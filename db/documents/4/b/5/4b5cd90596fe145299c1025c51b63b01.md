**Vascular Ring**

Any of the subtypes of vascular rings may cause compression of the tracheobronchial tree and/or esophagus leading to respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Complete vascular rings completely encircle both structures while incomplete vascular rings do not. In retrospective reviews and case series, DAA along with the right aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery accounts for up to 90% of reported cases of vascular rings causing significant symptoms.

**AorticÂ Aneurysm**

Aortic aneurysm (AA) describes an increased diameter in the ascending aorta to greater than 5.0 cm or descending aorta to greater than 4.0 cm (increase in diameter >50% from baseline).

**Aortic Coarctation**

Aortic coarctation (AC) occurs when there is a narrowing of the lumen at the distal arch or descending aorta. AC accounts for 4 to 6% of all congenital heart defects with a reported prevalence of approximately 4 per 10,000 live births.

**Aortic Dissection**

Aortic dissection (AD) occurs when blood enters the medial layer of the aortic wall through a tear in the intimal layer forming a second blood-filled pathway called a false lumen. The majority of intimal tears originate in the ascending aorta. The dissection can propagate proximally or distally to affect structures such as the aortic valve, cerebral arteries, coronary arteries, renal arteries, or pericardial space resulting in ischemic manifestations such as aortic regurgitation, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and cardiac tamponade. The incidence of AD is estimated at 2.6 to 3.5 per 100,000.

**Aortitis**

Aortitis describes inflammation of the aorta and encompasses a wide range of conditions. The most common causes of aortitis are large vessel vasculitides, including giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis (TA). Other causes include anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, seronegative spondyloarthropathies, sarcoidosis, and infectious aortitis.

**Atherosclerosis**

Atherosclerosis is a pathological process involving the deposition of fatty and fibrous plaques on the inner walls of the systemic circulatory vessels. The process can begin as early as childhood with the development of fatty streaks. In the United States, 1 in 6 teenagers was found to have abnormal intimal thickening on ultrasound.

**Trauma (Traumatic Aortic Rupture)**

Traumatic aortic rupture (TAR) most commonly occurs at a site immediately distal to the left subclavian artery known as the aortic isthmus. This part of the aorta is tethered by the ligamentum arteriosum making it prone to injury during sudden deceleration, such as during an automobile collision.
