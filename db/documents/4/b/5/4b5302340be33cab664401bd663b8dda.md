Transfusion hemolytic reactions are either preventable (human or mechanical error) or unavoidable, for example, immune incompatibility. As described before, hemolytic transfusion reactions have various classifications, and those classifications reflect their etiologies. They can be immune or non-immune mediated. Immune reactions are further divided into acute and delayed reactions. Hemolysis is also classified into intravascular and extravascular hemolysis.
