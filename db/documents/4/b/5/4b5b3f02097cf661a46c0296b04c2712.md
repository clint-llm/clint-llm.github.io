Axillary nerve damage can have an impact on the long head of the triceps brachii (LTB). Therefore, people with axillary nerve damage should undergo an assessment for the function of the LTB. If they demonstrate lost function, this shows a poor prognosis, and early repair at three months is recommended.

The triceps muscle can undergo reinnervation through a distal nerve transfer. Commonly used nerves for reinnervation include the flexor carpi ulnaris fascicle of the ulnar nerve and the posterior branch of the axillary nerve. Both of these nerves have been shown to recover the function of the triceps muscle

Additionally, various heads of the triceps can be used as flap coverage in traumatic injury. The medial and lateral heads are commonly harvested as flaps. These procedures are indicated during nerve injuries, shoulder or elbow defects, or muscular reanimation.
