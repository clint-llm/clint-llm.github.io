Patients undergoing cardiac interventions in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should undergo informed consent before invasive procedures, including those undergoing alcohol septal ablation. Informed consent should include discussion regarding evidence of long-term survival after alcohol septal ablation, the need for dependency on a cardiac pacemaker, success rate based on coronary anatomy, and potential complications related to cardiac catheterization that include:

- Coronary dissection

- CVA

- Access site bleeding/bruising

- Contrast related kidney injury
