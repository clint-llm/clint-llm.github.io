The overall mortality for Campylobacter infection is 24 per 10,000 culture-confirmed cases. In healthy patients, Campylobacter infections have a self-limited course with excellent clinical outcomes. These patients require supportive care such as electrolyte repletion, oral and parenteral rehydration. Antibiotics should be considered in immunocompromised patients and those with fever, bloody diarrhea, numerous stools or worsening symptoms. Approximately 10.8% of patients require hospitalization, making it the third most common cause of hospitalization for gastroenteritis. Immunocompromised and elderly patients have the highest risks of prolonged and fatal illness. Most patients experience a resolution of illness without complications.

Fewer than 1% of patients experience transient bacteremia, which occurs during the acute infection. Bacteremia is associated with mortality between 2.5 to 12.5%.Campylobacter and a more virulent course. These patients may require multiple doses of antibiotic therapy. They are more likely to experience extraintestinal symptoms and have higher mortality.
