The diagnosis of collagen vascular disease-associated interstitial lung disease and its distinction from infectious disease, hypersensitivity or drug-associated pneumonitis, and malignancy is often difficult, requiring collaboration among a team of healthcare professionals. Treatment and management are improved using an interprofessional approach with clinical, radiological, and pathological models for decision-making. A comprehensive management approach also takes into consideration comorbid conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension, as well as adjunctive therapeutic modalities such as oxygen use, exercise, and cardiopulmonary rehabilitation.
