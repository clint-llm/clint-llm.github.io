Patients with type 1 narcolepsy should be made aware of the increased risk of sleep-related driving accidents. Alcohol and recreational drugs should be avoided as they may exacerbate symptoms in these patients. Patients and parents should also be educated on the importance of a healthy diet and daily exercise. Patients should be advised to wear a life jacket when participating in water-related activities and to only engage in these actions with a partner that is aware of their diagnosis.
