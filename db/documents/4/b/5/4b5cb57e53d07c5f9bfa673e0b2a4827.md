Even though the disease has a favorable prognosis with early detection and treatment,Â  asthma often remains refractory and impacts the quality of life. The persistence of severe asthma symptoms often necessitates a much longer course of systemic corticosteroids than is necessary for other small vessel vasculitides. As reported by Solans et al., there is, therefore, an expected high prevalence of corticosteroid-induced side effects, including diabetes mellitus, myopathy, osteoporosis, and vertebral fractures, osteonecrosis of the femoral head, etc.

Moreover, almost all patients with EGPA develop long-lasting steroid-refractory neuralgia and myopathy, as well.
