The use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies has been incorporated in the COVID-19 treatment guidelines by the National Institute of Health. Currently, it is the only treatment available for patients who present early in their disease and are at high risk of progression to severe illness.

**National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for the Use of Monoclonal Antibodies in the Outpatient Setting/Emergency Departments:**

- Use anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies for mild to moderate COVID-19 disease in high-risk patients.

- Patients who qualify for treatment shouldÂ receive a referral to centers experienced in using these medications; this can include emergency departments and dedicated outpatient infusion centers.

- Referring providers should complete the form supplied by the U.S Department of Health and Human Services; this includes the patient's name, covid test date, date of symptoms onset, and a checklist of symptoms.

- If there are logistical constraints, prioritize patients as follows:

- Prioritize the treatment of COVID-19 over PEP of SARS-CoV-2 infection
- Prioritize unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated individuals over those who are completely vaccinated
- Prioritize vaccinated individuals who are not expected to mount an adequate immune response (e.g., immunocompromised individuals) over-vaccinated individuals expected to mount a full response to vaccination
- When there are no logistical constraints for administering therapy, do not limit the provision of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies.

- After a positive result, treatment with monoclonal antibodies should be started as soon as possible and should be within ten days of symptom onset.
