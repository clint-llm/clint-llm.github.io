The following histological features may appear on the examination of granulomas.

**Macrophage Morphology**

Macrophages may undergo various changes within the granuloma, resulting in a range of histological appearances. Activated macrophages may undergo transformation resulting in an ‘epithelioid’ appearance, with flattened cell shape, ovoid nuclei, and membranes that interdigitate with adjacent cells.

**Necrosis**

Necrosis develops in a subset of granulomas as they mature. Granulomas of specific etiologies are more likely to undergo necrosis than others, though the reasons behind this are not well-understood.

**Fibrosis**

Fibrosis is a prominent feature of many granulomas, which is unsurprising given the chronic nature of the lesions. Fibrosis may be adaptive, for example, as a method of sequestering parasitic eggs but is more often pathological. Fibrosis can lead to widespread loss of tissue function and may lead, for example, to liver failure in schistosomiasis or reduced lung function in tuberculosis.
