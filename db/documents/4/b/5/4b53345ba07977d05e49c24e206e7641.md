Taste disturbances, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and headache may occur in patients taking terbinafine. Despite these untoward effects, the continuation of the medication is often dependent on the severity of symptoms and the patient's discomfort threshold. Discontinuation may be appropriate to resolve most symptoms. Although multiple symptoms may present in patients taking therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of terbinafine, the most concerning and consistent severe adverse effects occur in the liver.

Hepatotoxicity may be asymptomatic and only detectable by lab evaluation and evidence ofÂ transaminitis. Liver enzymes over two times the normal value requires immediate discontinuation. Supportive care, including liver transplantation (in severe cases), may be necessary.
