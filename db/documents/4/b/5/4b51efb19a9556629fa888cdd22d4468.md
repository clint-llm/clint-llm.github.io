Diving in open waters is popular. It is enjoyed by novices and professionals alike. Many people dive for recreation, competitive sport, commercial employment, and military training. Diving as a profession can be dated back to more than 5000 years, yet diving-related diseases were not described until Paul Bert wrote about caisson disease in 1878. Symptoms of caisson disease were observed among bridge workers after finishing their shifts underwater and coming back to the surface. These symptoms included dizzy spells, difficulty breathing, and sharp pain in the abdomen or joints. The caisson workers oftenÂ said that they felt well while working. This was due to their being rested at the start of the shift compared to being exhausted when the workday was through. The workers would often have intense back pain that left them bent over, which is how caisson disease earned the nickname "the bends."

Pulmonary barotrauma is a potential diving injury. Pulmonary barotrauma can occur during self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) diving or free diving. It can happen during descent (negative pulmonary barotrauma or lung squeeze) or during ascent (positive pulmonary barotrauma is also known as pulmonary overinflation syndrome (POIS).
