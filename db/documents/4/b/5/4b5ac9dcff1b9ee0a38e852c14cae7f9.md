The costocervical trunk is a branch of the subclavian artery which supplies the upper extremities and contributes partly to the blood supply of the head and neck. The subclavian artery has a different origin on each side. On the right side, it originates from the brachiocephalic trunkÂ while stemming directly from the arch of the aorta on the left side.
