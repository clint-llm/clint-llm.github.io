The stroke volume (SV) has several clinical significances in hemodynamics, most notably in Point-Of-Care US (POCUS) to assess fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients who are inactive shock and to determine the etiology of the shock, intraoperative cardiac output monitoring, or as cardiac output (CO) calculation method per CO= Heart Rate (HR) x SV.

The RUSH (rapid ultrasound in shock) exam is an imaging technique that evaluates three components involved in producing mean arterial pressure (MAP).

Visually, the diastolic and systolic difference in the chamber size will be noticeable, hence, allowing to categorize the patientâ€™s LV contractility as normal, decrease (mild-moderate or severe), and hyperdynamic.

- FS= [(EDD-ESD)/EDD] x 100

- EDD= end diastolic diameter; ESD= end systolic diameter

A normal FS has values of 30% to 45%, which is semi-quantitative for normal ejection fraction (EF) and the overall LV contractility.

Moreover, there are four types of shock hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive, and distributive, where echocardiographic findings are unique to each. In hypovolemic shock, the heart is hypercontractile and reduced in size. In cardiogenic shock, the heart is hypo-contractile and dilated in size.
