Post-operatively, patients commonly stay 1 or 2 nights in the hospital. A brief period of flat bed rest, typically overnight, during the initial postoperative day can be considered to reduce stress on the dural closure. Ambulatory postoperative referrals to occupational and/or physical therapies may benefit bowel/bladder dysfunction and limb contractures.
