The differential diagnosis for gastric outlet obstruction depends on the age of the patient.

For adolescent patients presenting with suspected GOO, the differential should include congenital sources of obstruction like diaphragms, webs, or luminal obstruction with mucosal valves or heterotrophic pancreas.

Other differentials should include:

- Neoplasm

- Chemical injury

- Chronic granulomatous disease

- Hiatal hernia

- Brunner gland adenoma

- Congenital duodenal webs

- Pancreatic pseudocysts

- Gallstone obstruction

- Strongyloides hyperinfection
