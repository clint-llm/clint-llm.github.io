Acquired aural atresia is typically identified in the setting of progressive, conductive hearing loss in conjunction with a visible narrowing of the EAC. A thorough physical exam is required to evaluate for local causes of inflammation that may be contributing to canal stenosis or fibrosis. A history of recent trauma, recurrent outer ear infections, or otologic surgery often suggestsÂ the diagnosis and underlying etiology. In the absence of any of these external factors, idiopathic constriction of the EAC should be investigated as a potential rheumatologic/autoimmune condition.

Clinical suspicion for congenital aural atresia may begin during the first few days of life in a newborn. Initial evaluation requires a thorough examination of the external ear as well as other craniofacial features such as the mandible, oral cavity, spine, eyes, and facial nerve function.
