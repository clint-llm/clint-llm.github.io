Screening and early detection of cancers is the best form of treatment. Below are the recommendations for the screening of the specific malignancy.

- Breast cancer: Women 50 to 69 years: annual screening mammography with or without clinical breast examination is the current recommendation. At age 40 to 49 years: the benefit of screening is less certain and the ultimate decision is up to the clinician and patient. In females above 70 years of age: annual screening is appropriate as long as estimated life expectancy is about 8 years.

- Liver cancer: Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and cirrhosis, serum AFP and liver ultrasound should be performed every 6 to 12 months.

- PTLD: Complete history and physical examination should take place every three months, particularly in the first posttransplant year.

- Anogenital: Early physical examination of the anogenital area, including a pelvic examination and cytologic studies for women. There is insufficient evidence to recommend either for or against screening anoscopy and biopsies of the anal epithelium.

- Cervical: All women aged above 18 years and sexually active girls <18 years old should undergo an annual pelvic examination and Pap smear.

- Skin cancers: Examination of skin, conjunctivae, and oropharyngeal mucosa annually; patients at higher risk (ethnicity, geographic area of residence or serologic positivity for HHV) may benefit from more frequent screening.

Careful screening of the patient and donor before transplantation to help detect an underlying pre-existing malignancy is one of the effective ways to avoid dealing with this enigmatic problem later on. We have tried to summarize the broad topic of management and cancer in solid organ recipients into general recommendations;

**Reduction of immunosuppression:**Reduction or cessation of immunosuppressive therapy is useful primarily in patients who had a renal transplant since the loss of the graft to rejection is not a fatal event in these patients. Such measures may cause tumor regression sometimes such as  PTLD, some skin cancers, Kaposi sarcoma (KS).

**Anogenital cancers:**In situ anogenital cancers can be treated with laser therapy, electrocautery, or topical fluorouracil. Invasive tumors require wide local excision (e.g., APR), with inguinal lymphadenectomy.

**Visceral malignancy**: Visceral malignancies are to receive treatment by standard surgical, radiotherapeutic, or chemotherapeutic modalities.

**Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)**: Management of PTLD deserves special mention as the treatment has undergone major changes over time. The main options for initial treatment are the reduction of immunosuppression, immunotherapy with the CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab), chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these. The PTLD classifies into four types and treatment varies according to the type.

- Early lesions:****Reduction of immunosuppression alone suffices.

- Polymorphic PTLD: They express CD20, so besides the reduction in immunosuppression rituximab is advised. Surgery is reserved for patients with minimal localized residual disease.

- Monomorphic PTLD: For CD20+ PTLD, reduction in immunosuppression with rituximab and combination of systemic chemotherapy such as CHOP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone) is the therapeutic recommendation. If the tumor is CD20 negative, then systemic chemotherapy is administered along with the reduction in immunosuppression. Surgery is only for patients with complications such as perforation or obstruction of the hollow viscus such as the bowel.

- Classic Hodgkin lymphoma-like PTLD–Classic Hodgkin lymphoma-like PTLD is the least common form. Data regarding its management is lacking. Treatment is according to the protocols used for classic Hodgkin lymphoma.
