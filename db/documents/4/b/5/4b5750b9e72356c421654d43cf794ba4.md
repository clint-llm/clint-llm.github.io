The following block supplies are necessary for intercostal nerve blocks:

- US machine with a high-frequency linear transducer (8 to 13 MHz)

- Sonographic sterile cover

- Marking pen for marking landmarks and injection points

- Sterile gloves with or without gown and gel

- Clear drapes

- Antimicrobial skin cleanser (2% chlorhexidine gluconate )

- Peripheral nerve block 20 to 22 gauge, 4 to 5 cm, 1 and a half-inch needle

- Local anesthetic (lidocaine 1%)

- Needles for subcutaneous local anesthetic infiltration

- 2x2 in. gauzes

- 3 mL syringe / 12 mL syringe / 20 mL syringe

- Standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors applied: ECG 3 leads, HR, BP, Pulse oximetry and nasal cannula with EtCO2 detector if possible

- Resuscitation equipment and ACLS medications (oxygen supply and masks, laryngoscopes, bag-mask, suction, defibrillator, epinephrine, phenylephrine, atropine, etc.)

- Lipid Emulsion 20% available (intravenous lipid emulsion is an accepted treatment for severe local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). Epinephrine and benzodiazepines are also helpful during this severe adverse event. We need to be careful using calcium channel blockers because they can trigger cardiac impairment and worsen the situation).
