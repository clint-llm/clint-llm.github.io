Gray baby syndrome is a preventable problem. With the number of antibiotics available today, there should be no valid reason to use this agent for the management of infection in babies. All healthcare workers should be aware of the serious complications of this antibiotic and the onus is on them not to start treatment unless there is no other choice. The pharmacist should fully question the prescription of this antibiotic for neonates and infants and should recommend other agents. Data suggest that when the drug is discontinued immediately after initiation of therapy, then the outcomes are good. But once the syndrome has developed, the prognosis is guarded. Deaths were once commonly reported in neonates when started on chloramphenicol.
