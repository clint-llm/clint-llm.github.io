Coronary artery vasospasm (CAVS) is a constriction of the coronary arteries that can cause complete or near-complete occlusion of the vessel. In 1959, Dr. Myron Prinzmetal described a different entity of angina than the classic Heberden angina which was originally described in 1772. This vasospastic disease can cause acute ischemia and present anywhere along the spectrum of angina from stable angina to acute coronary syndrome. CAVS appears to be a heterogeneous disease but does not follow the traditional risk factors in the development of coronary artery disease. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of coronary artery vasospasm and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of coronary artery vasospasm.
- Review the presentation of coronary artery vasospasm.
- Summarize the treatment of coronary artery vasospasm.
- Outline the clinical evaluation of coronary artery vasospasm and explain the role of the interprofessional team in coordinating the care of patients with this condition.
