There are no specific histochemical markers for detecting Howell-Jolly bodies. However, there have been recent advances in the detection and quantification of erythrocyte chromosomal fragments with flow cytometry. Sample preparation is with an RNase/antibody solution and anti-CD71 fluorescein isothiocyanate to detect young reticulocytes. This process is not common in medical practice.
