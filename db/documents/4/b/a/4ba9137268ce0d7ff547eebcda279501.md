The symptoms of endogenous endophthalmitis vary from pain, redness, irritation, swelling photophobia, defective vision, floaters, and flashes. The clinical signs range from periorbital edema, scleral inflammation, chemosis, conjunctival congestion, corneal infiltrate, endothelial exudates, corneal edema, anterior chamber reaction, hypopyon, fibrinous membrane, iris exudates, iris nodules,  sluggish or fixed pupil, relative afferent pupillary defect, posterior synechiae, cataract, absent red reflex, vitreous haze, anterior vitreous cells, vitreous floaters, membranes and exudates.

The most important diagnostic feature of EE is vitreous involvement. Aspergillus flavus is known to cause yellow/ white exudates in the vitreous, which vary from focal to diffuse. The hallmark feature of Candida EE is the presence of fluffy cotton wool-like white retinal exudates or colonies along with vitritis.

EE can be broadly classified into three categories based on ocular signs and symptoms, as detailed below.
