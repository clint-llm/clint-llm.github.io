**General Physiological Changes**

There is generalized physical fatigue immediately after delivery. The pulse rate may be elevated a few hours after childbirth due to excitement or pain and usually normalizes on the second day. The blood pressure could be elevated due to pain or excitement but is generally in the normal range.

The temperature is slightly elevated up to 37.2C (99F) along with increased shivering, sweating, or diaphoresis in the first 24 hours and normalizes within 12 hours.

**Reproductive**

Involution, a part of postpartum physiology, is the term given to the process of reproductive organs returning to their prepregnant state. Immediately following the delivery, the uterus, and the placental site contracts rapidly to prevent further blood loss. This rapid uterine contraction can lead to abdominal pain or cramps after childbirth. At this point, the uterus has an increased tone, feels firm, and weighs 1000 gms, and at the end of the first week, it weighs 500 gms, and by six weeks, it weighs approximately 50 gms. The female may complain. Initially, the contraction of the uterus is due to a substantial reduction in myometrial cell size; it constricts the blood vessels and limits the bleeding. The subsequent decrease in size is due to autolysis and infarction of uterine blood vessels.

The lochia is the vaginal discharge that originates from the uterus, cervix, and vagina. The lochia is initially red and comprised of blood and fragments of decidua, endometrial tissues, and mucus and lasts 1 to 4 days. The lochia then changes color to yellowish or pale brown, lasting 5 to 9 days, and is comprised mainly of blood, mucus, and leucocytes. Finally, the lochia is white and contains mostly mucus, lasting up to 10 to 14 days. The lochia can persist up to 5 weeks postpartum. The persistence of red lochia beyond one week might be an indicator of uterine subinvolution. The presence of an offensive odor or large pieces of tissue or blood clots in lochia or the absence of lochia might be a sign of infection.

Once the ovarian function resumes, rugae start to appear in the vagina, usually by the third week in females that are not breastfeeding. Similarly, the postpartum vaginal epithelium, which appears atrophic under the microscopic exam, is restored in 6 to 10 weeks, but the recovery delays in breastfeeding females due to low estrogen levels. The patient may develop perineal edema, lacerations, tears, or undergo an episiotomy in the immediate postpartum period that may lead to discomfort and pain.

**Lactation**

The secretion from the breasts called colostrum increases after childbirth. Colostrum is rich in protein, vitamins and immunoglobulins, and other humoral factors (lactoferrin) and provides an immunological defense to the newborn.

**Endocrine**

The onset of the first menstrual period following delivery is variable and depends if the mother is lactating or not. If the mother is not breastfeeding, then the menstrual function returns by the sixth to eighth week postpartum in most of the cases. The duration of anovulation depends on the frequency and intensity of breastfeeding and is attributed to high serum prolactin levels associated with suckling.********

**Renal**

The bladder wall may become edematous, hyperemic, and the bladder might be overdistended without the urge to pass urine.

**Fluids**

There is a shift of fluid from extravascular to intravascular space, corresponding to 6 to 8 liters of total body water. Furthermore, the persistent activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) during pregnancy leads to an excess of 950 mEq of sodium.

**Hematologic**

The hematocrit may initially drop due to blood loss associated with delivery but starts to rise again plasma volume decreases due to diuresis and hemoconcentration.

**Cardiovascular**

There are significant structural and hemodynamic alterations in the peripartum period. Cardiac output increases throughout pregnancy. However, in the immediate postpartum period, following delivery, there is an increase in circulating blood volume from the contraction of the uterus and an increase in preload from the relief of inferior vena cava obstruction, leading to an increase in stroke volume and heart rate leading to a 60 to 80% rise in cardiac output, which rapidly declines to pre-labor values in 1 to 2 hours following delivery and to pre-pregnancy values in two weeks postpartum.

**Gastrointestinal**

The mother may develop flatulence or constipation due to intestinal ileus (induced by pain or presence of placental hormone relaxin in the circulation), loss of body fluids, laxity of abdominal wall, and hemorrhoids.

**Integumentary**

Hyperpigmentation is the most commonly reported skin change during pregnancy, affecting 85% to 90% of females.
