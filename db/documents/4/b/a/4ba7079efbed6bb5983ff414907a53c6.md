The clinical significance of endomyocardial biopsy depends on two factors which are, role in diagnosis and implication for treatment. EMB is relevant and applicable in selected clinical cases. EMB is essential to diagnose the diverse disease processes underlying cardiomyopathy presenting as heart failure. But sometimes, the therapeutic consequence of EMB is limited.

In certain cases, the use of additional methodologies besides light microscopy and staining such as electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry, and molecular analysis is recommended. For example, in hemochromatosis and some other storage diseases, there is diffuse involvement of the heart, and simple light microscopy of EMB specimens may not be diagnostic. When the index of suspicion of these diseases is high as suggested by symptoms and results of other diagnostic testing, special staining techniques (to detect iron and other substances infiltrating the heart) and molecular analysis may help diagnose the underlying disease.

The role of EMB to diagnose pathologic entities is changing over the years. The Dallas criteria have been discussed controversially since many patients that do not fulfill the Dallas criteria have been finally diagnosed to have myocarditis.
