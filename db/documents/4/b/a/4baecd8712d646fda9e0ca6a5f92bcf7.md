Although there is no cure for Buerger disease, the cornerstone of management is smoking cessation. Even smoking 1 or 2 cigarettes per day can perpetuate the disease. Even the use of nicotine replacement therapy can keep the disease active.

Symptomatic management with calcium channel blockers or other vasodilators can be implemented, especially if there is a concurrent Raynaud phenomenon. Prostaglandin analogs such as intravenous iloprost can be used to treat pain and ischemic complications. Intramuscular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been used experimentally but the results of various studies are still inconclusive. Lumbar and/or cervical sympathectomy or spinal cord stimulators have been sporadically utilized.

Intravenous (IV) iloprost appears to be helpful in relieving symptoms, improving distal-extremity trophic changes, and decreasing the amputation rate in patients suffering from Buerger disease.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and narcotic analgesia can be prescribed to palliate pain secondary to ischemia, and appropriate antibiotics can be given to manage mild distal extremity ulcers.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a widely accepted adjunctive treatment option that provides significant improvement in patients having diabetic wounds, refractory osteomyelitis, limb ischemia, or necrotizing infection of the soft tissues. Its use in Buerger disease without revascularization options still remains experimental as the available data are excessively limited.

Because of the diffuse segmental involvement of Buerger disease and its propensity to affect small and medium-sized arteries, surgical revascularization is usually not advisable. The ultimate surgical treatment for the refractory disease in patients who do not quit smoking is distal limb amputation for non-resolving ulcers, gangrene, or persistent pain. Whenever possible, amputation should be avoided.
