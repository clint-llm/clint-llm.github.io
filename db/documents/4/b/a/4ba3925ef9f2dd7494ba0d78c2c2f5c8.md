**Antenatal Presentation**

Most cases are diagnosed on antenatal ultrasound.

**Postnatal Presentation**

Neonates with undiagnosed posterior urethral valves can present in a variety of ways. These could be an apparent urinary tract pathology such as delayed voiding, weak stream, urosepsis, or a palpable bladder. However, the presentation may also be more indolent with lethargy, poor feeding, or failure to thrive. In severe cases, they may present with respiratory distress due to pulmonary hypoplasia.

**Physical Examination**

Many of the clinical signs in neonates with posterior urethral valves are common to other conditions associated with oligohydramnios caused by compression of the fetus with the uterus. These include indentation of the knees and elbows, skin dimpling, and Potter facies. Other more specific signs include a palpable bladder.
