Myotonia in MC is the result of a defective voltage-gated skeletal muscle chloride channel (CIC-1) secondary to mutations within the CLCN1 gene.

CIC-1 channels also counteract the depolarizing effect of excessive accumulation of potassium ions during the firing of multiple action potentials (APs) within the extracellular space of skeletal muscle. In healthy individuals, the high potassium ion concentration is negated by the concordance of CIC-1 channels. When this effect is lost, as in MC, the membrane becomes much more sensitive to even small fluctuations in local potassium concentration. These small variations may trigger spontaneous APs, further potentiating the myotonic symptoms. This effect explains why blockade of these voltage-gated sodium channels is a major therapeutic target in MC.
