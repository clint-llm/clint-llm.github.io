**Oral Stage**

The oral stage is often split into two steps:

1.) Oral preparatory

For liquids, the bolus is first sealed in the oral cavity by the tongue anteriorly, and hard palate posteriorly, in the preparatory phase. For solids, the bolus is not sealed in the oral cavity as it undergoes processing via mastication and manipulation.

2.) Oral Propulsion

The tongue elevates to move the bolus posteriorly into the oropharynx. This bolus is held in the oropharynx until it aggregates with repeated cycles, or the pharyngeal phase initiates.

**Pharyngeal Phase**

The processes mentioned above are mostly under voluntary muscle control. The pharyngeal phase, the first irreversible step in the swallowing mechanism, begins when the bolus reaches the palatoglossal arch. Afferent sensory fibers from CN IX, X, and XI in the oropharynx transmit the stimulus to the solitary tract nucleus in the brainstem.

1.) Nasopharynx closure

The pharyngeal phase beings with soft palate elevation via the tensor palatini and levator palatini to seal the nasopharynx to prevent pressure escape into the nasal cavity.

2.) Airway protection

The pharyngeal phase serves to protect the airway via swallowing apnea, a well-coordinated physiologic response where respiration ceases during swallowing.

3.) Elevation of the hyoid-laryngeal complex

The pharynx becomes elevated and pulled anteriorly by contraction of the suprahyoid muscles, which helps to open the pharyngeal-esophageal transition.

4.) Bolus transport

The bolus is moved inferiorly by a peristaltic-like sequential contraction of the superior, middle, and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscles in a top to bottom fashion.

5.) Transit through UES

The end of the pharyngeal phase involves the food bolus descending through a patent UES into the esophagus. The sphincter remains in tonic contraction at rest to prevent air from entering the esophagus but is opened by three sequential mechanisms: 1) contraction of the thyrohyoid to move the larynx and hyoid superiorly and anteriorly, thereby initiating the opening of the sphincter, 2) manometric relaxation of the cricopharyngeus, and 3) Pressure-dependent distension of the UES by the bolus.

**Esophageal Phase**

The bolus is propagated inferiorly by a wave of peristalsis once it reaches the esophagus. This is an autonomous process not under voluntary control, much like the pharyngeal phase. It occurs much slower than the pharyngeal phase, at a rate of about 3 to 4 cm/s.
