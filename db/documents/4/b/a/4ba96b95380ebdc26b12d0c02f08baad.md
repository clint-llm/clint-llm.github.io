Three primary nerves supply the majority of muscles in the forearm. The radial nerve and its branches supply the mobile wad of Henry and the dorsal compartment. The ulnar nerve and median nerve, and their respective branches supply the volar compartment. The radial nerve provides innervation to the anconeus, brachioradialis, and extensor carpi radialis longus.

The cutaneous nerves provide the dermatome pattern of the forearm. The lateral aspect is covered by the C5 and C6 nerve roots while the medial side is covered by the C8 and T1 nerve roots. Cutaneous nerves of the forearm include the posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm, lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm, and medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm.
