CMTC is characterized by dark purple to red, reticulated vascular pattern intermixed with telangiectasia and occasionally prominent veins.

Areas of skin that are enclosed by the reticulated pattern may be normal, erythematous, atrophic, and or even ulcerated.

Other associated extracutaneous findings include (1) skeletal anomalies such as syndactyly, tendinitis stenosis, cleft palate; (2) Glaucoma; (3) other vascular anomalies like port-wine stains, angiokeratomas, and hemangiomas; (4) neurological anomalies such as macrocephaly presenting as Macrocephaly-cutis marmorata telangiectasia congenital, a syndrome that also includes neonatal hypotonia, developmental delay, overgrowth, and connective-tissue defects.
