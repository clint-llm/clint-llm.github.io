Branch retinal vein occlusion is often asymptomatic. However, it may present with sudden-onset of painless vision loss or visual field defect correlating to the area of perfusion of the obstructed vessels. It is important to document a history of systemic hypertension, smoking, glaucoma, diabetes, or other systemic diseases and risk factors. Evaluation of patients for hypercoagulability may be beneficial. If the occlusion does not occur at an arteriovenous crossing, the possibility of underlying retinochoroiditis or retinal vasculitis should be ruled out. In patients with suspected BRVO, the blood pressureÂ should be obtained and documented. The patient should also undergo a complete physical examination and systemic vascular workup including carotid doppler and transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out cardiovascular causes of vision loss.
