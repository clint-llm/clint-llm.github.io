There are an estimated 358 million patients in the world affected by asthma. Asthma symptoms of dyspnea are secondary to bronchoconstriction and smooth muscle constriction. The increased parasympathetic activity can account for this constriction, including overstimulation of muscarinic receptors by increased release of acetylcholine.

Overactive bladder is a syndrome where the detrusor muscle is overactive, causing symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and, in some cases, bladder incontinence. There are greater numbers of M2 receptors in the detrusor muscle; however, the smaller population of M3 receptors is most associated with the contraction of the bladder.

Myopia is more commonly known as nearsightedness, a pervasive disorder with one-third of the United States population affected. Multiple studies have shown that muscarinic receptors, especially the M3 subtype, are involved in developing myopia. Scientists believe that muscarinic receptors are involved in axial elongation, which is present in cases of myopia.
