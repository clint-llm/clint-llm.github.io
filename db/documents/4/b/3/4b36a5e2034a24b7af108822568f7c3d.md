Treadmill stress testing is indicated for the diagnosis and prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). This is the initial investigation of choice in patients with a normal or near-normal resting ECG capable of performing adequate exercise.

- Symptoms suggesting myocardial ischemia

- Acute chest pain in patients excluded for acute coronary syndrome (ACS)

- Recent ACS treated without coronary angiography or incomplete revascularization

- Known CAD with worsening symptoms

- Prior coronary revascularization (5 years or longer after coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG] or two years or less after percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI])

- Valvular heart disease (to assess exercise capacity and need for surgical intervention)

- Certain cardiac arrhythmias to assess chronotropic competence

- Newly diagnosed heart failure or cardiomyopathy
