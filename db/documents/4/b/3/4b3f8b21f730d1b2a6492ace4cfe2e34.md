As discussed previously, the education of patients and the public is a vital part of the management and prevention of social anxiety disorder. Recognition of SAD is poor and requires more effort from healthcare professionals to recognize it, as individuals with the disorder are unlikely to self-report it due to their symptoms. SAD is the third most common mental illness affecting a significant proportion of the general population in their lifetimes. An important role of a primary care physician is to recognize the illness and either treat the disorder themselves or refer to a mental health specialist who has experience with the condition.
