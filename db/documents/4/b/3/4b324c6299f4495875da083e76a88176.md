The condition most commonly affects women aged 20-44 years with an annual incidence of 19.3/100,000 in those who weigh 20% or more than their ideal body weight. The annual incidence in all women aged 15 to 44 years is 3.5 per 100,000. The annual incidence of PTC in the general populace is 0.9 per 100,000.

Children of both genders are affected equally before puberty (defined as an age of under 12 years old). Obesity less commonly correlates with the pre-pubertal patient.
