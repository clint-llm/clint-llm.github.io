Complications also are relatively few. Rupture of membranes does eliminate the primary barrier between the fetus and the polymicrobial environment of the vagina. If performed too early in the labor process, there can be an increased risk of intrapartum chorioamnionitis. The most common complication of artificial rupture of membranes is prolapse of the umbilical cord. This invariably occurs after rupture if artificial rupture of membranes is performed when the head is not engaged in the maternal pelvis. In the case of an unengaged fetal head, rupture of membranes may allow for the umbilical cord to precede the fetal head when the release of amniotic fluid occurs. This will allow the fetal head to compress the section of the umbilical cord preceding the head, generally leading to fetal bradycardia and necessitating emergency cesarean section. This complication should be an easily avoidable, iatrogenic cause of emergency delivery.
