If left untreated, abdominal compartment syndrome is fatal. Even delayed treatment is associated with very high mortality rates. Predictors of mortality include a history of diabetes and transfusion of a high volume of blood products. Many series reports that even with treatment, multiorgan failure can delay recovery for weeks or months. Prolonged need for mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and more extended hospital stays are common in these patients.
