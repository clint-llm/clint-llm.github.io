- Patients in whom even mild intoxication is suspected should be observed in a monitored setting for at least 12 hours with immediate-release formulation ingestion to 24 hours for sustained release formulations.

- Evaluating and differentiating between negative inotropy and low systemic vascular resistance is helpful in the selection of appropriate vasoactive agents. (inotropes vs. vasopressors like norepinephrine)

- Urgent and time-sensitive use of gastrointestinal decontamination (if brought in early), intravenous crystalloids, calcium, vasopressors, and HIET therapy is warranted, often in conjunctionÂ with each other.

- It is easy to focus on the distractions of the specific therapeutic modalities and their administration, but the initial focus should be on the basics of resuscitation in an emergency - that of securing circulation, airway, and breathing first.

- Because of their affinity to plasma proteins, high hepatic first pass, and a large volume of distribution, hemodialysis or hemofiltration are not effective.

- In refractory cases of cardiogenic shock, consider an incremental increase in the dose of HIET along with advanced hemodynamic interventions like transvenous pacing and VA - ECMO.
