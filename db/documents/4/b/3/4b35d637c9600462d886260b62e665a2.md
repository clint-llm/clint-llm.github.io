A myriad of the factors can cause autonomic dysfunction, and more than one can concur even in the same patient. Due to the expansive nature of the autonomic nervous system, it can be affected by a wide range of conditions

**Inherited**

- Amyloidosis, Fabry disease, hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy, porphyrias

- Genetic disorders like familial dysautonomia and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase deficiency

**Acquired**

- Autoimmune: Guillain-Barre, Autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren, systemic lupus erythematosus

- Abnormal reflex responses in carotid sinus hypersensitivity, vasovagal syncope, and other neuro-meditated syncopes; and probably in postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS)

- Abnormal sweating responses, as in generalized or focal hyperhidrosis, are related to excessive activation.

- Metabolic/ Nutritional: Diabetes mellitus, vitamin B12 deficiency

- Degenerative neurologic diseases: Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy/Shy-Drager syndrome, pure autonomic failure presenting or suffering from orthostatic hypotension, fixed heart rate responses

- Infections: Botulism, Chagas disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), leprosy, Lyme disease, tetanus

- Neoplasia: Brain tumors, paraneoplastic syndromes

- Pharmacologic effects of several drugs that interfere with normal autonomic function and provoke symptoms include alpha- and beta-blocker-triggered orthostatic hypotension

- Toxin/drug-induced: Alcohol, amiodarone, chemotherapy

- Traumatic or tumoral spinal cord injuries at different levels and presenting with the so-called autonomic dysreflexia

- Uremic neuropathy/chronic liver diseases

**Medications That Exacerbate Orthostatic Hypotension**

- Diuretics: furosemide, torsemide, thiazide

- Nitric oxide-mediated vasodilators: nitroglycerine, hydralazine, sildenafil

- Adrenergic antagonists:

- 
              
- Alpha-1-adrenergic blockers: alfuzosin, terazosin
              
              
- Beta-adrenergic blockers: propranolol

- Alpha -2-adrenergic agonists: tizanidine, clonidine

- Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors: lisinopril, valsartan

- Dopamine antagonists:

- 
              
- Phenothiazines: chlorpromazine
              
              
- Atypical antipsychotics: olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine

- Calcium channel blockers: verapamil, diltiazem

- Selective serotonin receptor reuptake inhibitors: paroxetine

- Antidepressants: trazodone, amitriptyline
