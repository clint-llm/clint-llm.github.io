Anterior uveitis can present as an isolated entity or associated intermediate and posterior uveitis. There can be a spillover of anterior segment inflammation into the vitreous or posterior segment. All patients should undergo extensive evaluation to pinpoint the etiology. The internists have a key role to play in the diagnosis and management of uveitic cases. If untreated, complications can include decreased visual acuity and/or blindness, glaucoma, cataracts,Â and irregular pupil.
