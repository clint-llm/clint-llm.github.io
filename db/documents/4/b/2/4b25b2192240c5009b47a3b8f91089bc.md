Macroergonomics is the formal study of work systems.****As applied to healthcare, the human-task/tool interface represents the "microsystem." Individuals interacting as teams or organizations represent "mesosystems," while more complex sociotechnical interactions create the "macrosystem."  Regardless of which sub-system is under evaluation, the "systems approach" to HFE will always clearly map the interventions to the macrosystem.

Quality improvement initiatives frequently employ training as a means to reach error reduction. This approach is appropriately applicable when developing/testing new techniques, practicing new techniques in a safe/low-risk environment, gaining individual experience with sensorimotor dependent techniques, or improving team processes/interactions, while practicing or testing emergency responses. It is a common misconception, however, that HFE strives to eliminate human error.  The paradigms more accurately align with creating systems that are resilient to unanticipated events by utilizing a thoughtful design process. To this end, the modification of tools and techniques creates more sustainable improvements in safety than behavior modification through training alone.
