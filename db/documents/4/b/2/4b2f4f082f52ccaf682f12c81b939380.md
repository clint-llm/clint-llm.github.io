The Eustachian tube develops as a connection between the lateral extension of the first pharyngeal pouch endoderm and the first branchial cleft ectoderm. The expansion of the pouch forms the tubotympanic recess, which will eventually develop into the middle ear.

During normal growth and maturity into early adulthood, an individual's skull base extends caudally, causing the angle of the Eustachian tube to change from horizontal to oblique. This results in elongation and an increased angle of the Eustachian tube with respect to the horizontal plane. From childhood to adulthood, the eustachian tube volume increases from approximately 62 cubic mm to 111 cubic mm (+/- 22 cubic mm in both childhood and adulthood).
