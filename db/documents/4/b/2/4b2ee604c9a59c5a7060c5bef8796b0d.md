The mid-trimester ultrasound (also known as the second-trimester anatomy scan or the anomaly scan) is a routine examination in many countries that's aimed primarily to assess fetal anatomy and detect any fetal anomalies. A two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound with a curvilinear transabdominal probe is routinely used to evaluate the fetal number, viability, gestational age, anatomical survey, placental location, amniotic fluid, and maternal pelvic organs. A transvaginal probe, color Doppler and three-dimensional ultrasound are not routinely used but may be implemented in certain clinical scenarios, especially when placenta previa or fetal anomaly are suspected, or to provide accurate cervical length measurement. This activity outlines the indication, safety, the technique of second-trimester ultrasound and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in conducting and interpreting the study to improve the antenatal care provided.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the scanning protocol used in the anatomy scan systemically.

-  Summarize the indications, timing, and safety of the second-trimester ultrasound scan.
- Identify the basic requirement needed to conduct the scan.
- Explain how interprofessional team strategies can optimize patient outcomes when using ultrasound for pregnancy evaluation.
