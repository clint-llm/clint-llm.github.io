Nicotine addiction is a complex disorder with no easy cure. Millions of people throughout the globe would like to discontinue smoking but cannot. Many people try to quit smoking and are successful for a few weeks or months but relapse rates are very high. There is no one magical treatment to curing nicotine addiction but evidence suggests that an interprofessional approach that encourages changes in lifestyle may have better outcomes. The nurse is in the prime position to educate the patient at discharge. The pharmacist can educate outpatients on the adverse effects of smoking. The social worker should encourage the patient to change lifestyle, join a support group and keep away from people who smoke. The pharmacist may recommend nicotine substitutes but at the same time should encourage a healthy diet, starting a new hobby and participating in an exercise program.  Some individuals may benefit from cognitive behavior therapy. Finally physicians should continually enforce the importance of nicotine cessation and remind the patient that it adversely affects health.

**Outcomes**

Nicotine addiction affects millions of people all over the globe and has a very high morbidity and mortality. Besides causing cancers, increasing the risk of adverse cardiac events and stroke, it also results in premature birth, spontaneous abortions and peripheral vascular disease. The costs to healthcare from the adverse health affects as a result of nicotine are enormous. Stopping nicotine addiction is another industry that has evolved over the past decade with very poor success rates. Most nicotine addicts cease smoking more to good luck rather than any bona fide remedy. All healthcare workers should try and educate the patients on the harm of nicotine; until then the healthcare costs will continue to increase.
