Corneal surface assessment is useful in nearly all ophthalmic evaluations. Placido disc can be used in primary care to get a general understanding of the anterior surface of the cornea and allow a large number of low-risk patients to be screened. Those with more complex pathologies can be referred to an ophthalmologist, decreasing the cost and resource usage.

Corneal pachymetry is essential in determining candidacy for keratorefractive surgery and is employed by optometrists and ophthalmologists to screen for corneal ectasia risk. Careful screening cuts down on adverse events following operation and better patient outcomes.
