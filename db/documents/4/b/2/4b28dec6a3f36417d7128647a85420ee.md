The muscles in the leg are divided into four compartments, the anterior, lateral, posterior superficial, and posterior deep, by intermuscular septa.

The primary function of the FLM and FBM is eversion of the foot and ankle, while their secondary function is ankle plantarflexion. The fibularis muscles act as antagonists to foot and ankle inversion, which is why they may be injured in inversion ankle sprains.

The function of the superficial fibular nerve, anterior tibial artery, and fibular artery include providing a neurovascular supply to the lateral leg compartment.
