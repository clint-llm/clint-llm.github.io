Neurotransmitters are involved in the processes of early human development, including neurotransmission, differentiation, the growth of neurons, and the development of neural circuitry. Certain neurotransmitters may appear at different points of development. For example, monoamines are present before the neurons are differentiated. Norepinephrine levels are high in the notochord, even in the very early stages of the embryo. Serotonin has a role in morphogenesis. Excitatory amino acids tend to appear later in ontogenesis. The levels of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators tend to increase as new synapses form. Others will appearÂ in the perinatal period, like glutamate, and plateau afterward. Hypoxia and drug-exposure can disturb the formation of neuronal circuity, leading to long-term deleterious effects in the body.
