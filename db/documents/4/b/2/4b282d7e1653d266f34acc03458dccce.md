**Classification**

The two most widely used classification systems for aortic dissection are the Debakey and Stanford Classifications. Similarly, IMH is also classified in the same way.

**Debakey**

- Type 1 – Starts in the ascending aorta and progresses to the arch and sometimes beyond this point.

- Type 2 – Ascending aorta only

- Type 3 – Descending aorta only

**Stanford**

- Type A – Any dissection involving the ascending aorta

- Type B – Any dissection not involving the ascending aorta
