Flat food constitutes a multifactorial entity. Prognosis varies depending on etiology, length of time a patient has been having symptoms, and treatment course. Degenerative and inflammatory arthritis, as well as Charcot arthropathy as the cause of flat foot, is often difficult to treat, and the symptoms worsen over time. Surgery for pathologies such as posterior tibial tendon tear, a tight gastrocnemius muscle, or Achilles tendon has a favorable prognosis.
