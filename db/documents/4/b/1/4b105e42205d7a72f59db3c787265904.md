Hysteroscopy involves inserting a rigid or flexible hysteroscope through the cervical canal into the uterus and then using distending media to allow for complete visualization of the endometrial cavity. It allows for minimally invasive diagnosis and surgical management of endocervical and intrauterine pathology. It is considered the gold standard technique for evaluating and managing intrauterine pathology. Indications for hysteroscopy are numerous, including abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility, removal of intrauterine foreign bodies, and congenital Mullerian anomalies. This activity describes the hysteroscopic diagnostic and operative technique, highlighting the role of interprofessional team members in managing patients undergoing hysteroscopy.
