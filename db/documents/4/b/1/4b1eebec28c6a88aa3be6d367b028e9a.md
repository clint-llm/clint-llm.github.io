A Smith fracture is a fracture of the distal radius featuring volar displacement or angulation. It typically results from a fall on the dorsum of the hand with a flexed wrist. Reduction and reapproximation are essential and can be accomplished conservatively if not severe with casting. However, if heavily angulated or unstable after reduction, open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) is necessary. This activity outlines the definition, evaluation, and management of Smith fractures. It also reviews the role of the healthcare team in managing patients with this type of fracture.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Smith fractures.
- Review the evaluation of a Smith fracture.

- Outline the treatment and management options available for a Smith fracture
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance and improve outcomes in Smith fracture cases.
