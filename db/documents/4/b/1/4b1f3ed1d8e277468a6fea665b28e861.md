Vecuronium is most often used by the anesthesiologist, nurse anesthetist, emergency department physician, and intensivist. It is vital that before administering this agent, one has resuscitative equipment, including a mechanical ventilator, in the room. The patient must have an intravenous line and should be monitored by a dedicated nurse during the process of intubation.
