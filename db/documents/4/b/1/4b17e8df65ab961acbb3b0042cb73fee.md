Tetrodotoxin is a neurotoxin that is most commonly found in marine animals. It is famously known to cause perioral numbness in consumers of pufferfish sushi, known in Japan as fugu. The toxin is heat-stable, meaning that cooking does not destroy the toxin. There are 26 known naturally occurring analogs. The toxin blocks sodium channels leading to gastrointestinal, neurological, and cardiac symptoms in poisoned patients. There is currently no known antidote.
