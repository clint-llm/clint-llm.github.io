The involvement and effective collaboration of the entire healthcare team is essential in any patient encounter, but even more so in cases where the presentation requires urgency in proper diagnosis and management. Due to the high degree of functional impairment arising from CES/CMS, speedy diagnosis and subsequent treatment via surgical decompression are important. The efficiency of the medical system must begin with the person responsible for triaging appropriately in the emergency department, where a significant proportion of patients with CES/CMS initially present for evaluation. After the initial triage, nurses and physicians must work together to keep the patient updated on the suspected diagnosis, workup, and test results. The radiologist must know the reason for ordering the MRI these patients and given the clinical history and suspected diagnosis early.

MRI imaging is considered the gold standard imaging modality to asses of CES/CMS, Class I evidence. Many studies recommend obtaining MRI within an hour from presentation. Furthermore, it is paramount that prompt neurosurgical consultation take palce promptly, as surgical decompression is required. Many studies have been done that show decompression within 48 hours is best, although some studies recommend the timing be closer to under 24 hours, Class II evidence. It is challenging to design large RCTs to obtain Class I evidence for the timing of surgical decompression for obvious ethical reasons.
