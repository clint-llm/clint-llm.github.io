Horseshoe kidney is a congenital anomaly affecting about 1/400 to 600 people, more common in men. In this disorder, the patient's kidneys fuse, forming a horseshoe shape. During embryonic development, both kidneys become fused and ascend from the pelvis to their position in the abdomen. The kidneys are caught below the inferior mesenteric artery and, therefore, remain in the lower abdomen just below the IMA. Horseshoe kidneys are usually asymptomatic and don't typically require treatment.

Mesenteric arterial thrombosis typically occurs in patients with hypercoagulability and/or cardiac arrhythmias, resulting in arterial occlusion, most commonly of the proximal SMA, and presents with acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Occlusion of the IMA is possible, but rare due to the smaller caliber of the IMA.
