Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, also known as undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma, is a rare, highly aggressive malignant tumor accounting for 2 to 3 percent of all thyroid gland neoplasms. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma continues to be one of the most deadly diseases worldwide and carries a very poor prognosis. In addition to considerable local invasion, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma often presents with metastatic spread to regional lymph nodes and distant sites. This activity examines when clinicians should consider this condition on differential diagnosis and how to diagnose it properly. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
- Identify the characteristic features of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
- Review the management of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
- Explore modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve patient outcomes affected by anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
