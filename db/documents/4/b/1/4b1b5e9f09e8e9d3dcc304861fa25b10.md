Comprehension of the anatomy of the spinal cord and their respective functions is paramount when diagnosing and managing spinal cord infarction (SCI). The spinal cord has 31 pairs of dorsal and ventral roots emanating from the cervical (n=8), thoracic (n=12), lumbar (n=5), and coccygeal (n=1) segments. The anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord contains motor and spinothalamic modalities, and the posterior one third houses the proprioceptive tracts**.**

The spinal cord receives its vascular support from one anterior spinal artery (ASA) and two posterior spinal arteries (PSA) that span the length of the cord longitudinally. They originate from the vertebral arteries at the level of the craniocervical junction, they anastomose via the vasocorona and transverse radicular branches forming the pial plexus, then give rise to small perforating branches that enter the spinal cord and supply the different tracts.

The ASA gives rise to the sulcocommissural artery, which is also responsible for providing blood supply to the anterior of the spinal cord.

The spinal cord bears a high level of collateral circulation thus decreasing its susceptibility to vascular injury;

The anterior spinal and medial posterior veins are responsible for providing venous drainage to the spinal cord; together they form a venous network surrounding the cord, similar to the arterial system radicular veins are present in high quantity and channel through to the intervertebral and paravertebral plexi which direct blood flow to the azygos and pelvic venous systems.
