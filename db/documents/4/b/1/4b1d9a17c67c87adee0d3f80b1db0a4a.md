If homonymous hemianopia develops slowly, it is usually caused by a compressive etiology, but when it presents acutely, it is caused by hemorrhage, ischemia, and inflammation.

- Initially, patients with acquired homonymous hemianopias may not notice their field defect, especially if a right hemispheric lesion is responsible as associated neurological deficits are subtle.

- Eventually, however, most adult patients become aware of their defective peripheral vision.

- Those with dense field deficits may bump into objects in their blind hemifield.

- Superior deficits will cause the patient to hit his head with an object positioned above the head in the blind superior field. Patients may complain that they do not see the upper portion of a computer or television screen. They may have reading problems when the field deficit crosses the horizontal plane.

- The most posterior component of the internal capsule is the optic radiation. Therefore patients with lesions in this area can present with contralateral hemianesthesia.

- Depending on the etiology, the patient may present with headaches, seizures, contralateral motor deficits, contralateral sensory deficits, decreased level of consciousness, and in dominant temporal lobe lesions, the patient may be aphasic or dysphasic. Major neurological findings are much more common in parietal lesions than temporal ones.

- Lesions in the lateral geniculate ganglion produce many complex deficits as the dorsal part corresponds to the macula, the lateral part corresponds to the superior visual field, and the medial portion to the inferior visual field. Pupillary reactions are normal as the pupillary fibers go directly from the optic tract to the superior colliculus.

- Most lesions at the occipital lobe are vascular or traumatic. They are usually homonymous and congruous and almost always without other major localizing neurologic findings.
