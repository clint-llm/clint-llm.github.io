Evaluation of patients who are suspected of having pericarditis should begin with an electrocardiogram. Patients with pericarditis occasionally will have typical ECG changes that evolve through four stages. In stage I, patients develop diffuse concave up ST-segment elevation. This is often accompanied by PR-segment elevation in lead AVR as well. Stage II occurs within the first week, and shows normalization of ST and PR segment changes, while stage III, and stage IV are characterized by widespread T-wave inversions, followed by T-wave normalization.

Laboratory studies may be helpful when working up pericarditis.  A complete blood cell count may show a leukocytosis.  A basic metabolic profile may demonstrate elevated renal function tests supporting uremia as the cause of pericarditis or pericardial effusion.  The sedimentation rate and CRP are inflammatory markers which may help diagnose or track the progression of these conditions.

Once a diagnosis of pericarditis is made or there is a concern for cardiac tamponade, a bedside echocardiogram should be performed to evaluate the extent of the effusion and look for signs of tamponade.  Evidence on echocardiogram supporting tamponade would include right ventricular collapse or bowing of the intraventricular septum.  If myocarditis is of concern computed tomography or cardiovascular magnetic MRI.
