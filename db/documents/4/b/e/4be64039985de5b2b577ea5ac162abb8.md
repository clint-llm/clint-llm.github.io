Cryptosporidium can be diagnosed by identification of the parasite in the stool with special stains, by antigen detection assays or by nucleic acid/polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. On stool staining, the mature oocyst is identified using modified acid fast staining.Â An advantage of stool staining is the low cost of the modified acid fast reagents; however, this requires technical training to visualize the organisms appropriately. Improved diagnostic ability with PCR studies and antigen detection has increased the ability to diagnose this diarrheal pathogen. An advantage of molecular testing via PCR is that it can distinguish which species is causing symptoms. Serologic assays are also used to assess the burden of infection in populations, both symptomatic and asymptomatic.
