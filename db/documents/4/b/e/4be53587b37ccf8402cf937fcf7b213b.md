Lymphoma is a solid, cohesive cancer of the lymphatic cells. In thyroid lymphoma, these lymphoid cancer cells in the thyroid cause the gland to enlarge. The patient may experience various symptoms due to thyroid gland dysfunction and enlargement; or symptoms like fever, night sweats, and weight loss due to the lymphoma itself. Multiple laboratory investigations, imaging, and biopsy of the thyroid gland are needed to establish the diagnosis and stage of the lymphoma. Good treatment options are available depending on the specific subtype and stage of the lymphoma. Usually, multiple specialists like the medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, oncology pharmacist, and oncology nurse are involved in healthcare. Prognosis depends on several factors like age, functional status, tumor type, and stage, but overall, primary thyroid lymphoma has an excellent prognosis if promptly identified and treated.
