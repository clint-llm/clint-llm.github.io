Patients with a clinical history consistent with von Willebrand disease are investigated further with the following labs:

- Complete blood count (CBC): Platelet levels tend to be normal

- Coagulation profile: aPTT may be prolonged, as there would be increased factor VIII degradation in von Willebrand disease. PT should be normal.

- Von Willebrand factor antigen: von Willebrand factor protein levels are measured. This is a test for a quantitative defect.

- Von Willebrand factor activity: This is a qualitative analysis for von Willebrand factor physiological function. This is tested through Ristocetin cofactor activity (vWF:RCo) and collagen binding activity (vWF:CB). Normal Ristocetin cofactor activity levels are above 50 IU/dL. Levels below 30 are diagnostic for von Willebrand disease.

- Factor VIII Activity: Decreased von Willebrand factor leads to increased degradation of factor VIII.

- Von Willebrand factor activity/antigen ratio: This helps identify cases with a significant qualitative deficit. A low ratio should raise suspicion for type 2 von Willebrand disease; however, absolute normal values have yet to be determined.

Patients with von Willebrand disease activity/antigen levels between 30 and 50 should be designated as “low-von Willebrand factor” and be considered for treatment in high bleeding risk scenarios.
