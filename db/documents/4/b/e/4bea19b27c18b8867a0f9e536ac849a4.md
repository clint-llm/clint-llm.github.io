Most molluscum contagiosum lesions in non-compromised persons resolve spontaneously within an average duration of six to 12 months. However, the course of molluscum contagiosum may take as long as four years. During that period, some mollusca may heal without any intervention, while others occur. Unlike other viruses, the molluscum contagiosum virusÂ no longer exists within the body after healing. However, it remains possible to develop molluscum contagiosum again after repeated contact with an infected person or a contaminated fomite. Scarring is unusual in molluscum contagiosum unless lesions are scratched or scrapped. In immunocompromised persons, longer duration and resistance to therapy are common. Malignant transformation has never been reported.
