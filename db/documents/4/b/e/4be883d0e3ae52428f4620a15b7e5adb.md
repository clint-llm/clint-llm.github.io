The rationale for choosing teprotumumab for the treatment trials in thyroid eye disease was based entirely on in-vitro studies of IGF-1R expressing orbital fibroblast and CD34+ fibrocytes and their critical contribution toward pathophysiology of thyroid orbitopathy, including upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, T cell chemoattractant production including IL-16 and RANTES, hyaluronic acid synthesis and enhanced adipogenesis.

IGF-1R was overexpressed in orbital fibroblasts, monocyte progenitor cells, also known as fibrocytes in patients with thyroid orbitopathy, and peripheral B and T cells in patients with Graves disease.

Furthermore, TSHR and IGF-1R receptors are found to co-localize and form functional complexes on orbital fibroblasts.

in addition to the known IGF-1R signaling through the canonical pathway (Shc/SOS, RAF, MAPK, MEK and ERK, and IRS-induced PI3K/AKT) and non-canonical pathway where IGF-1R uses G protein signaling.

Teprotumumab is a 150 kDa fully human monoclonal anti-IGF-IR antibodyÂ that does not display cross-reactivity towards the insulin receptor.
