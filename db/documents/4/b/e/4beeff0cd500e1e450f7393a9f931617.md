Natural killer cells' effector functions are tightly regulated by the balance of inhibitory and activating receptors and downstream intracellular signaling cascades of these receptors. NK cells were originally identified in the 1970s

NK cells can kill tumor cells without previous sensitization. They directly kill tumor cells by releasing lytic granules that contain granzyme and perforin. NK cells, together with cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes, generate immunity against virus-infected and tumor cells. In most circumstances, tumor cells downregulate their MHC I to escape from cytotoxic T cells. However, the lower expression of MHC I make tumor cells susceptible to lysis by NK cell.
