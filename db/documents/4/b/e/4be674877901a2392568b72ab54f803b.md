There are many recommendations on the diagnosis and management of aortic coarctation, especially in adult males and females. There is no cure for the disorder, and even after treatment, there is a risk of recurrence and development of hypertension. Thus, patients need lifelong follow up with an interprofessional group of health professionals, including a cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, internist, and a critical care consultant. After surgery, the patient must be educated by the cardiovascular nurse and pharmacist on the importance of compliance with blood reassure medications. Regular follow up is vital to ensure that the blood pressure is controlled and the distal pulses are not diminished. The primary care provider must ensure that the patient receives endocarditis prophylaxis when undergoing any invasive procedure.

**Outcomes**

The short-term outlook for surgically patients with coarctation of the aorta is excellent, but even these patients have a guarded prognosis. Long-term data are not yet available primarily because patients are lost to follow up. Data indicate that in the long-term, recurrence of aortic coarctation, hypertension, stroke, paraplegia, and adverse cardiac events are not rare. In view of these negative observations, an interprofessional team approach is highly recommended to prevent the high morbidity and mortality.
