The treatment can be divided into two groups:

**Non-operative**

- **Observation:**Solitary lesions are generally self-limited with spontaneous regression. Thus, skeletally immature patients and asymptomatic patients with solitary lesions are observed for spontaneous regression. They are followed up at regular intervals.

- **Immobilization:**Patients with a spinal lesion producing pain with no or minimal neurological deficits should be immobilized. Bracing can be done in patients presenting with kyphosis.

- **Low Dose Irradiation:**The dose range is 6 to 12 Gy delivered at 2 Gy per fraction. It is given for symptomatic lesions that are persistent or relapse after conservative treatment or lesions involving vital structuresâ€”also given in patients with mild neurological deficits.

- **Methylprednisolone Injection:**Intralesional methylprednisolone injection (40mg to 160 mg) is given for symptomatic lesions of the spine and extremities. Corticosteroids are also offered in pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma (EG) when there are significant pulmonary and constitutional symptoms.

- **Chemotherapy:**High-risk patients like skeletal mature, polyostotic EG, CNS-risk bones involvement (sphenoid, ethmoid, orbital, or temporal), and multisystem involvement should be treated with systemic chemotherapy (vinblastine and prednisone or cytarabine for 12 months).

- Smoking cessation helps in stabilizing the pulmonary EG, stop its progression, and prevent bronchogenic carcinoma.

**Operative**

- **Curettage and Bone Grafting:**Solitary skull lesions are treated with curettage after biopsy, followed by bone grafting. Lesions that are at risk for impending fracture are also treated with curettage followed by bone grafting.

- **Surgical Fixation:**Surgical fixation is done for patients with severe pain, restricted range of motion, progressive neurological deficits, and spinal instability.

- **Chest Intubation and Pleurodesis:**Pneumothorax in pulmonary EG is managed with chest intubation followed by pleurodesis. If recurrent, then pleurectomy can be done.

- **Lung Transplantation:**In advanced disease, lung transplantation can be helpful.
