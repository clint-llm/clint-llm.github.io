Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is performed because the mortality rates are as high as 78% following rupture. Open and endovascular surgery are the two approaches utilized for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Main repair indications include large aneurysm diameter (5 centimeters in females, 5.5 centimeters in males), rapid expansion, symptomatic aneurysm, and frank rupture. This activity reviews the evaluation, screening, and treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in identifying and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- List the factors associated with high risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture.
- Detail the screening recommendations for abdominal aortic aneurysms. 
- Describe the two approaches utilized for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair; identify which approach is associated with lower morbidity.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and collaboration in order to employ better identification, screening, and treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms and improve patient outcomes.
