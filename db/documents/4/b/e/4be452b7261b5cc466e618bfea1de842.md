While osteopathic medicine has existed for over 130 years, many healthcare professionals still poorly understand it. This lack of understanding is partly due to differences in training during residency and medical school education and lack of practice in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Modalities such as muscle energy and counterstrain technique, when appropriate, can help enhance outcomes of patients and their symptoms. It is crucial for the interdisciplinary teams treating patients to understand the role of OMT in treatments and that OMT can serve as an adjunct therapy to existing therapies in place.
