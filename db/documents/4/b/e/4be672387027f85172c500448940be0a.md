The treatment of aortic transections often involves an interprofessional team. The prehospital treatment and transport begin with emergency medical personnel. After arrival, they will likely undergo evaluation by emergency physicians and a trauma surgery team. Early involvement of the cardiothoracic or vascular surgery teams will likely be required for operative planning, and some facilities may require transfer due to lack of resources. Depending on concurrent injuries, the multiple specialists involved will need to communicate involving the best timing of repair on a patient-by-patient basis.
