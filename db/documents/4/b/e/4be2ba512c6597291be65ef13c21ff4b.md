Several benefits to regional modalities for postoperative analgesia have been documented in the literature. Most of this evidence comes from adult literature.

Uncontrolled pain after abdominal surgeries can impair respiration, resulting in atelectasis and pneumonia. Epidural analgesia for major abdominal procedures offers excellent pain relief and minimizes the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. Epidural also facilitates the quicker return of gastrointestinal motility after major abdominal surgeries, both by its direct analgesic action and indirectly by minimizing opioid requirements. Neuraxial analgesia attenuates neurohumoral stress response to pain and subsequently the postoperative hypercoagulable state, decreasing the incidence of thromboembolic complications. Other benefits include decreased opioid requirements andÂ reduced incidence of opioid adverse effects like sedation, nausea, and vomiting.
