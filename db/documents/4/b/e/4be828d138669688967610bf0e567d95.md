Radiation therapy leads to mucosal damage, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and eventually cell death which leads to ulcerations of the esophageal mucosal lining. Radiation therapy causes cell DNA damage, leading to stress-related, pro-inflammatory cytokine production through various signaling pathways and ultimately causing mucosal damage and irritation. If severe, ulcerations of the mucosal wall can occur.
