TTP results from a decrease or absence of the enzyme ADAMTS13 activity. TTP can be eitherÂ congenital or acquired. Acquired TTP is more common than the congenital type and is caused by autoantibodies targeting ADAMTS13. Antiplatelet drugs, immunosuppressive agents, HIV, estrogen-containing birth control, and pregnancy are the most commonly listed triggers for ADAMTS13 autoantibody formation causing acquired TTP. The less common congenital form of TTP results from mutations to ADAMTS13.
