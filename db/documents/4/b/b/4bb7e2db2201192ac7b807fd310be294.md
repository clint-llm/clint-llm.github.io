Even though aspergillomas can often be diagnosed incidentally in an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patient, there is a significant risk of evolving complications. The natural history and risk of complications, therefore, become a deciding factor in choosing between surgical and conservative treatment options. Rafferty and colleagues noted that 20% of non surgically treated mycetoma progresses to invasive aspergillosis. Similarly, Paneth et al. observed that after an episode of hemoptysis, 5-year survival for operated patients was 41% compared to 84% for conservatively treated patients. Treatment approach has, therefore, leaned towards surgical resection either preemptively on every patient diagnosed with aspergilloma, or in those with even one episode of hemoptysis, if the patient is a surgical candidate. Massard and colleagues advocated the prophylactic resection approach while Daly and colleagues preferred surgery only after hemoptysis.

For patients with normal respiratory function, and with aspergilloma involving only one lung, 30-day postoperative mortality is anywhere between 1 to 5%. Antifungal therapy alone is, on the other hand, of limited benefit in treating either simple or complex aspergilloma.

A significant proportion of patients with aspergilloma have a preexisting diseased lung. Therefore resection with lung-sparing surgery has been gaining ground over the years. While wedge resection can occasionally be an option for a small, simple mycetoma, anatomical resection of segments or lobes has been the favored approach. Evaluation of pleural space is done carefully to ensure the absence of fistula or residual infection. But at the same time, manipulation of the mycetoma itself is reduced to a minimum.

**Pneumonectomy, although less favored can be a necessity in the following circumstances**

- Intraoperative injury to major vessels like pulmonary artery

- Second stage pneumonectomy for lobar torsion

- Multiple unilateral complex mycetoma

- Significantly destroyed surrounding lung tissue

- Megamycetoma

Endo and colleagues performed pneumonectomies in 35% of their reported patients without any postoperative mortality.

Cavernostomy and cavernoplasty followed by muscle flap interposition was a practice in vogue until the late 1930s. It fell out of favor with increased morbidity and mortality compared to surgical resection. It has been slowly coming back in practice for a limited subgroup of patients who are not surgical candidates.

For patients with pleural involvement with pleural aspergilloma, an open window thoracostomy or first stage thoracoplasty is performed, just as in chronic empyema. Certain centers will perform an intrathoracic muscle transposition in the same setting, thus obliterating the cavity.

These surgical procedures do have complications like shoulder deformity, restriction of mobility, chronic postoperative pain, and scoliosis that should be addressed with patients before surgery.

Major surgical complications include massive hemorrhage, bronchopleural fistula, empyema, and rarely lobar torsion. Pleural complications involve residual infection, empyema, incomplete reexpansion, and prolonged air leaks. A preexisting underlying lung disease like tuberculosis, emphysema, or fibrosis leads to loss of elasticity of the affected lung, thus preventing reexpansion. The incidence of all complications has been reported to be as high as 60%.

A local pulmonary or pleural recurrence often leads to a dramatic deteriorating clinical course. Even prophylactic adjuvant antifungal pharmacotherapy does not seem to reduce the risk of this adverse effect.

The source of postoperative bleeding can be aberrant systemic arteries, twisted bronchial vessels, or vascular adhesions due to chronic inflammation. Preoperative bronchial arterial embolization has been attempted in scenarios where there is a high risk of postoperative bleeding.

Passera and colleagues address some of the challenges of the surgery itself.

- Bronchovascular hilum can have induration with extra bronchial fibrosis and nodes affected by chronic infection. Routine taping of the main artery before dissection can help avoid bleeding complications.

- Extrapleural dissection reduces the risk of rupture of mycetoma in pleural space as well as the risk of bleeding.

- A bronchopleural fistula from bronchial deficiency can be an outcome of chronic inflammation, nonviable tissue, calcification, and atrophy. Coverage of the bronchial stump with pericardial, omental, or muscle flaps decreases the risk.

- Finally, the obliteration of residual pleural cavity reduces the risk of empyema or residual infection in the pleural space not adequately filled by entrapment of the remaining lobes.

For inoperable patients, intracavitary instillation of antifungal agents through percutaneous or intrabronchial catheters can lead to short-term clinical improvement.

Oakley and colleagues devised an algorithm for appropriate pre-surgical evaluation and risk stratification to improve outcomes. They divided patients into four categories

- CLASS 1 - fit individuals with no symptoms

- CLASS 2 - Fit individuals with severe symptoms

- CLASS 3 - Unfit individuals with no symptoms

- CLASS 4 - Unfit individuals with severe symptoms

Class 2 individuals were directed to surgical resection, while class 4 individuals were chosen for intracavitary installation or cavernostomy.

Surgical removal of aspergillus abscess, granuloma, and focally infarcted brain, coupled with systemic antifungal therapy, form the mainstay of management of CNS aspergillomas. When non-eloquent brain areas are involved, lobectomy for solitary Aspergillus fumigatus abscess is also an endorsed treatment option.

Some centers do prefer voriconazole extended therapy as an adjuvant treatment post-resection to control pleural contamination and encourage bronchial stump healing.

Postoperative survival has been reported to be similar in both simple and complex aspergilloma.

Amphotericin B is the mainstay among pharmacological agents in brain aspergilloma. Liposomal amphotericin B is significantly less toxic than free amphotericin B. However, because of the poor CSF penetration of systemic forms, intracatheter installation into the abscess cavity has also been an advocated approach. A combination of 5-fluorocytosine 50-150 mg/kg orally every six hours with rifampin can have a synergistic benefit with amphotericin.

**Bronchial Arterial Embolization for Massive Hemoptysis**

Bronchial arterial embolization is the favored approach for patients with massive hemoptysis both as a first-line treatment asÂ well as a bridge to more definitive surgical resection. However, in advanced disease, architectural distortion, neovascularization, and multiple vascular sources often make identification and control a challenging task.

The source of hemoptysis is the bronchial circulation in 90% of cases, although various thoracic and abdominal branches of the aorta can provide collateral supplies to interstitium and bronchi rarely in 10% of cases. Identification and distinction from ectopic or orthotopic bronchial arteries can be challenging even on bronchial arteriograms. Bronchial arterial branches tend to follow a vertical or horizontal course before joining the bronchial tree, unlike non-bronchial collaterals who follow a transpleural course not following the bronchial tree.

In 70% of instances, bronchial arteries arise from the descending thoracic aorta in the T5-T6 segment, with variants arising from the aortic arch or ascending aorta and occasionally from other aortic branches in the thorax or abdomen. Importantly, in the same context, is the path of the anterior spinal artery receiving collaterals from up to eight segmental medullary arteries, ventral to lower thoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord.

Apart from supplying pulmonary interstitium and bronchi, bronchial arteries also provide blood flow to visceral pleura, the middle third of the esophagus, vasa vasorum of the aorta and pulmonary artery, and mediastinum.

Complications and adverse events are therefore related to nontarget embolization and transient vascular disruption in other mediastinal structures. Transient chest pain and dysphagia are the commonest reported adverse events and are usually self-limiting.

Anterior spinal arterial embolization causing acute transverse myelitis is the most devastating outcome. However, it has been increasingly rare with advanced angiographic techniques, the use of microcatheters, and hypo or iso-osmolar contrast agents. Its rate of occurrence over the years has been reported between 1.4 to 6.5%.

Since adverse effects are rare, technical success occurs in greater than 90% of interventions with clinical success reported at 73 to 99% immediately post embolization. Unfortunately, recurrence is also frequent at 10 to 55% in studies up to a 4-year follow-up.
