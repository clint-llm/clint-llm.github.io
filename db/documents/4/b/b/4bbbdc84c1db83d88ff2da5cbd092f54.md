The pattern electroretinogram (PERG) is a specialized electrophysiologic test of central retinal function in response to a pattern reversing stimulus. There are standard protocols for eliciting the retinal electrical response. The PERG is a valuable diagnostic tool that can aid providers in determining a correct diagnosis in patients with retinal disease beyond standard clinical examination capabilities. This activity reviews the PERG procedure and technique and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients using this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for pattern electroretinogram (PERG).

- Describe the typical pattern electroretinogram (PERG) findings associated with optic nerve dysfunction.
- Review the interfering factors for the pattern electroretinogram (PERG).
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by retinal disease using pattern electroretinogram (PERG).
