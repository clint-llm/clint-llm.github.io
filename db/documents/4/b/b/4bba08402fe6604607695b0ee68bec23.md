The anorectal abscess can vary on the spectrum of complexity based on the location and involvement of surrounding tissue. A thorough knowledge of the anatomical structures and their relationship to each other is important for both accurate diagnoses of the disease and to provide appropriate treatment to avoid the complications of multiple procedures and increased costs associated with delayed diagnosis. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of a perirectal abscess and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of anorectal abscesses.
- Contrast the types of anorectal abscesses that can be drained at the bedside with the types that require consideration of intra-operative draining.
- Explain the decision process for prescribing antibiotics to patients with anorectal abscesses.
- Identify ways that interprofessional team members can collaborate and improve care coordination to reduce anorectal abscess recurrence rate of enhance patient outcomes.
