Several variations to the branch patterns of the DPA exist. For instance, if the anterior tibial artery does not reach the foot, the perforating branch of the peroneal artery becomes DPA. Also, if the arcuate artery is small or missing, the lateral tarsal artery may support the dorsal metatarsal branches.
