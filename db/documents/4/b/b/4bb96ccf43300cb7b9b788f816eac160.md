**Preparation**

Any EMS system that may potentially respond to altitude-related conditions should be prepared well in advance to manage altitude-related illnesses.  Proper pharmacologic options, specific altitude-related equipment, and medical training should all be prepared, available, and familiar to EMS providers well before responding to an EMS call for an altitude-related condition.

**Environmental Concerns**

Because altitude illnesses often occur in an austere environment, EMS personnel must be prepared for situations when the optimal treatment options may be unavailable.  Patients experiencing HACE may suffer from significant trauma because the associated altered mental status can lead to poor decision making. Patients with other forms of altitude illness may have traveled too far and are unable to return to their starting point due to symptoms. In cases with significant trauma, only life-threatening treatments should be performed prior to evacuation. “Load and go” should be the mantra as opposed to “stay and play.” Bad weather and difficult terrain will often make immediate descent dangerous or impossible.  These issues are why adjunct treatments should be available in addition to supplemental oxygen and descent. When an EMS professional is dealing with life-threatening altitude illness, balancing the available options with the feasibility of descent can be difficult.  In general, because even relatively small descents can have dramatic improvements for patients, a rapid descent of a small amount is preferred to delaying descent for a larger elevation change.

**Diagnosis**

For EMS, recognition of the presence of an altitude-related condition is vital and initiate descent from altitude or alternative treatments should be immediately started.  Because acute mountain sickness can present with non-specific symptoms, the condition can be challenging to diagnose.  Fortunately, the much more severe condition of HACE is easier to diagnose because of specific symptoms that are pathognomonic.  The Lake Louise scoring system can assist EMS providers and diagnosing altitude-related illness.

**Differential Diagnosis**

EMS providers should be familiar with and understand how to manage patients with different types of high altitude illnesses when there is a chance that patients with these conditions may be encountered. Patients will often call with nonspecific complaints and perhaps even a presumptive alternative diagnosis. Infection, dehydration, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, hangover, and migraine are extremely common complaints that can mimic AMS and early HACE. Asthma, pulmonary infection, heart failure, and PE are all in the differential diagnosis of HAPE.  When EMS is called for a complaint consistent with these diagnoses, it is essential that EMS have an awareness of a high altitude environment and understand the importance of rapid descent in altitude illness.  Delay in transport is potentially life-threatening if a patient with HACE is misdiagnosed as dehydrated and given IV fluids in place.  Oxygen saturation does not correlate with the degree of AMS/HACE enough to be used in deciding if a patient needs immediate evacuation. The decision to evacuate is based on history and clinical presentation, not vital signs. A complete neurological evaluation and mental status exam are of paramount importance when deciding whether immediate evacuation of patients with AMS/HACE is required. EMS providers should consider presenting vital signs, specifically tachycardia and tachypnea in the presence of dyspnea at rest, that can suggest a diagnosis of HAPE.
