Prior to video capsule ingestion, the patient is outfitted with a sensor belt which gathers the capsule’s transmitted images. Once a magnet is removed from the capsule, it becomes activated, and the patient can ingest the capsule while in an upright position. As mentioned above, the capsule can also be placed in the stomach or duodenum endoscopically. Patients are advised not to participate in any activities that may cause sensor belt detachment. The patient can resume a clear liquid diet 2 hours after capsule ingestion. They can have a small meal 4 hours after ingestion. Patients undergoing esophageal capsule endoscopy only need to fast for 2 hours before the procedure and will need to consume 100 mL of water just prior to capsule ingestion. The patient will swallow the capsule while lying supine and slowly move into an upright sitting position over a 5-minute period.
