The overriding factor affecting incidence and distribution depends on patient risk factors, including but not limited to: prior abdominal surgery, colon or metastatic cancer, chronic intestinal inflammatory disease, existing abdominal wall and/or an inguinal hernia, previous irradiation, and foreign body ingestion.
