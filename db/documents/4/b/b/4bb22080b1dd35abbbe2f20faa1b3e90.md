Surgical treatments involving the hamstring muscles are rare, as conservative treatment for injuries is the preferred first-line management. Patients may present with ecchymosis over the posterior thigh and a stiff-legged gait to avoid flexion at the hip and knee. Patients with avulsion injuries of the proximal hamstring musclesÂ from their origin may benefit from surgical treatment of their injuries regarding pain levels and functional outcomes, particularly if they are young and active. Surgical procedures have been shown to have better results when used in treating more severe avulsion injuries, as well as being performed on more acute injuries compared to chronic avulsion injuries.

Other surgical considerations regarding the hamstring muscles include autografting hamstring tendons to reconstruct the ACL in patients with tears. Removal of the semitendinosus and sometimes gracilus tendons from their insertion site into the pes anserinus for use in ACL repairs has been shown to have advantages over other autograft methods (such as using the patellar tendon) with less post-operative knee pain and an overall easier recovery following surgery.
