Managing proper drug administration in healthcare requires interprofessional effort from various healthcare professionals such as clinicians, pharmacists, nurses, residents, etc. Numerous drug-related problems result in medication-related harm and low-quality healthcare for patients without appropriate regulation and administration techniques. To properly deliver a drug via transdermal patches, the following steps are necessary:

- Proper physical examination and updating the patient's medical history by the prescribing clinician

- Consult with the pharmacist on the appropriate drug to be administered based on patient symptoms and history

- Consult with a clinician if there are any concerns about a transdermal patch

- If there is a life-threatening emergency related to the transdermal patch, the emergency department should be contacted immediately.

To enhance communication between healthcare professionals, techniques such as face-to-face interviews have proven to provide cohesiveness between pharmacists, primary care physicians, and surgical physicians for drug-related healthcare. It also includes reinforcement of patient counseling points to ensure proper administration and contacting the prescriber if it appears the patient is unable to perform self-administration properly. Ultimately, these techniques allow for an amplified patient-centered approach.
