Cultural competency is emphasized in treating American Indian/ Alaskan Native (AI/AN) patients because the mortality rates are more likely to increase in the population since they acquire Type 1 Diabetes and other chronic disorders more often. Preventative measures are required from their primary care physicians. Early measures include nutritionist referrals, blood glucose checking, and early screening for chronic uncontrolled hypertension, renal disease, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and cancer. This activity reviews the clinical and public health issues faced by AI/AN patients. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating those conditions and addressing such adversities.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical reasons for a delayed diagnosis of chronic diseases within AI/AN patients.
- Explain the psychosocial considerations for patients with AI/AN racial background.
- Outline the management considerations for patients with limited healthcare access in AI/AN areas.
- Summarize how to counsel a patient with chronic diseases from AI/AN background.
