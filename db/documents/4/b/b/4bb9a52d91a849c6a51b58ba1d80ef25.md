For emergency contraceptive use, the recommended dose is 1.5 mg oral tablet within 72 hours. There is also a 0.75 mg oral tablet that can be given with a second 0.75 mg dose if needed 24 hours later. A 3 mg oral levonorgestrel is for patients concomitantly taking a CYP3A4 cytochrome p450 liver enzyme-inducing drug, e.g., rifampicin, St. Johnâ€™s wort, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital due to these agents increasing hepatic clearance of levonorgestrel. Vomiting can occur within two hours of administration, at which case the patient would need to repeat the initial dose taken.

For the long-term birth control options, the levonorgestrel intrauterine T-shaped device has 52 mg of levonorgestrel covered by a rate-controlling membrane that regulates the rate of release of hormones.
