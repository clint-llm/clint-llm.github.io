Hippocampal sclerosis is histopathologically seen as segmental pyramidal cell loss in CA1, CA3, and CA4 regions, whereas CA2 pyramidal and dentate gyrus granule cells are most seizure resistant.

Several classification systems have been proposed for HS. The most widely used is the ILAE classification system, which divides HS into three types based on a semi-quantitative survey of segmental cell loss within hippocampal subfields. International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) type 1 has both CA1 and CA4 loss; ILAE Type 2 has predominant CA1 loss, and ILAE Type 3 has predominant CA4 loss.

Malformations of cortical development represent a wide range of cortical lesions resulting from the derangement of normal developmental processes involving cells implicated in the formation of the cortical mantle.

Gangliogliomas and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET) is the most frequent long-term epilepsy-associated tumors (LEAT) comprising 65% of brain tumors encountered in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery.
