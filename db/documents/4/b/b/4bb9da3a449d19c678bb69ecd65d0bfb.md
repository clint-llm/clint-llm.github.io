In a retinal detachment,Â layers of rods and cones become detached from the RPE. The separation of the neurosensory layer of the retina from the outermost pigmented epithelium leads to the degeneration of photoreceptors and subsequent vision loss. Symptoms of early retinal detachment include flashes and floaters in the affected eye or a veil/curtain type of vision loss that is constant (vs. transient loss due to amaurosis fugax). Treatment includes lasering around the detached area to re-adhere the retina to the underlying RPE or doing a vitrectomy and filling the eye with oil to press the retina back onto the RPE. Common causes of retinal detachment include trauma, hypertension, and diabetic retinopathy.
