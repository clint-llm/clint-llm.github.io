The worldwide incidence rate of congenital torticollis varies between 0.3% and 1.9 %; other studies indicate a ratio of 1 in 250 newborns being the third congenital orthopedic anomaly. There is a preponderance to male sex and first pregnancy.

A 2% incidence of congenital torticollis in traumatic deliveries and 0.3% in non-traumatic deliveries.

Congenital muscular torticollis categorizes into three types:

- Postural (20%) – Infant has a postural preference but no muscle tightness or restriction to passive range of motion

- Muscular  (30%) – Tightness of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and limitation of passive range of motion

- Sternocleidomastoid mass (50%) – Thickening of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and restricted passive range of motion
