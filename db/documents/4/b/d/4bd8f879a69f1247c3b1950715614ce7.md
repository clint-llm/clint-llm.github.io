Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia is a severe form of thrombocytopenia with reduced or absent megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. It can be congenital or acquired. There is an eventual progression to impairment in the production of all three cell lines. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia and explains the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia.
- Summarize the epidemiology of amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia.
- Review pathophysiology of amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies that the healthcare team can use to improve outcomes in patients with lipoid proteinosis.
