The exact number of the supraclavicular lymph nodes, including the Virchow node, and their distance from anatomical boundaries surrounding it can vary to an extent.

In a study done to provide a detailed description of the surgical anatomy of the supraclavicular lymph node flap for free vascularized lymph node transfer, a surgical method to treat lymphedema, dissections on fresh cadavers showed variation in the number of lymph nodes between the right (average of 1.5 +/- 1.85) and left supraclavicular lymph nodes (average of 3 +/- 2.26). In four out of nine cases, no right supraclavicular lymph nodes were present on the right side while in one out of nine cases, no left supraclavicular lymph nodes were present. Researchers also noted a variation in their mean distance from the jugular notch in the right (8.29 +/- 2.15) and left sides (6.10 +/- 1.21).

Studies have also noted variations in the location of the Virchow node and its histological anatomy relative to the thoracic duct. A study done on five cadavers found that the Virchow node was attached to the dorsal aspect of the carotid sheath (two out of five cadavers) or on the scalenus anterior muscle (three out of five). The study noted different numbers of collaterals coming from the thoracic duct and their communication pattern with the Virchow node. It is also noteworthy that the Virchow node is not always present at the terminal of the thoracic duct (only present in 27% of Japanese subjects).
