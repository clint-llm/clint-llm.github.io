Awake craniotomy with brain mapping is the gold standard for resections of tumors or lesions in or near eloquent areas of the brain. Neurological deficits resulting from excision or injury of areas essential for speech and motor control functions might be devastating. The gold standard technique for mapping these vital areas involves direct electrical stimulation of the cortex while the patient is awake. The awake patients will be able to perform a relevant task and thus help determine if the stimulus disrupts the execution of the particular task.

Proper patient selection and patient counseling are of paramount importance. A co-operative patient who can follow commands during surgery is a must for brain mapping; therefore, improper patient selection may result in failure of awake craniotomy. The patient should be told about the details of the procedure and what is expected from them so that they are calm and cooperative during surgery. Judicious use of sedation and neve block is mandatory to keep the patient pain-free, comfortable, and cooperative.
