Treatment options for patients with diplopia are limited. Patients with monocular diplopia should be evaluated for possible cataract surgery, and their refractive errors should be corrected. Patients with binocular diplopia who are symptomatic should ideally first try to palliate the diplopia with prisms in their spectacles. Prisms are generally effective only for patients with small (~up to 10-12 prism diopters) misalignments. For patients with larger misalignments, occlusion of either eye with a patch or a tape applied to one lens in the spectacles can be an effective way to eliminate diplopia. Patients with stable misalignments should be assessed by a strabismologist for potential surgical correction of the eye misalignment. Injection of Botulinum toxin into the antagonist of the paretic muscle has also been suggested but can be difficult as it is hard to predict the reaction of each patient to a specific dose of Botulinum toxin, and its effect will eventually wear off
