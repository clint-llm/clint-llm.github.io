Investigation with chest radiography should follow the complaint of dyspnea; patients with MPE present with moderate to large effusions with volumes ranging from 500 to 2000 mL. Ten percent of patients present with massive pleural effusion, defined as occupying an entire hemithorax. Large pleural effusions should result in a contralateral mediastinal shift; absence of mediastinal shift implies endobronchial lesion of the ipsilateral mainstem bronchus, disease involvement of pleural surfaces, or fixation of the mediastinum. Chest ultrasonography has 100% sensitivity in the diagnosis of pleural effusion. The appropriate site for performing thoracentesis can be identified using ultrasound. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest is the best modality for visualizing the pleural surfaces in detail, along with lung parenchyma, chest wall, and mediastinum. On CT, pleural thickening greater than 1 cm, irregularity of the pleural space, and pleural nodules can indicate MPE, but approximately 50% of patients with MPE have no pleural abnormalities on CT.

Every patient with free pleural fluid that measures more than 10 mm on the radiograph, ultrasound, or chest CT should have a diagnostic thoracentesis. Therapeutic thoracentesis should be performed in all patients with suspected MPE to assess the degree of relief of dyspnea and rate of recurrence. If dyspnea is not improved with thoracentesis, an alternative diagnosis such as pulmonary embolism, atelectasis, or lymphangitic carcinomatosis should be investigated.

The gross appearance of MPE varies. Malignant disease is the most common cause of bloody effusions, and about half of malignant pleural effusions appear bloody. MPE can otherwise appear clear or cloudy.

As with all pleural effusions, the fluid analysis should include distinguishing between transudate and exudate. Light’s criteria were developed as a means of distinguishing transudative effusions (commonly caused by heart failure, cirrhosis, or renal failure) from exudative effusions (commonly caused by malignancy, infection, pulmonary embolism, and gastrointestinal disease). The identification of transudate or exudate is made by the analysis of the pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Exudative effusions fulfill at least one of the following criteria: (1) pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio greater than .50, (2) pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio greater than .60, and (3) pleural fluid LDH greater than two-thirds the upper normal limit for serum. These criteria have 100% sensitivity in diagnosing exudates but can misdiagnose transudates as exudates in up to 25% of cases. If the patient clinically appears to have a transudate (clear, yellow fluid), then additional testing can be performed to further differentiate the two. A serum to fluid protein gradient of greater than 3.1 or serum to fluid albumin gradient of greater than 1.2 indicates a fluid is transudative. The pleural fluid from malignant effusions is almost always an exudate. Rarely, malignant effusions can be transudative, but this is usually related to an underlying condition causing increased hydrostatic pressure resulting in an effusion, such as congestive heart failure, the superior vena cava syndrome, airway obstruction with resultant atelectasis or pneumonia, and low oncotic pressure from underlying malnutrition or cachexia.

Cell differential of pleural fluid typically demonstrates lymphocyte-predominant fluid, although eosinophilic or neutrophilic-predominant effusions do not necessarily preclude effusion secondary to malignancy.

Definitive diagnosis requires the demonstration of malignant cells on cytology sample obtained during thoracentesis. Diagnostic yield is reported to be as high as 60% in patients who undergo thoracentesis for suspected MPE; the diagnostic yield varies with the type of tumor and the extent of tumor involvement of the pleural space. For example, cytology results are more commonly positive in adenocarcinoma than in squamous cell carcinoma due to its greater tendency to invade the pleural space. Cytologic yield does not depend on the size of the effusion. The first thoracentesis is expected to result in diagnosis 65% of the time; one study demonstrated an additional yield of 27% on the second thoracentesis and only 5% on the third. Therefore, if 2 thoracenteses have not yielded cytology and an MPE is highly suspected, thoracoscopy should be pursued as the next step. The diagnostic yield of medical thoracoscopy is considerably higher at 95% but far more invasive than simple thoracentesis.

Finally, during thoracentesis, pleural manometry is encouraged to identify trapped lung physiology. A trapped lung is defined as the inability of the lung to expand due to fibrous visceral peel fully. In patients with MPE, it can be due to endobronchial tumor occlusion or by complete infiltration of the pleura by malignancy. This may be more evident on imaging in those with large pleural effusion without accompanying contralateral mediastinal shift. In the physiology of pleural effusion, pleural pressures are positive. However, the pleural pressure in the trapped lung is negative initially and drops steeply with the removal of fluid.  Those patients with trapped lung are unlikely to benefit from pleurodesis, which will be discussed below.
