The majority of non-IgM MGUS patients are asymptomatic. According to the 2014 International Myeloma Working Group updated criteria, the diagnosis of non-IgM MGUS is based on three criteria:

- Serum monoclonal protein less than 30 g/L (3 g/dL)

- Less than 10% of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow

- The absence of CRAB symptoms (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia and, bone lesions suspicious for PCM)

Non-IgM MGUS is usually diagnosed as an incidental finding on protein electrophoresis performed as part of an evaluation for disorders or disease presentation of peripheral neuropathy, vasculitis, hemolytic anemia, skin rashes, hypercalcemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Non-IgM MGUS is generally not considered a neoplastic process, with an annual risk of progression of 1%. Non-IgM MGUS may progress to PCM, solitary plasmacytoma, or amyloidosis. Two important factors influence non-IgM MGUS progression. The first is the size and type of M protein, and the second is the level of immunoglobulin (less than 5 g/L and greater than 25 g/L).
