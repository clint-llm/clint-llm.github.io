The differential diagnoses of Candida auris include invasive fungal infections caused by other species of Candida and comprise 95% of all invasive fungal infections:

- Candida albicans

- Candida glabrata

- Candida tropicalis

- Candida paratropicalis

- Pichia kudriavzevii

Other differentials are:

- Aspergillosis

- Bacterial sepsis

- Cryptococcosis

- Septic shock

While these pathogens are more common, infections with Candida auris occur at a higher incidence in primary and acquired immunosuppression than other fungal pathogens. However, infection in immunocompetent hosts also occurs, and the mere clinical presentation is insufficient to distinguish among Candida species.

The phenotypic characterization, such as the appearance and color of C. auris colonies in culture, high tolerance to growth in high heat (up to 42C), and saline environments, helps distinguish it from other Candida species but should not be used as the sole method for identification. Phenotypic platforms typically mistake C. auris for C. haemulonii and different yeasts (C. famata, C. guilliermondii, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, C. sake, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Rhodotorula glutinis).C. auris.
