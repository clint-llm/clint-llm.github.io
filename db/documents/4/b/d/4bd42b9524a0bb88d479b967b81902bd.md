Follicular lymphoma typically presents with generalized painless lymphadenopathy. Lymphadenopathy is waxing and waning in nature. FL commonly involves axillary, cervical, femoral, and inguinal lymph nodes. Rarely, it may present with an asymptomatic large mediastinal mass. Only 20% of the patients experience B symptoms (night sweats, fever, weight loss). Increased serum LDH is also seen in 20% of the patients. Usually, FL only involves bone marrow and lymphoid organs

The disease is usually indolent with a favorable prognosis. Marrow involvement occurs in most of the cases (>50%); the paratrabecular pattern of infiltration is the most common pattern of bone marrow infiltration. Some examples show lymphocytosis with atypical forms that show deeply cleft nuclei. Spleen infiltration presents as lymphocyte aggregates in the white pulp. There are some subtypes of FL, such as double-hit follicular lymphoma (MYC and BCL2 translocations) and low-grade FL with a high proliferation index that presents with low-grade morphology and a relatively aggressive course; more research on these and other rare subtypes is underway
