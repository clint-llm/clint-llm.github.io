Immuno-excitotoxicity plays a central role in the pathogenesis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy wherein repeatedly primed microglia, following a repetitive head injury, fail to switch from a neuro-destructive mode to a reparative mode, thereby attenuating the inflammatory insult to the brain by providing a favorable milieu amidst glutamate toxicity.

Repetitive head injury, owing to axonal degeneration and microtubular disintegration, leads to tau oligomerization which later transforms to neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) thereby affecting neuronal crosstalk and networking. Such a process eventually leads to tau propagation thereby activating inflammatory cascades and ultimately hampering blood-brain barrier permeability.
