Currently, FDG PET/CT does not have a role in screening for breast cancer. Studies have found FDG PET/CT to be most clinically useful in staging recurrent or metastatic breast cancer in addition to the evaluation of the response of locally advanced breast cancer during neoadjuvant and post-treatment.Â Currently, FDG is the main radiotracer utilized in clinical practice though studies have found 18F-Fluoroestradiol to be used in imaging estrogen receptor expression.

PET/CT for staging replaces CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis plus bone scan to assess metastatic disease and is indicated per NCCN guidelines. Given the sensitivity of PET to be superior to that of CT in the detection of nodal disease, it may be beneficial in the staging and restaging of locally recurrent disease. Further, in known breast cancer patients with rising tumor marker levels, FDG PET allows a more accurate diagnosis of metastatic disease when compared to conventional imaging, with PET/CT having a sensitivity of 90%.
