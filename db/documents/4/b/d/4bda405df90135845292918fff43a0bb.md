Myopia has become a concern for public health. The growing incidence of myopia can be attributed to reduced outdoor activities, increased screen time, and prolonged near-vision work, especially during the COVID (coronavirus disease) pandemic.

Myopia is more prevalent in Asian children than in European countries, which report a lower prevalence of myopia (17.8-23.5%).
