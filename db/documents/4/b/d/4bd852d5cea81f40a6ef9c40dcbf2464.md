Diphenhydramine, which is available as an over-the-counter medication, is a first-generation antihistamine that is used in a variety of conditions to treat and prevent dystonias, insomnia, pruritis, urticaria, vertigo, and motion sickness. It also possesses local anesthetic properties for those patients who have allergies to other, more commonly used local anesthetics; however, this is an off-label use of the medication. Additional off-label use is for the treatment of oral mucositis. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of diphenhydramine, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients

**Objectives:**
- Explain the mechanisms of action for diphenhydramine.
- Identify the approved and off-label indications for diphenhydramine use.
- Review the possible adverse events associated with diphenhydramine.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients where diphenhydramine can play a role in treatment.
