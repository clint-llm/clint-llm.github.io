Congenital rubella syndrome is a global public health concern with more than 100,000 cases reported annually worldwide. Natural rubella infection during pregnancy is one of the few known causes of autism.

Before the rubella vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1969, rubella was a common disease that occurred primarily among young children. However, rubella was eliminated from the United States in 2004. Since elimination, fewer than 10 cases have been reported annually in the United States, and most cases were imported from outside the country.

Rubella continues to be a commonly transmitted infection in many parts of the world. Many rubella cases are not recognized, as the rash resembles many other illnesses and up to half of all infections may be subclinical.

Humans are the only source of infection. Transmission is through direct or droplet contact from nasopharyngeal secretions. Once inhaled, the virus replicates in the respiratory mucosa and cervical lymph nodes before reaching the target organs via systemic circulation. The infectious period extends approximately 8 days before to 8 days after the rash onset.

Maternal rubella during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, fetal death or congenital rubella syndrome.
