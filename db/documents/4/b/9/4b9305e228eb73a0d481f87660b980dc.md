**Incidence and Prevalence**

Generalized pustular psoriasis is rare. The annual incidence and prevalence in a French population have been estimated at least 0.64 and 1.76 per million, respectively. The prevalence in Japan has been estimated at 7.46 per million.

**Age at Onset**

The incidence peaks between 40 and 59 years of age, but infantile and juvenile cases are also reported. The age at onset tends to be earlier in those with pure generalized pustular psoriasis without plaque psoriasis.

**Gender**

In some published series, women outnumber men in a ratio of about 2 to 1, but this is not consistent in all cohorts.

**Associated Diseases**

Inflammatory polyarthritis is common. In one series, one-third of patients were eventually affected. The metabolic syndrome is also frequently associated; in one large series, the reported co-morbidities included obesity (43%), hypertension (26%), dyslipidemia (26%), and diabetes (24%).
