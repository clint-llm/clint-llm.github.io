The umbilical cord is considered both the physical and emotional attachment between mother and fetus. This structure allows for the transfer of oxygen and nutrients from the maternal circulation into fetal circulation while simultaneously removing waste products from fetal circulation to be eliminated maternally. On the other hand, mothers associate an emotional connection to the fetus through the cord. It may merit consideration as the route of love and care during pregnancy. Thus, some poets call it the string of life.

The umbilical cord is a bundle of blood vessels that develops during the early stages of embryological development. It is enclosed inside a tubular sheath of amnion and consists of two paired umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein. During development, the umbilical arteries have a vital function of carrying deoxygenated blood away from the fetus to the placenta.
