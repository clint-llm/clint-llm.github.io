The diagnosis of BPES is mainly clinical. Physical exam features include:

- **Blepharophimosis**. Horizontal shortening of the palpebral fissure. The normal horizontal palpebral fissure measures 25-30 mm, but in BPES, the palpebral fissure measures 20Â to 22 mm.

- **Ptosis**. Upper eyelid droopiness develops from bilateral dysplasia of the levator palpebral superioris muscle, resulting in poor levator function and bilateral ptosis.

- **Epicanthus inverus**. Skin fold arising from the medial lower eyelid and running inward and upward to the upper eyelid. This is always bilateral; the caruncle and plica semilunaris beneath have a hypoplastic appearance.

- **Telecanthus**. The boney walls of the orbit are unaffected in BPES. The medial canthal tendons are elongated, which causes a widened intercanthal distance with normal interpupillary distance.

There are two clinical types of BPES.

- **BPES type I**is characterized by blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus, telecanthus, and premature ovarian failure.

- **BPES type II**is characterized by the same classic four findings without premature ovarian failure.

Numerous other coexisting deformities, as well as compensatory responses, have been reported. Craniofacial malformations include thin and short upper eyelid skin with a margin that has an S-shape, while the lower margin has a concavity downward, with or without slight ectropion.

Lacrimal drainage apparatus abnormalities include lateral displacement of the lower punctum, canaliculi stenosis, and horizontal canaliculi elongation.

Individuals compensate for ptosis by adopting a chin-up head position and constantly contracting their frontalis muscles. The eyebrows can become more prominent and arched, giving patients a constantly surprised look.
