Gas distribution in the extraluminal space is a multifactorial process. There are three hypotheses of pathogenesis labeled mechanical, pulmonary, and bacterial theories. The mechanical theory hypothesizes that an increase in intraluminal pressure may lead to mucosal damage. Surgical complications and endoscopies can cause blunt trauma, forcing gas from the gastrointestinal cavity into extraluminal space. Gas transmits through the tissue layers and propagates via peristalsis. Lung diseases such as asthma, interstitial pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can cause alveolar rupture that may release gas into the mesenteric vasculature. The pulmonary theory states that gas can propagate caudally into the retroperitoneum and mesentery from the mediastinum.

It is hypothesized that gas migrates through the mediastinal vessels into the mesentery. Finally, the bacterial theory states gas-producing bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Clostridia species can invade the intraluminal compartments, which is supported by the decrease in gas after antimicrobial drug therapy and proximity of the gas cysts near blood vessels. In neonates, pneumatosis intestinalis is usually a radiographic sign of necrotizing enterocolitis. Risk factors include prematurity, low birth weight, and formula diet.
