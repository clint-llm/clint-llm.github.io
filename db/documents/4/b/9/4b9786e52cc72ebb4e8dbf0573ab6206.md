Although the underlying etiology of Crohn disease remains fundamentally unknown, the largely accepted theory involves exposure to “triggers” (i.e., microbial, environmental, immunological) in a genetically susceptible person. The chronic inflammatory component of Crohn disease is likely driven by altered activation of both Th1 and Th17 immune pathways with elevated levels of interleukins 23 and 17. Polymorphisms of the NOD2/CARD15 genes may further affect the innate immune response. Interestingly, patients with an altered TRAF3IP2 gene may be predisposed to developing cutaneous involvement of their Crohn disease.

Specific lesions: lesions have histopathological findings consistent with Crohn disease on biopsy. This may be further subcategorized to the following:

- Cutaneous lesion occurring due to a direct extension of bowel disease to the skin

- Metastatic Crohn disease: skin lesions with characteristic findings of Crohn disease on biopsy, but at sites distant from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (noncontiguous).

Reactive lesions: inflammatory lesions that do not share the same histopathological findings.

Associated lesions: likely develop due to shared HLA-gene types or secondary to a chronic inflammatory response.

A fourth category is suggested by some authors and encompasses the cutaneous manifestations that may be induced by the treatment of Crohn disease, particularly with anti-TNF therapy.
