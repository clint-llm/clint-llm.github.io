This device has given people once deemed deaf, the ability to hear once again, which is a profound medical accomplishment. All age ranges may benefit from this device, which impacts the patients differently at different stages of life. In the elderly population, patients with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss have been shown to lead to dementia at an earlier age compared to peers. The social isolation associated with acquired hearing loss in elderly individuals, the significant decline in quality of life, and increases in emotional handicaps are risk factors leading to cognitive decline which show improvement with cochlear implants for appropriately selected patients.

In prelingually deaf individuals (primarily children) the ability to develop speech is drastically improved, and they may not be required to learn alternative forms of communication such as sign language. Disclaimer, there is nothing wrong with patients who need or choose to use alternative forms of communication, and their communities should be respected, as this can aid in patient integration into regular classroom environments. Although educational costs for all implanted patients remain increased compared to children without hearing impairment, the ultimate achievement of educational independence for most implanted children produces net savings that range from $30000 to $100000 per child, including the costs associated with initial cochlear implantation and postoperative rehabilitation.
