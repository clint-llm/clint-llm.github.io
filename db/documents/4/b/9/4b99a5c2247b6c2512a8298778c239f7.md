Histopathological examination of skin biopsies reveals normal epidermis without atrophy, follicular plugging, basal vacuolar change, or basement membrane thickening. There are dense superficial and deep perivascular and periadnexal CD8+ T cell lymphocytes infiltrates within the dermis that sometimes extends into the subcutaneous tissue and can also be perifollicular. While T cells are noted to be more peripheral, B cells expressing follicular center differentiation are found close to superficial vessels.

Plasmacytoid monocytes, also called plasmacytoid dendritic cells, are larger than lymphocytes with a pale nucleus and a relatively large single nucleolus. These cells are usually scattered throughout the dermis. When eruptions are present, there is also an increase in circulating immune complexes, which typically normalize with the resolution of the eruption. There is also a depressed natural killer cell cytolytic function.
