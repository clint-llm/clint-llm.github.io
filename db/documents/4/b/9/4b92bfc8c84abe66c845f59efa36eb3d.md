A nerve block should be performed in the following steps:

- Place the probe in the elbow crease over the proximal radius.

- Identify the radius, with pronator teres lying medially.

- Identify the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) medial to pronator teres.

- The median nerve should be easily identifiable as a hyperechoic structure with a honeycomb appearance between FDS and FDP.

- Insert a block needle in-plane and parallel to the probe surface. Ensure that the needle tip is visible at all times.

- Aim the needle tip at the fascial plane between FDS and FDP.

- Aspirate to confirm the needle tip is not within a blood vessel.

- InjectÂ a small amount of local anesthetic to confirm needle tip placement.

- The needle tip may need to be advanced, or withdrawn slightly for optimal placement in the fascial plane, so that spread of local anesthetic around the nerve is achieved.

- Once injectate is confirmed to be within the fascial plane containing the median nerve, continue aspiration followed by incremental injection of 1 mL to 2 mL of a local anesthetic until the satisfactory spread has occurred.
