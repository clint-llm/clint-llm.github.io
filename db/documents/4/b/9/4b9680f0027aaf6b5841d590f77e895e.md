Nocardia is ubiquitous in the environment and can cause a variety of infections. However, the clinical presentation and outcomes do vary depending on the immune status and patient comorbidity.

Given the severity and rarity of nocardial infections in immunocompromised patients and the high rate of dissemination and abscess formation of the bacterium, it is essential to utilize an interprofessional approach toward evaluation and treatment to yield the best results. Some examples of specialties that should be involved in the decision-making process to determine optimal treatment include primary care physicians, infectious diseases specialists, general, neurological, and/or cardiothoracic surgeons, pulmonologists, neurologists, critical care physicians, and/or ophthalmologists. Nurses need to be familiar with the disease process to coordinate patient education. Pharmacists need to be involved in the selection and maintenance of drug therapy. Over the past decade, it has become clear that Nocardia has started to develop resistance to many of the common antibiotics like the cephalosporins and sulfonamide. Because of the potential resistance to sulfonamides, it is important to start treatment based on drug susceptibility results.

**Outcomes**

There are only small cases series on outcomes of Nocardia treatment. Individuals with intact immunity usually have a good outcome, but transplant patients or those with HIV who are immunosuppressed have a guarded prognosis. The management of a transplant patient requires an interprofessional approach if high morbidity and mortality is to be avoided.
