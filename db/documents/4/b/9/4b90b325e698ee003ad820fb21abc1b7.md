In 1965 thallium was banned from United States households and, subsequently, banned commercially in 1975. Due to intoxication often mimicking other diseases, ill patients may go unnoticed. More current uses of thallium are in the semiconductor and optical industries. Thallium is used in rat poison and ant killer, and because it is both odorless and tasteless, it has become an accidental intoxication as well as a criminal poison in some cases. To this day, thallium is seen in rodenticide and insecticide in other countries. In Africa, thallium has been used as a pesticide, which has led to food contamination. Chinese herbal medications also have been contaminated. Intoxication occurs by cumulative intake through the skin, respiratory, and gastrointestinal tracts. Accidental snorting by cocaine abusers, accidental injection by heroin users, as well as skin absorption through protective gloves have been reported.
