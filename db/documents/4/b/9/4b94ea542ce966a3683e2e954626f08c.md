Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were introduced in the late 1950s for the treatment of depression. However, with the advent of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other new antidepressants, the use of TCAs has become limited, although it is still used to treat depression that has not responded to treatment with less toxic agents. In adults, TCAs are also used in migraine headache prophylaxis, treatment of neuralgic pain, including the pain associated with Ciguatera poisoning, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In children, TCAs have been used to treat nocturnal enuresis. Despite the current limited use of TCAs, the curve for TCA-overdose associated hospitalization and fatality is on the rise.
