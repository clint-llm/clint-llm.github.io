One of the advantages of this technique is that the requirement of personnel (in terms of the number of surgeon(s) and paramedical staff), as well as the amount of their prior experience to perform a proper skin grafting by Jodhpur technique, are both minimal.

A single dermatology surgeon with exposure to 2 or 3 surgeries and preferably at least one-time assistance as a co-surgeon with a senior dermatology surgeon experienced and conversant with the Jodhpur technique is sufficient as the primary and the only required doctor. And although the availability of a general minor procedure room or minor operating theater staff nurse/technician helps expedite the completion of the surgery, the technique has been undertaken several times by the authors and their students single-handedly. Of course, in the latter scenario, it is expected that the surgical nurse/technician would have ensured the availability of all material and kept them sterile for the surgeon's use.
