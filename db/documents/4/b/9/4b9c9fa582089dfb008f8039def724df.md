The posterior descending artery, as with any coronary artery, is subject to possible stenosis or occlusion secondary to atheromatous plaque accumulation or thrombosis. The result of stenosis to the posterior descending artery would be decreased perfusion or even infarction of the posterior third of the interventricular septum, depending on the severity. Therefore, the location of the possible infarction or reduced perfusion is dependent on the cardiac dominance of the individual. For example, a patient that is left heart dominant and suffering from severe stenosis of the proximal left main coronary artery may suffer infarction of the posterior interventricular septum. However, this would not be true in a patient with codominant coronary circulation. A stenotic lesion to the proximal left main coronary artery would result in decreased perfusion to the posterior interventricular septum, but it would still receive blood via the right coronary artery, reducing the risk of an infarct.

In right dominant coronary circulation, the posterior descending artery serves as a collateral vessel to the basal left anterior descending artery through septal perforators,
