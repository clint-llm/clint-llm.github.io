Fuchs uveitis syndrome (FUS) is a chronic, typically unilateral mild anterior uveitis that was first described by Ernst Fuchs in 1906. FUS is also referred to as Fuchs heterochromic uveitis and Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis. The exact etiology of FUS is unknown. When first described, Fuchs had many theories about what caused this unique pathology; however, many of these have been largely disproven over the years, with the infectious theory remaining one of the more probable causes. The patient population demographics vary by geographic location, with different incidence rates, age of symptom presentation, and rates of complications depending on the subpopulation studied. Most patients with FUS experience changes in vision mainly due to secondary complications, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Treatment of these complications leads to a good prognosis.

Non-hereditary heterochromia, present in about 13.9% of patients with FUS, is caused by anterior iris stromal atrophy.

This article will discuss the etiology, epidemiology, proposed pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of FUS and its complications.
