The 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (finasteride and dutasteride) are a class of medication used in the management and treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and androgenic alopecia (male pattern hair loss). This activity outlines the indications, action, and contraindications for the 5-alpha reductase inhibitors as valuable agents in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, and relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the healthcare team in the management of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action and administration of the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.
- Describe the adverse effects and contraindications of the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.
- Review the appropriate monitoring and toxicity of the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.
- Summarize some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor use and improve outcomes.
