The somatic branches from the stellate ganglion are the gray rami communicantesÂ which provide sympathetic fibers to the anterior rami of the C7, C8, and T1.

The visceral branches include the inferior cardiac nerve; this is the contribution of this ganglion to the cardiac plexus in the thorax.

It gives off sympathetic nerve branches to the brachial plexus, which lies laterally, as well as tributaries to the subclavian and vertebral arteries and the brachiocephalic trunk.
