PCR is used in basic and biomedical sciences which has substantial laboratory and clinical significance due to its high sensitivity, specificity, and rapidity.

Rapid detection of microbial pathogens via rapid real-time PCR allows for clinicians to promptly administer tailored treatment thus, reducing hospitalizations, preventing inappropriate administration of antibiotics, in turn, antibiotic resistance.

Additional microbial pathogens that are infamous for causing food-borne related illnesses such as group B streptococci, mycobacterium species, Bacteroides vulgatus, and escherichia coli (e.coli) can also be identified via real-time PCR testing.

PCR is also used to study the histopathology of various viral and cellular genes to comprehend and diagnose malignant diseases in humans.
