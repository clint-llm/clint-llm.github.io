Undergoing cardiac catheterization is a common yet complicated procedure in which complications can be life-threatening. As orbital atherectomy (OA) is still a relatively new procedure, no guidelines are written that incorporate its use by the major governing bodies in cardiology. To help optimize outcomes, especially when implementing a new procedure, utilizing an interprofessional healthcare team is paramount. While the interventional cardiologist is significantly involved when the patient is in the catheterization laboratory, an entire team is necessary from beginning to end to help minimize poor outcomes.

Based on the 2016 SCAI expert consensus statement for best practices in the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL), a multidisciplinary team made up a cardiologist, cardiac trainees, cardiothoracic surgeons, an anesthesia provider for cases involving more than moderate sedation, provider assistants/nurse practitioners, registered nurses, andÂ catheterization laboratory technicians are required to help ensure the success of any procedure.

With further complexities in patient care, incorporating medical teams from multiple disciplines will be essential to ensure the best care possible and improve outcomes for patients. The Heart Team has well exemplified this, first described by Holmes et al., and has now been included in the European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines.
