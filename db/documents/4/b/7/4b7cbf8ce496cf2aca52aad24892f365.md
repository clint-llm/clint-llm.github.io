The most common diagnostic testing performed is wet prep microscopy. Trichomonads are motile organisms with flagella and can be seen moving in the preparation when viewed with a microscope. This test has been shown to be only 40% - 60% sensitive but is typically the most common testing method used due to convenience and low cost.

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are gaining favor when testing for Trichomonas vaginalis. They have become the gold standard when testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Many of the NAATs available have been shown to have greater than 90% sensitivity and specificity when testing for Trichomonas vaginalis.

Before NAATs and other point-of-care options were developed, the gold standard was a culture when testing for Trichomonas vaginalis with a negative wet prep and a symptomatic patient.

The vaginal pH is usually more than 4.5 in the presence of trichomoniasis, but this is not a specific finding. The whiff test is done by adding drops of potassium hydroxide to a sample of vaginal discharge. This generates a fishy smell.
