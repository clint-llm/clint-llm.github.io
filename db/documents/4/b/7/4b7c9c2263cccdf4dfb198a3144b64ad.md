The etiology of UVCP varies with geography and time. Data obtained from 1985 through 1995 in one of the largest North American case series,

Malignancy is the most worrisome cause of UVCP and is most commonly seen in primary and metastatic lung and laryngeal carcinoma, with thyroid and central nervous system (CNS) cancers less frequently seen.

Iatrogenic injury has traditionally been attributed to thyroidectomy operations, the likelihood of which increases when there is aberrant anatomy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

Traumatic UVCP is common but not well understood, with proposed mechanisms of injury including direct recurrent laryngeal nerve trauma and arytenoid dislocation.

There are a host of diseases that may present as a less common cause of UVCP. Therefore, careful history and examination instead of extensive serological testing, will help guide diagnosis. Such causes can include neurological (stroke, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis), inflammatory (sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus), and infectious (Varicella Zoster, Lyme disease) conditions.

Although common, idiopathic paralysis is poorly understood and is thought to be secondary to viral or inflammatory disease. Idiopathic disease should only be diagnosed when all other causes have been excluded.
