Patients with Monteggia fractures frequently present to the emergency room, but the diagnosis of these fractures is not simple. When the diagnosis is missed, these fractures carry very high morbidity. Hence the emergency department physician, nurse practitioner or nurse provider should refer these patients to an orthopedic surgeon ASAP. Initial management for a suspected fracture includes rest, ice, immobilization, and elevation. In most circumstances, closed reduction should be attempted. If the annular ligament is trapped within the joint, reduction may be unobtainable. Patients with a Monteggia fracture should be placed in a sugar-tong splint with urgent referral to an orthopedist.

All Monteggia fractures are considered unstable and require intervention. Emergent orthopedic consultation is essential for open fractures and vascular compromise. Urgent orthopedic consultation is indicated for neurologic deficits without vascular compromise.

Even after treatment, the outcomes of patients with Monteggia fractures are guarded. Chronic pain and limited range of motion are common complaints.
