Treatment of a cultural syndrome is a diagnostic challenge for any clinician. Gathering a detailed history and understanding the patient and the family's views and opinions about the presenting problems assists in developing insight into the dynamics of the patient's world and helps the clinician in developing a treatment plan that is acceptable and conducive to the patient's well being. This approach also facilitates better communication between patient and clinician and leads to improved outcomes in treatment.

Irrespective of their particular role in the health care team, each member must be aware of these cultural differences when dealing with patients and report to the team leader as concerns arise. As one member of the team learns about a cultural norm that applies to a patient, they should document it for the benefit of other members; this prevents wasted time for each team member to have to find out the same information, and also can avoid indelicate situations that may occur as each provider interacts with the patient for the first time. Physicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare team personnel all bear a responsibility to not only understand and respect these cultural differences but also to share them with other providers. This type of collaborative communication will streamline the healthcare delivery process and better drive optimal outcomes for patients with cultural diversity concerns. [Level V]
