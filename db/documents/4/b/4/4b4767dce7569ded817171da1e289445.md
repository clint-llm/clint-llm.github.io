The warm heart trial

Potential disadvantages of warm blood cardioplegia include:

- Maldistribution of cardioplegic solution

- Impaired visualization of the distal coronary anastomosis

- Increased requirement of alpha agonists due to vasodilation

- Warm heart surgeries are technically challenging

- Increased incidence of neurological injury/perioperative strokes

- More frequent dosing required when employing the intermittent WBC technique

- Aggravation of ischemia-reperfusion injury with intermittent perfusion of WBC

- Inadequate myocardial protection, especially in procedures requiring long periods of aortic cross-clamping
