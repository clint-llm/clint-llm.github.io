Etomidate is contraindicated in any patient with a known hypersensitivity reaction.

**Adrenal Suppression**: Etomidate is a commonly used sedative during rapid sequence intubation (RSI). In some studies, septic patients have an increased risk of developing adrenal suppression, associated with increased mortality.

**Pediatric Neurotoxicity:**Published preclinical studies demonstrate that administering anesthetic and sedation drugs that potentiate GABA activity and block NMDA receptors increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in cognitive deficits.
