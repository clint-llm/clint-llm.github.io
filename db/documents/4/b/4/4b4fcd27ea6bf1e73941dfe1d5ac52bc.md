Clinicians should check blood pressure and vitals before initiating therapy and routinely after that. Monitor for changes in suicidal ideation, especially when starting treatment, altering the dose, and after discontinuation of therapy. Monitor for worsening depression, behavioral changes such as mania, and withdrawal symptoms from abrupt discontinuation. Patients should be monitored for abnormal bleeding as duloxetine may impair platelet aggregation. Caution should be exercised when using anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications along with duloxetine therapy. Laboratory workup should include monitoring serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen(BUN), transaminase levels, blood glucose levels, and HgbA1c in diabetic patients. Sodium levels require follow-up when prescribing duloxetine in the geriatric population.
