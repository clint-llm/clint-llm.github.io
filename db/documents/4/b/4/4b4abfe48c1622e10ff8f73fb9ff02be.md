A study examining nearly ninety veterans in a Veterans Affairs medical center reviewed the role of physical activity as a part of a self-guided cannabis cessation program, demonstrating that among primarily male veterans with a mean age of nearly 51 years old, after being matched for age, medical and psychiatric conditions, and psychiatric assessment for stated desire to halt cannabis use, participants that performed lower levels of physical activity, measured in metabolic equivalents (METS) had more significant risks for relapsing to cannabis in the first four days after cessation, a particularly important period for acute withdrawal.

The ACCENT trial (Achieving Cannabis Cessation: Evaluating N-Acetylcysteine Treatment), which began enrollment in 2014 and is now in Phase 3 under the purview of UCLA, which examined the use of N-Acetylcysteine as a potential tool for cannabis cessation in adult participants. Its material is presently undergoing review and is unpublished at this time.
