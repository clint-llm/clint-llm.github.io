The delusional disorder, if left untreated, might lead to depression, often as a consequence of difficulties associated with the delusions. Delusions also can lead to violence or legal issues; for instance, stalking or harassing the object of delusion, could lead to arrest. Further, patients suffering from this disorder can become alienated from others, particularly if their delusions interfere with their social ties.
