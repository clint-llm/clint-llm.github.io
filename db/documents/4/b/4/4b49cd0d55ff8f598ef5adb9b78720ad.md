Sulfur mustard is proposed to exert its effects on the cell through a number of pathways. Its absorption leads to increase in free radicals and lipid peroxidation, ultimately causing oxidative cellular injury and apoptosis. In one proposed mechanism, sulfur mustard alkylates deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) leading to activation of the intracellular repair enzyme poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP). This exhausts intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) leading to decreased glycolysis, protease release, and cell injury. Upon cell death, proteases are released from the cell, causing dermal-epidermal separation as blisters. In another proposed mechanism, sulfur mustard inactivates glutathione, which leaves the cell vulnerable to oxidative injury and leads to increased intracellular accumulation of calcium and ultimately cell death. The etiology of acute and delayed toxicity of sulfur mustard exposure is not fully elucidated.
