Electrocardiograms are the most readily available method of analyzing the overall electrical activity of the heart. P wave corresponds to atrial depolarization, and the QRS complex corresponds to ventricular depolarization (Phase 0). The QRS complex masks atrial repolarization, but the T wave allows visualization of ventricular repolarization. The peak of the T wave corresponds to the repolarization of the shortest epicardial action potential while the end of the T wave corresponds to the repolarization of the M cell with the most prolonged action potential duration.

QT interval is the time from starting of the QRS wave to the end of the T wave. It represents one cycle of ventricular electrical activity from the start of ventricular depolarization to the end of ventricular repolarization. Changes in this interval can signify pathologies, such as long QT and short QT syndromes. Further testing modalities include electrophysiology tests, which involve trained personnel inserting electrodes into a patient's body through a catheter, manipulating the electrodes with magnets, and measuring the heart's electrical activity. Other methods of testing to consider would include Holter monitors, event monitors, and implantable loop recorders. These are all different means of monitoring heart rhythm over extended periods in the ambulatory setting.
