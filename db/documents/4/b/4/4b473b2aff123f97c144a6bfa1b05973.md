Herpangina is a self-limited illness, and the treatment is primarily supportive. The management can be described as general treatment, symptomatic treatment, and antiviral treatment.

**General**

Patients should be isolated in well-aerated and clean rooms to prevent cross-infection. The general management includes a healthy diet and adequate hydration. The patient’s diet should be comprised of light, liquid, or semi-liquid foods with adequate calories and should avoid hot, spicy, and/or irritating foods. Emphasis should be placed on oral care, and it is recommended that patients rinse their mouths with normal saline after meals. Younger children can have their mouths wiped with normal saline. If normal saline is unavailable, salted water can be considered.

**Symptomatic**

High-grade fever is the most common symptom reported for herpangina. For patients whose temperature exceeds greater than 101.3 F (38.5 C), antipyretics such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can be considered. The dosage, timing, and duration depend on the patient’s age and symptoms and are administered according to the treating physician’s recommendation. Several physical cooling options can be considered, including cool compresses of the forehead, fever cooling patches, or sleeping with an ice pack under the head. Adequate hydration should be ensured while treating with these drugs. Topical therapies containing lidocaine or diphenhydramine are not generally recommended for symptomatic treatment of the oral lesions in herpangina. This is due to the risks of toxicity associated with these medications and the lack of adequate trials.

**Antiviral**

No specific antiviral drugs are currently available for the treatment of herpangina. Interferon-alpha spray, however, has shown some promising effects. Local administration of the drug can potentially have some local immunomodulatory and antiviral effects, as interferon-alpha plays a key role in maintaining anti-infection immunity for the mucosa.
