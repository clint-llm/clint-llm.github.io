Although the exact function of the K-complex during sleep is not precisely known, there are a few theories. In more recent times, it has been said to have seemingly contrasting functions when it comes to sleep promotion and arousal. Some of its proposed functions are as follows.

- Maintenance of sleep: During sleep, certain stimuli can be dangerous and require arousal from sleep while others are harmless. The K-complexes function to suppress cortical activity and arousal to maintain sleep when encountered with a stimulus that the brain evaluates as harmless.

- Arousal from sleep: When the brain interprets a particular stimulus as potentially dangerous, the K-complex has also shown to help in arousal from sleep.

- Memory consolidation: An important proposed function of sleep is to aid in the conversion of short term memory into the long term. The ‘down-state’ produced by the K-complex aids in the function of memory consolidation.

- Maintenance of synapse homeostasis: The K-complex creates a sort of ‘reboot’ for the neural connections to keep them in homeostasis.
