- There is an FDA-mandated warning for severe psychiatric symptoms, including suicidal ideation, as there are reports of such adverse outcomes with varenicline. Patients taking varenicline should have closer therapeutic supervision to monitor these behavioral symptoms. It is not a contraindication to use varenicline in patients with underlying psychiatric illnesses; however, clinicians should monitor symptoms for further deterioration. Patients exhibiting worsening psychiatric behaviors or suicidal ideation should promptly stop varenicline therapy.

- Serious hypersensitivity reactions or skin reactions to varenicline may occur, and patients exhibiting Stevens-Johnson syndrome or erythema multiforme should be advised not to take varenicline.

- Take caution and monitor closely if the patient has a history of renal impairment, psychiatric disorder, or seizure disorder.
