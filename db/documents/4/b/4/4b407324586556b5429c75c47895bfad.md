Always utilize the facility policy for specific instructions. It is essential to be aware of what constitutes a clear liquid item and what is not. Providing clear communication with the healthcare team is vital, especially with special circumstances such as patients with diabetes or dysphagia. This will include the clinicians (including mid-level practitioners), dieticians, nurses, and in some cases, pharmacists. Patient education should include not only what is the clear liquid diet but also why they are on this diet. Keep in mind the transition to solid foods and reassess readiness regularly.
