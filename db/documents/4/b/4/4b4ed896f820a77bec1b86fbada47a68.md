Silver sulfadiazine is considered to be extremely safe; however, there should be limitations to its use. This medication slows re-epithelization and should stop once there is visible evidence of healing.

Hematologic effects are the most common side effects, including agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, and leukopenia. Practitioners should follow laboratory screening recommendations and inquire about symptoms of infection and or anemia during patient encounters.

Dermatologic reactions, including erythema multiforme, pruritis, skin discoloration, skin photosensitivity, rash, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have all been reported. Patients who have previously experienced a rash in response to silver sulfadiazine should not use this medication as this can be a sign of an allergy.

It is unknown whether patients with sulfonamide allergies are at risk for cross-reaction to silver sulfadiazine, but product labeling indicates that those patients should avoid use if their previous reaction to sulfonamides has been severe.
