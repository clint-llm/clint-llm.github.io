The Krebs cycle, by itself, does not require the presence of oxygen; this element is necessary for the last stage of aerobic cellular respiration, i.e., oxidative phosphorylation.

Organic molecules endowed with energy (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins) are split in previous reactions. Before entering the Krebs cycle, they transform into acetyl-CoA, a molecule formed by an acetyl group (CH3CO-) and by an acyl transporter called coenzyme A.

However, the preferred source of acetyl-CoA remains glycolysis. The acetyl group is then oxidized, and the energy obtained is used for the synthesis of ATP in cooperation with oxidative phosphorylation. In eukaryotes, the Krebs cycle reactions take place in the mitochondrial matrix, a dense solution that surrounds the mitochondria crests: in addition to water, the matrix contains all the enzymes necessary for the biochemical reactions of the cycle, coenzymes, and phosphates.The Krebs cycle is controlled and regulated by the availability of the NAD+ and FAD substrates, while high concentrations of NADH inhibit it.
