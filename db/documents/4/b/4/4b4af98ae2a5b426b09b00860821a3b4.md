Untreated severe classic galactosemia is a life-threatening disorder. Severely ill infants with galactosemia (e.g., those with sepsis, coagulopathy, liver dysfunction) may develop permanent liver, brain, and/or eye damage (although cataracts are often completely reversible).

Most patients with severe galactosemia often do not survive the newborn period if treatment is not initiated.
