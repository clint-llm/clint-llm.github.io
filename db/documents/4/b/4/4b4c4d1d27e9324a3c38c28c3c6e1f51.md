Sometimes, certain underlying medical and physical conditions can prevent patients from effectively participating in the rehabilitation program.Â Some examples include angina pectoris, decompensated congestive health failure, acute cor-pulmonale, inability to perform exercises due to severe orthopedic impairments, and severe cognitive deficits. Individualized evaluation and plan for patients with potential roadblocks to pulmonary rehabilitation are essential.
