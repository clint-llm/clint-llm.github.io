Dipyridamole is an antiplatelet agent used in secondary prophylaxis against stroke and as an adjunctive agent with warfarin post mechanical valve replacement. It is also used in the evaluation of coronary artery disease during a pharmacologic stress test. This activity illustrates the indications, action, and contraindications for dipyridamole as a valuable agent in preventing thromboembolic events in those with mechanical valves and the importance of use for pharmacologic stress testing. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors pertinent to members of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action for the administration of dipyridamole.
- Describe the possible adverse effects of dipyridamole.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for patients using dipyridamole.
- Summarize some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication, especially in the administration of pharmacologic stress testing to improve outcomes and reduce adverse events.
