Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) occurs due to an abnormal hip development, which presents in infancy or early childhood with a spectrum ranging from dysplasia to dislocation of the hip joint.

Previously referred to as "congenital dislocation of the hip," the term developmental is preferred since not all are present or are identified at birth. Developmental will be more accurate as it explains the broad spectrum of abnormalities in the hip joint. Presentation varies from minor hip instability to frank dislocation. The exact etiology is still elusive. Multifactorial in nature, a combination of genetic, environmental, and mechanical factors plays a role. This article is focused on healthy babies with DDH, rather than genetic or syndromes which causes teratologic or neuromuscular dysplasia. Many genetic loci have been identified in familial cases.

Early diagnosis and treatment are rewarding to prevent residual DDH, which causes limp, and or early osteoarthritis.
