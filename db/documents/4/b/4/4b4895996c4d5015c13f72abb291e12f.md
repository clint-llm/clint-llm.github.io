Middle ear barotrauma is the most common complication of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This trauma is regularly seen in patients undergoing multiple treatments. Sinus barotrauma is the second most encountered complication with hyperbaric therapy. This condition typically occurs in patients with an upper respiratory infection or allergic rhinitis.

Patients can also experience pulmonary complications as a result of hyperbaric therapy. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity, which manifests as chest tightness, can occur in patients receiving multiple treatments.  Pulmonary barotrauma is serious, but unusual complication that can occur during hyperbaric therapy.

Central nervous system (CNS) oxygen toxicity is a rare and severe complication that manifests as a seizure. One retrospective study showed that out of 62,614 hyperbaric oxygen sessions with 2334 patients, only one patient experienced a seizure directly related to oxygen toxicity. The risk of this complication increases with hyperbaric exposure greater than 90 to 120 minutes and at any pressure greater than 2.8 ATA. This complication can be managed by decreasing the oxygen concentration of therapy and by administering anticonvulsive medication.
