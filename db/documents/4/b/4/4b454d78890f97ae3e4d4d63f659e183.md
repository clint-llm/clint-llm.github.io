Distinguishing reactive from malignant lymphocytosis can be challenging and may vary depending on age and other demographics. The following is a list of the most common etiologies.

- Infectious:

- Viral infections: 

- Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV): Infectious Mononucleosis (IM) is a classic example of viral infections associated with lymphocytosis. Acute IM is a disease characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, splenomegaly, and various hematologic manifestations, among which lymphocytosis is the most common and presents in up to two-thirds of cases.
- Cytomegalovirus (CMV): CMV can cause a disease indistinguishable from EBV IM. 
- Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV): Although chronic HIV infection resulted in lymphopenia and decreased CD4+ lymphocytes count, primary HIV infection can lead to an acute febrile mononucleosis-like illness with associated lymphocytosis. A negative heterophile test can help distinguish the two.
- Other Viruses: Influenza, hepatitis, mumps, measles, rubella, and human T Lymphocytic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), adenovirus, to name a few. 


- Bacterial Infections: Most of the acute bacterial infections will cause neutrophilia; however, notable exceptions include: 

- Bartonella
henselae: Bartonella henselae leads to cat scratch disease, a disease transmitted by scratch or bite from an infected cat, that leads mostly to self-limited lymphadenopathy, but can be associated with ocular or neurologic manifestations. Lymphocytes are large and atypical. 
- Bordetella Pertussis: Pertussis is characterized by increased lymphocytes that are small with a deeply cleaved nucleus, clinical correlation is needed to differentiate from some lymphoid malignancies that might share the morphologic appearance.  
- Other: Brucellosis, syphilis, malaria


- Parasitic Infections: 

- Toxoplasma Gondii: symptomatic toxoplasmosis occurs most commonly in immunocompromised hosts. Lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes is a hematologic hallmark of the disease, that can present as a mononucleosis-like illness.
- Other: Babesiosis


- Mycobacterial Tuberculosis

- Lymphoproliferative disorders: Lymphocytes tend to be monomorphic in malignant causes in contradiction to the pleomorphic lymphocytes in reactive causes. Some common etiologies are listed here:

- Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL): CLL is the most common leukemia in adult patients in the USA. Lymphocytes are over 5000 cells/microL per definition and are typically small mature looking with dense nuclei and compact chromatin, also called "soccer ball" cells. Numerous smudge cells resulting from damage during the preparation of peripheral blood smear slide are characteristic of patients diagnosed with CLL. 
- Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL): Bone marrow can have involvement in around 30% of cases, and peripheral blood lymphocytosis varies between different types.
- Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL): MCL is an uncommon NHL; however, it frequently correlates with lymphocytosis.
- Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL): The lymphocytosis is associated with anemia and thrombocytopenia. Typical lymphocytes in MZL have villous cytoplasmic projections. 
- Hairy Cell Leukemia: "hairy cells" have regular cytoplasmic projections through the entire periphery of the cell that may resemble "villous" cells; however, typical immunophenotype is different (discussed below). 
- Follicular Lymphoma (FL): FL cells are larger than typical normal lymphocytes but smaller than MCL cells. "Cleaved" lymphocytosis can occur, which refers to the cleft appearing nuclei. Other disorders with angulated or cleaved lymphocytes include pertussis and MCL as above in addition to Sezary Syndrome and Adult T cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL).
- Sezary Syndrome: It represents the leukemic phase of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Characteristic Sezary cells have cribriform nuclei with compact chromatin.


- ATLL: this is aggressive leukemia caused by HTLV-1. It is common in Japan, the Carribean, and the southeastern US. 
- Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia (LGL): T-LGL cells are typically large with multiple azurophilic granules, and the disease is associated with pancytopenia symptoms, splenomegaly, and Rheumatoid Arthritis. 
- Acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (ALL): It is associated with increased lymphoblasts rather than more mature lymphocytes.

- Drugs and drug hypersensitivity reactions: Certain medications such as allopurinol, carbamazepine, vancomycin, and sulfa drugs may have correlated drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and this can be related to lymphocytosis. The relatively new CLL medication Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor Ibrutinib has resulted in impressive responses; however, it correlates with the worsening of lymphocytosis upon initiation of the medication. It likely represents a redistribution of CLL cells from lymphoid tissues to the peripheral blood and does not indicate a suboptimal response to therapy.

- Monoclonal B Lymphocytosis (MBL): this refers to the presence of monoclonal B cells at a level less than 5000 cells/microL in the absence of features of lymphoproliferative disorders, splenomegaly or cytopenias. These B cells most commonly have the same phenotype of those seen in CLL (CLL-like); however, their phenotype may be different (atypical MBL).

- Congenital B cell Lymphocytosis: this is due to germline heterozygous missense mutation in CARD11, a scaffolding protein required for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-KB) in both B and T lymphocytes.

- Persistent B-cell polyclonal B-Lymphocytosis: It is a rare clinical entity described as polyclonal binucleated lymphocytes occurring predominantly in young smoker woman. Unlike CLL or MBL, lymphocytes are polyclonal with the expression of both kappa and lambda chains. It is associated with HLA DR-7 and IgM polyclonal gammopathy and exhibits a stable clinical and biological course.

- Stress: Severe and emergency medical conditions may correlate with transient lymphocytosis that would precede neutrophilia. Most patients had cardiac conditions, status epileptics, or epinephrine use.

- Asplenia: similar to other blood components, lymphocyte count, may increase post-splenectomy but typically stays stable for years.
