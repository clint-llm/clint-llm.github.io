The basic evaluation of an eye malignancy includes fundoscopic examination, fundus photography, and ocular ultrasound. Depending on the location of the malignancy, various imaging modalities can be used. If the orbit is involved, CT or MRI is the first step. If lymphatic involvement is suspected, then a PET scan is warranted, along with an MRI of the head and neck. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the suspected involved lymph nodes should be performed.
