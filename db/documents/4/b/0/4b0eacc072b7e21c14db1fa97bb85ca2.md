Identifying the E3 ligases substrate is critical to understand their implications in human malignancies and other diseases. Deregulation of E3-substrate interactions is often an indicator of many of these pathologies. Various assays were developed to identify the substrates of E3 ligases, such as shRNA- or CRISPR-Cas9-mediated screening and in vitro ubiquitination assay. Also, a genome-wide screening strategy called Global Protein Stability (GPS) profiling was recently developed to identify the previously unknown substrates of the E3 ligases. The GPS system made use of reporter proteins fused with hundreds of potential substrates independently. By inhibiting the ligase activity (causing ubiquitination not to occur), increased reporter activity shows that the identified substrates are accumulating. These results demonstrate the potential of these technologies as basic platforms for the global discovery of E3-substrate regulatory networks.
