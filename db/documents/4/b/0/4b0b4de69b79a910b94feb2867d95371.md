Advanced imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has a limited role in diagnosing radial tunnel syndrome as it is often negative. MRI is useful, however, to evaluate common locations of PIN entrapment and to identify other causes of compression such as tumors, ganglion cysts, or heterotopic ossification. Electrodiagnostic studies are also negative as the large myelinated fibers of the PIN are not affected.
