Oral health directly affects the overall health and quality of life of an individual. Studies have shown that patients with poor oral health have increased mortality and are more likely to develop respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus.

As a healthcare provider, it is important to discuss with patients the concept of proper oral hygiene and its importance in preventing dental caries, periodontal disease, halitosis, and gingivitis. Despite careful brushing and flossing, plaque buildup and tartar can form and must periodically be cleaned professionally. It is important to advise patients to brush twice a day to prevent the formation of plaque and tartar. Flossing should be done once per day, as it removes plaque from between the teeth and prevents periodontal disease.

The eruption and composition of teeth are influenced by body metabolism, endocrine function, genetics, and local factors.

Certain drugs and prescription medications can affect dentition, including changing the color, eroding the enamel, and causing dental caries. For example, medications that can lead to gingival hyperplasia include calcium channel blockers and phenytoin. Medications that can lead to oral inflammation (stomatitis) include inhaled corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and chemotherapy. Sugar-containing medications, including antacids and cough syrups, can lead to enamel erosion. Medications that can lead to dry mouth (xerostomia) include SSRIs, antipsychotics, diuretics, antihistamines, opioids, decongestants, and antihypertensives such as atenolol and clonidine.

In addition, research shows that if teeth are exposed to tetracycline at the time of tooth calcification and mineralization, tetracycline will bind calcium ions in the teeth. If this occurs before tooth eruption, the bound tetracycline will cause the teeth to erupt with an initial fluorescent yellow discoloration. Once the teeth have been exposed to light over a few months to years, tetracycline will oxidize, and the discoloration will change to a nonfluorescent brown or gray.

As previously mentioned, teeth play a functional role in speech, with the loss of these teeth affecting the formation of the fricative sound and, by extension, many other sounds. Another important concept is the vertical dimension of occlusion. A lack of teeth, or extreme wear and destruction of teeth, can cause the jaw to over-close, resulting in accentuated nasolabial folds and an aged appearance, which speaks to the cosmetic function of teeth. As the soft tissues of the face lose support, phonation, bolus creation, and swallowing can also be affected.

Of clinical importance to all medical specialties is the proper numbering of teeth. The numbering of teeth begins from right to left, 1-32, with the upper right third molar (wisdom tooth) being tooth number one. Moving from right to left, top to bottom, 1-16 involves the upper teeth. Tooth number 17 is the lower left third molar, then traveling from left to right, ending at tooth number 32, the bottom right third molar.
