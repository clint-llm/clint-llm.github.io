Placenta previa is the complete or partial covering of the internal os of the cervix with the placenta. It is a major risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage and can lead to morbidity and mortality of the mother and neonate. This situation prevents a safe vaginal delivery and requires the delivery of the neonate to be via cesarean delivery. Most cases are diagnosed early on in pregnancy via sonography and others may present to the emergency room with painless vaginal bleeding in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. The presence of placenta previa can also increase a woman's risk for placenta accreta spectrum (PAS). This spectrum of conditions includes placenta accreta, increta, and percreta. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with placenta previa. It also highlights the role of an interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition in order to improve outcomes for mother and fetus.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the risk factors for placenta previa.
- Describe the pathophysiology of placenta previa.
- Describe the management of patients with placenta previa and how this varies with gestational age, presentation, and stability of the patient.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination, collaboration, and communication amongst an interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care and improve outcomes for patients with placenta previa.
