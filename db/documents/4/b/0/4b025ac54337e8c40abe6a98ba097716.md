The genus Ehrlichia consists of several species of obligate intracellular gram-negative bacteria that infect humans and various other mammals via tick bite. Clinically, Ehrlichia infections share many symptoms and geographic distribution with rickettsial infections, and thus, one must also consider Ehrlichia infections when evaluating patients with flu-like illnesses in endemic areas.
