Hemoglobin (Hb) molecule is the combination of protein globin and nonprotein portion called haem and responsible for essentially transporting of the oxygen in the blood. Hemoglobin is composed of four subunits: two alpha subunits and two beta subunits, each of which contains a heme group and globin chain. The heme group contains an iron atom as ferrous form(Fe 2+) at its core that binds one oxygen molecule, allowing one hemoglobin tetramer to bind four oxygen molecules.

In a set of normal lungs, the partial pressure of oxygen is naturally high at the alveolar-capillary junction. Therefore, exposing the T state hemoglobin to vast amounts of oxygen and facilitating oxygen loading. This process occurs very quickly and allows for hemoglobin to saturate to 100% before the end of the capillary bed.

The relationship between pO2 and SaO2 can be represented by the oxygen dissociation curve, which represents oxygen saturation (y-axis) as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen (x-axis). The sigmoid or S-shape of the curve is due to the positive cooperativity of hemoglobin.
