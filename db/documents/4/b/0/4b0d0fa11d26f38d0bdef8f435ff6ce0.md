Foot dislocations are best managed by an interprofessional team that also includes nurses, technicians, and therapists. The diagnosis of foot dislocations is not always as simple as the more subtle injuries can be missed, and it is on the clinicians to know the proper imaging studies to obtain. This type of caution is more often needed when potential injuries to the forefoot are present as the can present is a less subtle manner. Imaging needed includes an anteroposterior, 30-degree oblique, and lateral weight-bearing radiographs. Despite their difficulty, weight-bearing films are essential in diagnosis and management, especially in subtle cases. Both the patient, nurses, and radiography technician should be educated on the importance of these injuries, thus allowing the proper X-rays to be obtained. Following stabilization or reduction, a physical therapist may work with the patient to restore function and strength, reporting back to the orthopedist regarding progress. Orthopedic nurses will monitor treatment progress, and inform the clinicians of any setbacks or lack of progress. They can also answer patient questions and coordinate care with therapists. These interprofessional steps can result in improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]
