Minerals are naturally occurring elements found as part of the human diet. These essential trace elements are imperative for normal health, regulation, and function. They include copper, fluoride, iron, iodine, manganese, selenium, zinc, and chromium. Excess or deficiencies in any of these can lead to various biochemical imbalances. Chromium, in particular, is a mineral that has many implications in the setting of nutritional health and medical care.

Chromium exists in both the trivalent (+3) and hexavalent (+6) forms. The trivalent form is an essential trace element that is naturally present in the human diet, while the hexavalent form is a toxic by-product of the manufacturing processes.

Trivalent chromium is used as a coenzyme in the normal biochemical reactions of multiple processes throughout the body. Chromium can be found in various fruits, vegetables, grains, cereals, and processed meats. Deficiency has been linked to multiple physiological aberrations, especially in certain populations. This text will examine the causes, manifestations, and identification of the trivalent(+3) form of chromium deficiency specifically.
