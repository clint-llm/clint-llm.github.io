The clinical significance of the proper perioperative cardiac management in non-cardiac surgery lies in the high number of surgical procedures performed each year and the related cardiac complications. Before surgery, the health professional must assess the risk of surgery type and the patient's risk. The patient's risk can be specified through history, examination, and non-invasive and invasive tests. The evaluation of functional capacity and the calculation of surgical risk may be useful in this regard. The preventive approach is pivotal, and if the situation warrants it, risk reduction strategies should be implemented with drugs, surgery, or endovascular procedures.

In patients with true life-threatening surgical issues, operative intervention should not be delayed by ticagrelor or extensive perioperative cardiac management. In patients who continue antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants in the perioperative period, a meticulous surgical technique should be employed to minimize the risk of postoperative bleeding complications.
