Patients present with complaints of dysuria, pruritus, penile burning, and urethral discharge. Urethral discharge can be purulent, mucoid or watery. Discharge in NGU is sometimes scant and only noted as crusting at the meatus or staining of the underwear.

Not all men with urethritis have symptoms, and over 40% of cases of all cases of NGU are asymptomatic.

Patients who present with regional lymphadenopathy, constitutional symptoms, or vesicles may have urethritis from HSV NGU.

Physical examination may reveal penile discharge. Differentiating between gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis is difficult based on clinical examination of discharge. NGU tends to be mucoid or clear, compared to gonococcal urethritis which is more commonly purulent; however, this generalization is not reliable.

Men with urethritis can also present with fever, testicular pain, testicular swelling, sore throat, rectal pain, or rectal discharge. Differential diagnoses of these symptoms would include other infectious processes such as epididymitis, pharyngitis, or prostatitis, and these should be considered accordingly.

Conjunctivitis can accompany urethritis caused by gonorrhea, chlamydia, or Adenovirus.

Some patients with NGU can also present with reactive arthritis, which is characterized by urethritis, uveitis, and arthritis. This constellation of symptoms is typically associated with the HLA-B27 gene.
