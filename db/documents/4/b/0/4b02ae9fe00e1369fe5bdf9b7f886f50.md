Ainhum is a disease process that is often under-recognized and may not be caught early enough to implicate effective treatment. As nurses, medical assistants, and non-physician healthcare members are often the first to see patients in the social and medical setting, increasing awareness in this community may prompt patients to seek care before symptoms occur. In addition to the physician’s interpretation of diagnostic studies and ultimate surgical treatment, physical therapists and occupational therapists can help maximize an affected individual's quality of life. Researchers have not explored the social and mental effects of ainhum, but psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, or pastoral care may help alleviate underappreciated psychological consequences of this disease.

Although historically a disease of rural South America, Africa, and India, as migratory patterns continue to change, physicians in the western world and developed nations may be more likely to encounter ainhum.

All studies at this time are evidence level 5 or lower. As the disease is so infrequently encountered, there have been no well-organized trials performed.
