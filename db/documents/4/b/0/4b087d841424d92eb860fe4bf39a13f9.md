Hibernomas are benign neoplasms that may present as a symptomatic subcutaneous mass or incidentally found on imaging for an unrelated purpose. Primary care physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and dermatologists are often the first to encounter this relatively uncommon entity. Owing to their similar imaging appearance to atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (ALT/WDLS) on MRI and high metabolic activity simulating malignancy on FDG PET-CT, hibernomas should be managed with an interprofessional team approach with the involvement of an orthopedic oncologist and a radiologist, preferably with musculoskeletal training. Nursing staff can also provide patient counsel, assist with pre-surgical preparation, assist during surgery, and provide post-procedural care. This interprofessional approach can help drive optimal patient outcomes with hibernoma patients. [Level 5]
