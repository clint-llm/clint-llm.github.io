An interventricular abscess is a rare complication of infective endocarditis. It is more prevalent in developing countries where patients may not have access to antibiotics for simple bacteremic infections that seed the cardiac structures and later lead to infective endocarditis. In the U.S. and Europe, patients often have predisposing medical conditions or devices that increase the chance of developing an infection. Among microbiological etiologies, Staphylococci are the leading cause of infective endocarditis, producing a septal abscess. The incidence of infective endocarditis between 2000 and 2011 in the United States increased from 11 per 100,000 to 15 per 100,000 individuals.

The most common infectious organisms causing interventricular abscess include:

- 
Staphylococcus aureus

- Haemophilus species

- Enterococci

- 
Escherichia coli

- Beta-hemolytic streptococci

- 
Streptococcus pneumoniae

- Bacteroides species

- Parasitic organisms

- Hydatid cysts

- 
Listeria monocytogenes

- HIV

- Immunocompromised states
