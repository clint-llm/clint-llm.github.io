With the application of positive pressure to the airway, excessive airway pressures can lead to barotrauma. While the effects of barotrauma are complex and adversely affects survival, an immediate concern is the causation of a pneumothorax. A pneumothorax can lead to a further increase in airway pressures, collapse of aerated portions of the lung leading to worsening oxygenation, and the formation of a tension pneumothorax leading to hemodynamic compromise. Figure 7 depicts a pneumothorax in a patient on mechanical ventilation. An unexplained drop in blood pressure or oxygen saturation should be evaluated at the bedside.

While an emergent chest X-ray is being arranged, a bedside sonogram can help diagnose a pneumothorax. Under normal circumstances, in the absence of a pneumothorax or a large pleural effusion, the lung and the chest wall interface can be well visualized on a sonogram. This interface is unique because a shimmering movement is noted with the lung moving against the chest wall; this is known as lung sliding. Providers can be trained to detect a pneumothorax with relative ease, and treatment can be started promptly. In the absence of lung sliding, steps can be taken to relieve the pneumothorax even when the chest X-ray is awaited. In case of hemodynamic instability due to a tension pneumothorax, a needle thoracostomy performed using a large-bore needle (14 to 16 gauge) in the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line can be lifesaving.

Once the patient has been stabilized, a more definitive approach like a pig-tailed catheter can be pursued. If a pig-tailed catheter is unable to drain the pneumothorax, a wide bore chest tube with a surgical approach can be used. It is best if these procedures are performed by experienced physicians to ensure patient comfort and minimize iatrogenic injury. Figures 8 and 9 show the placement of a wide bore chest tube for a large pneumothorax. A water seal should be applied with suction to ensure reinflation of the lung. Bubbling in the water seal denotes a persistent air leak, and the chest tubes should not be removed unless the air leak is resolved. If the air leak persists beyond 24-48 hours, a possible bronchopleural fistula should be considered, and thoracic surgery should be consulted to aid in managing the pneumothorax. Figure 10 depicts a broncho-pleural fistula leading to a persistent pneumothorax despite the placement of 2 chest tubes.

With an endotracheal tube, there is an added benefit of efficient airway clearance with suction. However, these suction catheters can cause damage to the airway and lead to hemoptysis. Ideally, respiratory therapists should perform suction, as this leads to efficient suction, with minimal trauma and aerosolization. If the suction trauma persists, we can switch to softer catheters with a smaller bore; however, the operator should be mindful of aerosolization associated with breaking the ventilator circuit. Ventilator-associated pneumonia should be considered in patients with fevers and evidence of sepsis. Secretions should be cultured and empiric antibiotics should be started to cover nosocomial infections endemic to the region.

ECMO has significant adverse effects, and its use should be limited to carefully selected patients after an interprofessional discussion. Life-threatening bleeding has been associated with the use of ECMO due to the need for anticoagulation and platelet dysfunction.

Thromboembolism remains a significant complication of ECMO. Deep venous thrombosis can be seen in a majority of patients on ECMO, and pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening. The ECMO circuit should be checked frequently between shifts to look for signs of thrombosis. Figure 11 depicts an ECMO oxygenator with a significant clot. The placement of ECMO catheters requires constant monitoring; if the catheters are too close, there may be recirculation of blood between the two catheters leading to suboptimal systemic oxygen delivery. Figure 12 depicts 2 ECMO catheters in close proximity leading to recirculation.
