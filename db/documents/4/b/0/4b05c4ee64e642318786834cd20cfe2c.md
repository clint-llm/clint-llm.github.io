Segmental instability is also identifiable on dynamic radiographs. White and Punjabi suggested that any of the following criteria on a flexion-extension radiograph could be considered as segmental instability. A sagittal plane translation of greater than 4.5 mm or a sagittal plane translation greater than 15% of the vertebral body width or a sagittal plane rotation greater than 15 degrees at either L1/L2, L2/L3 or L3/L4, or greater than 20 degrees at L4/L5, or greater than 25 degrees at L5/S1.

Ultrasound examination has shown that the cross-sectional area of the multifidus muscle becomes decreased in patients with low back pain.
