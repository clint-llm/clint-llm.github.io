The labyrinthine artery, a branch off the anterior inferior cerebellar artery, is believed to supply the facial nerve proximal to the geniculate ganglion. Subsequently, a petrosal branch of the middle meningeal artery is thought to supply the nerve as it reaches the stylomastoid foramen. Finally, the stylomastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery has two branches that supply the remaining portions of the facial nerve.
