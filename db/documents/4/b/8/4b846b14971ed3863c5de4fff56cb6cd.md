Blood and/or intraoperative cultures define the organisms and histopathology. Staph aureus (coagulase-positive or negative) accounts for over 60% of the SEA. The polymicrobial SEA is a rarity and blood cultures are positive in most patients. Further, the pathogens identified by blood culture are almost always similar to the infectious agents cultured from abscess content.

This situation differs completely from that of IEA in which blood cultures are positive in only 10% of patients; and even if positive, they do not represent the actual causative organism. IEA and brain abscess pus often grow mixed organisms.
