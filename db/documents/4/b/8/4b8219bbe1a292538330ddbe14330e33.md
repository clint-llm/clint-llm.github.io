The only FDA-approved use for clomipramine is to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in ages ten and older. For the treatment of OCD, clomipramine was found to be more effective than sertraline, fluoxetine, and fluvoxamine in a meta-analysis. Clomipramine is used off-label to treat patients with depression, anxiety, treatment-resistant depression, cataplexy syndrome, insomnia, neuropathic pain, chronic pain, body dysmorphic disorder, panic disorder, premature ejaculation, pediatric nocturnal enuresis, and trichotillomania. This activity reviews indications, mechanism of action, administration, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity associated with clomipramine and the interprofessional team's role in caring for patients with conditions that indicate therapy with clomipramine.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for initiating clomipramine therapy.
- Describe the mechanism of action of clomipramine.
- Review the contraindications for clomipramine therapy. 
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients receiving therapy with clomipramine.
