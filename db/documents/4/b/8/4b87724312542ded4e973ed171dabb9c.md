The term "blue nevus" describes a group of skin lesionsÂ characterized by dermal proliferation of melanocytes presenting as blue to black nodules on the head, extremities, or buttocks. In most cases, they are acquired and present as a solitary lesion but may also be congenital and appear at multiple sites. In addition to multiple less-known variants, there are two widely known histological subtypes: common blue nevus (dendritic blue nevus or Jadassohn-Tieche type) and cellular blue nevus.
