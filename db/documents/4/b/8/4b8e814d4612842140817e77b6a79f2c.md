Patients with diabetes should receive extensive education in all aspects of the disease, with emphasis on dietary and medication management, as well as the importance of exercise and awareness of the potential consequences of the disease.  Specific information regarding the dawn phenomenon should be provided if the patient is suspected or has been diagnosed with this entity.  The importance of using dietary interventions to minimize the dawn phenomenon should be discussed at length.  Recommendations should include increasing protein to carbohydrate ratio for the evening meal and encouraging the patient to have breakfast regularly.  Increased physical activity during the evening hours has also demonstrated some effectiveness in minimizing early morning hyperglycemia.
