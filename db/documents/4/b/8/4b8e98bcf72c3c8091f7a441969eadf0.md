Upon the proper identification of tardive dystonia, the offending agent(s) should be modified and if possible, discontinued. Clinical judgment will indicate whether abrupt cessation or a gradual taper is most appropriate. Some experts suggest simply cross-tapering to an alternative antipsychotic with a lower EPS profile, such as clozapine.

Drug-induced EPS are believed to precipitate following the blockade of nigrostriatal dopamine tracts, ultimately resulting in an increased ratio of cholinergic to dopaminergic activity. Therefore, drugs that antagonize cholinergic activity and increase striatal dopaminergic function will theoretically normalize the biochemical imbalance.

One study reviewed the therapeutic efficacy of specific pharmacologic interventions and revealed “at least some benefit” in 53% of patients following the administration of tetrabenazine, 44% with anticholinergic agents, 56% with benzodiazepines, and 56% with baclofen.
