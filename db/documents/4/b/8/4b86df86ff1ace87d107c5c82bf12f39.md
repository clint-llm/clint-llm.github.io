When a patient with uveitis complains of a decrease in vision, uveitic macular edema is the most frequent cause. In the early stages, the edema may be subclinical, and there may not be any visual disturbance.

A slit-lamp examination with a 90D or a 78D lens supplemented by biomicroscopy (direct or indirect) is performed. It may reveal an increase in macular thickness, loss of normal foveal reflex, with cystic spaces perceived in a few cases, and an associated epiretinal membrane may be present in some cases. An overlying vitreous haze may be present and surrounding signs of inflammation like vasculitis, chorioretinitis, choroiditis, disc edema, inferior snowballs, snow banking, vitreous traction must be looked for. Cystic spaces and edema are better appreciated using a red-free light. When the edema is subclinical (central macular thickness <300 μm), it is difficult to appreciate it clinically and is diagnosed on the investigations discussed below.
