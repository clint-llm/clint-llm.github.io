Aldolase reductase is an enzyme that is part of the alpha-keto reductase superfamily that uses NADPH to drive the forward reaction.

Sorbital dehydrogenase, on the other hand, is a member of the medium-chain dehydrogenase superfamily.

As the polyol pathway continues to metabolize glucose, an overproduction of fructose in the body occurs. This has several metabolic consequences. The surplus of fructose is metabolized by fructokinase, which requires ATP. This results in acetyl-CoA overproduction and depletion of ATP.

Fructose also can chemically glycate proteins via fructose metabolism byproducts fructose-3-phosphate and 3-deoxyglucose, impairing protein function.
