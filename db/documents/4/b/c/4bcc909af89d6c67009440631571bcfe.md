UnconsciousnessÂ is generally caused by a temporary or permanent impairment of either the reticular activating system in the brainstem, both cerebral hemispheres, or bilateral thalamus. The three main mechanisms are structural brain lesions, diffuse neuronal dysfunction secondary to a systemic pathology, and rarely psychiatric causes.

**Structural Causes**

These causes either destroy an area or exert indirect damage by way of compression or increased intracranial pressure. Increased intracranial pressure impairs global cerebral blood flow and can promote tissue distortion and brain herniation.

- Stroke

- Traumatic brain injury (TBI)

- Intracranial, epidural, subdural hemorrhages

- Intracranial tumors

- Inflammation

- Venous thrombosis

- Acute hydrocephalus

**Systemic Causes**

- Hypoglycemia

- Hyperglycemia

- Hyponatremia

- Hypernatremia

- Hypercalcemia

- Seizures

- Systemic infections (sepsis)

- Meningitis

- Encephalitis

- Adrenal crisis

- Pituitary apoplexy with pituitary hormonal insufficiency

- Endocrine abnormalities

- Myxedema coma

- Medication overdose

- Illicit drug use

- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome

- Excessive alcohol intake

- Hepatic encephalopathy

- Uremia

- Heavy metals (lead poisoning)

- Malaria

- Fungemia (aspergillosis)

- Herbicides

- Gases (carbon monoxide)

- Anesthesia

**Psychiatric Causes**

- Catatonia

- Severe depression

- Conversion disorder

- Malingering
