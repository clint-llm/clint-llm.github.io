Amphotericin B deoxycholate belongs to the polyene class of antifungals. It is also known by the conventional name amphotericin B and has been in use for the treatment of invasive fungal infections for more than 50 years. It was first isolated as a natural product of a soil Actinomycete sp.

Newer lipid formulations that are less nephrotoxic as compared with conventional amphotericin B are available.

- Amphotericin B, which is more commonly administered in a liposomal formulation and exhibits increased tolerability and a reduced toxicity profile

- An amphotericin B lipid complex in which amphotericin B is tightly packed in a ribbon-like structure

- Amphotericin B cholesteryl sulfate complex

These lipid formulations permit a higher daily dose, provide better delivery to organs within the reticular endothelial system such as the lungs, liver, and spleen, have similar efficacy when compared to conventional amphotericin B, and are less nephrotoxic.

With the advancement of newer antifungals, such as azoles (e.g., voriconazole) and Echinocandins (e.g., caspofungin), amphotericin B is typically only reserved for selected invasive fungal infections.

Common indications in yeast and invasive mold infections are listed below:

- Invasive candidiasis (FDA approved). It is effective against the majority of the Candida species, including Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida tropicalis, and Candida parapsilosis.

- In neonatal candidiasis, conventional amphotericin B is less toxic than in adults and well-tolerated.

- Opportunistic fungal infections in immunocompromised children, including HIV

- Life-threatening fungal infections in both normal and immunocompromised hosts

- Empiric treatment in a persistently febrile neutropenic host.

- Cerebral cryptococcosis along with flucytosine for induction therapy

- Mucormycosis and other molds, including Fusarium spp. and penicilliosis

- Severe cases of sporotrichosis

- Coccidioidomycosis and paracoccidioidomycosis, especially in severe disease

- Histoplasmosis, for disseminated disease

- Blastomycosis, for severe disease

- Aspergillosis, for salvage therapy in cases not responding to voriconazole

- Visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis (a protozoan infection)

Dose: The recommended daily dose depends upon the type of infection, the organ involved, the host (immunocompetent versus immunocompromised), and ranges from 0.7 to 1 mg/kg per day over 2 to 4 hours as tolerated.

When prescribing amphotericin B, the clinician should take into consideration: the indication, immune status of the patient, and side effect profile. Also, the resistance to amphotericin B remains low for Candida species except for Candida lusitaniae. Aspergillus spp. and opportunistic molds have a more variable susceptibility pattern. Secondary resistance is uncommon and is not usually a clinical problem. Clinicians should consider in vitro susceptibility testing in cases of clinical failure, and when treating pathogens such as Candida lusitaniae, Trichosporon species, Fusarium species, or Psudoallescheria boydii.

Clinicians should recall that amphotericin B exerts a concentration-dependent fungicidal activity against susceptible fungi such as Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp., and Aspergillus
spp. It also has a prolonged post-antifungal effect of up to 12 hours.
