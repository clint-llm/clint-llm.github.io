The exact etiology has not been clarified. Nevus comedonicus is considered to be an epidermal nevus developing from the hair follicle. The other opinion is that it is a hamartoma derived from the mesodermal part of the pilosebaceous unit. Genetic mosaicism has been proposed to be part of etiology of nevus comedonicus.
