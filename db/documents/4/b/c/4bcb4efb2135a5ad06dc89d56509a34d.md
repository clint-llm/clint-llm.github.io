First, if the tube is still in place, it should be examined. There are cases of a malfunctioning tube. It is vital that the clinician take a careful history and review prior records when they are available, to know the type of tube that has been placed (with internal mushroom cap versus internal balloon). The dressing is removed, and the percutaneous incision site is examined for any signs of infection, track closure, or tube displacement in subcutaneous tissue. The area should be appropriately cleaned with sterilizing alcohol or povidone-iodine. The area is covered with either the sheath in the PEG replacement kit or surgical drapes to avoid contaminating the surroundings during PEG replacement.
