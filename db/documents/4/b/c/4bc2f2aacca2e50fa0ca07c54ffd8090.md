If metastases are restricted to the lungs, surgery within the overall oncological treatment is justified. However, since a prediction of survival is not possible without an operation, and the utility of surgery remains untested in a prospective randomized study, the decision for or against metastasectomy must be made on a case-by-case basis.

The criteria for selecting patients to undergo surgical resection of lung metastases are:

- Technical resectability

- Tolerable general and functional surgical risk

- Control of the primary tumor process

- Exclusion of any further extrathoracic metastasis.

Favorable prognostic factors after surgical treatment of pulmonary metastasis depend on the following factors:

- A long disease-free interval between the treatment of the primary tumor and the discovery of pulmonary metastases

- Absence of thoracic lymph node metastases

- A small number of pulmonary metastases

The standard procedure is circumscribed atypical (lung tissue-sparing) resection; more rarely, anatomic resection such as pulmonary segmentectomy or lobectomy is necessary. If anatomical resection not possible due to multiple metastases, centrally located metastasis using neodymium YAG laser should be attempted, or a pneumonectomy is an option.

The role of lung metastasectomy by VATS as a curative procedure to achieve local radical resection comparable with that obtained by thoracotomy has yet to be studied. Extend of resection and lymph node dissection has not been defined in any of the studies.

In one study, malignant pulmonary foci that had not been detected by preoperative CT were detected in 20% of patients by intraoperative palpation. So far, thoracoscopic procedures have not been generally recommended for curative intent since the lung tissues are not accessible to palpation, similar to an open procedure.

5-year survival rates after pulmonary metastasectomy, depending on the primary tumor, are 35.5% to 47% for renal cell carcinoma, 39.1% to 67.8% for colorectal cancer, 29% to 52% for soft-tissue sarcoma, 38% to 49.7% for osteosarcoma, and 79% to 94% for non-seminomatous germ-cell tumors. For the latter two types of tumors, chemotherapy is the most beneficial treatment for long-term survival.

If there are widespread diffuse pulmonary metastases, or if the lesions are technically or functionally inoperable, local interventions such as surgery and radiotherapy are at best palliative.

Patients with complete resection (R0) of a solitary disease focus and a disease-free interval of more than three years after surgery to treat the primary tumor showed the most favorable prognosis. Although this study contained no control group of non-operated patients, the significantly more favorable 5-year survival after R0 resection (36%) compared to incomplete resection (13%) indicates the chances of success of metastasectomy. Operative mortality reported was 1%.

Solitary recurrent metastasis in the lung requires investigation for whether repeat resection is indicated. A longer interval of time between the first metastasectomy and the appearance of recurring metastases appears to be prognostically more favorable. Primary tumors patients who undergo one recurrence metastasectomy achieved a median survival time of more than 60 months; with two recurrence metastasectomies, median survival was 34.7 months, and with three or more, it was 45.6 months. Nonsurgical candidates had a  median survival of 8 months.

**Special Tumors and Considerations**

Colorectal cancer:  1% to 2% of patients undergo pulmonary metastasectomy. Stage IV tumors demonstrate survival of 24 months; after metastasectomy, 5-year survival of 68% is possible. In the presence of synchronous liver metastasis, 5-year survival is 42% after lung and liver metastasectomy.

Renal cell cancer (RCC): Chemotherapy plays a pivotal role in RCC, but surgery can be performed with curative intents, especially if there is no thoracic lymph node involvement. Thoracic lymph nodes are present in 30% to 45% cases, decreasing survival after surgery between 64 and 92 to 26 to 29 months.

Breast cancer: The median survival time for patients with lung metastasis was 21 months, and 15.5% of the patients were alive for more than three years. The tumor subtype distribution was 45.3% HR−/HER2−, 12.2% HR+/HER2+, 7.8% HR−/HER2+, and 15.0% triple-negative subtype. Compared with patients without lung metastasis, those with lung metastasis were more likely to be older, female, black, higher tumor grade, HR−/HER2+, HR+/HER2+, and triple-negative subtypes at diagnosis.

Head neck cancers: Survival of 20% to 59% is reported after surgery. Due to the high co-incidence of lung cancer and head/neck cancer, even after biopsy, it is not possible to differentiate between metastatic and primary lung cancer.

Melanoma: 70% of melanomas are metastatic, but only 10% involve the lungs. After surgery, a 5-year survival range from 21% to 35 %.

Non-seminomatous germ cell tumors: All lesions remaining after chemotherapy (cisplatin-based) require removal via surgery. Normalization of tumor markers after chemotherapy does not indicate that residual tumor should not get removed.

**Indications for Removal**

- All residual tumor after chemotherapy and normalization of tumor markers

- Recurrence after chemotherapy treatment

- Failure to respond to chemotherapy

- Partial response to chemotherapy

Soft tissue sarcoma: Usually, these are discovered as metachronous metastasis during the course of the disease. Should be treated surgically, given the metastasis are only moderately chemosensitive. The 5-year survival after surgery is reportedly between 29 and 52%.

Osteosarcoma: Despite combined chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, the 5-yrs survival of these patients ranges from 40% to 20%. Primary metastatic osteosarcoma carries a poor prognosis. When discovered synchronous during treatment, the aim of surgery should be complete metastasis removal after chemo and surgical removal of the primary tumor. In the case of recurrent pulmonary metastasis, repeat surgery is necessary irrespective of whether or not there is also chemotherapy. In the case of other primary tumors, surgical options should occur if it is feasible. The primary site is either removed or under control, and other local or systemic treatment options are futile.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): The successful treatment of multiple lung metastases after hepatic resection for HCC with combined docetaxel, cisplatin (CDDP), and enteric-coated tegafur/uracil (UFT-E) is reported in a study.

SRC kinase inhibitor ( saracatinib) was studied as it inhibits the SRC kinase and their downstream signals (FAK and Stat3). In the orthotopic xenograft HCC model, saracatinib inhibited lung metastasis without influencing primary tumor inhibition. It was able to completely block lung metastasis, indicating the involvement of more complex mechanisms in HCC metastasis to the lung.

Chondrosarcoma: Metastasectomy and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) affect the patient's prognosis with chondrosarcoma of the extremities who develop lung metastasis. Extrapulmonary metastasis and poor grade of tumors affect the prognosis. Three and 5-year survival after lung metastasis is 51.5% and 45.7%. Surgical options merit consideration if extrapulmonary metastasis is under control. RFA is safe, with the local rate of control reported to be 89% to 95% can be repeated if needed. It’s useful in controlling metastatic disease. However, it is less effective if the size of metastasis is greater than 3 cm and if it is near a large segmental vessel.

Forty-two patients were analyzed after metastasectomy for various tumors and were followed for 6 to 98 months; the 3-year and 5-year overall survival rates were 45.7% and 34.6%, respectively, much higher than the postoperative survival rates for stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC 24.9% to 33%).

A study revealed lymph-node metastases as significant prognostic factors (P < 0.05), with the 5-year survival rates 46.9% and 25.0%, respectively. Previous studies also indicated a significant difference between the lymph-node dissection negative and positive groups in 3-year survival rates. Therefore, systematic mediastinal lymph-node dissections should take place for prognostic purposes during pulmonary metastasectomies. Better prognoses are possible in patients undergoing lymph-node dissections while receiving resections of metastatic lung tumors compared with those who did not undergo hilar or mediastinal lymph-node dissections, suggesting that lymph-node dissection should be mandatory for patients with hilar or mediastinal metastasis.

A study reported that 5-year overall survival rates of 31.4% and 36.6% without and with postoperative treatment, indicating that only a weak relation between postoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy and overall survival is present.

The study also indicated no significant difference in the effects of surgical resection between patients with unilateral or bilateral multiple metastatic lung tumors compared with solitary unilateral metastatic lung tumors. Patients who succumbed to death after surgery from multiple lung metastases were also had metastases to other organs, including bone, liver, and brain. A detailed examination of other organs is essential for patients with multiple metastases to exclude extrapulmonary metastasis before embarking on surgery.
