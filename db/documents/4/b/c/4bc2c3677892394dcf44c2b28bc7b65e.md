Various factors are implicated in the etiopathogenesis of this entity, but the exact cause is unknown. Studies investigating specific angiogenic factors and signal transduction pathways have yet to implicate a single pathway for the pathogenesis of the lesion. Proposed mechanisms emphasize the importance of insults resulting in an imbalance of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors, which lead to a rapid proliferation of capillaries of a neovascular, friable, and lobulated character. Reactive granulation tissue from minor trauma may be contributory; however, studies attribute only up to 7% of these lesions directly to a history of trauma.

Hormonal factors appear to play a role in the pregnancy-associated phenotype of this lesion.

Certain variants of lobular capillary hemangioma have also shown an association with medication use. Of these variants, multiple periungual pyogenic granulomas occur most frequently in association with medications (reports suggest up to 30% of these are associated with medications) and are also associated with other chronic dermatoses such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.

Drugs implicated most often include:

- Systemic and topical retinoids

- Antiretrovirals

- Indinavir (HIV protease inhibitor)

- Antineoplastics

- Pyrimidine analogs: capecitabine
- Taxanes: docetaxel
- Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors

- Monoclonal antibodies against the EGFR: cetuximab and panitumumab
- EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (orally active small molecule): gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, afatinib, and osimertinib


- Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib)
- BRAF inhibitors: vemurafenib, encorafenib

- Immunosuppressive agents

- Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonists: etanercept
- Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors

Disseminated pyogenic granulomas, a rare entity, have been documented to occur with isotretinoin use in patients with severe nodulocystic acne and the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in immunodeficient patients.

Intraoral pyogenic granulomas are seen in patients on cyclosporine and tacrolimus after a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

PG may arise spontaneously within or following laser treatment or cryotherapy to a preexisting vascular malformation, such as capillary (port-wine stain)or arteriovenous malformation.
