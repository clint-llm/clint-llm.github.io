Common injuries due to hazards in the home include falls, ingestion accidents, and heat accidents.

Falls can lead to serious injury and complications in individuals of all ages. Hazards that may increase the risk of falls include wires or loose rugs in walkways, steep steps or steps without a hand railing, and even cluttered floor space.

Ingestion accidents are also a serious risk across the lifespan.

Heat accidents are primarily characterized by scalding or burning of the skin. Burns may come from improperly protected cooking equipment or heating appliances, and lack of proper supervision for children and adults with declining cognition can lead to increased risk for such injuries.

These are just a few examples of potential hazards and techniques for home safety.
