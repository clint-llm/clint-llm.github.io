Ticks are arachnid ectoparasites of the order Ixodida. They are small, hematophagic parasites that feed on the blood of animals, including humans. Ticks carry many bacterial, viral, and protozoal diseases that can affect humans; the number of such conditions continues to grow. Additionally, the geographical range of many ticks is expanding. As ticks are a very important vector of disease-causing pathogens in humans, tick removal requires awareness beyond the physical act of removing the tick from the patient. Clinicians should consider the type of tick, the geographic distribution of ticks in general, and any need for further therapies. This activity summarizes information about tick identification, the technique of removing attached ticks, and information about prophylaxis against some tick-borne diseases.

**Objectives:**
- Correlate the geographic distribution of tick species with known human pathogens.
- Formulate a plan to effectively and efficiently remove a tick attached to a patient.
- Employ best practices for initiation of antibiotic prophylaxis against Lyme disease.
- Apply and implement an interprofessional team process improving outcomes for patients who have sustained a tick bite.
