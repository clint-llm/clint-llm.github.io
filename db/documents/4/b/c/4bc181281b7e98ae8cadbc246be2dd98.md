**Laparoscopic Appendectomy**

**Patient Preparation and Draping Procedures**

- A wide abdominal prep and draping are indicated.

- The patient should be supine with the left arm tucked. However, after the port placements, a Trendelenburg position, with the right side up, provides improved visibility and access.

- Create a sterile surgical field from slightly superior to the bilateral costal margins extending inferiorly to the pubic tubercle and laterally to both the right and left flanks. The sterile field should allow for possible conversion to an open procedure.

**Abdominal Access**

- Abdominal access may be obtained using the periumbilical Hasson technique, with a Veress needle or an optical trocar as dictated by the clinical situation and surgeon preference.

**Abdominal Insufflation and Port Placements**

- If using the Hasson technique or a Veress needle, insufflate the peritoneal cavity with carbon dioxide gas. Insert a 5-mm angled laparoscope. Under direct visualization, place a 5-mm operating port in the midline above the pubic bone and a second 5-mm port in the lateral left lower quadrant.

- Optical trocars, if used, are placed periumbilically. Under direct visualization, place a 5 mm port in the right lower quadrant just above the pubis and another 5-mm port in the left iliac fossa. Assuming a usual anatomic position of the appendix and a right-handed surgeon, the first trocar will be used to grasp and manipulate the appendix, and the second trocar will be used for the operating instruments.

- Using a third trocar should be considered for appendiceal anatomical variations, including a subhepatic appendix.

**Procedure**

- Exploration of the abdomen is completed before attention is turned to the right lower quadrant.

- The omentum and small bowel are swept cephalad. The fold of Treves or antimesenteric fat can be used to identify the terminal ileum; follow this to the cecum. In normal anatomy, the appendix can be identified at the confluence of the taeniae coli. If the appendix is retrocecal, mobilization of the retroperitoneal attachments of the cecum and ascending colon may be required. Proper patient positioning, as described above, facilitates the identification of the appendix. For a right-handed surgeon, the right-hand instrument retracts the most distal ileal loop, and the left-hand instrument optimizes cecal exposure. The preferred approach in patients with the subserosal appendix is the complete, meticulous dissection of the visceral peritoneum.

- Once the appendix is identified, it should be held taut without specific preference to grasp the appendix by its tip or body. Complicated appendicitis with phlegmon or gangrene requires careful handling, and direct meso-appendiceal grasping is preferred.

- Divide the mesoappendix from the tip to the base using bipolar cautery; monopolar cautery is discouraged due to an increased risk of bowel injury.

- Any adhesions formed by inflammatory processes between the appendix, small bowel, and cecum can be divided using blunt dissection; sharp dissection may be necessary.

- In cases of suboptimal visualization or dissection of the appendix, consider conversion to an open procedure.

- Once the tip of the appendix is visualized, it can be grasped and elevated off the cecum anteriorly. A window is created between the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix using a Maryland dissector. The safest orientation to create this window is placing the appendix and mesoappendix parallel to the lateral abdominal wall; this reduces the risk of bowel injury.

- Divide the mesoappendix using an endoscopic stapler loaded with vascular staples. Divide the appendix at its base using a second load of vascular staples. Caution must be taken to ensure the stapler is brought together close to the cecum to prevent the creation of an extra unnecessary appendiceal stump.

- Place the resected appendix in an endoscopic retrieval bag; remove the bag through the umbilical port.

- Assess the staple lines to confirm hemostasis and integrity.

- Sweep the bowel caudally to return it to the lower abdomen; drape the omentum back over the small bowel and, ideally, the appendiceal stump.

- Insert the laparoscope through the midline port to ensure hemostasis of the anterior abdominal wall.

- Accessory port sites may be left open, reducing the risk of needle stick, length of the procedure, and overall cost without a higher incident rate of port-site hernias than fascial closure.

- Close the skin according to the surgeon's preference.

**Open Appendectomy**

**Patient Preparation and Draping Procedures**

- A wide abdominal prep and draping are indicated.

- The patient should be supine.

- Create a sterile surgical field from slightly superior to the bilateral costal margins extending inferiorly to the pubic tubercle and laterally to both the right and left flanks.

**Procedure**

- In uncomplicated appendicitis, access to the McBurney point may be provided by selecting either an oblique (McBurney) incision or a transverse (Rockey-Davis or Elliot) incision. Alternatively, based on preoperative imaging, an incision can be made using the point of maximal tenderness or appendiceal location.

- A McBurney incision is made one-third of the way from the anterior-superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the umbilicus following Langer lines. Separate the external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis muscles along their fibers.

- The Rockey-Davis or Elliot incision is a transverse incision close to the McBurney point, extending medially to the rectus abdominis muscle and laterally an equal distance. Blunt dissection and electrocautery are used to dissect the external aponeurosis. Expose the external aponeurosis in a superolateral to inferomedial fashion along its fibers to expose the underlying internal oblique muscle. Use blunt dissection to divide the internal oblique perpendicular to the direction of the fibers to expose the transverse abdominal muscle, which is divided in a similar fashion to expose the peritoneum.

- Grasp the peritoneum with forceps, and if free of adhesion, incise it with a scalpel.

- Attention is then turned to locating the appendix. If the cecum can be visualized, it can be mobilized and used to identify the appendix. The appendix can be externalized using atraumatic graspers to advance with the taeniae coli. Alternatively, the cecum can be used as a guide to locate the appendix.

- Once the appendix is identified, dissect the mesoappendix, divide the appendiceal vessels between clamps, and ligate them with silk sutures.

- Crush the tissue at the appendiceal base with a right-angle clamp. Move the clamp distally and ligate the appendiceal base distal to the clamp with an absorbable suture.

- Excise the appendix proximal to the right-angle clamp with a blade. The appendiceal stump mucosa can be obliterated using electrocautery. Place a silk purse-string suture around the appendiceal base and invert the stump.

- Confirm hemostasis. Close the peritoneal and fascial layers using absorbable sutures.

- Close the skin according to the surgeon's preference.

- Even in class III (contaminated) wounds due to perforated or gangrenous appendicitis, primary skin closure, and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage are recommended.
