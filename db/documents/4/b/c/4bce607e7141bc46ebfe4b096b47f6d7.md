SSc is associated with several complications, mostly secondary to end-organ damage caused by fibrosis. Digital ischemia can lead to gangrene needing amputation. Gastrointestinal involvement can lead to malnutrition. Pulmonary involvement is the leading cause of morbidity in patients with SSc, leading to permanent pulmonary fibrosis. Patients with scleroderma renal crisis can have permanent renal damage, although, with ACE inhibitors, renal function recovers in most of these patients.
