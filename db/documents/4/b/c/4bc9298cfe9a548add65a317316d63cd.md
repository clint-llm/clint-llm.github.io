If acute closed-angle glaucoma is not detected and treated in its initial stages, it can lead to temporary loss of vision or blindness. There is a loss of peripheral vision, followed by a loss of central vision. There can be a significant increase in IOP in patients with peripheral patent iridotomy and a flat anterior chamber. This condition is called malignant glaucoma. This condition is difficult to treat and progressively leads to blindness.
