Differential diagnosis includes anaphylaxis triggered by certain allergens resulting in the release of histamine from mast cells. Histamine release causes localized cutaneous reactions such as hives or urticaria that itch, as well as bowel wall mucosal edema, which can manifest as vomiting and abdominal pain. The systemic reaction can manifest as hypotension and tachycardia due to peripheral vessel dilatation and capillary leakage. These symptoms can be suppressed by the use of adrenaline, antihistamines, and steroids, which inhibit immunoglobulin production and reduce the recurrent chances of allergic attacks. Other differential diagnoses include cellulitis, contact dermatitis, lymphedema, erysipelas, and systemic lupus erythematosus.
