Herpes simplex ophthalmicus (HSO) is caused by the neurotropic herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 and affects all the structures of the eye. Primary infection occurs in the form of blepharoconjunctivitis both in neonates through birth canal transmission and in children through orofacial mucus membrane transmission. Primary infection is often self-limiting, and the virus ascends through the cutaneous nerves and stays latent in the trigeminal nerve ganglion. Upon reactivation due to unfavorable immune conditions, a secondary infection happens involving eyelids, conjunctiva, cornea, uvea, and rarely retina. Antiviral agents, both topical and systemic antivirals, are the treatment of choice. Severe infections and their sequelae can often cause severe impairment to the vision. Once infected, it is impossible to eradicate the virus from the body.
