In neuroembryology, the neural tube forms around the fourth week of gestation. The center, hollow portion of the neural tube eventually develops into the ventricular system. Three dilations, called the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, form from the neural tube. The prosencephalon, or the forebrain, develops into the telencephalon (cerebral hemisphere) and the diencephalon. The mesencephalon becomes the midbrain, while the rhombencephalon grows into the metencephalon (pons and cerebellum) and the myelencephalon (medulla). Within each of theseÂ dilations that develop from the neural tube are cavities that become the ventricles. The cavity located in the rhombencephalon becomes the fourth ventricle.
