Collagen vascular disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CVD-ILD) consists of several immunologically mediated diseases with characteristic pulmonary features. Diagnosis and management require an understanding of the combination of radiologic, histologic, physical, and functional findings. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with CVD-ILD, appropriate, and comprehensive evaluation must be undertaken. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of CVD-ILD and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the collagen vascular diseases and their associated interstitial lung diseases.
- Describe and correlate the radiologic and pathologic features of collagen vascular disease-associated interstitial lung disease.
- Explain the importance of the evaluation of collagen vascular disease-associated interstitial lung disease and its role in management and prognosis.
- Outline the importance of collaboration among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients with collagen vascular disease-associated interstitial lung disease.
