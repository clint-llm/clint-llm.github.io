**A) Initial Management**

**1) The Supportive Measures**

The initial approach to patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) should focus on supportive measures.

Supplemental oxygen is indicated in patients with oxygen saturation <90%. Mechanical ventilation (non-invasive or invasive) should be utilized in unstable patients, but providers should be mindful of the adverse hemodynamic effects of mechanical ventilation.

Acute RV failure is the leading cause of death in patients with hemodynamically unstable PE. Aggressive volume resuscitation in such patients can over distend the RV, worsen ventricular interdependence, and reduce cardiac output (CO). Hence, in patients with massive PE, intravenous fluid resuscitation should be tried only in patients with collapsible IVC/intravascular depletion. Vasopressors might be needed for hemodynamic support.

Mechanical cardiopulmonary support devices, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), may be used in hemodynamically unstable patients with pulmonary embolism.

**2) Anticoagulation**

It is vital to remember that the mainstay of treatment of acute PE is anticoagulation.

It is important to note that either low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux or unfractionated heparin (UFH) can be used for anticoagulation in acute PE. LMWH and fondaparinux are preferred since they have a less incidence of inducing major bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

For patients with suspected PE, the treatment is stratified according to the type of PE ( whether it is hemodynamically stable or unstable PE) and according to the suspicion of PE in an individual patient. Patients are classified into low, intermediate, or high suspicion for PE based on either revised Geneva or Wells score.

**Hemodynamically Stable Patients:**

Patients with a high clinical suspicion for PE, anticoagulation is started even before diagnostic imaging is obtained.

For patients with a low clinical suspicion for PE, if diagnostic imaging can be performed within 24 hours, then wait for imaging to establish a definitive diagnosis before starting treatment with anticoagulation.

For patients with an intermediate clinical suspicion for PE, if diagnostic imaging can be performed within 4 hours, then wait for imaging to establish a definitive diagnosis before starting treatment with anticoagulation.

For patients in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated, IVC filter placement should be considered once the diagnosis of PE is confirmed.

**Hemodynamically Unstable Patients:**

Patients with a high clinical suspicion for PE who are hemodynamically unstable, emergent CTPA, portable perfusion scanning, or bedside transthoracic echocardiography should be performed whenever possible.  Primary reperfusion treatment, usually, thrombolysis, is the treatment of choice for patients with hemodynamically unstable acute PE. Surgical pulmonary embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed therapy are alternative reperfusion options in patients with contraindications to thrombolysis. Following reperfusion treatment and hemodynamic stabilization, patients recovering from high-risk PE can be switched from parenteral to oral anticoagulation.

**3) Reperfusion Strategies**

**Thrombolysis:**

Thrombolysis has shown an effective reduction in pulmonary artery pressure and resistance in patients with PE when compared with UFH alone; these improvements are assessed by a decrease in RV dilation on echocardiography.

Pulmonary Embolism Thrombolysis (PEITHO) trial identified the benefits of thrombolysis in hemodynamically stable patients with intermediate-risk PE.

Absolute contraindications to thrombolysis include any prior intracranial hemorrhage, known structural intracranial cerebrovascular disease (e.g., arteriovenous malformation), known malignant intracranial neoplasm, ischemic stroke within three months, suspected aortic dissection, active bleeding or bleeding diathesis, recent surgery encroaching on the spinal canal or brain, and recent significant closed-head or facial trauma with radiographic evidence of bony fracture or brain injury.

**Catheter-Directed Treatment:**

Involves the insertion of a catheter into the pulmonary arteries, which is then used for ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis, suction embolectomy, rotational embolectomy, thrombus aspiration, or combining mechanical fragmentation with pharmacological catheter-directed thrombolysis. Different studies have shown a success rate of up to 87%  for catheter-directed therapies.

**Surgical Embolectomy**

It****is usually indicated in a patient with****hemodynamically unstable PE  in whom thrombolysis (systemic or catheter-directed) is contraindicated, or in patients who have failed thrombolysis.

**Vena Cava Filters**

These block the path of travel of emboli and prevent them from entering the pulmonary circulation. Filters are indicated in patients with venous thromboembolism who have an absolute contraindication to anticoagulants, and in patients with recurrent VTE despite anticoagulation. Retrievable filters are preferred, such that once the contraindication has resolved, the filter can be removed, and patients should be anticoagulated. This is because, the Prevention of Recurrent Pulmonary Embolism by Vena Cava Interruption (PREPIC) study showed that the insertion of a permanent vena cava filter was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of recurrent PE and a substantial increase in the risk of DVT, without a remarkable difference in the risk of recurrent VTE or death.

**B) Chronic Treatment and Prevention of Recurrence**

The aim of anticoagulation after the acute management of PE is to complete the treatment of the acute episode and also prevent the recurrence of VTE over the long-term. Clinical trials have assessed various durations of anticoagulant therapy with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for VTE.

In conclusion, the optimal duration of anticoagulation remains uncertain and has to be considered on a case to case basis. A minimum of 3 months is usually recommended, but a more extended period is required if the  PE was unprovoked or if there are persistent risk factors.

Special considerations are required for patients with active cancer, given their increased risk for a VTE event. Hence, cancer patients should receive an extended duration of anticoagulation if their bleeding risk remains acceptable ( low or moderate bleeding risk). For cancer patients with PE, LMWH, and DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban) are preferred over VKA.
