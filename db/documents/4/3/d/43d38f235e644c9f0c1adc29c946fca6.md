Osmoreceptors maintain the osmolality of the blood through a coordinated set of neuroendocrine, autonomic, and behavioral feedbacks. These responses aid cellular function by maintaining the osmolar gradient of various ions.Â Another crucial role of the osmoreceptors is to aid in perfusion, as the deranged osmolality can lead to a decrease in the blood volume, thereby increasing the work required to maintain adequate circulation. The receptors initially act on the renal system, which modulates the rate of water and salt excretion.
