PRP occurs worldwide with no predilection for gender or ethnicity. There is a lack of information in the literature regarding the true incidence or prevalence of PRP. One British study, estimated an incidence of 1 in 5000 new patient visits to a dermatologist in the outpatient setting, while another Indian study suggests 1 in 50,000 visits. Dr. Andrew Griffith, in an address to members of the British Association of dermatology in 2003, suggested a prevalence of 2.5 million cases in all totaling on average 1 case per 400,000 of the population.

There appears to be a bimodal age distribution with peaks during the first to second and fifth to sixth decades of life. Most cases appear to be sporadic, though familial cases have been reported in up to 6.5% of cases. Familial inheritance pattern appears to be autosomal dominant with variable penetrance in most cases. However, autosomal recessive patterns have also been demonstrated.
