Cholera is characterized mainly by profuse painless diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, borborygmi, and vomiting in the absence of fever. Severe cases may present with hypovolemic shock due to the massive volume and electrolyte loss. Although initial diarrhea may include fecal material, the classic diarrhea presentation consists of watery foul-smelling mucous described as "rice-water" stools. The rate of fluid loss (up to 1 liter per hour) and high stool sodium concentrations characterize cholera from other diarrheal diseases.
