Oral, live attenuated Ty21a vaccine requires four doses of an oral capsule separated by 48 hours. This vaccine requires a booster every two years if continued exposure and re-vaccination every five years. The vaccine schedule should be completed at least one week before potential exposure. The vaccine is approved for patients six years of age and older. It is a live vaccine, so it should not be given in pregnancyÂ or immunocompromised patients.

Vi capsular polysaccharide vaccine administration is by intramuscular injection and only requires a single dose with a booster every two years. It is administered as a 0.5 mL intramuscular injection for a single dose for use in ages two years and older.

There are no known dose adjustments necessary in cases of renal or haptic insufficiency for either formulation.
