Evaluation and diagnosis is mainly a combinationÂ of history and physical examination, biopsies of skin, mucosa, or bone marrow, and flow-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Biopsies of skin and mucosa show histological characteristics listed above along with possible malignancy-associated changes. Bone marrow biopsy shows associated bone marrow failure, myelodysplastic, or leukemia changes.
