Octreotide scan is also known as somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. This scintigraphy is useful in the detection of carcinoid tumors and various neuroendocrine tumors. Neuroendocrine cells appear in many areas, including the brain, thyroid, lungs, and GIT. For the detection of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, an octreotide scan has a sensitivity of 75 to 100%.

Octreotide radiolabeling is with indium-111. This radiolabelled tracer then attaches to the tumor cells having the receptor for somatostatin. Somatostatin exerts its anti-proliferative and anti-secretory function after attaching with one of the five types of somatostatin receptors (SSTR1- SSTR5), which are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors show their presence in the brain, pituitary, pancreas, thyroid, spleen, kidney, GIT, blood vessels, peripheral nervous system, and immune cells.

There are two types of imaging based on these receptors; the first and commonest is an octreotide scan utilizing 111 In-DTPA (diethylenetriamine pentaacetate)-D-Phe-1-octreotide and binding mainly to SSTR 2 and 5. This scan provides a planar whole-body image, which in modern medicine fuses with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and CT. Octreotide scan specificity and the anatomic details of SPECT/CT are thereby combined.
