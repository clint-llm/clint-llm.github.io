Fenofibrate is FDA approved for the management and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia, primary hypercholesterolemia, or mixed dyslipidemia. It reduces low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and total cholesterol while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in adults. Fenofibrate should be used in conjunction with a restriction of cholesterol intake and exercise if lifestyle modifications alone have been insufficient.
