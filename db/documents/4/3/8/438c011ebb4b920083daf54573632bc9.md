Specific data on cottonmouth venom toxicokinetics in humans is extremely limited.  Pit vipers have curved hollow fangs that inject venom subcutaneously. In rats who had an intramuscular injection of Agkistrodon halys ussuriensis, the absorption half-life was 2.5 hours, distribution half-life of 4.8 hours and elimination half-life of 125 hours with an apparent volume of distribution of 19 L/kg.
