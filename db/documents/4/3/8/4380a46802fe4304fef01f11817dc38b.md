Practitioners contend that frequent use of acute headache medications may reflect poorly controlled headaches and not necessarily the cause. This idea stems from evidence that not all patients improve when they stop taking headache-relieving medications. Instead of primarily blaming analgesic medication overuse as the reason for the increase in headache frequency, clinicians must be cautious in managing these patients and not overlook those in whom headaches are simply poorly controlled. Some studies suggested that other substances, such as the regular use of tranquilizers or other recreational substances abused in the general population, should be considered in conjunction with analgesics.
