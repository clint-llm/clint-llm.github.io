Because ergotamine is not specific for the 5HT-1 serotonin receptors, it can cause a broad range of side effects. A common side effect of ergotamine and caffeine use is nausea and vomiting after both oral and parenteral administration, most likely due to a direct impact on CNS emetic centers. Cramps, insomnia, and transient lower limb muscle pain can also occur.
