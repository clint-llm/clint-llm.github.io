**Hormonal**

Fibroadenoma arises from stromal and epithelial connective tissue cells that are functionally and mechanically important in the breast. These tissues contain receptors for both estrogen and progesterone. For this reason, fibroadenomas tend to proliferate during pregnancy because of excessive production of female reproductive hormones. Hormone sensitivity causes excessive proliferation of breast connective tissues.

**Genetics**

Mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12) gene is also important in the pathophysiology of fibroadenomas.
