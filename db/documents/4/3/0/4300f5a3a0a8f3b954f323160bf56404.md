The Trendelenburg sign is useful in identifying weak hip abductors as well as assessing other mechanical, neurological, and spinal disorders.Â Especially in the post-operative setting, a positive Trendelenburg sign may identify the source of patient complications. Particularly in the posterior approach to the hip, the gluteus medius is in danger of being detached from its attachment at the greater trochanter. Therefore orthopaedic surgeons must be careful in their surgical approach to avoid this complication.

A positive Trendelenburg test is a finding in the following

- Any condition that brings the origin and insertion of gluteus medius together:

- 
              
- Subluxation or dislocation of the hip
              
              
- Coxa vara
              
              
- Greater trochanter fractures
              
              
- Slipped femoral capital epiphysis
              
              
- Legg-Calve-Perthes disease

- Abductor paralysis or weakness:

- 
              
- Polio
              
              
- Root-lesion
              
              
- Post-operative nerve damage
              
              
- Muscle-wasting disease
              
              
- Hemiplegic cerebral palsy

- Short leg syndrome
              
              
- The initial time following total hip replacement
