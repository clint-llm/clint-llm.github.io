Osteonecrosis is a degenerative bone condition characterized by the death of cellular components of the bone secondary to an interruption of the subchondral blood supply. Also known as avascular necrosis, it typically affects the epiphysis of long bones at weight-bearing joints. The most common sites for AVN are the femoral head, knee, talus, and humeral head. The hip is the most common location overall. Advanced disease may result in subchondral collapse, which threatens the viability of the joint involved. Therefore, early recognition and treatment of osteonecrosis are essential. This activity discusses the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease, presentation, and treatment options of the most common forms of osteonecrosis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of osteonecrosis.
- Review the presentation of a patient with osteonecrosis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for osteonecrosis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with osteonecrosis.
