Generally, males are affected more commonly than females by hamartomas. There is no particular evidence of racial predilection. The incidence of most hamartomas remains unknown except for pulmonary hamartoma, in which the incidence rate is approximately 0.25%. Pulmonary hamartomas are 8% of all lung tumors; most of them are diagnosed incidentally. The most common patient age range is 40 to 70. Benign breast lesions have demonstrated correlations with age, hormonal factors, obesity, and family history. Increased age and BMI also increase the risk of colonic polyps.
