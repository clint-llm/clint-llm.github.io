The prognosis of allergic interstitial nephritis is favorable in cases where a diagnosis has been made promptly. Predictors of a decreased likelihood of recovery include interstitial fibrosis, interstitial granulomas, and tubular atrophy on renal biopsy. AIN with renal failure for greater than three weeks portends a worse prognosis, likely due to the development of advanced fibrotic features on biopsy. NSAID-related AIN also is associated with a worse prognosis.

Acute hemodialysis has been required in as many as 30% to 69% of patients. One series revealed that 26% of patients with AIN ultimately returned to their baseline renal function, while 4% of patients required long-term renal replacement therapy. Another series noted a more favorable prognosis, with 74% of patients returning to their baseline renal function after six weeks of withdrawal of the offending drug.

AIN due to proton-pump inhibitors has been noted to have less severe acute kidney injury but with less likelihood to recover by six months, which has been attributed to the likelihood of prolonged drug exposure.
