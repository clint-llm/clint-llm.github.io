Traction alopecia is quite common in women and usually occurs in individuals having hairstyles that produce a continuous pulling force on the hair roots. It usually occurs in women of African descent who have tight and curly spiral hair. The dermatology nurse and clinician should work together to educate the patient as traction alopecia is preventable, and with appropriate education, it could be eliminated. [Level V]
