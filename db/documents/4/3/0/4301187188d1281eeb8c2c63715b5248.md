Clinical syndromes associated with the anterior inferior cerebellar artery may be secondary to an infarction in its vascular territory, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, or, infrequently, mass effect on adjacent structures from an aneurysm.

AICA infarction may be of cardio-embolic or athero-embolic origin (rupture of atherosclerotic/arteriosclerotic plaque). Patients present with a lateral pontine syndrome, also known as the AICA syndrome and have a sudden onset of severe vertigo, nausea, vomiting, nystagmus (vestibular nuclei),  ipsilateral hemiataxia (middle cerebellar peduncle), ipsilateral, lower motor neuron facial weakness, ipsilateral loss of lacrimation and salivation, ipsilateral loss of taste from anterior 2/3rd of tongue and loss of corneal reflex (CN VII nucleus and nerve), ipsilateral loss of pain and temperature from the face (spinal trigeminal nucleus),  ipsilateral hearing loss and tinnitus (cochlear nuclei) and ipsilateral Horner's syndrome (descending sympathetic tracts). There is a contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation from the body (lateral spinothalamic tract). It is important to distinguish the AICA syndrome from lateral medullary syndrome caused by infarction in the distribution of the PICA which presents with severe dysphagia, dysarthria, and dysphonia and also does not have lower motor facial paralysis, loss of lacrimation and taste which are prominent features of the AICA syndrome.

As reported in the literature, aneurysms of the posterior fossa account for 8% to 12% of all cerebral aneurysms, with aneurysms of anterior inferior cerebellar artery accounting for about 1% to 2% of all aneurysms.

In very rare case reports, aneurysms have been noted in the distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery with the aneurysms mainly being dissecting or fusiform and rarely associated with bifurcation with about 55.5% located near the meatal loop.
