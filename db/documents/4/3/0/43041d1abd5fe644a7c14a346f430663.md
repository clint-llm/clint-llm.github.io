Frontotemporal dementia is the second most common etiology of early-onset dementia in patients under 65 years of age constituting ten percent of pathologically confirmed cases. Three percent of dementias in patients of any age are attributable to frontotemporal disease.

The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia comprises sixty percent of cases with the primary progressive aphasia subtypes occurring less frequently. Estimates for prevalence and incidence are 15 to 22 per 100,000 and 2.7 to 4.1 per 100,000, respectively, with those statistics likely under-representing actual figures due to the diagnostic difficulties of frontotemporal dementia.
