It is of great importance to educate patients on how to properly administer otic drops and the significance of adherence to treatment. The patient should lie down with their affected side facing upward, apply two to five drops depending on the prescribed drug, and remain in that position for about 3 to 5 minutes. This will maximize treatment effectiveness. Patients should also be advised to avoid water exposure and to minimize manipulation or trauma to the ear.
