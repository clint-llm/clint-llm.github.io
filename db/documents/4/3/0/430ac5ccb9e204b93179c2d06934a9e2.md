BRUE is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a pediatric nurse. The key component of management is to educate caregivers about the condition, ensure close follow-up after discharge, and provide resources for training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Admission for cardiorespiratory monitoring is not routinely indicated. There is no role for medications, tests, specialist consultations, or home cardiorespiratory monitoring. Infants that are not low-risk should be managed based on the physiological status and abnormalities identified in history and physical exam.

However, in some high-risk children, one should undertake relevant studies to ensure that there is no sinister cause of BRUE (e.g., meningitis).
