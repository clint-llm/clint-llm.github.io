Bilirubin is produced from the catabolism of heme, a breakdown product of hemoglobin, in the reticuloendothelial system (RES). First, heme is converted to biliverdin, releasing iron and carbon monoxide via the action of enzyme heme oxygenase.

Newborn infants have higher TSB levels than adults owing to higher hemoglobin levels at birth, along with a shorter RBC life span and limited conjugating ability of the newborn liver.

In severe hyperbilirubinemia, unbound and unconjugated bilirubin crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds to the brainstem, hippocampus, cerebellum, globus pallidus, and subthalamic nuclei.

Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia results from abnormalities in the uptake, metabolism, transport, and/or excretion of bile salts and bilirubin.
