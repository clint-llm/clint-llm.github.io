Despite widespread attempts at implementation of improved communication strategies with CLC, errors associated with ineffective communication are far too common. There has been a leap from problem recognition during operative training to solution implementation, failing to explore communication lapses among teams.

Salas et al. proposed a model for five elements of effective teams, including team leadership, mutual performance monitoring, backup behavior, flexibility, and team orientation, with a groundwork of mutual trust and CLC.[36] Strong leadership involves task coordination, team development, inspiring motivation, and fostering a positive environment. Performance monitoring requires enough knowledge of team members to allow identification of failures or task overload, while backup behavior requires supportive behavior from team members, including redistribution of workload and altered task delegation. Flexibility or team adaptability enables a team to acutely respond to changes in a dynamic clinical environment, while team orientation is the willingness to take the perspectives of others into account and the valuation of team goals over individual ones. Shared mental models lead to common situational awareness and an integrated treatment plan for the patient while taking into account the roles and tasks of individuals. This shared mental model allows for effective team-based problem solving and decision making.

A meta-analysis of 72 studies with 4795 teams across a range of industries revealed that successful information sharing predicted team performance.

One of the limitations to the enhancement of CLC among professionals is that different groups have different expectations regarding the content, timing, and generalized structure of information transfer, and may not grasp the roles and priorities of other groups.
