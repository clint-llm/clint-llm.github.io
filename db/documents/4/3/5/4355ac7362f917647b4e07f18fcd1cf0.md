For a percutaneous liver biopsy, there are varying needle sizes and types, with three main categories.

- Suction needles (Menghini needle, Klatskin needle, Jamshidi needle)

- Cutting needles (Vim-Silverman needle, Trucut needle)

- Spring-loaded cutting needles with triggering mechanisms

The choice of needle is primarily based upon operator preference, instrumental availability, and clinical picture.
