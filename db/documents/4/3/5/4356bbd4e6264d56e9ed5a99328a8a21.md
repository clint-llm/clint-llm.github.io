**Isolated Aldosterone Defects**

A) Defective synthesis: **Hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism**(renin-angiotensin independent; renin production is intact)

Immaturity

Immaturity of aldosterone synthetic enzymes in VPT infants

Aldosterone synthase deficiency I and II

Critically ill patients

Delayed recovery of the suppressed gland after contralateral adrenalectomy

Drug-induced diminished synthesis

Discontinuation of drugs with mineralocorticoid activity after prolonged use

B) Defective release:

Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism (renin-angiotensin dependent; decreased renin or Ang II production results in decreased aldosterone production

a) Congenital.

b) Acquired (type 4 RTA).

- Diabetes

- Various nephropathies

- Autonomic neuropathy

- Sickle cell disease

- HIV disease

C) Medications such as NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, ACEI/ARBs

D) Aldosterone resistance:

Genetic

i) Autosomal dominant pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA AD)

ii) Autosomal recessive pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA AR)

Acquired

i) Urinary tract infection (UTI) and obstructive uropathy (PHA III, resistance to ALD)

ii) Medications

iii) Downregulation of MR in renal tubules (solid organ transplant)

Adrenal failure due to congenital or acquired causes can sometimes present initially as isolated aldosterone deficiency and later on progresses to involve the cortisol axis.

Hypoaldosteronism can occur in both congenital and acquired conditions as part of a general adrenal failure as in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), adrenal hypoplasia (AHC), or acquired adrenal destruction and are not discussed here.
