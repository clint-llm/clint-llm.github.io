Cervical clear-cell carcinoma has a similar histologic appearance to clear-cell carcinomas found elsewhere in the gynecologic tract such as the vagina, the endometrium, and the ovary.

**Macroscopic Findings**

The tumor is often located in the endocervical canal and can have either an exophytic or an endophytic appearance.

**Microscopic Findings**

Histologically, there are three growth patterns:

- Tubulocystic

- Papillary

- Solid

The cells can range from flat to hobnail with mild to severe atypia. The cytoplasm can be optically clear or eosinophilic. Mitotic figures are infrequent. Cervical squamous cell carcinoma has a well-known precursor lesion, as do many types of adenocarcinoma. However, to date, no premalignant analog of cervical clear cell adenocarcinoma has been described.

**Immunohistochemical Study**

The immunohistochemical study is usually noncontributory to the diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix.

Napsin A and HNF1-beta are positive; PR, ER, and p16 are negative, normal p53 expression in most cases.
