**Myonecrosis/Rhabdomyolysis:**Rhabdomyolysis may develop as a result of venom-induced myonecrosis. A patient’s total CK and renal function require monitoring if rhabdomyolysis is suspected. Treatment does not differ from other causes of rhabdomyolysis.

**Compartment syndrome:**As addressed in the previous sections, compartment syndrome is a rare but serious complication of pit viper envenomation. Any patients with suspected compartment syndrome should receive antivenom prior to any surgical fasciotomy or digital dermatomy. Serial compartment pressures can be obtained to monitor progression or improvement.

**Bleeding:**Though clinically significant bleeding is rare, bleeding may occur either at the site of envenomation or at distal sites; this is due to the venom’s effect on both the coagulation pathways and platelet aggregation.

**Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:**Antivenom is the first-line treatment for any hematologic abnormalities. Transfusion should only be a consideration after administering antivenom.

**Angioedema/hives:**As discussed in the previous sections, hypersensitivity reactions are uncommon. If present, treatment includes steroids, epinephrine, and antihistamines in addition to antivenom. Airway management may be necessary if significant angioedema is present.
