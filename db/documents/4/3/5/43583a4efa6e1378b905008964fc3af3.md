Recent group consensusÂ recommendations were against radiographic imaging for patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for BPPV if there are no additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV. There is no need for vestibular testing for patients who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms. The routine treatment of BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines should be avoided.
