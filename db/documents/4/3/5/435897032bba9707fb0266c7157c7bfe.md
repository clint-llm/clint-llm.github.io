For CT and MRI imaging, patients should lie in a supine position on the CT table with the patient’s head in the head holder. Patients should remain as immobile as possible during the study to prevent motion artifacts. Contrast is useful for visualizing the extraocular muscles and vascular structures.

During ultrasonography of the eye, the patient should be sitting as comfortably as possible and upright in the examination chair. The patient’s head should be resting on the headrest, and eyes should be closed. There should be a layer of methylcellulose gel between the probe and the eyelid. During the dynamic examination, while the probe is placed over the eyelid, the patient will gaze upward, downward, left, and right as directed by the examiner. The patient’s head should remain still during the entire exam.

For ASOCT, the patient should be sitting upright in an examination chair. The chair height should be adjusted so that the patient’s chin comfortably rests in the chinrest of the machine. The patient should open both eyes and look forward towards the target light either inside the camera or on an external light source. For the best quality images, the patient should not move and should open the eyes completely between normal blinking.
