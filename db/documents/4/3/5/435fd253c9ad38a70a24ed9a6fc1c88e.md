Both the primary caregiver and nurse practitioner should be familiar with BAL. The technique involves instillation of sterile normal saline into a subsegment of the lung, followed by suction and collection of the instillation for analysis. This procedure is typically facilitated by the introduction of a flexible bronchoscope into a sub-segment of the lung. The procedure as we know it today was popularized in 1974 by the work of American physicians, Reynolds and Newball, in Maryland. Today, it serves predominantly as a diagnostic tool for the evaluation of lower respiratory tract pathology and in some uncommon conditions, also has therapeutic utility. While any health professional can perform BAL, the procedure is best performed by a pulmonologist or thoracic surgeon for optimal results.
