The two most common and most significant complications arising from saphenous vein grafting in the setting of CABG are thrombosis and atherosclerosis.  Both complications result in significantly decreased duration of vessel patency–graft failure is as high as ten to twenty-five percent after twelve to eighteen months postoperatively, with a 5 percent increase in failure rate for each year beyond five years post-bypass.

Beyond concerns for long-term patency, additional complications may relate to the harvest itself at the harvest site. These include, but are not limited to, persistent post-operative pain/paresthesias, surgical site infections, development of lower extremity varicosities and lower extremity swelling secondary to reduced venous outflow after vein removal. OVH, in particular, may result in increased postoperative pain and persistent paresthesias related to incision length and incidental nerve injury during dissection and are at an increased risk of developing surgical site infections given the length of the incision.
