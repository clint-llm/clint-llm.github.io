COVID-19 is an acute viral illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory system; however, it can also affect other major organ systems. Since the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, multiple new variants of concern have emerged, such as the Alpha (B.1.1.7); Beta (B.1.351); and Gamma (P.1); Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529) which are associated with enhanced transmissibility and increased virulence. This activity discusses these new variants and the latest novel therapeutics available to manage COVID-19. It also highlights the role of clinical interprofessional teams, public health agencies, and community participation in improving care for patients with this illness.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical manifestations, including extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.
- Outline the latest treatments available in the management of COVID-19.
- Summarize the vaccines available to prevent COVID-19 and their efficacy against the new variants.
- Review the importance of having a holistic and interprofessional team approach to enhance the delivery of care for patients with COVID-19 leading to improved patient outcomes.
