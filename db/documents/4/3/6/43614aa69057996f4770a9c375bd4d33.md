For the treatment of ocular hypertension and open-angle glaucoma, betaxolol is administered in its topical form, a 0.5% betaxolol hydrochloride ophthalmic solution. The current guidelines recommend one drop of 0.5% betaxolol hydrochloride ophthalmic solution twice daily in the affected eye(s). This dosing equates to approximately 28 μg per day. Patients should see a stabilization in the decrease in intraocular pressure within a few weeks. If the desired response does not occur, the patient’s clinician can consider adding other medications to the treatment regimen.

For the treatment of hypertension, betaxolol is administered in its oral form at a starting dose of 10 mg at bedtime. Betaxolol is either used as monotherapy or in combination with a diuretic. If the desired antihypertensive response does not occur within 7 to 14 days, the patient’s clinician can consider doubling the dose. Although betaxolol is not proven to show a significant increase in its efficacy beyond 20 mg, the dose can safely increase up to a maximum of 40 mg daily.
