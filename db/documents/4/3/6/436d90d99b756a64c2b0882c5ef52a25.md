**Abacavir:**Patients with the HLA-B*5701 allele or prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir or moderate or severe hepatic impairment.

**Emtricitabine:**Patients with previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to any of the components of the products.

**Lamivudine:**Patients with a previous hypersensitivity reaction to lamivudine.

**Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate:**Previous hypersensitivity and/or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 50.

**Zidovudine:**Patients who have had potentially life-threatening allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to any of the components of the formulations.

**Efavirenz:**Patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity, for example, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, or toxic skin eruptions) to any of the ingredients of this product. Co-administration of efavirenz with elbasvir and grazoprevir is contraindicated.

**Etravirine:**Hypersensitivity

**Nevirapine:**In patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment or for use as occupational and non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimens. Women with CD4 greater than 250 or men with CD4 greater than 400 due to an increased probability of hypersensitivity reaction. Hepatotoxicity is largely cholestatic but demonstrates hepatocellular pattern as well. In some cases, reports of clinically apparent hepatotoxicity present after the first eight weeks of therapy but can be severe and fatal.

**Rilpivirine:**Contraindicated for co-administration with all of the following; carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, rifapentine, dexamethasone, St. John’s wort, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole.

**Atazanavir:**In patients with previously demonstrated clinically significant hypersensitivity, for example, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, or toxic skin eruptions, to any of the ingredients of formulations. Concurrent administration of medications is highly dependent on CYP3A, or UGT1A1 for clearance is associated with elevated plasma concentrations of the interacting drugs and severe life-threatening events. When co-administered with drugs that strongly induce CYP3A4, it may lead to lower exposure and loss of efficacy of formulations.

**Darunavir:**Co-administration of formulations is contraindicated with medications highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and life-threatening events.

**Fosamprenavir:**In patients with previously demonstrated clinically significant hypersensitivity, for example, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, to any of the components of this product or amprenavir. When co-administered with medications that are highly dependent on cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and life-threatening events.

**Ritonavir:**Contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity, for example, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), or Stevens-Johnson syndrome, to ritonavir or any of its ingredients. Ritonavir is contraindicated with medications highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and life-threatening reactions. It is also contraindicated with drugs that are potent CYP3A inducers, where significantly reduced lopinavir plasma concentrations may correlate with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance and cross-resistance.

**Saquinavir:**Contraindicated in those with congenital long QT syndrome, those with refractory hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, and with concurrent administration with drugs that increase saquinavir plasma concentrations and prolong the QT interval. It is also contraindicated in people with complete atrioventricular (AV) block without implanted pacemakers or patients at high risk of complete AV block. In addition, it is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reaction, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to saquinavir, saquinavir mesylate, or any of its ingredients.; in patients with severe hepatic impairment. It is also contraindicated with drugs that are CYP3A substrates, for which increased plasma levels may result in serious or life-threatening reactions.

**Tipranavir:**Use of tipranavir is contraindicated with concurrent administration of drugs highly dependent on CYP3A4 for clearance or potent CYP3A4 inducers due to increased risk of intracranial bleeding. Tipranavir is also contradicted in moderate to severe hepatic impairment.

**Enfuvirtide:**Known hypersensitivity to enfuvirtide or any of its components.

**Maraviroc:**This drug is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD (CrCl less than 30 mL per minute), concomitantly taking potent CYP3A inhibitors or inducers.

**Dolutegravir:**Previous hypersensitivity reaction to dolutegravir or receiving dofetilide due to the potential for higher dofetilide plasma concentrations and the risk for severe and life-threatening events.

**Raltegravir:**None

**Ibalizumab:**None

**Cobicistat:**The concomitant use of cobicistat with atazanavir is contraindicated with drugs dependent on CYP3A or UGT1A1(UDP Glucuronosyl transferase Family 1 Member A1) for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations of the interacting drugs are due to serious life-threatening events. Darunavir and cobicistat should not be co-administered with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance which may lead to increased plasma concentrations and life-threatening events.
