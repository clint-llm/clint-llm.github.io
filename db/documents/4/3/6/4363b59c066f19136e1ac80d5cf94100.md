Fluoxetine is rarely lethal in monotherapy overdose. However, when taken in conjunction with alcohol, it may cause ataxia and respiratory depression. The drug may cause serotonin syndrome (clinical constellation of changes in mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular abnormalities) when taken in excessive amounts or combined with other agents that increase serotonin levels.
