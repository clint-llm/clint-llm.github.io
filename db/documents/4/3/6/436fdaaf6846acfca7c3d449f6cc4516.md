Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) is a constellation of symptoms that arise from a congenital heart defect and result in large anatomic shunts. Due to anatomic variations present at birth, hemodynamic forces initially result in a left-right shunt, which develops into severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and elevated vascular resistance. Ultimately, due to increased pulmonary vascular resistance, the left-to-right shunt will become a right-to-left shunt, resulting in significant hypoxemia and cyanosis. This activity a discussion of the evaluation and treatment of Eisenmenger syndrome and further defines the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of Eisenmenger syndrome.
- Identify patients considered high risk for Eisenmenger syndrome
- Describe the physical exam findings associated with Eisenmenger syndrome.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected with Eisenmenger syndrome.
