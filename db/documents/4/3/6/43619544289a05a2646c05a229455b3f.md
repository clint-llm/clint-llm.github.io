The osteoarthritis cascade causes many complications as the disease progresses. Osteoarthritis of the spine can cause pain, functional impairment, and disability. Pathologically osteoarthritis can cause spinal stenosis, herniated nucleus pulposus, myelopathy, radiculopathy, spondyloarthritis, and spondylolisthesis.

Spondylosis is a complication that can cause radiculopathy, myelopathy, and vascular impingement.

Spinal stenosis can lead to two clinical syndromes, including cervical myeloradiculopathy and lumbar neurogenic claudication. Stenosis of the lumbar spine can manifest as persistent or intermittent pain, weakness, dermatomal sensory symptoms exacerbated by standing or walking and relieved by sitting or lying down.

Herniated discs cause persistent low back pain in one to two percent of the population from 35 to 45 years old.

Degeneration in the lumbar spine can eventually lead to degenerative spondylolisthesis, which most commonly occurs at L4 on L5, in which the superior vertebral segment slides forward on the inferior segment as a result of the weakened facet joint.
