Human metapneumovirus can present as either upper respiratory tract infection or lower respiratory tract infection.

- Common symptoms of **upper respiratory tract infection**include cough, rhinorrhea, congestion, and sore throat.

- **Lower respiratory tract infection**symptoms include wheezing, fever, cough, dyspnea, hypoxia. More often, lower respiratory tract infections in children cause bronchiolitis, acute asthma exacerbations, croup, and pneumonia. This may necessitate hospital admission, depending on the severity of symptoms.

- In adults, HMPV can cause pneumonia, acute asthma exacerbations, and acute exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting have also been noted. Abnormal tympanic membrane suggestive of acute otitis media can also occur. These symptoms can be quite severe in adults with comorbidities, age greater than 65 years old, and immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV, cancer, immunomodulatory therapy, and transplant recipients.
