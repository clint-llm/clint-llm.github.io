When the patient presents to the ED in cardiac arrest, TEE can provide valuable information, quickly and at low risk, and therefore improve outcome and patient survival. In acute myocardial infarction, TEE visualization of the hypokinetic area of the myocardium can inform the cardiologist of the affected vessel, quantify ejection fraction, guide intra-arterial balloon placement, help look at the patient’s volume status, identify unstable etiology, and guide management.
