Any procedure that includes a gastrojejunostomy permanently alters the patient's anatomy; therefore, the care of this patient population includes not just the perioperative period but the patient's entire life. While signs and symptoms concerning a bowel obstruction can be treated in a typical patient with nasogastric decompression and bowel rest, it may represent an internal hernia and, therefore, a life-threatening condition in a patient with a gastrojejunostomy. Every individual involved in the care for a patient with a gastrojejunostomy must be aware of the procedure performed so that they may be vigilant for signs or symptoms that are typically benign in the average patient but highly concerning in gastrojejunostomy patients. Therefore clear and constant communication between the entire healthcare team throughout is particularly criticalÂ in this patient population to ensure that subtle but significant findings are not missed.
