Histologic evidence of empty osteocytic lacunae is consistent with osteonecrosis. When evaluating early necrosis, there may be a loss of nuclear staining of marrow cells and the appearance of large, ovoid, fat-containing spaces appear. Small vessels will show evidence of necrosis. An increased amount of foamy histiocytes and woven bone may be present as well.
