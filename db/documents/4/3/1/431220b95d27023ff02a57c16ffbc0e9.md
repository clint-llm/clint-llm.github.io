Any cause of hyperthyroidism can lead to thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. They include Grave disease (most common), toxic nodular goiter, solitary toxic nodule, iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis, excess exogenous thyroxine use, thyroiditis, thyrotropin-secreting pituitary adenoma, and amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.

Common factors triggering attacks of periodic paralysis include the consumption of carbohydrate-rich foods, strenuous physical activity, high salt/sodium intake, stresses (surgical, infectious, psychological), trauma, and drugs (diuretics, estrogens, acetazolamide, epinephrine, laxatives, corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, licorice, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and ecstasy).
