The initial approach to any trauma patient is described in the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) course; it is a structured and standardized approach. The approach is meant to recognize and stabilize life-threatening injuries first. It is important to note an initial detailed history is not essential to begin evaluating a patient with acute injuries. The emergency medical system (EMS) personnel bringing the patient to the trauma/resuscitation area of the emergency department (ED) will provide a brief history of present illness. After the initial evaluation and stabilization of the patient, a detailed history can be obtained. A few useful facts include the mechanism of injury,Â whether the patient was ambulatory at the scene, bowel or bladder incontinence, and any numbness or weakness. In an awake trauma patient, the history and physical exam are highly sensitive for pelvic trauma.
