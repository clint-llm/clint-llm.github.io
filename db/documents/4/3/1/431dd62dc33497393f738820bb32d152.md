Ibuprofen use is contraindicated in patients with a known history of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions to the drug itself, other NSAIDs, or aspirin. Numerous case studies detail ibuprofen as a precipitant of disease after usage.

Research on NSAID-induced hypersensitivity reactions in the pediatric population showed similar prevalence but differences in the clinical phenotypes. Oral provocation testing is still the gold standard for diagnosing NSAID hypersensitivity, and safe alternatives for cross-intolerant children and adolescents exist, including tolmetin, etoricoxib, paracetamol, and nimesulide.

In preterm neonates, ibuprofen lysine IV formulation is contraindicated in those with congenital heart diseases requiring patency of the PDA, active bleeding, thrombocytopenia, renal impairment, coagulation defects, and proven or proven or suspected necrotizing enterocolitis. Aside from this, ibuprofen use has been shown not to have any increased adverse effects when used in infants younger than six months and is still indicated for use in pediatric populations outside these contraindications.

In Canada, ibuprofen has contraindications listed on drug labels for additional conditions, including active GI or cerebrovascular bleeding, uncontrolled heart failure, lupus, renal impairment, and hepatic impairment or disease.
