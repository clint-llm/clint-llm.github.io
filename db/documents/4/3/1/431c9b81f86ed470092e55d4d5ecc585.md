The serosanguinous and/or hemorrhagic fluid collection associated with caput succedaneum notably lies superior to the cranial suture lines and thus will also cross the midline. This important distinguishing characteristic is due to the site of fluid accumulation superior to the periosteum and epicranial aponeurosis and inferior to the subcutis and cutis layer of the scalp. The cranial suture lines are collagenous sites for future intramembranous bone growth that lay inferior to the periosteum. The fluid accumulation in caput succedaneum is superior to the cranial sutures leading to an edematous, fluctuant, pitting mass that crosses the cranial sutures lines on an exam. This is an important distinguishing feature from cephalohematoma (birth trauma resulting in edema that does not cross cranial suture lines) and other related injuries.

The initial location of the edema depends on the etiology of the trauma. For example, during protracted labor, the fetal head is compressed by the uterus. The resulting edema moves to the side opposite of contact while following the path of least resistance. Contrasted with instrument-assisted delivery, the resulting edema presents quickly at the site that the instrument makes contact with the scalp.
