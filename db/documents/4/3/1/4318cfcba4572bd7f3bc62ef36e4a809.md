Clinically, the main use of secretin is in the diagnosis of gastrin-secreting tumors, such as in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Under normal physiologic conditions, secretin inhibits gastrin release; however, in gastrinoma pathologies, the administration of secretin will cause an overall increase in gastrin release. This idea is the basis for the secretin stimulation test, which is used to determine the presence of gastrin-producing tumors.

Secretin plays a role in diagnosing pancreatic insufficiency. Administration of secretin increases pancreatic secretions and causes dilation of pancreatic ducts. Therefore, secretin administration occurs during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to aid in cannulization.
