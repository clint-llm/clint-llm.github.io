There are potential toxicities in patients administered oxygen in high concentrations (above 50%) for long periods like atelectasis, oxidative stress, and peripheral vasoconstriction, but the benefits outweigh the risks. Uncontrolled oxygen delivery may lead to a worsening of hypercapnia in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is advised to target the SpO2Â to 90% to 92% to prevent tissue hypoxia while minimizing any side effects, which might be associated with excessive oxygen supplementation.

- Patients should be made aware of the dangers of using home oxygen in the presence of any naked flame, such as cookers and candles. Oxygen cylinders should be at least 5 feet away from naked flames, a heat source, or electrical devices.

- There is a significant risk of fire associated with smoking while using home oxygen therapy. Smoking cessation should be advocated. And a written education plan should be given to patients before ordering home oxygen.

- The skin around the facemask or nasal cannula can get irritated or bruised if the mask fits tightly.

- The nasal mucosa might become dry, and nosebleeds can occur.

- Morning headache or tiredness can occur with oxygen therapy.
