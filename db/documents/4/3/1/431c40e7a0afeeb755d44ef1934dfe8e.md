The organ systems involved in theÂ immune response are primarily lymphoid organs which include, spleen, thymus, bone marrow, lymph nodes, tonsils, and liver. The lymphoid organ system classifies according to the following:

- Primary lymphoid organs (thymus and bone marrow), where T and B cells first express antigen receptors and become mature functionally.

- Secondary lymphoid organs like the spleen, tonsils, lymph nodes, the cutaneous and mucosal immune system; this is where B and T lymphocytes recognize foreign antigens and develop appropriate immune responses.

T lymphocytes mature in the thymus, where these cells reach a stage of functional competence while B lymphocytes mature in the bone marrow the site of generation of all circulating blood cells. Excessive release of cytokines stimulated by these organisms can cause tissue damage, such as endotoxin shock syndrome.
