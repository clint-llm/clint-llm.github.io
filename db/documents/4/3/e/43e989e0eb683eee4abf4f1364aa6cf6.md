The interossei muscles are intrinsic muscles of the hand locatedÂ between the metacarpals. They consist of four (or three) palmar and four dorsal muscles that, respectively. These muscles are responsible for finger adduction and abduction. Synchronously, the palmar and dorsal interossei assist in flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints and extension of the interphalangeal joints. All interossei muscles receive innervation from the deep ulnar branch of the ulnar nerve. Therefore, any injury to the ulnar nerve may have debilitating implications on specific intrinsic hand muscle functions, including finger abduction and adduction, which is primarily controlled by the interossei muscles.
