Anatomical variants may make the placement of either the anterograde or retrograde cardioplegia catheter technically difficult, or placement of the aortic cross-clamp may be contraindicated altogether. Severe ascending aorta calcification or unstable atheromas increases the risk of dissection and stroke following the removal of the aortic cross-clamp, and alternate sites of cannulation must be used, such as the subclavian or femoral artery.
