The primary trigger for NMS is dopamine receptor blockade, most often due to an antipsychotic agent. NMS is usually associated with high-potency first-generation neuroleptic agents but also may be caused by low-potency and atypical antipsychotic agents, antiemetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and lithium. Rapid withdrawal of dopaminergic drugs, most often used to manage parkinsonian diseases, such as levodopa and amantadine, also may cause this syndrome. The rapid switching of one Parkinson medication to another also is associated with the development of NMS.
