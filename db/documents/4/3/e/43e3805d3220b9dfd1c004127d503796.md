PC is considered a terminal illness with a poor prognosis. Whether cancer originates in the peritoneum or spreads from somewhere else, it is advanced and stage IV. The primary peritoneal cancer has a survival rate varying from 11-17 months.

The factors affecting EOPPC in the univariate analysis include patient age, stage, performance status, and residual tumor size after CRS, and in multivariate analysis performance status (p<0.001) and residual tumor size (p=0.03) are significant.

In MPM, histological type holds prognostic significance, with the epithelioid subtype having the best prognosis. In a study, median survival in epithelioid MPM was 55 months compared to 13 months in the biphasic subtype. Moreover, sarcomatoid features (p=0.0006), depth of invasion (p=0.02), CCR 2-3 (p=0.02), and inflammatory stroma (p=0.04) were other factors associated with worse prognosis.

In DSRCT, the prognosis is dismal, with a 5-year survival of only 15% to 30%. The extra-abdominal presence of tumors is associated with worse prognosis, while surgical resection in loco-regional disease and radiotherapy in metastatic disease offers better survival.

The stage and size of leiomyosarcoma are the two factors influencing its overall bad prognosis (64% at five years).

Prognostic factors associated with secondary PC from GIT tumors include tumor histopathology, stage of the tumor, PCI score, and CCR score.
