Blunt abdominal trauma results in thousands of admission each year, resulting in great costs to the healthcare system. while the actual injury is managed by a team of healthcare professionals, there is also focus on preventing such injuries. The nurses not only are responsible for monitoring these patients but they also have an important role in patient education. To prevent blunt abdominal trauma, the public has to be educated on wearing a safety belt. These safety devices have to be worn even if the motor vehicle comes fitted with airbags. More important, the public has to be educated about defensive driving and maintaining a safe distance from other automobiles on the road. Plus, the public should be told about the consequences of drinking and driving. Finally, the nurse and the pharmacist should educate the public on avoiding distractions in the car like eating, texting or using a mobile phone.

**Outcomes**

In the past two decades, the outcomes of blunt abdominal trauma have improved. However, there are very few papers published on long-term data and hence the eventual outcome of these patients remains unknown. For patients with minor blunt trauma, the outcomes are good but for those who suffer multiple organ injuries, the in-hospital mortality can vary from 3-10%. The ready availability of CT scans has also allowed physicians to closely monitor these patients without performing unnecessary surgeries.
