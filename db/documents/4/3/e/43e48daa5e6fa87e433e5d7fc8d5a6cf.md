Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) accounts for approximately 90% of all focal entrapment neuropathy, making it a frequent electrodiagnostic consultation. It is present in about 3.8% of the general population. It is more common in women than in men, and while it occurs in all age groups, incidence generally reaches a peak within the age of 40 to 60 years.

The clinical presentation typically reveals numbness, weakness, and paresthesias within the thumb, index, middle, and radial side of the ring finger.

Depending on the severity of the patient's symptoms, they can categorize into three stages. Stage 1 presents with frequent awakenings at night due to tingling in their hands and fingers, which may last through the morning with associated stiffness. Stage 2 shows symptoms that are also present during the day. Motor deficits may also be apparent with patients reporting dropping objects from their hands. Stage 3, the final stage, demonstrates atrophy of the thenar muscles and may respond poorly to surgical decompression.
