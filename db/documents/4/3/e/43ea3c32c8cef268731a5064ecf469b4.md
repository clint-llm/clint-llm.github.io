There are several common US-guided techniques for arthrocentesis.  Included are several in-plane and out-of-plane techniques. For convention, in-plane refers to a position with the needle directly below the US transducer with the full length of the needle in constant view on the US screen. Out-of-plane technique refers to a US view in which a portion of the needle, ideally the tip, will be visualized on the US screen.  For the out-of-plane technique, the needle will be perpendicular to the US probe and inserted at a steep angle with triangulation to introduce the needle tip at a depth of the effusion as seen on the US screen. A general rule to adhere to with the out-of-plane technique is that the needle tip should never be advanced beyond the probe. If this occurs, the operator should halt the movement of the needle and slowly slide the probe away from the needle. This maneuver will cause the visualized portion of the needle to disappear from the US window. At this point, the operator should then slowly slide back towards the needle so that the needle tip is identified. All of these adjustments should be made while maintaining the same orientation of the US probe.

Below are the authors’ recommendations for US-guided techniques for arthrocentesis of the ankle, elbow, hip, knee, shoulder, and wrist. Please note that there are variations to these suggested techniques in the literature.

**Ankle Arthrocentesis**

Begin by identifying the anatomical landmarks; the tibialis anterior tendon and the medial malleolus. Place the probe with the marker cephalad, identifying the tibia on the US screen, and then slide the probe distally until the space between the tibia and the talus is found. While maintaining this orientation, move the probe slightly medial so that it is between the tibialis anterior tendon and the medial malleolus. Using an out-of-plane approach, insert the needle at a steep angle adjacent to the middle of the probe. Begin aspirating once the needle tip is seen within the effusion.

**Elbow Arthrocentesis**

Place the patient’s elbow in 90 degrees of flexion while the arm is resting on a table. Place the US probe in a longitudinal axis at the distal humerus. This position should allow the clinician to visualize the triceps muscle/tendon, the posterior fat pad, the distal humerus, and the proximal ulna or olecranon fossa. The clinician should assess for effusion below the triceps tendon in the olecranon fossa from this longitudinal position. If an effusion is identified, the probe can rotate 90 degrees into a transverse or short-axis view. In this view, the triceps tendon is visualized in a transverse plane, and the effusion should be located below the tendon. Once in this position, freeze the US image and approximate the depth of needle entry by measuring from the probe to the effusion. This is the depth that the needle should be inserted lateral to medial. The needle can then be inserted at the appropriate depth in a flat approach using an in-plane US technique. The needle approach should be seen approaching lateral to medial, with the needle advancing towards the effusion in the olecranon fossa. Given the flat and parallel approach, the needle tip should be easily seen for the duration of the procedure.

**Hip Arthrocentesis**

The US machine should be at the head of the bed before setting up for arthrocentesis. Following the procedure set up, the probe should be placed on the inguinal groove with the probe marker always to the patient’s anatomic right. This positioning will give a US window that should include the femoral nerve, artery, and vein in the near field and the femoral head and neck in the far-field. At this point, rotate the probe so that the inferior or medial portion of the probe faces the umbilicus. For a right-sided hip arthrocentesis, the non-probe marker side will point towards the umbilicus, and for a left-sided hip arthrocentesis, the side with the probe marker will point towards the umbilicus.  This convention will make anatomical sense when performing hip arthrocentesis using an in-plane approach from the lateral aspect regardless of the side of this hip.

The clinician should now see the femoral head, femoral neck, anterior synovial recess, and the iliofemoral ligament on the US screen from this rotated view. These important landmarks must be identified before attempting arthrocentesis.  After the landmarks are identified, insert the needle in a longitudinal approach directly below the transducer. As this is an in-plane US technique, the needle should be visualized throughout the procedure. The needle tip should be advanced into the anterior synovial recess. As the needle enters into the anterior synovial recess, begin to aspirate the effusion.

**Knee Arthrocentesis**

Place the probe above the patella with the probe marker in a cephalad position; this view should aid in locating the effusion. The US window should include the superior portion of the patella, the quadriceps femoris tendon (long axis), fat pad, and femur. The effusion will be located below the quadriceps tendon and above the femur. While the echo signal will vary depending on the type of effusion, it will typically appear as a hypoechoic fluid space. From this longitudinal position above the patella, rotate the probe 90 degrees into a transverse view so that the marker faces the patient's right side. Freeze the US image and approximate the depth of needle entry by measuring from the probe to the effusion. This is the depth that the needle should be inserted lateral to medial. The needle should be advanced in a flat and parallel approach at the measured depth using an in-plane US technique. Continue to advance the needle into the suprapatellar space. The needle tip should be seen advancing into the effusion below the quadriceps tendon. Be sure to avoid the fat pad while aspirating, as this will cause discomfort during the procedure.

**Shoulder Arthrocentesis**

The US-guided arthrocentesis of the shoulder is typically performed from the posterior glenohumeral view. This view allows for an easy and reliable assessment of the synovial joint between the glenoid fossa and humeral head. To correctly position the probe in the posterior glenohumeral view, first, palpate the scapular spine along the lateral portion where the humerus and glenoid fossa meet. Next, place the linear or curvilinear transducer directly below the palpated spine of the scapula in a parallel fashion. The probe marker will typically be positioned to the operator’s left as this will make for easy positional awareness with the US. The patient should be positioned upright / sitting with the US machine adjacent or in front of the patient on the side of the affected shoulder with the screen facing posteriorly. The physician should be standing behind the patient, looking towards the US screen. This allows for easy interpretation of position, and thus the probe marker should face to the left of the screen regardless of laterality if the physician is behind the patient.

Once the probe has been positioned under the spine of the scapula, slide laterally until the scapular notch is seen, followed by the glenoid and humeral head. This view allows for evaluation of a shoulder effusion as well as shoulder dislocations.

**Wrist Arthrocentesis**

Place the patient with their wrist on a towel with the palmar surface down so it is held in a slightly flexed position. Place the transducer with the probe marker facing laterally towards the ulnar aspect. This view should include listers tubercle on the distal radius, the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon, and the extensor carpi radialis longus. Then rotate the US approximately 90 degrees so that the probe is positioned longitudinally along the radius; the scaphoid and radius, or the radioscaphoid joint, should now be in view. Using a steep angle, enter the area in an out-of-plane approach between listers tubercle and the extensor carpi radialis brevis. The needle tip will emerge into the effusion, and aspiration should then be performed.
