Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Practitioners should educate all patients about the risk and benefits of anticoagulation. It is important to explain to patients that the risk of stroke increases exponentially each year without anticoagulation. Clinicians should offer the patient choices among various anticoagulation options and treatment strategies to improve adherence and decrease the side effect profile. Stress should be laid on regular INR testing to maintain a therapeutic range while taking warfarin. Furthermore, physicians should counsel the patient about red-flag signs such as shortness of breath, palpitations, fatigue, and weight gain. Patients should learn to reduce AF recurrence non-pharmacologically by cutting down on caffeine intake, avoiding alcohol, and exercising regularly.
