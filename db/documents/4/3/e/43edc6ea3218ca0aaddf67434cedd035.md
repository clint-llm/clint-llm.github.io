The nerves of the peripheral nervous system are classified into different types based on a multitude of factors, including diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity, see Table 1. Aα- and Aβ-fibers are considered large nerve fibers, while Aδ- and C-fibers are considered small nerve fibers. Amongst small fibers, myelinated Aδ-fibers demonstrate faster conduction velocities (4 to 36 m/s) than unmyelinated C-fibers (0.4 to 2.8 m/s).

SFN is defined as a dysfunction of these small Aδ and C fibers, which occurs by an unclear mechanism. Demyelinating processes are unlikely to be the underlying pathogenesis as demyelinating processes do not solely affect small fibers. Thus it is believed that distal axonal loss or neuronal degeneration is the most likely underlying etiology for SFN.
