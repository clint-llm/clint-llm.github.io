Patent urachus refers to a spectrum of umbilical disorders that result from the failure of involution of normal embryologic tissues that connect the developing bladder to the umbilical cord. Similarly, presentation is variable and can be readily evident at birth with umbilical cord abnormalities or diagnosed later in adolescence with the complaint of persistent umbilical wetness or recurrent umbilical infection. Surgical management in the form of local exploration with excision versus a laparoscopic approach is generally undertaken, but conservative management is gaining traction. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of patent urachus and highlights the healthcare team's role in accurately evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the embryologic origin of a patent urachus.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of a patent urachus.
- Review the management options available for patent urachus.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis of patent urachus to improve time to potential intervention.
