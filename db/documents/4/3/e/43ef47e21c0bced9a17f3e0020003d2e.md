Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) staining on skin biopsy specimen should be realized because it is considered the most sensitive and specific examination used for confirming the diagnosis. It confirms the diagnosis by showing positive linear C in 100% of the cases, and occasionally IgG in 30%, depositions along the dermal-epidermal junction of lesional, perilesional and clinically normal skin. DIF sometimes remains positive even for six months to 4 years after clinical remission.

Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (indirect IF) allows the detection of circulating IgG antibodies in the patient's serum in 30% to approximately 100% of cases.

ELISA-BP180 is very sensitive and specific (approximately 95%) for the diagnosis of pemphigoid gestationis. His positivity would allow to differentiate GP from other pruriginous dermatoses of pregnancy reliably and to potentially render obsolete the practice of a direct immunofluorescence test, which nevertheless remains the reference standard.

Its positivity would make it possible to reliably distinguish pemphigoid gravidarum from other pruriginous dermatoses of the pregnancy, and potentially make obsolete the practice of a direct immunofluorescence examination, which nevertheless remains still the reference standard. The result of the ELISA-BP180 is semi-quantitative, and its evolution correlates with the activity of the disease.
