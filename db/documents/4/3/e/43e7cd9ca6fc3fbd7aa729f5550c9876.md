In a patient under intravenous sedation or general anesthesia, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) uses an electric current to create a generalized cerebral seizure. Although it is primarily utilized to treat patients with severe depression, patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, catatonia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and bipolar disorder may also benefit. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and complications of ECT and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with mental health disorders.

**Objectives:**
- Explain how the effects of electroconvulsive therapy.
- Discuss the potential uses of electroconvulsive therapy.
- Review misinformation associated with electroconvulsive therapy.
- Describe electroconvulsive therapy, and review the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who undergo ECT.
