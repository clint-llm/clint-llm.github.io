Behavior therapy achieves goals in therapy that medication alone may not be able to accomplish. It has long-lasting effects on the individual even after the behavior plan is no longer in place because the new behavior is already established. Behavior can change the way a person thinks and feels about themselves which in psychiatry is an ultimate goal.
