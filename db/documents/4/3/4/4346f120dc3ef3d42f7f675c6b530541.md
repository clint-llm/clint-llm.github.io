There is no direct toxicity with this medication. High doses and overdoses could lead to hypotension, and patients should be supported clinically with volume resuscitation if necessary or pressor support.

The literature reportsÂ a case of an overdose of prazosin in a pediatric patient with hypotension, which was refractory to volume resuscitation, epinephrine, and norepinephrine support. This patient had concomitant ingestion with naproxen and acetaminophen. Given the hepatic metabolism of both acetaminophen and prazosin, this likely led to the prolonged clearing of the medication. The patient did respond to vasopressin.
