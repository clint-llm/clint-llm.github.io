Pneumonia is a common cause of mortality and morbidity. It can have a myriad of clinical presentations and can pose a diagnostic dilemma especially in the setting of severely ill patients with several comorbidities and underlying lung pathologies. It is vital to have a strong interplay among physicians, the ICU team, nursing staff, pharmacists, and radiologists, functioning as an interprofessional team, to improve patient outcomes. The nursing staff plays a pivotal role in recording temperature variations and other vitals that the physician needs before arriving at a diagnosis. The nursing staff has an important role to play especially in the ICU setting by maintaining clean and hygienic ventilator settings and preventing aspiration among the patients. The pharmacist has to provide the right dose and the right drugs as prescribed by the clinician. Also, the pharmacy has a special role to play in the dosing of special antibiotics like vancomycin; the clinician may want to consult with a board-certified infectious disease pharmacist and review the latest antibiogram data to decide on which antimicrobial to use. The radiologists also take center stage because of the radiological findings in the different types of pneumonia vary considerably and require expert interpretation. The current guidelines for the management of CAP, VAP, and HAP are laid down by the American Thoracic Society in conjunction with the Infectious Diseases Society of America and are reviewed periodically.
