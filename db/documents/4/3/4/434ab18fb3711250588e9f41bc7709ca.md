Complications include secondary infection, most commonly with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcal species. Secondary impetiginization occurs in up to 8% of cases. If the infection is prolonged post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis has been reported. Although it is well accepted that larvae cannot penetrate the basement membrane of skin, visceral disease has been rarely reported. Larvae have been identified in sputum, found in viscera of a human host, and also found in skeletal musculature. Host response to infection has rarely occurred as erythema multiforme.
