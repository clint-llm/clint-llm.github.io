The etiology of Zenker's diverticulum is not fully understood, but most of the hypotheses revolve around the abnormal structure and physiology of the cricopharyngeus muscle. Professionals believe that abnormal pressure during swallowing causes dehiscence of this muscle leading to the formation of a Zenker diverticulum. Therefore, this diverticulum is an acquired mucosal herniation between the horizontal and oblique fibers of the cricopharyngeus muscle.

The diverticulum develops between the transverse fibers of the CP muscle and the oblique fibers of the inferior constrictor muscle; this area is often known as Killian triangle.
