When acute GV is diagnosed or highly suspected, urgent surgical intervention is needed. The appropriate surgery is to perform emergency cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy can be done using open or laparoscopic approaches. The crucial steps during the cholecystectomy involve decompression and derotation of the gallbladder to obtain a clear view of the anatomical structures. Careful and meticulous dissection of the anatomical structure is essential because biliary structures such as the bile duct will be abnormally placed because of the torsion, making it susceptible to iatrogenic injury. The outcome for this condition is excellent when emergency surgery is done, Any delay in surgical intervention can result in infarction and necrosis of the gallbladder which can then lead to bilious peritonitis and increase morbidity and mortality rate.
