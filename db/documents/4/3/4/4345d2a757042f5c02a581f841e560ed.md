A large number of patients may only have an asymptomatic infection after the exposure. The usual time from exposure to onset of symptoms is 2 to 4 weeks, although, in some cases, it can be as long as 10 months. A constellation of symptoms, known as an **acute retroviral syndrome**, may appear acutely. Although none of these symptoms are specific to HIV, their presence of increased severity and duration is an indication of poor prognosis. These symptoms, in the order of decreasing frequency, are listed below:

- Fatigue

- Muscle pain

- Skin rash

- Headache

- Sore throat

- Swollen lymph nodes

- Joint pain

- Night sweats

- Diarrhea

**Chronic HIV infection**can be characterized by either without AIDS or with AIDS and can progress to advanced HIV infection:

- **Chronic HIV infection without AIDS:**
- Thrush
- Vaginal candidiasis
- Oral hairy leukoplakia
- Herpes zoster
- Peripheral neuropathy
- Bacillary angiomatosis
- Cervical dysplasia
- Cervical carcinoma in situ
- Constitutional symptoms
- Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura

- **Chronic HIV infection with AIDS:**AIDS is defined as a CD4 cell count <200 cells/microL or the presence of any AIDS-defining condition****regardless of the CD4 cell count. AIDS-defining conditions relate to those opportunistic illnesses and malignancies that occur more frequently or more severely as a result of immunosuppression. These are listed below:
- Multiple or recurrent bacterial infections
- Recurrent pneumonia
- Candidiasis
- Cervical cancer, invasive
- Coccidioidomycosis
- Cryptococcosis, extrapulmonary
- Cryptosporidiosis, chronic intestinal
- Cytomegalovirus disease (other than liver, spleen, or nodes), onset at age >1 month
- Cytomegalovirus retinitis (with loss of vision)
- HIV related encephalopathy
- Herpes simplex: chronic ulcers
- Histoplasmosis, disseminated or extrapulmonary
- Isosporiasis, chronic intestinal
- Kaposi sarcoma
- Lymphoma (Burkitt, immunoblastic or primary brain)
- Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) or Mycobacterium kansasii, disseminated or extrapulmonary
- Mycobacterium tuberculosis of any site
- Mycobacterium, other species or unidentified species, disseminated or extrapulmonary
- Pneumocystis jirovecii 
- Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy

- **Advanced HIV infection**is defined as a CD4 cell count <50 cells/microL
