Distal femur fractures are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, orthopedic surgeon, internist, orthopedic nurses, and physical therapist. The majority of distal femur fractures require surgical intervention; thus, consultation of the orthopedic surgeon is essential.  Vascular surgery requires a consult if there is any suspicion for vascular compromise to the limb. The management of the elderly patient requires advanced training and education in the handling of patients with co-morbidities and a significant change in their life trajectory. After surgery, patients need nursing care with prophylaxis against pressure sores and deep vein thrombosis. Nursing can also serve as a bridge between rehabilitative care and the treating clinician, as physical therapy is a vital part of rehabilitation. A social worker should be involved to ensure that the patient's home environment is safe and that the patient has support services. The recovery is often slow, and many patients need pain control; hence, a pharmacist may be helpful to educate the patient on modes of pain management. Open communication between the team members is vital to improving patient outcomes. These interprofessional team dynamics can improve patient outcomes. [Level 5]
