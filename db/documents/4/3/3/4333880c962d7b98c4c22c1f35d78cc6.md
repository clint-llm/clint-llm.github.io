The human colon possesses the largest population of bacteria in the body, and the majority of these organisms are anaerobes; of these, about 25 percent are species of Bacteroides. Bacteroides fragilis is part of the normal microbiota of the human colon. Disruption of the mucosal surface either by inflammation, trauma, or surgery and spread of Bacteroides fragilis to the bloodstream or surrounding tissues results in clinically significant infection. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of Bacteroides fragilis infection and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Bacteroides fragilis infections and emergencies.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of Bacteroides fragilis infections.
- Describe the management options available for Bacteroides fragilis infections.
- Explain some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of Bacteroides fragilis infections and improve outcomes.
