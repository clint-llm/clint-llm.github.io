Patients with viral gastroenteritis are often seen by the primary care provider, pediatrician, nurse practitioner, and emergency department physician. The key in most cases is to ensure adequate hydration. However, an important aspect of treatment is prevention. Thus, the primary care providers and nurses should work as an interprofessionalÂ team to educate the patient on good personal hygiene, hand washing, and vaccination. For most healthy patients, the outcomes are excellent.
