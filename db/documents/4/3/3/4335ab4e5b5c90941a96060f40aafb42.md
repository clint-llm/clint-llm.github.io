Malignant tumors of the palate have a wide range of overall prognosis depending on the specific histologies, tumor grade, margin status, cervical metastasis, and recurrence.

Prognosis of specific palatal histologies.

**Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**

Negative prognostic factors for SCC include high-grade tumors, advanced T stage, positive margins, cervical metastasis, and local recurrence.

**Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (AdCC)**

The overall 5-year survival rate for AdCC ranges from 60% to 90% but decreases to 40-50% after 10 years.

**Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma (MEC):**

Low-grade MEC has a 5-year survival rate of over 90% whereas the high-grade variant has a tendency to metastasis and recur locoregionally.MECT1 and MAML2 gene fusion have a better prognosis.

**Polymorphous Low-grade Adenocarcinoma (PLGA):**

Local recurrence has been reported in 9-33% of cases with cervical lymph node metastasis present in 6-35% of cases. Distant metastasis is rare at about 1%.

**Low-grade Papillary Adenocarcinoma (LGPA)**

LGPA has a more aggressive course than PLGA and has an increased tendency for recurrence due to a discontinuous growth pattern.

**Acinic cell carcinoma (ACC)**

ACC has a 5-year overall survival rate of 88.6%. Poor prognostic factors included high tumor grade, advanced T stage, cervical lymph node metastasis, and advanced age.

Mucosal melanoma (MM): The prognosis for mucosa melanoma is poor with a 5-year survival rate of 15%-45%.

**Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS)**

KS has a median survival of 18 months if left untreated.

**Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL)**

Studies show the 5-year disease-free progression of 88% in NHL of the head and neck after radiation therapy.
