Prevention is crucial in good outcomes for patients with latex allergy. Because of the widespread allergy to latex in the healthcare environment, there is now an interprofessional team that sets policies on purchasing latex-free products and assists with the management of latex-sensitive patients.

Ancillary staff, technicians, nurses, and clinicians involved in caring for the patient are the first line in the prevention of incidental exposure to latex for the patient on admission to the hospital. If they have symptoms, an allergist and immunologist will help determine if there are sensitization and a true latex allergy.

Elimination of latex products has been shown to reduce the problem with a marked reduction in healthcare costs. Nurses are often the first to see patients and should be taught to determine the presence of latex allergy in the patient's history, which enables healthcare workers to provide a latex-free environment. Lastly, if there are persistent symptoms, a dermatologist could be consulted to aid in the treatment.
