Cancer-associated thrombosis adds to the complexity of care for cancer patients. The utilization of multidisciplinary care is essential. Primary care physicians, as well as primary oncologist/hematologist, will initiate evaluation and the discussion with the patient regarding benefits vs. risks of anticoagulation therapy if it is needed. They are also responsible for educating patients about side effects and perform close monitoring for risks of bleeding. Pharmacists are necessary to ensure correct dose adjustmentsâ€”nursing staff, whether inpatient or ambulatory, play a significant role in education and medication administration.
