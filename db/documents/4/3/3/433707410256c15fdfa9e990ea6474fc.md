Lumbar disc disease carries enormous morbidity leading to disability and a poor quality of life. Many patients are mistakenly led to the belief that the disorder can be cured by surgery, sadly, failed surgeries and residual neurological deficits are common. There is a whole industry that focuses on low back pain offering sham therapies for people with lumbar disc disease. The key is patient education. The nurse and the physical therapist are in a prime position to educate the patient about changes in lifestyle that can lead to significant improvement and a better quality of life. Weight loss must be encouraged; the patient must enter an exercise program and eat a healthy diet. The pharmacist should encourage cessation of smoking and abstention from alcohol. More importantly, the patient should be discouraged from seeking supplements that have no benefit. In the majority of patients with lumbar disc disease, a positive change in lifestyle leads to a marked improvement in symptoms.

**Outcomes**

The majority of patients who are treated conservatively do have a good outcome, provided they change their lifestyle. For those who undergo surgery, the outcomes do vary from poor to fair. In fact, poor results are universal. Many outcome studies have been misrepresented because they have been published by the surgeon or the orthopedic manufacturer, or sponsorer. The long-term reduction in radicular pain is seen in some patients, but the numbers vary from 30-60%. For those who do not undertake changes in lifestyle, the recurrence of symptoms is very common.
