Detailed counseling, depending on the etiology of neonatal jaundice, is vital to improving the long-term outcome. Most patients with the common causes of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia have an excellent prognosis, and parents need to be educated to alleviate fear and anxiety. Jaundice from etiologies that carry poor prognosis often requires multidisciplinary interventions, and parents should be adequately counseled and educated. Genetic counseling and referrals to medical geneticists should also be offered to parents whenever a child is diagnosed with hereditary hyperbilirubinemias.
