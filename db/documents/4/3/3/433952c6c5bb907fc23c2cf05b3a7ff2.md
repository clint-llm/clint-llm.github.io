Contraindications to immunization are rare**Severely immunocompromised persons generally should not be administered live vaccines.**

Caution should be used when administering a vaccine to a child with an acute moderate to severe illness, with or without a fever. The cause of fever following vaccination in this population may be difficult to determine, whether it be continued illness or directly resulting from the vaccination. This may complicate the management of the illness. **According to CDC, severe combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) and a prior history of intussusception are contraindications to the rotavirus vaccines.**
