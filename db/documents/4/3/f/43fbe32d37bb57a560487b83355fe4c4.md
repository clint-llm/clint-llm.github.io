Rotator cuff pathology is a commonly encountered condition, and the natural history suggests tears increase with increasing age. This activity will discuss the diagnosis and management of the spectrum of disease from tendinopathy to tears. It will also discuss the relationship between the team members involved.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risks and physical exam findings associated with a complete rotator cuff tear.
- Describe the appropriate referral for rotator cuff tear based on the clinical picture.
- Review the indications for appropriate imaging (X-ray, ultrasound, and MRI).
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for rehabilitation, injections, and tendon repair surgery.
