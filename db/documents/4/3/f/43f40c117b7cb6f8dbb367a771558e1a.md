Clinical evaluation should include a detailed and systematic history, with the mechanism of injury described by the patient, if possible. The mechanism of injury of index ankle sprain should also merit consideration to pinpoint previous ligamentous attenuation.

As with acute ankle sprain, recurrent ankle sprain physical exam should be thorough and first begin with observation of any gross dislocation or asymmetry. Next, palpation of ankle ligaments should be conducted and evaluated for tenderness, including the medial ankle and length of the fibula.

- Edema and ecchymosis may or may not be visually apparent during the time of examination.

- Assess the range of motion of the affected ankle joint, as well as comparing the contralateral ankle

- 
              
- Normal ankle dorsiflexion: 10 degrees (knee extended), 20 degrees (knee flexed)

- Assess the range of motion of the subtalar joint, comparing to the contralateral subtalar joint

- Assess muscular strength, including plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, inversion and eversion

- Assess neurovascular status

Special tests can serve to stress the ankle joint ligaments:

- Anterior drawer test

- 
              
- Assess ATFL integrity
              
              
- Positive "dimple" sign

- Talar tilt test

- 
              
- Assess subtalar instability and integrity of CFL

- Kleiger external rotation test

- 
              
- Assess possible deltoid ligament injury or ankle syndesmosis injury

Ankle sprain classification is as follows:

- Grade 1: Mild stretching of the lateral ligament complex with microscopic tearing, no joint instability. Mild edema present with no functional loss or joint instability. The patient may be able to fully or partially bear weight.

- Grade II: Ligament tear or partial rupture (usually of the ATFL). Moderate to severe edema, with ecchymosis. Moderate functional loss with mild to moderate joint instability. The patient may experience difficulty weight-bearing.

- Grade III: Complete disruption/rupture of the ligament with moderate to severe instability of the ankle joint. Immediate edema with ecchymosis. Moderate to severe ankle joint instability.
