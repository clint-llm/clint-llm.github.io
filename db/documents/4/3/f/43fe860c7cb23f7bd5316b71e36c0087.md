The human eye can see any object placed at a variable distance from it by altering its structure (by altering the anterior lens surface). This phenomenon is called accommodation.

Accommodative excess (AE) or excessive accommodation can be defined as a condition when the subject uses more accommodation effort or power than required for the stimulus at a particular distance or cannot relax the accommodation. Spasm of accommodation or accommodative spasm (AS) is defined as 'prolonged contraction of the ciliary muscle, most commonly causing pseudomyopia to varying degrees in both eyes by keeping the lens in a state of short-sightedness.'

AS falls in the spectrum of AE. AE is characterized by blurred vision at a distance, especially after prolonged near work, and difficulty refocusing from near to far. In the case of AS (also known as pseudomyopia), it always manifests. Headache, eye ache, and asthenopic symptoms are common in most cases.
