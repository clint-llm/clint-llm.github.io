The diagnosis and management of Strongyloides infection are done with an interprofessional team that includes an infectious disease expert, gastroenterologist, emergency department physician, and pharmacist. The key is to get rid of all larvae with ivermectin. Once discharged, the patients need to follow upÂ with either a nurse practitioner or primary physician to ensure that all body fluids have no remnant larvae. Patients also need to be educated about handwashing and maintaining personal hygiene. For those with a simple infection of the GI tract, the outcomes are good, but in patients with multiple organ infestations, the prognosis is guarded.
