Drusen bodies are a common clinical finding on an ophthalmologistâ€™s fundoscopic exam with hard drusen being the most abundant. According to the Beaver Dam Eye Study, hard drusen had a prevalence of 93.6% in study participants between 43 to 86 years of age.

Although drusen bodies are most commonly described in AMD, it is important to note that they are not pathognomonic of AMD. Drusen-like deposits can also be seen in some less prevalent inherited conditions such as Sorsby fundus dystrophy, North Carolina macular dystrophy, Stargardt disease, and Adult-onset foveomacular vitelliform dystrophy, just to name a few.
