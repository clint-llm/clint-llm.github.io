Although there is an instinctual drive to do everything in one's power to save the life of a child, in neonates and infants that suffer from congenital malformation or disease which significantly lower life expectancy or quality of life, it is considered reasonable to withhold resuscitative measures, this includes significant prematurity.

In the US, data from 2013-2015 showed a discharge survival rate of only 9% at 22 weeks. This did increase to nearly 50% only 1 week later and 79% at 25 weeks.

In children, there are no recommended time limits to discuss an end to resuscitation. However, in neonates, studies have not evaluated significant survival rates beyond 20 minutes, and, therefore, resuscitative efforts can be terminated at any point past this timeframe.
