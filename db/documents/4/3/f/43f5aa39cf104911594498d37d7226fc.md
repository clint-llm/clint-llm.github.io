The annual incidence of bacterial tracheitis varies between countries, with an estimated incidence of 0.1 to 1 case(s) per 100,000 children.****Interestingly, one study of 33 pediatric tracheostomy-dependent patients at a large tertiary care center showed an association of bacterial tracheitis with higher socioeconomic status (SES); although they postulated that patients with lower SES do not present for treatment as frequently.
