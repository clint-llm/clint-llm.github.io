Absolute contraindications for ablative nerve blocks are few, but these include active local infection at the site of needle insertion and elevated intracranial pressure. The use of anti-coagulants provides a unique challenge for practitioners, as the clinical judgment must be used following accepted guidelines. Current guidelines put forth by ASRA (American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine) recommend that:

- Aspirin to be stopped 6 days before the procedure

- Clopidogrel to be stopped 7 days before the procedure

- Apixaban to be stopped 3 to 5 days before the procedure

- Rivaroxaban to be stopped 3 days before the procedure

- Warfarin to be stopped 5 days before the procedure

- Intravenous heparin to be stopped 4 hours before the procedure

Other relative contraindications that the clinician must consider before the procedure include:

- Neurologic abnormalities

- Concerning clinical or imaging finding

- Definitive causes of low back pain (for example, disc herniation, spondylolisthesis, spondylosis, spinal stenosis, malignancy, infection, or trauma)

- Lack of pain relief from prior diagnostic nerve blocks
