**Laboratory Investigations**

- Blood and Routine Investigations

- Complete hemogram
- Blood sugar
- Urine routine microscopy

- Other Tests (case to case basis depending upon the history and examination)

- Serum calcium for hyper or hypoparathyroidism.
- VDRL for syphilis
- Antibody titer for TORCH.
- Red cell galactokinase or uridyl transferase for galactosemia
- Urine protein for Alport syndrome
- Urine amino acid for Lowe syndrome
- Urine sodium nitroprusside/ plasma homocysteine for homocystinuria
- Urine/serum copper for Wilson disease
- Karyotyping for a genetic defect

**Ocular Investigations**

- Ultrasound B scan: B scan ultrasonography has to be performed to rule out other posterior segment pathologies that mimic congenital cataract (other causes of leukocoria include retinoblastoma, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, coats disease, ROP with retrolental fibroplasia, organized vitreous hemorrhage, congenital falciform fold, ocular toxocariasis, and retinal hamartomas.

- Ultrasound biometry can also help to obtain optical parameters such as axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and lens thickness (LT), which is crucial for IOL power calculation.

- Keratometry: Using handheld keratometers. A child’s cooperation is the key to accurate keratometry readings. In the case of an uncooperative child, standard K values of 43.00 D can be used.
