**Deep posterior leg compartment****:**

Popliteus

- Origin: Lateral aspect of the lateral femoral condyle, lateral meniscus

- Insertion: Base of the second through fifth distal phalanges

- Actions: Flexes second through fifth DIP, PIP, MTP, plantar flexes ankle

Flexor hallucis longus

- Origin: Distal aspect of the posterior fibula, interosseous membrane

- Insertion: Base of hallux distal phalanx

- Actions: Flexes hallux IP, MTP, plantar flexes ankle (weak)

**Medial plantar branch******:****

Abductor hallucis

- Origin: Tuberosity of calcaneus, plantar aponeurosis

- Insertion: Medial aspect of base of hallux proximal phalanx

- Actions: Abducts hallux, flexes hallux MTP

Flexor digitorum brevis

- Origin: Tuberosity of calcaneus, plantar aponeurosis

- Insertion: Second through fifth middle phalanges

- Actions: Flexes second through fifth PIP, MTP

Flexor hallucis brevis

- Origin: Plantar aspect of the cuboid, plantar aspect of lateral cuneiform

- Insertion: Base of hallux proximal phalanx

- Actions: Flexes hallux MTP

1st lumbrical (not named in relation to digits)

- Origin: Tendon of flexor digitorum longus

- Insertion: Medial aspect of second phalanx extensor expansion

- Actions: Flexes second MTP, extends second DIP, PIP

**Lateral plantar branch****:**

Quadratus plantae

- Origin: Medial and lateral aspects of the plantar surface of the calcaneus

- Insertion: Flexor digitorum longus tendon (posterolateral aspect)

- Actions: Assists in flexor digitorum longus flexion by correcting for its obliquely directed contraction

Abductor digiti minimi

- Origin: Tuberosity of calcaneus, plantar aponeurosis

- Insertion: Lateral aspect of base of the fifth proximal phalanx

- Actions: Abducts fifth phalanx, flexes fifth MTP

Flexor digiti minimi brevis

- Origin: Base of the fifth metatarsal

- Insertion: Lateral aspect of base of the fifth proximal phalanx

- Actions: Flexes fifth MTP

First through third plantar interossei (not named in relation to digits)

- Origination: Medial surface and base of third through fifth metatarsals

- Insertion: Medial aspect of third through fifth proximal phalanges

- Actions: Adducts third through fifth phalanges, flexes third through fifth MTP

First through fourth dorsal interossei (not named in relation to digits)

- Origin: Adjacent aspects of first through fifth metatarsals

- Insertion of first dorsal interossei: Medial aspect of the second proximal phalanx

- Insertion of second through fourth dorsal interossei: Lateral aspect of second through fourth proximal phalanx, tendons of extensor digitorum longus

- Action: Abducts third and fourth phalanges, flexes second through fourth MTP, extends second through fourth DIP, PIP
