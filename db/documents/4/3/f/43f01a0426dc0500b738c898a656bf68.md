It is important caregivers are informed about the etiology of dental fluorosis and how to avoid it, as dental fluorosis only has the potential to develop during amelogenesis.

Patients should also be informed of potentially less publicized sources of fluoride, including tea, artificially fluoridated milk, and fluoridated salt.

The control of fluoride levels within drinking water is vital.

Fluoride water concentrations of 0.7-1 ppm are optimal in terms of balancing the beneficial anti-cariogenic properties of fluoride while avoiding complications associated with its excessive ingestion.
