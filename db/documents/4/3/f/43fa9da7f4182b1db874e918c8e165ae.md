Causative organisms for deep neck infections include gram-positive organisms, including but not limited to Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus aureus; and gram-negative organisms, including but not exclusively Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Haemophilus influenza. In studies of retropharyngeal abscess, polymicrobial results were found in almost 90% of patients. Aerobes were found in all patients and anaerobes found in more than half. Anaerobes may include Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, Prevotella, and Actinomyces. Other bacteria may include Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Propionibacterium, among others.

Some studies show cultures with an average of at least five isolates. There have been studies showing an association between the presence of biofilm and abscess development.
