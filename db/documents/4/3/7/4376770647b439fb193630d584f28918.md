Given the diverse range of clinical presentations and potential complications of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, patients are best managed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of dermatology, wound care, nutrition, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. Patients should be monitored regularly for the development or progression of mucosal involvement. If mucosal lesions are present or suspected, patients should be evaluated and treated by ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and gastroenterology. Interprofessional team care, prompt diagnosis and treatment, patient education, and close monitoring can improve outcomes and optimize prognosis for EBA patients.
