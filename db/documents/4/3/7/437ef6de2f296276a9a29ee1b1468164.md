Innominate artery injury is often a consequence of blunt or penetrating trauma. While the traumatic injury is often the most common cause of injury, iatrogenic injury can also cause injury to the innominate artery.

Key clinical indicators of injury include the seat belt sign and steering wheel imprint. Blunt injury to the innominate artery is most commonly found at its origin from the aortic arch. A review of postmortem exams found that pedestrians struck by motor vehicles had the highest incidence of significant vessel injury. Patients who present to the hospital with this injury rarely show signs of life due to the severity of this type of injury. Penetrating injury to the innominate artery is often due to a gunshot or stabbing to the chest. Iatrogenic injury to the innominate artery can also occur due to central venous catheter placement or the creation of a tracheostomy. Another iatrogenic cause of innominate artery injury comes after the creation of a tracheostomy, which in rare cases, can lead to tracheoinnominate artery fistula.
