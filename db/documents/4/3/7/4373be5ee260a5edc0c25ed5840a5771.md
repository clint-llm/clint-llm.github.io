Management of pityriasis rotunda is often challenging. Topical corticosteroids, antifungal agents, emollients, tars, and keratolytic topicals (salicylic acid and lactic acid) are poorly efficient. Retinoids, either topicals (retinoic acid and tazarotene) or oral (etretinate) have been used with little or no success in pityriasis rotunda. Treatment with vitamin D3 analogs such as calcipotriolÂ leads to a progressive improvement in the lesions in a small number of patients.

However, for patients with comorbidities, successful treatment of the underlying disease often leads to remission of pityriasis rotunda lesions.
