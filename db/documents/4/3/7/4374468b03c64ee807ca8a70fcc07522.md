The lungs are highly dynamic intrathoracic organs. Not only are they required for gas exchange and providing oxygen, which is essential for survival, but also they play a vital role in maintaining physiologic homeostasisÂ and enzyme production. They are also an integral part of host defense against infection. They are exposed to a wide variety of pathology, both malignant and benign, which may require a pneumonectomy.

Pneumonectomy is defined as the surgical removal of the entire lung. Extrapleural pneumonectomy is an expanded procedure that also involves resection of parietal and visceral pleura, ipsilateral hemidiaphragm, pericardium, and mediastinal lymph nodes.

Pneumonectomy was first performed in 1933 by Evarts A.Graham for lung carcinoma. The patient, who was a 48-year-old obstetrician, survived for a long period after the operation. Sarot described the first extrapleural pneumonectomy in 1949. It was initially used to treat TB empyema but then became more commonly used for the treatment of mesothelioma.
