Neck lumps are a common presentation in both children and adults, and therefore have a wide range of differential diagnoses.Â  Lumps that present from birth are more likely to be congenital in origin. Congenital differentials include thyroglossal cysts, branchial cysts, dermoid cysts, or teratomas. Other differentials include infective causes, such as reactive lymphadenopathies, or neoplastic causes, such as lymphoma. The provider should also consider inflammatory causes such as sarcoidosis, traumatic such as hematomas, and vascular causes such as carotid body tumors.
