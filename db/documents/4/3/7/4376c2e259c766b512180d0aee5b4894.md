Radiation therapy is given in two forms to patients with endometrial carcinoma - brachytherapy and external beam radiation. In vaginal brachytherapy, a radiation-emitting source is placed inside the vaginal canal, and this can be a high or low dose rate brachytherapy.

The most common complication of radiation therapy is skin changes. The skin may become red and dry, leading to scarring and infection. Radiation cystitis, proctitis, and vaginitis can also occur. In the long run, the inflamed tissue may scar and cause stenosis of the vaginal and anal canal. A communication between the vagina, bowel, and skin called a fistula can also form. Radiation leads to inflammation and damage to ovaries and can cause premature ovarian failure leading to premature menopause.
