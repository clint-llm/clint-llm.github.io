Research shows there is a genetic component to atopic dermatitis. One common mutation has been observed in the gene Filaggrin, a vital gene for skin cell maturity. This gene is responsible for creating the tough, flat corneocytes that form the outermost protective layer of skin. In a patient with normal skin cells, the corneocytes are tightly packed in an organized manner. A patient with a filaggrin mutation will have a dysfunctional skin barrier due to the haphazard organization of the skin cells.staph aureus.
