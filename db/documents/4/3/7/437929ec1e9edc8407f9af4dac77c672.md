The diagnosis and management of ESES are very complex and best done with an interprofessional team. The diagnosis usually requires an EEG capturing NREM sleep.

The treatment approach is the prompt initiation of appropriate AEDs and escalation to corticosteroid regimen if needed. Because all patients have neuropsychiatric features, a mental health nurse should be involved in the care, assisting in the evaluation, monitoring treatment progress, counseling patients and family about the condition, and reporting any concerns to the treating clinician. The pharmacist should educate the patient and caregivers about the drugs, their adverse effects, and potential benefits, check for drug interactions, and verify all dosing. The recovery is slow, and hence social work should be involved to ensure that the patient has adequate support services. Long term monitoring by the Interprofessional team is vital to prevent high morbidity. [Level 5]
