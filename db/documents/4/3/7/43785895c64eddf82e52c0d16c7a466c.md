Cataract has emerged as a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness. It has been estimated that approximately 20 million people are blind because of cataracts. Complicated cataracts develop as one of the most common complications of chronic uveitis or recurrent uveitis. Complicated cataracts occur secondary to intraocular inflammation and steroid therapy, accounting for about 40% of the visual disability in patients with uveitis.

Complicated cataract surgery due to uveitis comprises almost 1.2% of all cataract surgeries. The prevalence of acquired cataracts increases with age. In 2013, there were more than 22 million people in the United States who had cataracts, with a prevalence of 30.1 million in 2020. The incidence of cataracts increases with age affecting about 70% of people over the age of 80 years. Females are more commonly affected.
