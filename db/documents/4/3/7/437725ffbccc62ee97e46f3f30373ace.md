Terazosin is available in the US in oral capsule formulation in the form of a hydrochloride salt, available in 1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg formulations. For the FDA approved indications of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia, the dosing route, frequency, and amount are as follows:

**Hypertension**

The initial dose is 1 mg to 10 mg orally daily, titrated upwards as needed to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Considered a second-line agent due to adverse effects, additional consideration as an agent if the patient also experiences lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

**Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia**

The initial dose is 1 mg to 10 mg orally at bedtime, titrated upwards as needed based upon patient response up to 20 mg daily in 1 or 2 divided doses.

For Non-FDA approved indications,****including medical expulsive therapy (MET), chronic prostatitis, hyperlipidemia, urethritis, hyperhidrosis, and oligospermia:

**Medical Expulsive Therapy for Distal Ureteral Calculi**

2 mg to 10 mg orally at bedtime. Most studies have indicated usage of 2 mg to 5 mg, and only rarely have 10 mg doses been cited. For MET, the typical duration of terazosin is for up to 2 weeks, and the patient may discontinue therapy following the expulsion of the stone.

**Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome**

1 mg to 5 mg orally daily for 14 weeks. Terazosin demonstrated effectiveness in a study comparing alpha-antagonist naïve patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome with a placebo.

**Hyperlipidemia/Hypercholesterolemia**

5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg orally daily. Studies demonstrating the lipid-lowering effects were subject to confounding factors due to titration of drug dosing to diastolic blood pressure or meeting the maximum (20 mg) dosage for terazosin. Additionally, there have not been studies to demonstrate a mortality benefit, as seen for other lipid-lowering drugs.

**Idiopathic Oligozoospermia**

2 mg orally daily. One clinical study by Gregoriou et al. demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in spermatozoa count and seminal fluid volume after treatment with six months of terazosin. However, the study noted no change in the mean percentage of abnormal spermatozoa and also did not detect any significant difference in pregnancy rates.

**Urethritis associated with Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer**

2 mg to 6 mg orally daily. One study from Zelefsky et al. suggests an improvement in urinary tract symptoms associated with radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.

**Antidepressant-induced Excessive Sweating**

1 mg to 6 mg orally daily. A recent clinical trial demonstrated a positive response to hyperhidrosis associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use.
