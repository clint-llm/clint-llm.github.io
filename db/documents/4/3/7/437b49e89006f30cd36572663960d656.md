Because of platelets’ essential role in hemostasis, platelet pathology correlates with excessive bleeding. Patients with thrombocytopenia or reduced platelet function tend to present with petechiae and mucocutaneous bleeding. Following small endothelial lesions, primary hemostasis is often ineffective, and so bleeding, such as epistaxis, gingival bleeding, and purpura occur. Patients with coagulation disorders such as Haemophilia, on the other hand, tend not to experience excessive bleeding from small cuts, but struggle to control larger bleeds where fibrin reinforcement of the primary clot is required.

Platelet abnormalities categorize into quantitative disorders (thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis) and qualitative disorders (thrombasthenias). Thrombocytopenia is common and usually acquired. Common causes include hypersplenism, drugs (e.g., heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), infections, pregnancy, and immune thrombocytopenia. Hereditary thrombocytopenias are rare but merit consideration, especially if giant platelets are visible on the blood film.

Platelets are also involved in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. They play an obvious role in thrombus formation on the surface of a ruptured plaque in response to the exposure of subendothelial structures. Platelets also appear to be involved in the recruitment of leukocytes to plaques during their formation, through cytokine release and receptor-ligand interactions.
