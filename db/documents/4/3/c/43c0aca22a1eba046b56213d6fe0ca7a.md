Tests can be performed to determine the levels of the different types of lipids in the blood. While cholesterol levels are usually steady, triglyceride levels vary from day to day and rise after meals. Therefore, a blood sample called a “lipid panel" taken for lipid testing should occur after a 12-hour fasting period, which allows the clearance of chylomicrons from the blood. For more accurate results, patients should not take any medications that could change blood lipid levels or take the test during times of stress or illness.
