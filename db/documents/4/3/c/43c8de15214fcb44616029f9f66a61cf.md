Type 1 diabetes is a systemic disorder with diverse presentations and very high morbidity; for this reason, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals.

Type 1 diabetes is a serious disorder with very high morbidity and mortality. Over the long term, the vast majority of patients with this disorder will develop blindness, adverse cardiac events, end-stage renal disease, neuropathy, and in some cases, premature death. Data indicate that those patients who manage to control their blood sugars without developing severe complications tend to have a good quality of life.

The patient must be screened for foot, eye, and eye complications at each visit. Appropriate referrals need to be made before disease occurs in these organs. A diabetic nurse should educate the patient on self-insulin injection and how to perform fingerstick tests for blood glucose level monitoring.

Social workers should be involved in the care to ensure that the patient has adequate support and finances for treatment. Communication with the interprofessional team should be prompt to ensure no patient is denied treatment. With assurance and guidance, many patients with type 1 diabetes can live a good quality of life.
