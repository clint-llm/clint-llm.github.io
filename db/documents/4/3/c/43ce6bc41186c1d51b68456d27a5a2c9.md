The pathophysiology of polyhydramnios is not entirely understood. Under normal circumstances, an equilibrium exists balancing the production and absorption of amniotic fluid. Amniotic fluid is mainly derived from fetal urination and less from fetal lung fluid. Fluid absorption occurs mainly through fetal swallowing. It is estimated that the fetus produces 500 to 1200 mL of urine and swallows 210-760 mL of amniotic fluid daily.

In cases of maternal hyperglycemia, fetal urine excretion increase is thought to be due to the increase of osmotic diuresis contributing to increased AFV production.

In twin-twin transfusion syndrome, there is a donor and recipient fetus. In this condition, the placenta causes a fluid imbalance between the twins such that the recipient twin is volume overloaded and produces more urine. This affects 8% to 10% of monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies and is diagnosed in the presence of polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios caused by placental vascular anastomoses and blood flow imbalance between twins.

High output cardiac states (i.e., hemolytic anemia and infection with parvovirus B19) can increase fetal urine output and polyhydramnios. Common aneuploidies such as trisomies 21 (Down syndrome),18 (Edward syndrome), and 13 (Patau syndrome) can be associated with polyhydramnios.
