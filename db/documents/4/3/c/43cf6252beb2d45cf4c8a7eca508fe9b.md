Very little is known about the long-term impact of frotteurism on the initiator or the victim.

If comorbid conditions are considered, this may lead to the development of a frotteuristic disorder, which can cause clinically or functionally significant impairment for the individual. These individuals may suffer from poor self-esteem, severe social anxiety, and guilt. Untreated mental health conditions may cause a further decline in the mental state. Once “caught,” there may be societal stigma and additional legal requirements that follow. For those with severe sexual disorders, mandatory registration to the sex offender registry, regular “check-ins” with the legal system, housing limitations may further complicate the picture.

This may be akin to a traumatic experience for the victim - increased anxiety, hypervigilance, avoiding public transportation, insecurity, and an overall sense of mistrust may occur.
