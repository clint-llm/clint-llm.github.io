In addition to pharmacy calculations, other factors in pharmacology must also be a consideration. For instance, bioavailability is the amount of drug from the administered dose that reaches the systemic circulation and should be taken into account.Â Different routes of administrations can impact drug bioavailability.

It is essential to understand the relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as these factors influence the drug effect and metabolism. (See Figure 3 for a schematic of the relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.)

Pharmacodynamics is the study of drug effects and their metabolism of action.
