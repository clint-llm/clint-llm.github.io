Nerve agents like organophosphates are primarily absorbed in the body through the lungs, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Nerve agents bind and phosphorylate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) which leads to inactivation of the enzyme and excess amounts of acetylcholine (ACh) in the neuromuscular junction. Excessive ACh leads to constant depolarization of the postsynaptic neurons which causes the symptoms of cholinergic and muscarinic toxicity. Until the new AChE is synthesized or an oxime like pralidoxime is used to displace the organophosphate from AChE, ACh will persist in the neuromuscular junction constantly binding the muscarinic and nicotinic receptors leading to the signs and symptoms of cholinergic excess. Following the initial phosphorylation, a conformational change, known as â€˜aging,' may occur where an alkoxy group leaves the phosphorylated enzyme. The aging process is clinically important when it comes to the quick recognition of symptoms and treatment with oximes. Once AChE has aged, it cannot be reactivated by the use of oximes. Aging is variable between nerve agents. The nerve agent soman ages quickly at 5 to 8 minutes compared to the long aging process of VX which takes 24 hours
