The patient can develop cellulitis in the area that is not connected to the surgical site. However, on the balance of probabilities, these infections are often treated as SSI as treatment is similar, and the need to determine the cause does not change management.

There is a life-threatening condition that needs to be ruled out when diagnosing surgical site infections. Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly spreading infection of the fascial planes. If rapidly spreading, a clinical diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis is made, and the patient should be rushed for emergency surgery. Aggressive, multi-stage debridement of skin fascia and other ischaemic/dead tissue is the current strategy of dealing with the condition in addition to using appropriate antibiotics.
