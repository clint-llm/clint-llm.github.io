Typically benign breast calcifications have a wide range of etiologies.

Skin calcifications localize to the skin, particularly the dermis, and result from processes such as folliculitis or inspissated material within sweat glands (figure 1A and 1B).

Vascular calcifications have been associated with increasing age, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.

Coarse or popcorn-like calcifications are associated with involuting fibroadenomas or papillomas.

Large rod-like calcifications represent areas of ductal ectasia (figure 3A).

Round calcifications (figure 2) may be seen in hemangiomas.

Rim calcifications (figure 4A and 4B) may result from fat necrosis, which is a common sequela of autologous fat augmentation. Additionally, rim calcification may be seen surrounding breast implants or at the periphery of free silicone or other materials injected within the breast for breast augmentation.

Typically benign dystrophic calcifications may represent post-traumatic changes, post-surgical changes, or an area of fat necrosis.

Milk-of-calcium calcifications represent calcium sediment within cysts.

Suture calcification is a result of the formation of suture granulomas.

A few additional etiologies of typically benign breast calcifications include vascular lesions, tuberculosis, and parasitic infections.
