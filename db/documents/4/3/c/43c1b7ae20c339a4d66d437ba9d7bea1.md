Azotemia is a biochemical abnormality, defined as elevation, or buildup of, nitrogenous products (BUN-usually ranging 7 to 21 mg/dL), creatinine in the blood, and other secondary waste products within the body. Raising the level of nitrogenous waste is attributed to the inability of the renal system to filter (decreased glomerular filtration rate-GFR) such as waste products adequately. It is a typical feature of both acute and chronic kidney injury.

Azotemia is important when discussing the precipitant syndrome of acute kidney injury (AKI); there are three subtypes, prerenal, intrinsic, and post-renal azotemia. There are multiple classification systems use to define AKI: The RIFLE criteria of 2004, AKIN criteria in 2007, and the KDIGO system in 2012. AKI is generally diagnosed by an increase in creatinine (Cr) by 0.3 mg/dL, Cr increase greater than 1.5%, or even less than 0.5 mL/kg per hr. This diagnosis is made with urinalysis (UA), urine electrolytes, metabolic panel (CMP/BMP), and a renal ultrasound (US). With these labs, the clinician can discern the classification and etiology of the AKI, which guides clinical management.

Azotemia becomes manifested with a constellation of clinical signs and symptoms along with biochemical abnormalities; it is termed uremia.
