Intestinal ischemia can affect the small intestine or the colon. Whereas, colonic ischemia refers to ischemia that affects the colon, mesenteric ischemia refers to ischemia that affects the blood vessels of the small intestine. It can be secondary to occlusive or nonocclusive obstruction of the arteries or can be caused by obstruction of venous outflow. This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology and presentation of mesenteric artery ischemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of mesenteric artery ischemia.
- Describe the pathophysiology of mesenteric artery ischemia.
- Summarize the treatment options for mesenteric artery ischemia.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by mesenteric artery ischemia.
