In atypical cases with no antecedent history of Valsalva maneuver, various conditions which can mimic Valsalva retinopathy include:

Proliferative vascular retinopathies – secondary to diabetes, retinal vein occlusion, and other diseases. It is necessary to rule out retinal new vessels of new vessels at the optic disc before making a diagnosis of Valsalva retinopathy.

- Hypertensive retinopathy

- Sickle cell anemia

- Battered baby syndrome

- Terson syndrome

- Ruptured macroaneurysm

- Anemic retinopathy

- An acute posterior vitreous detachment can also cause hemorrhages, and it is necessary to rule out peripheral retinal tears.

There are very few ocular conditions in which multilayered hemorrhages can present, i.e., at pre retinal, intraretinal, and subretinal levels. Conditions causing multilayered hemorrhages include Valsalva retinopathy, anemic/leukemic retinopathy, and trauma (battered baby syndrome).

Sometimes, pre-retinal hemorrhage identical to Valsalva retinopathy occurs in apparently normal patients without any history of Valsalva or exertion.
