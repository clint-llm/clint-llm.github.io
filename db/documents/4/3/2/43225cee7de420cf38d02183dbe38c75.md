Several other conditions may present similarly to AR pupils, as they also demonstrate a light near dislocation.

Either input or output failures can cause light-near dissociation. Bilateral pre-chiasmal lesions of the optic nerves, chiasmal lesions or bilateral optic tract lesions could cause input failure, leading to a false light-near dissociation: The light reflex will be reduced under these conditions, and the near reaction unaffected. Output failure is the cause of AR pupil, as well as Adieâ€™s pupil, the Miller-Fisher variant of acute idiopathic demyelinating polyradiculopathy, and in the setting of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and certain peripheral neuropathies. AR pupil can de be differentiated from these other conditions by the pupillary size: Argyll Robertson pupil alone presents with small pupils, the other diagnoses all demonstrate large light-dissociated pupils.
