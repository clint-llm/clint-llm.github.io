**History**

- Neonates: Congenital abnormalities present within the first month of life, with some presenting later in life.

- Infants to toddlers: The most common cause in this age group is croup or foreign body aspiration.

- Young adolescents: Vocal cord dysfunction, peritonsillar abscess

- Acute: Epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis will present with severe respiratory distress and secretions, and fever; if fever is not present, then suspect foreign body aspiration or anaphylaxis

- Subacute: Croup will present with intermittent stridor

**Symptoms**

- Hives: Should prompt evaluation for anaphylaxis secondary to an allergic trigger

- A cough: Typically presents with croup

- Drooling: Typically seen with retropharyngeal abscess and epiglottitis, or foreign body aspiration

**Physical Exam**

- General appearance:Â Assess for any swelling of soft tissues of the neck and oropharynx, and rashes or hives, or any clubbing of digits.

- HEENT: Assess tongue size, pharyngeal edema, or peritonsillar abscess. Be cautious in manipulating the oropharynx of a suspected epiglottitis patient, and consider doing this in a controlled setting such as the operating room.

- Lungs: Asses rate and depth of breathing, auscultate for inspiratory and expiratory stridor. Auscultate over the anterior neck to best hear stridor.
