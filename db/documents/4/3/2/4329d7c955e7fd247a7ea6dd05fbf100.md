The predominant complications of ossiculoplasty include failure to improve the conductive hearing loss, necrosis of an autologous osseous graft or remnant native ossicles, and prosthesis extrusion/migration. More rare complications include fracture of stapes superstructure, displacement of stapes, disruption of the annular ligament of the oval window leading to perilympahtic fistula, severe or complete sensorineural hearing loss, and vertigo.

Factors that influence surgical failure include middle ear pathology, type of prosthesis, ossicular chain condition at the time of ossiculoplasty, surgical technique, external auditory canal wall status in cases of canal wall down mastoid surgery, and staging of ossiculoplasty. The most common reason for surgical failure is persistent middle ear disease followed by prosthesis displacement or migration resulting in maximum conductive hearing loss.

Loss of hearing can occur immediately after surgery or be delayed. Poor hearing in the postoperative period may be due to middle ear effusion or ongoing middle ear disease, graft failure, or displaced prosthesis.

Traditionally, closure of the air-bone gap on pure tone audiometry below 20 dB has been the marker of surgical success.

The OOPS index has been useful in helping providers predict surgical success, pinpoint patients at risk for surgical complications, compare different surgical techniques and prostheses, and assess progression in surgical ability.

Factors that increase the risk of complications after ossiculoplasty include poor hearing results on the first postoperative audiometry, absence of malleus, middle ear disease, ETD, recurrent otitis media, tobacco smoking, and inability to perform Valsalva.

In order to improve ossiculoplasty success rates, a delayed ossicular chain reconstruction has been recommended for patients with a significant disease requiring extensive middle ear and mastoid surgery, canal wall down mastoidectomy, residual cholesteatoma, and excessive middle ear mucosa resection.

Postoperatively, patients are followed annually with audiometry to assess the long-term stability of hearing and office otomicroscopic examination to assess whether there is a return of middle ear disease. For patients with poor postoperative audiometric outcomes, the reasons for failure will need to be determined, and decisions will need to be made to see any factors that may be corrected. In some cases, CT imaging may be required to assess prosthesis position and whether there is persistent tympanomastoid disease that might contribute to the poor result. Revision surgery may be necessary.
