It may also be important to account for patients' weight when calculating the correct dose for certain drugs.  The body surface area represents the patient's height and weight. In certain patient populations, specific drugs may be dosed based on BSA depending on drug properties.  The average adult has a BSA of 1.73 m^2. The equation for BSA may be calculated as follows:

- BSA (m^2) = [Height (inches) x Weight (lbs)/3131]^1/2.

The following are the calculations for ideal body weight for males and females, respectively

- Male: IBW = 51.65 kg + 1.85 kg/inch of height greater than 5 feet

- Female IBW = 48.67 kg + 1.65 kg/inch of height greater than 5 feet

The pediatric population often utilizes Young's Rule (pediatric dose based on age) or Clark's Rule (pediatrics dose based on weight) to determine the dose administered.

It is also important to note that some drugs may be dispensed in their own respective units; for instance, the drug digitalis is dosed as follows:

The number of vials of digitalis required = Total digitalis body load X 0.8/0.5 mg of digitalis bound.

In regards to toxicity, understanding properties of certain drugs is important in order to eliminate them effectively. For acidic drugs: pH = pKa + log [A-]/[AH] and for basic drugs: pH = pKa + log[B]/[BH+].
