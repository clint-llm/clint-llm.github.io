Blood clots can mimic flank pain caused by any renal stone in the urinary tract, pyelonephritis, ectopic pregnancy, rupture or torsion of an ovarian cyst, aortic aneurysm, biliary colic, cholecystitis, appendicitis, acute mesenteric ischemia, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, and dysmenorrhea.

Suitable imaging techniques like CT scans can differentiate renal stones from these entities. Hematuria will be absent if the cause of abdominal pain is gastrointestinal. The location, appearance, and density may helpÂ identify stone composition in a CT scan. For example, a large staghorn-shaped calculus in the renal pelvis favors struvite stone. Like cystine and uric acid stones, struvite stones are radiopaque in nature, but they are not as dense as calcium stones.
