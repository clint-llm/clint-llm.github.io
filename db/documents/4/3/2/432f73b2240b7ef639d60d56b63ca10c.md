Aqueous humor is produced from the ciliary processes and predominantly drains via the pressure-dependent trabecular meshwork with the residual component of aqueous humor draining via the pressure-independent uveal scleral pathway.

There are approximately 80 ciliary processes, which are projections arising from the ciliary body, an encircling ring of smooth muscle lining the inner wall of the sclera. These ciliary processes consist of a double-layer of epithelium protruding into the anterior chamber overlying a core of stroma and fenestrated capillaries. From the external surface of the eyeball, these ciliary processes are located approximately 1.5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus.

The continuous-wave TCP diode laser emits laser energy at a wavelength of 810 nm. When directed at the ciliary processes, it causes ablation of the ciliary epithelium resulting in homogenous blanching and shrinking of the ciliary processes. Histopathologic studies have demonstrated significant damage to the pars plicata and surrounding tissues, including the sclera, pars plana, and iris root. Adjacent damage to the pars plana provides another mechanism by which cyclodiode acts by enhancing uveoscleral outflow.

Unlike the continuous-wave TCP, MP-TCP delivers a series of short, pulsed repetitive bursts of laser energy in on/off phases, in which the 'off-phase' allows time for surrounding tissues to cool, therefore lessening propagation of thermal damage while still lowering IOP.
