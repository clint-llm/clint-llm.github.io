Ventilation-perfusion V/Q scanning is mostly indicated for a patient population in whom CTPA is contraindicated (pregnancy, renal insufficiency, chronic kidney disease stage 4 or more, or severe contrast allergy) or relatively inconclusive. The data are conflicting regarding the superiority of one modality (CTPA) over the other (V/Q) to diagnose PE in pregnant patients; however, V/Q is the test of choice in pregnant females with suspected PE who have a normal chest radiograph. V/Q scan can provide additional information to determine PE resolution, measure pulmonary functions before surgical intervention in lung cancer, may provide evidence of COPD, left heart failure, pneumonia, evaluation of congenital cardiac and pulmonary disorders (arteriovenous fistula), pulmonary arterial stenosis, cardiac shunts, evaluation of pulmonary hypertension, cystic fibrosis, and the diagnosis of bronchopleural fistulas.
