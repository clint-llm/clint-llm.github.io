The exact cause of pilomatrixoma is not known, but some studies link it to a mutation in exon 3 of the B-catenin gene (CTNNB1). B-catenin is a component of the cadherin protein, and it plays a role in hair follicle differentiation. High expression of B-catenin leads to activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, and this is seen in the matrix cells that are proliferating. B-catenin, during development, controls the adhesion between epithelial cells. Overexpression of BCL2 proto-oncogene also has been seen in immunohistochemical studies.
