All topographic and tomographic machines have normative data in the system. Additional indices for ectasia, such as the Klyce Maeda and the Rabinowitz indices, are included in the Placido-based systems. The tomographic maps have further been evaluated and analyzed by the Belin-Ambrosio display(BAD-D) and the ABCD progression maps.

**Different Indices and Their Normal Range in Topographic Maps**

**Indices for Placido-based Topography**

- Central K reading (K): <47.2 D (>7.2mm)

- Average Corneal Power (ACP):  40.5 to 46.7 D

- Inferior - Superior Asymmetry (IS):  <1.4

- Corneal Asymmetry Index (CAI) positive for prolate surface, negative for oblate surface: -0.114 to 0.806

- Standard Deviation of Power (SDP): 0.37 to 1.33

- Differential Sector Index (DSI): 0.21 to 3.51

- Opposite Sector Index  (OSI): -0.55 to 2.09

- Center Surround Index (CSI): -0.28 to 0.80

- Irregular Astigmatism Index (IAI): 0.19 to 0.49

- Surface Asymmetry Index (SAI): 0.10 to 0.42

- Surface Irregularity Index (SRI): 0 to 0.56

- Area Analyzed (AA): 0.70 to 0.94

**Indices in Orbscan**

- The ratio between the radius of the anterior best fit sphere (BFS) and posterior best fit sphere (BFS): 1.21 or less is normal; 1.22-1.27 is suspect for ectasia.

- Power of posterior BFS up to 55 D is normal, and >55 D is suspect for ectasia.

- CTI (corneal thickness index): CTI up to 1.16 is normal, and CTI >1.16 is ectasia suspect.

- Irregularity in the 3 mm zone up to 1.15 D is normal, and > 1.15 D is suspect.

- Irregularity in the  5  mm zone up to 2.5 D is normal, and > 2.5 D is suspect.

**Indices in Schiempflug-based Corneal Tomography**

Four maps are displayed together in a Pentacam image. **Four Map Refractive**is the most commonly used display (Figure). Here one map displays the front axial or sagittal curvature, similar to the Placido display. The second map in this four-map display is the pachymetric map. Anterior and posterior elevation maps are the remaining two maps. The anterior and posterior elevation maps are based on the best-fit sphere. Use of best fit toric ellipsoid is done under some circumstances.

**Axial or sagittal map:**It is a two-dimensional image that shows the dioptric power/radius of curvature of the cornea in the central, paracentral and peripheral cornea up to 9 mm. Warm colors like orange and red denote steepening, and cooler colors like blue and green suggest flattening. Corneal power (keratometry) can also be shown as the radius of curvature. The axial or sagittal map is similar to the maps seen on Placido-based systems. Normal corneas are green throughout, with gradual flattening from center to periphery**.**

**Pachymetry map**shows corneal thickness in various areas up to 9 mm. The thicker areas are depicted in cooler colors, and the thinner areas in warmer colors.

**Elevation maps:**The difference between the examined anterior or posterior corneal surface and a standard reference shape 8 mm best fit sphere (BFS) or best fit toric ellipsoid (BFTE) is depicted as the elevation map.
