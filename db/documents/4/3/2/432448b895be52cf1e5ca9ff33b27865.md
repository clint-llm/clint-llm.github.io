According to current literature, two-thirds of women who have had breast cancer surgery develop chronic pain.

Several recent studiesÂ suggest that regional anesthesia combined with general anesthesia is involved in controlling acute postoperative pain avoiding a transition to chronicity, and reducing opioid consumption, which prevents side effects like nausea and vomiting, respiratory depression, and hallucinations in elderly patients, leading to early revalidation, and reduced patient length of stay.

Regional anesthesia has been widely implemented nowadays by anesthesiologists in breast cancer clinics because of its beneficial effects on reducing the resurgence of cancers demonstrated by several retrospective studies.

Therefore, regional anesthesia is best indicated in patients with a history of chronic neuropathy who present with high opioid consumption before surgery or in patients with significant comorbidity factors in whom reduction of general anesthetics may be beneficial for their cardiorespiratory function and cerebral function.
