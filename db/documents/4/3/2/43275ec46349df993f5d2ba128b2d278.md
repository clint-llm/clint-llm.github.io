The use of any modified diet, including a full liquid diet, can be a potential issue for patients if used long-term. For example, in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia, this type of modified diet can lead to poor nutrition. The use of modified diets, including full thickened liquid diets in long-term care patients, has correlations with higher BUN and creatinine levels as well as higher rates of dehydration over time. The use of certain types of full liquid diets can also affect drug absorption. Studies have shown that using full thickened liquid diets to take medications can affect the rate of absorption by delaying drug dissolution. Finally, full liquid diets can affect a patient's quality of life over time due to patient dissatisfaction with taste when supplemented with nutrients, patient discomfort with the texture of diet lacking solid food, and increased thirst depending on what full liquids the patient receives.
