Toxic multinodular goiter emerges from nontoxic multinodular goiter over a long duration. The hallmark of this disease is the presence of true functional autonomy with disordered, structural, and functional heterogeneity. The extent to which thyroid tissue has gained functional autonomy governs the transformation from nontoxic multinodular goiter to toxic multinodular goiter. Somatic point mutations in the TSH receptor (TSHR) gene are substitutions of amino acids that constitutively cause the activation of the TSH receptor in the absence of TSH. TSHR, therefore, appears as going from an off-state to an on-state.

Somatic TSHR gene mutations and G protein mutations have been thought to cause this disease, but we see only about 60% TSHR gene mutations in the nodules and even fewer G protein mutations. Thus, many nodules have an undetermined cause of functional autonomy. Mutations in TSHR genes increase basal (TSH-induced) activation of cAMP, and IP cascades, which keeps TSHR in an inactive unliganded, but thyroid hormone-activated-like state. The hyperactive nodules in Plummer disease have these mutations.

According to the two-state model, the TSH receptor has three states.

- Closed - inactive

- Opened - unliganded

- Opened - hormone activated

Radioiodine studies show localized concentration in one or more discrete nodules with a suppression of the rest of the gland. The thyroid gland in this disease state has areas of hyperfunctioning and hypo-functioning adenomas interspersed between normal suppressed tissue. The inactive tissue takes up iodine in the presence of TSH, indicating that suppression is due to low levels of TSH. If TSH suppression by autonomous nodules is not complete, the non-nodular part of the thyroid gland is not suppressed completely and is faintly or partially visible on thyroid scintigraphy.

Patients with goiter because of iodine deficiency, Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and some thyroid adenomas can experience iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (Jod-Basedow phenomenon) when a patient is made iodine replete whether in the form of iodine supplementation in diet, iodine contrast for imaging, or in the case of amiodarone use.
