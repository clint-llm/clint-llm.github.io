Physical exam findings characteristic of caffeine toxicity include fever, tachycardia or bradycardia, and hypertension early on, followed by hypotension. Pupils may demonstrate mydriasis. Muscles may be rigid, and deep tendon reflexes may be accentuated (hyperreflexia). A neurologic exam may demonstrate altered mentation, agitation, delusional thought, hallucinations, seizures, or even focal neurologic findings thought to be due to ischemia from vasoconstriction. The patient is commonly nauseated and will frequently have vomiting.
