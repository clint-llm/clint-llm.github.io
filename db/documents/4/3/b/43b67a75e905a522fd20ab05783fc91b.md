Uveitic macular edema is the most common cause of loss of visual acuity in patients with posterior uveitis, panuveitis, and also if there is recurrent or chronic intermediate uveitis or anterior uveitis. In the presence of a progressive drop in vision or perception of metamorphopsia or decreased contrast sensitivity, a detailed ophthalmic assessment is vital. The entity needs timely diagnosis and treatment as long-term persistence can lead to permanent visual disturbance. Confirmatory tests like optical coherence tomography and fundus fluorescein angiography, in addition to routine hematological examinations for diagnosing uveitis, will be needed. Treatment may be in the form of steroids or immunomodulatory therapy; injections may be given in the eye. Rarely one may need surgery.
