At birth, growth parameters, such as weight, length, and body mass index, are 15Â to 20% smaller in patients with Prader Willi Syndrome than those of their unaffected siblings, indicating that the growth is irregular during the prenatal period. Hypotonia prenatally causes decreased fetal movement, an abnormal position at the time of the delivery leading to increased cesarean and assisted birth.
