The interprofessional healthcare team includes the patient, the physician, the nurse, certified nurse's aid, and the pharmacist, all working in concert to optimize the patient's health. Therefore, all team members mustÂ remain up to date with literature on medication and potential side effects. Furthermore, they must utilize excellent communication skills between the different disciplines to ensure the desired outcome for their patient. A proper history and continuous physical assessments will need to be performed by the health care team to ensure that propranolol is used correctly, with appropriate precautions maintained in at-risk populations to minimize adverse outcomes. Nurses can offer counsel to the patients on their dosing regimen. The pharmacist can check for potential interactions, reinforce the nurse's counsel, answer patient questions, and report any concerns to the prescriber. This interprofessional approach will yield better therapeutic outcomes when using propranolol. [Level 5]
