Ricin is a lectin (carbohydrate-binding protein) produced in the endosperm of the seeds of the castor oil plant. Ingestion of as few as two castor oil plant seeds has been shown to be toxic, although patientsÂ have survived ingesting as many as 30. Ricin is also toxic by inhalation or injection, and as little as five to ten micrograms per kilogram by inhalation can be lethal. Ricin was developed as a biological weapon by both the United States and the Soviet Union. The castor oil plant grows in the wild in tropical climates. Approximately two million tons of castor seeds are produced yearly around the globe. Castor seeds can be crushed to extract castor oil, which has industrial applications in lubricants, dyes, preservatives, and pharmaceuticals. The waste mash of castor seeds after the oil extraction process is approximately 5% ricin by weight. This waste can be detoxified and used as a fertilizer or as a supplement in animal feed.
