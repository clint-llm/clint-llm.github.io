The pathophysiology of primary dysmenorrhea is not well understood. Nevertheless, the identified cause is due to the hypersecretion of the prostaglandins from the uterine inner lining.Â Prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF-2a) and Prostaglandin PGF 2 increases the uterine tone, and also causes high-amplitude contractions of the uterus.

The uterine contractility is observed to be more prominent in the first two days of the menstrual period. Progesterone levels drop before menstruation, which leads to increased production of PGs' triggering dysmenorrhea.
