It has been thought that the PPC results from hyaloid artery persistence or mesoblastic tissue invasion of the lenticular substance. It manifests as PPC forms during early embryonic life and results in glare, photophobia, and defective vision during the third to fifth decade. An autosomal dominant (AD) pattern has been documented for PPC, but occasionally it can be sporadic.

Positive family history has been reported in about 40 to 50%.

**PPC Linked to Five Genes (CTTP)**

- CTTP1 (OMIM 116600) on chromosome 1p36

- CTTP2 on chromosome 11q22-q22.3

- CTPP3 (OMIM 605387) on chromosome 20p12-q12

- CTPP4 (OMIM 610623) on chromosome 10q25

- CTPP5 (OMIM 610634) on chromosome 14q22-q23

Additionally, the CRYAB gene, 450delA, and Pro20Ser are linked with CTTP2. The CHMP4Bgene is associated with CTTP3.  PITX3 gene, mutation of 38G > A, and 650delG are linked with CTTP4.
