The most serious potential complication from Dressler syndrome is by far pericardial tamponade leading to a risk of complete cardiovascular collapse. There is often a pericardial effusion with Dressler syndrome, and this fluid build-up around the heart can lead to ineffective relaxation and filling of the atrioventricular system by causing direct pressure and therefore affecting both diastolic filling and systolic squeeze. Classic findings of tamponade include Beck's triad:

- Low blood pressure

- Distended neck veins (jugular venous distension)

- Muffled/distant heart tones

This is a true emergency and requires rapid action. Delay in providing removal can lead to cardiac collapse and death. As little as 200 cc can cause tamponade depending upon how rapidly the collection developed. The potential space can hold up to 2 liters of fluid; however, this is quite rare.
