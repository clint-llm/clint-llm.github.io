Neuroimaging and lumbar puncture (LP) are essential initial diagnostic studies for evaluating patients with viral encephalitis. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) help exclude increased intracranial pressure and the risk of uncal herniation prior to performing an LP.

CT may show low-density lesions in the temporal lobes when HSV is involved. These lesions usually appear 3-5 day after the infection.

MRI is also the most sensitive imaging modality for showing findings consistent with HSV encephalitis, such as temporal and frontal lobe involvement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be analyzed for opening pressure, cell counts, glucose, and protein. CSF evaluation should also include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for HSV-1, HSV-2, and enteroviruses. Additional testing, such as serology for arboviruses and HIV testing, may also be done based on history and clinical presentation. Brain biopsy and body fluid specimen cultures and PCR may also be helpful in establishing the etiology in some cases.

The CSF will show:

- Normal glucose

- Moderately elevated proteins

- Moderate lymphocytosis

About 10% of patients will have normal CSF studies.

EEG may show abnormalities in patients with seizures. JE is often associated with 3 EEG patterns that include 1) diffuse delta activity with spikes 2) diffuse continuous delta activity and 3) alpha comma activity.
