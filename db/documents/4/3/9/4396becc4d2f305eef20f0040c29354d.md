Patients with Turner syndrome have an increased mortality rate, three times greater than the general population. Cardiovascular disease due to coronary heart disease and stroke in older patients is a significant factor. Of the congenital cardiovascular disease, an aortic aneurysm is the largest cause. Patients also demonstrate an increase in mortality due to pneumonia, diabetes, epilepsy, liver disease, and kidney disease.
