The most common symptom of valproate toxicity is altered mental status and CNS depression, which can be due to a wide range of conditions. Valproate-induced tremor occurs in about 10% of the patients, which require differentiation from essential tremor and tremors associated with parkinsonism. A comprehensive metabolic panel should assess metabolic derangements, such as hypoglycemia and hypernatremia. As serum ammonia is frequently elevated with valproate poisoning, disorders of urea cycle disorders and hepatic encephalopathy should merit consideration. Suspicion of meningitis should arise when the patient presents with fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status along with irritability. HSV-1 encephalitis may show temporal lobe involvement, which may be evident on brain imaging. Patients with opioid misuse disorder may present with pinpoint pupil, constipation, and severe respiratory depression, which may reverse with IV naloxone.

Arterial blood gas analysis is essential as other causes of anion gap metabolic acidosis may include uremia, methanol poisoning, diabetic ketoacidosis, acetaminophen toxicity, aspirin toxicity, and lactic acidosis.  Sedative-hypnotics drugs can cause respiratory depression, especially if ingested with opioids. The common causes of cerebral edema include neoplasm, intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, and traumatic brain injury, which may reveal focal neurological deficits. Physical examination and MRI helps to rule out the causes mentioned above of cerebral edema from Valproate toxicity. Toxicity with other antiepileptic drugs should always be suspected in confirmed cases of epilepsy.

In summary, differential diagnosis of valproate poisoning is broad, hence a detailed history, physical examination, laboratory evaluation, and cerebral imaging are required.
