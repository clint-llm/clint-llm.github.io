The obturator artery, a branch of the internal iliac artery, passes from within the pelvis through the obturator foramen to enter the medial compartment of the thigh and supplies the muscles in this compartment, though the blood supply to the adductor magnus is derived from many additional vessels as well. As the perforating branches of the profunda femoris artery pass through the adductor magnus, they also are the primary source of the blood supply to the muscle. As with the other adductor muscles, the medial femoral circumflex artery supplies the superior portion of the muscle. The inferior portion of the muscle will be supplied via the femoral artery, the popliteal artery, and the genicular arteries. Adductor magnus receives vascular supply from both its anterior and posterior surfaces.

Lymphatic vessels from the adductor compartment muscles, including the adductor magnus, will drain into the deep inguinal lymph nodes located in the medial compartment of the femoral sheath of the femoral triangle.
