Different studies have reported significantly different rates of priapism in the general population and in specific populations. This means that there is a lack of real information on the prevalence of different types of priapism.

In children, about 2/3 of all those who demonstrate priapism will also have SCD. Thus, among children with SCD, the rate of pediatric priapism is about 25% to 30%.
