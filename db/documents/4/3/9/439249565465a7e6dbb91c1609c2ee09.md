Symptoms related to advanced or recurrent pelvic malignancies include intractable pain, bleeding, sepsis, obstruction, and fistula formations. Some of the symptoms are also related to prior radiation therapy. The primary indication for PE is locally advanced carcinoma, both primary and recurrent. These lesions involve the contiguous pelvic organs or adjacent anatomy, including the pelvic sidewall, neurovascular structures, or boney components of the pelvis: sacrum or pubis. The goal is to achieve a complete oncologic (R0) resection indicated by the absence of malignancy involving the resection margins.

Historically, the triad of unilateral hydronephrosis, leg edema, and sciatic leg pain indicated pelvic sidewall disease that was unresectable. Extra-anatomic resections are now being performed with advanced preoperative planning utilizing pelvic MRI and/or CT angiograms or venograms with R0 rates of 66.5%.
