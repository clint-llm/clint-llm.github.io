Periodic measurements of fasting glucose and HBA1c are recommended for determining the efficacy of treatment. Dose adjustments should be monitored by fasting glucose alone for responsivity at a minimum of 1 week following the start of treatment.

Repaglinide is metabolized by the hepatic isoenzymes CYP3A4Â and CYP2C8. As such, it carries a low therapeutic index as a substrate for inactivation and clearance and is susceptible to concentration changes in the presence of hepatic inducers and inhibitors.

Dose adjustment and closer monitoring may be necessary for concomitant use of the following therapeutic agents:

- Fenofibrate

- Ketoconazole

- Trimethoprim

- Cyclosporine

- Rifampin

- Estrogen-based therapies

- Simvastatin

- Nifedipine

- Clarithromycin

Besides, grapefruit juice may cause pharmacokinetic interactions.
