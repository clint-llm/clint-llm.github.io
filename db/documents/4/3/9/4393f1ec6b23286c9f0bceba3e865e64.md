The vertebral canal contains the spinal cord, from which 31 pairs of spinal nerves arise. These spinal nerves control motor, sensory, and other functions.

Innervation of the vertebrae is by the recurrent meningeal branches. These arise from the mixed spinal nerve, formed by the union of the posterior (dorsal) spinal root, which is sensory, and the anterior (ventral) spinal root, which is motor. The sensory neurons have cell bodies in the posterior (dorsal) root ganglia, whereas the anterior (ventral) neurons have cell bodies in the anterior gray horn. TwoÂ to four recurrent meningeal branches in each right and left mixed spinal nerve supply sensation for the vertebrae. Motor functions reside in the paraspinal muscles (erector spinae).
