Linitis plastica carries a poor prognosis owing to the late stage of metastatic disease at the time of the initial discovery of the disease. This late diagnosis is due to absent clinical manifestations at the early stages of the disease, as the gastric mucosa is mostly spared, rendering the patient asymptomatic until the late stages.

Median survival ranges from 5Â to 17 months in case of surgical intervention.
