Possible contraindications to bedside incision and drainage include large and deep abscesses, the presence of a pulsatile mass at the site of infection, proximity to the vasculature and nervous structures, the presence of a foreign body, and particular locations of an abscess.

Certain locations on the body make bedside incision and drainage more technically difficult to perform, whether due to the inherent sensitivity of the area (e.g., the palms, soles, and face) or associated complications. Examples of locations that warrant evaluation by surgery due to a high potential for complications include perirectal and periareolar abscesses, which could be complicated by fistula formation. An otolaryngologist should evaluate neck abscesses that could potentially have developed from preexisting cystic lesions.

Consider also the need for prophylactic antibiotics in patients with abnormal or artificial heart valves as this may delay the procedure. Additionally, it is prudent to inquire about underlying bleeding disorders and to determine a history of allergy to lidocaine, epinephrine, or latex if using latex gloves.
