The ocular examination should include a detailed slit lamp examination. The important features to be looked at include retinoscopy, best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, anterior chamber angle and depth, gonioscopy, lens morphology, and signs of subluxation. Dilated fundus examination is needed to look for glaucomatous disc changes, myopic retinal changes, or coexisting retinal pathology. Gupta et al. reported an E sign for early recognition of microspherophakia cases clinically.

Extra investigations might include lens thickness, axial length, ultrasound biomicroscopy, and anterior segment optical coherence tomography. These investigations might help understand the mechanism of angle closure in these patients. The role of iTrace has been described in analyzing the underlying cause of pre-operative reduced visual acuity and predicting postoperative outcomes.

Often, patients might have reduced endothelial cell count, and electron microscopy might be needed before planning surgical intervention in these cases.
