No current disease-modifying, curative therapies exist for frontotemporal dementia. Treatment must center upon symptom management with particular consideration for supportive measures for patients, families, and caregivers. There is a consensus that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are beneficial in the management of behavioral symptoms.

Non-pharmacologic interventions have a prominent role in addressing symptoms and delaying disease progression. Physical therapy and exercise can slow cognitive decline while speech therapy may mitigate language deficits in patients with the primary progressive aphasia variants.

Patient and caregiver education is paramount and can ameliorate the guilt and stigma associated with the neuropsychiatric features of the disease. Support groups and community resources must be made available to caregivers, and their psychological health should be featured in family discussions.
