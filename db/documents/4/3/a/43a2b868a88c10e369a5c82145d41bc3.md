As tympanic membrane rupture is generally unintentional, prevention tactics are limited. However, patients should always be instructed not to use cotton tip swabs in an attempt to clean the ear, as this can cause direct trauma and perforation. One study discovered that of 949Â patients with TM perforation, 261 were caused by the use of cotton tip applicators for cleaning their ear canal.
