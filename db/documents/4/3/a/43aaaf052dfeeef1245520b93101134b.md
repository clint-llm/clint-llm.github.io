Patients who undergo treatment for oral malignancies often display long-term impairments in swallow and speech due to resection of anatomic oral structures, soft tissue fibrosis from radiation, and mucositis from chemoradiation. Early consultation with speech and swallow professionals is vital for assisting the patient in regaining some pre-treatment function to prevent malnutrition, aspiration, long-term reliance on enteric feeding, and poor communication.

Recurrence can often occur many years after initial treatment, and continuous follow-up is needed.
