A fasciotomy procedure is a procedure used to decompress acute compartment syndrome. Most commonly, acute compartment syndrome occurs in the leg and the forearm in the setting of acute trauma. This article highlights the exact steps needed to perform these two common fasciotomies. A high index of suspicion is necessary for the early detection of compartment syndrome from the whole interdisciplinary team and the low threshold for intervention needed by the responsible healthcare professional.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for fasciotomy.
- Describe the technique of fasciotomy.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of fasciotomies.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance fasciotomies and improve outcomes.
