Various factors influence spinal accessory nerve (SAN) function after an insult, such as the type of neck dissection, the extent of injury, radiation therapy, the interval between trauma and repair, the vascularity, and length of the graft.

In a study in which half of the patients received primary nerve repair and half of the patients received nerve graft,  it was found that the recovery time ranged between 4 to 10 months.

A study by Eickmeyer et al. observed that in neck cancer cases, patients who underwent nerve-sparing neck dissection did better in terms of residual function as opposed to patients who were managed with nerve-sacrificing dissection. Additionally, a correlation was seen between decreased scores on QOL measures and reduced shoulder flexion and abduction. Those who did not undergo neck dissection showed the best level of function.
