A Segond fracture can normally be diagnosed with a plain radiograph. A bony fragment (avulsion fracture) is seen in the anteroposterior view of the knee on the lateral aspect of the proximal tibia.

As previously discussed, with likely underlying ligamentous and or meniscal injuries, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary for further evaluation,Â which may also highlight the more subtle Segond fractures.

Computed tomography is not usually used in the diagnosis of Segond fractures. While there is a much higher sensitivity for diagnosing fractures with CT Scan, MRI is the imaging modality of choice to identify the specific associated ligamentous injuries in the knees.
