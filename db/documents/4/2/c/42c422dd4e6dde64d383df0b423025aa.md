The management of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not simple and requires clinical acumen. When encountering such patients, an interprofessional approach with an infectious disease expert, emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, internist, pharmacist, and a nurse is recommended.

Most patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria will not develop symptomatic urinary tract infections and will have no adverse consequences from asymptomatic bacteriuria.  Specifically, children, patients with diabetes, older patients, patients with spinal cord injuries, and patients with indwelling urinary catheters do not benefit from treatment with antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Treatment in these patients does not decrease the incidence of symptomatic urinary tract infections or improve survival. However, it does increase the likelihood of adverse effects of antibiotics and the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

In contrast, treatment of pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria has been shown to be beneficial.

The nurse should focus on assisting with patient education and assisting the family in learning to help the patient. The pharmacist may provide guidance to the clinician regarding medication choices as needed and help prevent drug-drug interactions. The clinical team of pharmacist, nurse, and clinician working together to educate and assist the patient and family will result in the best outcomes. [Level V]
