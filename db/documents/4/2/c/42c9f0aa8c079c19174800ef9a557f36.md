Bedpan use in today's society is not that different from use in the 18th century. Bedpans are a way of addressing elimination concerns when the traditional toilet is not an option due to high risk of injury or debilitating illness in sick, bed-confined individuals.

There are 2 types of bedpans: regular or fracture. The regular bedpan is larger than its fracture counterpart. The fracture pan has one flat end for ease of use with specific patient populations: i.e., hip fractures, hip replacements, or lower extremity fractures. Bariatric bedpans are available up to a 1200-pound (544-kg) capacity.

Using the toilet may be a source of discomfort and embarrassment among all genders. Semi-private rooms or shared wards and hospital overcrowding are a challenge regarding patient privacy.
