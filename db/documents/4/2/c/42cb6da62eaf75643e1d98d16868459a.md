The pelvic examination presents very useful information in certain clinical circumstances, but it is important that the examination is done from a patient-centered approach with proper preparation and procedure to avoid iatrogenic effects, such as pain, traumatization, and anxiety. Physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners should be familiar with exam techniques. Nurses should be experienced in providing examination support and assuring patient modesty.
