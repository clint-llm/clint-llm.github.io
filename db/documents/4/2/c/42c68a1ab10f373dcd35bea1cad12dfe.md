Contraindications for mesalamine include hypersensitivity to mesalamine, salicylates, or aminosalicylates. Contraindications also include patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment due to the toxic nature of mesalamine in the kidneys and the liver. Other contraindications for using mesalamine are urinary tract obstruction and use in infants and patients with existing gastric or duodenal ulcers.

**Warning/Precautions**

**Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome**

Mesalamine administration is associated with an acute intolerance syndrome which may be difficult to differentiate from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. It has occurred in approximately 3% of the controlled clinical study populations of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms reported include abdominal pain, cramping, headache, malaise, pruritis, conjunctivitis, rash, bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever. Clinicians should monitor patients closely for worsening of mentioned symptoms while using mesalamine. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, it is recommended to discontinue treatment with mesalamine promptly.

**Photosensitivity**

Patients with pre-existing atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema treated with mesalamine have reported severe photosensitivity reactions. It is advised to avoid sun exposure, wear protective gear, and use broad-spectrum sunscreen when sun exposure occurs.

**Nephrolithiasis**

There are cases of nephrolithiasis reported with the administration of mesalamine (including stones made of 100% mesalamine content). These stones are radiotransparent and not detectable by radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate fluid intake by patients during treatment with mesalamine.

**Interference with Laboratory Tests**

Normetanephrine is a metabolite of norepinephrine. This laboratory test is ordered to detect possible pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. Administration of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated laboratory test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of its similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine.
