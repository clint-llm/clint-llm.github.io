Chronic venous disease has a high prevalence. However, it is under-recognized and therefore undertreated. Initial recognition begins at the level of the primary care physician or a primary care provider. Often lower extremity venous stasis changes are mistakenly treated for cellulitis or dermatologic conditions. It is important to refer the patient to an appropriate vascular specialist where definitive evaluation can occur. Vascular technologists trained in performing venous reflux studies should be involved in testing patients presenting with chronic venous disease. It is particularly important to follow testing protocols as recommended by the Society of Vascular Surgery guidelines.

The Society of Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum have developed guidelines for treating varicose veins, venous insufficiency, and chronic venous disease. The current guidelines were developed after an exhaustive review of the existing literature, including randomized trials, registries, meta-analyses, etc. The level of evidence for the use of Radiofrequency ablation in treating varicose veins has been graded as moderate by the society of vascular surgery.
