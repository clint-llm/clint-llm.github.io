The presence of risk factors in history, in combination with clinical features, should prompt further evaluation for Mycotic aneurysms. There is no diagnostic algorithm or criteria to make the diagnosis, but a combination of clinical, laboratory, imaging, and intraoperative findings suggest the diagnosis of an infected aneurysm. Clinical presentation with fever, local findings, immunosuppressive state, presence of atherosclerosis risk factors, and concomitant infection. Laboratory findings are elevated inflammatory parametersÂ CRP, ESR, leucocytosis, positive blood culture

Bacterial cultures are positive in 50-85% of the cases.

Radiologic findings are the most sensitive and specific indicators. Findings that are highly suggestive include:

- Saccular with lobulated contours

- Soft tissue inflammation surrounding the vessel wall (seen as perivascular contrast enhancement)

- Intramural air or air collection around the blood vessel

- Perianeurysmal fluid collection

Contrast-enhanced CT scan is the initial imaging modality of choice for aortic aneurysms, contrast-enhanced MR angiography is a suitable alternative. Digital subtraction angiography can provide the same information, although it is more invasive.

The monitoring of antibiotic therapy is done by serial inflammatory markers, and serial imaging studies are performed for patients before and after definitive surgery.
