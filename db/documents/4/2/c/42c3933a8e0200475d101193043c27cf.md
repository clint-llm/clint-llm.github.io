Here are some important points to remember:

- ARMD is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly age group.

- Regular follow up in cases of early ARMD can help in the timely recognition of signs of progression and facilitate initiation of treatment.

- With the advent of SD-OCT, the follow up of these patients has improved significantly. Various prognostic markers that have been identified on SD-OCT are useful clinically in decision making regarding treatment and patient education and counseling regarding the visual prognosis.

- Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections have largely replaced all the other treatment modalities. The visual acuity achieved at the end of the treatment period is much better than that achieved with the laser. Patients' quality of life has improved. With treat and extent regimen being used widely, the burden of the cost of injections, as well as the number of visits to the hospital, have reduced significantly.

- Low vision aids are very helpful in rehabilitating the patients who progress to blindness despite treatment.

- The disease is a bilateral process that makes the patient dependent and affects the quality of life.

- The cost of intravitreal injections is a burden for the patient.

- Regular follow up in cases of monthly dosing also increases the number of visits to the hospital.
