While preparing glasses, it is essential to understand the prismatic effects of spherical lenses and Prentice's rule for prisms.Â The prismatic effect of the spherical lens is essential whenever the patient being evaluated has an underlying refractive error. A plus or a hyperopic lens behaves like two prism lenses stacked base to base.

A minus or a myopic lens behaves like two prism lenses stacked apex to apex. Thus, the refractive correction affects the measured deviation and must be born in the mind. The measured deviation will be lesser with a plus lens and more when measured with a minus lens in situ.

**Prentice's Rule**

This law is named after a famous optician Charles F. Prentice. As per this rule, the prismatic power of the lens at any point on its surface equals the distance from its optical center, measured in centimeters multiplied by the power of the lens in diopters. There is no prismatic power at the center of the lens. Thus, it is vital that to avoid any prismatic effect, the lens's optical center should be fitted directly in front of the pupil.

**Formula**

Prismatic effect = power of the lens (DD) 'Distance off from the optic center in mm
