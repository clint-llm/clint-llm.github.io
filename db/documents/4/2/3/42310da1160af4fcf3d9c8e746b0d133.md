**Absolute Contraindications**

- Angina

- Tachydysrhythmias

- Preexisting ventricular arrhythmias

- Digoxin intoxication

- Sulfa allergy: Contains sulfites

Isoproterenol requires caution in patients with the following:

- Cardiovascular disease: Isoproterenol causes an increase in myocardial oxygen demand

- Diabetes: May cause an increase in blood glucose levels

- Distributive shock: Beta-2 agonism will further decrease total peripheral resistance

- Hyperthyroidism: May induce thyroid storm

- The drug contains sulfites which may provoke an allergic reaction in patients with a sulfa allergy

- Elderly

**Pregnancy**

Isoproterenol is a Pregnancy Risk Factor C. It may interfere with uterine contractions due to its beta-2 agonist properties. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted at this time. It is currently unknown if isoproterenol is present in breast milk; breastfeeding mothers are advised to exercise caution when taking isoproterenol. There is no human data available regarding the effect of isoproterenol on milk production.

**Drug Interactions**

**Risk C: Monitor Therapy**

- Atomoxetine: Propensity to increase heart rate

- Cannabinoid-containing products: Propensity to increase heart rate

- COMT Inhibitors: Isoproterenol is degraded by catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) and may rise to dangerous levels in the presence of a COMT inhibitor

- Doxofylline: Increased risk of doxofylline toxicity

- Tedizolid: Increased risk of a hypertensive episode

**Risk D: Consider Modifying Therapy**

- Topical Cocaine: Heightened risk of hypertension, tachycardia, and increased oxygen demand

- Linezolid: Increased risk of hypertension due to COMT inhibitor-like action of linezolid

- Mifepristone: QTc prolongation

- QTc prolonging agents: Avoid giving isoproterenol in combination with other QTc prolonging agents.

**Risk X: Avoid or Use Alternatives**

- Inhaled Anesthetics: Increased risk of arrhythmia

- Benzphetamine

- Clomipramine

- Diethylpropion

- Epinephrine

- Methamphetamine

- Midodrine

- Phendimetrazine

- Procarbazine

- Sotalol
