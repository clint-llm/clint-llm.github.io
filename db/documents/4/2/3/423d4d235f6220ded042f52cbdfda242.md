In studies of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction or AHR, researchers found that a significant portion of hypersensitive diagnoses were false positives using epicutaneous patch testing. HLA B 5701 screening has shown to have a 100% negative predictive value.

In the diagnosis of hypersensitivity in patients, clinicians must use patch testing to confirm their diagnosis. In blind comparative trial regimens, two to seven percent of patients were diagnosed with hypersensitivity without receiving abacavir.
