Transurethral resection of the prostate or TURP is a procedure where the prostate is resected from an endoscopic approach. It was the first major, minimally invasive surgery of the modern era. A TURP can also be used to unroof prostatic abscesses, as well as open the ejaculatory ducts in some cases of obstructive azoospermia. Transurethral resection of the prostate is a procedure used in the management of bladder outlet obstruction caused by prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic abscess management. This procedure should be performed if the patient desires to be off of medical management for bladder outlet obstruction or who fails medical management. This activity describes and explains the role of the physician and medical staff in evaluating patients for possible TURP.
