There is minimal information available about contraindications with cannabis-derived pharmaceuticals and medical cannabis. Known contraindications to dronabinol, a synthetic THC and DEA schedule 3 drug, include hypersensitivity to the drug, allergy to cannabinoids/propylene glycol/peppermint oil,Â as well as concomitant use of ritonavir, which may lead to potential toxicity.

Medical contraindications are cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, poorly controlled hypertension, severe heart failure, history of psychotic disorder, patients under eight years old, pregnant women, or nursing women.

One study showed that marijuana could worsen preexisting heart disease, resulting in up to a five-fold increase in heart attacks one hour after smoking marijuana.
