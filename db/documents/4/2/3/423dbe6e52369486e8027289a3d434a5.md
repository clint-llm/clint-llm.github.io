SPG RFA should be performed by appropriately trained physicians with experience using fluoroscopy for needle placement. These physicians are typically fellowship-trained and board-certified in pain medicine, with backgrounds in anesthesiology, physical medicine, rehabilitation (PM&R), neurology, emergency medicine, family medicine, or psychiatry. Support staff should include a radiology technician, a nurse to assist with equipment, an anesthesia provider, and patient support.
