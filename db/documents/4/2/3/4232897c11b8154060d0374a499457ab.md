Treatment of AI should begin with proper refraction and correcting any underlying refractive error. It should be noted that low levels of ametropia may have an exacerbating effect on individuals with AI. Correction of these small refractive errors may substantially alleviate the symptoms of AI for the sufferer.

Examples of these signs include low PRA and amplitude of accommodation values. Others are high retinoscopic values as measured with the MEM method and difficulty clearing the minus lenses during accommodative facility testing. This may be a problem for myopes as prescribing plus lenses can negate the refractive endpoint. Myopes, however, may benefit from bifocals or progressive lenses, especially if they are found to suffer AI or accommodative esophoria. Studies have shown that this may slow myopic progression.

In cases where the cause of AI is organic or due to a paralysis of the accommodative system, plus lenses can be recommended either permanently or temporarily as needed.

Vision therapy offers some promise in managing AI and is generally aimed at improving accommodative amplitude and positive fusional vergence in reserve.
