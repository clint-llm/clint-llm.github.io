If sensory neuropathy is not managed within an acute time frame, the results can be debilitating. Patients will often suffer from varying degrees of burns and other traumatic dermal injuries due to the lack of protective sensation. This sensory loss, in turn, increases the risk of infection secondary to these traumatic events as these injuries are usually not treated quickly and efficiently. In older populations, the risk of accidental falls also increases as balance and strength diminish.

Again, in patients with diabetes mellitus who present with concomitant sensory neuropathy, the complications are significant and life-altering. As a protective threshold is lost, it is not uncommon for a patient to step on a sharp object such as glass or a rusty nail and remain unaware until they notice bleeding from their socks. These injuries are extremely common in the emergency room and constitute a significant challenge for the medical team.

Severe infections leading to sepsis and gangrene of the lower extremities due to chronic neuropathic ulcerations or retention of a foreign body is one of the leading causes of amputation in people with diabetes. The overall risk of developing diabetic foot ulceration is around 2% per year; that statistic increases to about 7% in those with sensory neuropathy, a staggering causal finding.
