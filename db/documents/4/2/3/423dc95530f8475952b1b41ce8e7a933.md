Mucormycosis, especially when caused by Rhizopus arrhizus, is an acute and rapidly fatal disease. These organisms can invade blood vessels and cause destruction quickly. The infection rapidly accelerates and extends into adjacent tissues and structures. Necrotic and black tissue develops in the nares, palate, or orbit. The organisms can invade vessels and initiate a clotting response that leads to infarction. This tissue death leads to acidosis, which continues to feed the growth and destruction of the fungal organisms. This lack of blood flow also makes treatment with antifungals more difficult. Due to angioinvasion, the infection can quickly progress to fungemia and the disseminated form.
