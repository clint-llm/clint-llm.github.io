The following features of the patient's history and/or examination should make clinicians suspicious that the patient has pneumocephalus:

- CSF leak from the nose, ear, or surgical site

- Persistent headache after cranial or spinal surgery

- Seizures following surgery

- Postoperative meningitis

- Frontal lobe syndrome

- Flapping scalp sign

- Oculomotor nerve palsy

- Tinnitus

**Physical Examination**

Pneumocephalus is a clinically difficult diagnosis. Rarely, some patients may describe a splashing sound on head movement (known as bruit hydro-aerique), which can be auscultatedÂ as well. TP can lead to deterioration in sensorium and papilledema. The same features in the posterior fossa may cause brainstem signs, respiratory irregularities, and cardiac arrest. Even paraplegia and hemiplegia have been reported following TP.
