Skeletal scintigraphy relies on intravenous administration. Most of the common complications of this examination originate from a failure of proper injection.

Extravasation of the injected Tc99m-MDP into the soft tissues causes the following three problems:

-  Minimal radiotracer reaches the bones and thus severely degrades visibility of osteoblastic pathology.

- The extravasated radiotracer is taken up by the lymphatic system which complicates same-day re-injection due to retention in lymph nodes which may obscure underlying bone pathology.

- The intense tracer uptake coming from the injection site degrades the image of the skeleton due to the image being derived from extraneous photons arising from the site of extravasation.

Arterial injection may also rarely occur which produces the "glove" phenomenon. The glove phenomenon is characterized by significant asymmetric uptake extending from the arterial injection site down into the fingers.
