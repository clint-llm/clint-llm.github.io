Because chemical and surgical neurolysis potentially have very serious side effects, a thorough knowledge of the relevant anatomy and mechanism by which the agent destroys nerve tissue is essential. Anatomy depends on the sensory territory to block. Neurolytic block can, therefore, theoretically be applied anywhere along the sensory pathway. As a consequence, peripheral nerves, sympathetic ganglia, and dorsal roots are all examples of potential targets for neurolysis. The procedure can be practiced by guidance through ultrasonography, fluoroscopy, and/or nerve stimulation. It is important to first perform a prognostic block with a local anesthetic in order to assess efficacy. Important preconditions for the application of peripheral neurolytic block include good knowledge of anatomy, attention to and control of side effects, as well as the choice of the correct block techniques.
