Owing to the scarcity of literature, poor understanding of the pathophysiology, and modest response to therapy, the overall prognosis of the CG spectrum or OFG is not encouraging. The monosymptomatic form, i.e., CGM, may resolve with the treatments mentioned above. MRS has the poorest prognosis with no published evidence on the response of neurological complications of MRS to treatment.
