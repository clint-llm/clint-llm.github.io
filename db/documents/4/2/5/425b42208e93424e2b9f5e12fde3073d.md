**Mechanism of Ventricular Tachycardia**

Ventricular tachycardia is a diverse group of tachyarrhythmias, and its cellular mechanism depends on the underlying structural heart disease and channelopathy. Understanding the mechanism of ventricular tachycardia helps in the risk stratification of patients and guides appropriate management strategies. Reentry is the most common mechanism of ventricular tachycardia, followed by triggered activity and enhanced automaticity.

The basic mechanism of ventricular tachycardia in long QT syndromes is triggered activity due to early after-depolarization. While delayed after-depolarization is the main mechanism of ventricular tachycardia in catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, verapamil-sensitive VT,  and digoxin toxicity.

**Hemodynamic Consequences of Ventricular Tachycardia**

The hemodynamic effects of ventricular tachycardia depend on coronary artery disease,  left ventricular systolic function, valvular heart disease, and other co-morbid conditions. The rapid ventricular rate in VT leads to low cardiac output due to a significant reduction in preload as well as stroke volume.

Ventricular tachycardia is relatively well tolerated in patients with a structurally normal heart, but incessant VT may lead to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, hemodynamic instability, heart failure, and syncope.
