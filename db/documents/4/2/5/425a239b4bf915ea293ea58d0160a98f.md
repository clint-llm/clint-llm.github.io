The two major treatment options include surgery or close monitoring. Generally, surgical excision is the recommended treatment unless there is a contraindication to surgery. The goal of surgical treatment is to excise all visible tumor and reconstruct any resultant intracardiac defects. Papillary fibroelastoma tumors are typically attached to a pedicle and are excisable with precision. Other chambers of the heart are inspected to avoid missing multiple PFEs. If the PFE significantly damages a valve, it may warrant valve repair or replacement at the time of surgery. If the patient is a poor surgical candidate and yet they are symptomatic, then consideration of anticoagulation is reasonable. The rationale for this approach is to prevent embolic complications. However, there are no randomized controlled trials to support this practice. Asymptomatic patients with a PFE size over 9 mm, highly mobile masses, and independent motion are predictors of poor outcomes and, thus, should be considered for surgery.
