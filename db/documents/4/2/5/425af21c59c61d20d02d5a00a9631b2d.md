Mesenteric artery thrombosis is a serious illness with potentially catastrophic implications absent the initiation of prompt diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis and treatment require an efficient, collaborative approach involving physicians, nursing, as well as laboratory and radiology personnel. Because there is no specific test to make the diagnosis of mesenteric artery thrombosis, the general surgeon should be consulted early in the care of the patient. Most patients need immediate resuscitation and treatment. The overall outlook for most patients is poor.
