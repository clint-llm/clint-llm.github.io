Hydrocodone is a schedule II semi-synthetic opioid medication used to treat pain. Hydrocodone is also an antitussive indicated for cough in adults. In January 2018, the FDA required safety labeling changes for prescription cough and cold medicines containing hydrocodone or codeine to limit the use of these products to adults 18 years of age and older. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, toxicity, and other key elements of hydrocodone therapy in the clinical setting as relates to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients with pain and its related conditions and sequelae.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of hydrocodone.
- Outline the approved uses for initiating hydrocodone therapy.
- Summarize the adverse event profile using hydrocodone.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance hydrocodone therapy and improve outcomes and minimize adverse events and misuse, especially in light of the ongoing opioid crisis.
