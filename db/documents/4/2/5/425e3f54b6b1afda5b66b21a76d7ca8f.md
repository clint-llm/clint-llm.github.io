Gustatory testing is either used in research or for diagnostic purposes in the clinical setting. The latter is challenging due to the subjectivity of most testing methods, meaning the tests cannot be validated or applied to certain patient groups. In terms of research, increasing emphasis is being placed on the need to develop more objective and validated methods.

In the clinical environment, gustatory testing is indicated in any patient that reports distorted taste, and only once olfactory pathology has been ruled out. Testing for detection thresholds (using the three-drop method, taste tablets, or electrogustometry) may be useful in patients suffering from medication-induced hypogeusias in order to prove and document the disorder, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of medications so that necessary adjustments can be made. If a peripheral nerve lesion is suspected, which most commonly causes an ipsilateral ageusia following a surgical procedure, regional gustatory testing is indicated using taste strips or filter paper disks. Any whole-mouth test would be unsuitable in such a case. Taste-testing might also be useful in appetite disorders, where our perception of flavor plays an important role in diet and nutritional intake.
