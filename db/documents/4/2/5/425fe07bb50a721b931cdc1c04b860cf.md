Fludrocortisone acetate is an inactive pro-drug requiring hydrolyzation by esterases or pseudo-esterases in the liver and other body fluids.

Upon binding, receptor complex translocates to the nucleus and initiates the transcription of responsive genes to exert its effects. The primary sites of fludrocortisone's effect are the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts, where it enhances Na+ and water retention as well as increasing K+, H+ excretion. This pharmacologic effect leads to a generalized ECF volume expansion not specifically targeted to the intravascular space. Thus, it is postulated that its efficacy in orthostatic hypotension management is due to potentiating the pressor effects of various endogenous vasoconstrictors such as norepinephrine and angiotensin II.
