If there has been inadequate proximal resection or failure of the nerve to retract, the neural stump can become enlarged and bulbous. The neural stump may also adhere to the adjacent bone and soft tissue, causing traction neuritis. It can cause pain and tenderness in the webbed space of previous neuroma excision at or proximal to the metatarsal heads. The clinical examination, investigations, and non-operative management are the same as for a primary neuroma. For surgery, both dorsal and plantar incisions are recommended. The dorsal incision has to be extended proximally to visualize the stump, but sometimes, exposure can be difficult. The plantar approach provides better exposure so that the nerve is identified and resected easily.
