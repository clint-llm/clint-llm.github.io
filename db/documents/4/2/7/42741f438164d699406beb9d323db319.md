The positive findings of a urine culture can lead to the diagnosis of UTI (uncomplicated vs. complicated), asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), catheter-associated UTI (CA-UTI), and catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria (CA-ASB). These diagnoses lead to the possible identification ofÂ the source of sepsis. Proper diagnosis lends itself to proper antibiotic stewardship and decreases in morbidity and mortality. As up to 25% of hospitalized patients in North America receive indwelling catheter placement, utilization of the urine culture is of utmost importance to determine potential diagnoses.
