The primary goal in preparation for the Ross procedure along with any other surgical procedure is to achieve sterility. This means the chest needs to be shaved and sterilized, followed by placement of sterile drapes to allow access to the surgical field only once the opening of the chest during the procedure has occurred. The Ross procedure is conducted under general anesthesia, and therefore pre-anesthetic evaluation and intubation for maintaining airway and sedation are utilized. Depending on the center and the operator, pre-operative and perioperative transesophageal echo may be performed.
