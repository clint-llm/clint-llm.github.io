Many cases of enuresis lack an identifiable cause. Common etiologies in children are constipation and neurodevelopmental disorders. Various etiologies have been discussed, including poor arousal from sleep, delayed bladder maturation decreased bladder capacity, and decreased vasopressin release. Enuresis has also been attributable to various medical conditions or medications listed in differential diagnoses seen below.

Risk factors for enuresis include unusual stress, low socioeconomic status, parental divorce, sibling birth, and family history of enuresis. Enuresis has high genetic susceptibility, with children having a rate of 44% if one parent wet the bed and a rate of 77% if both parents had a history of wetting the bed. No specific gene has been linked to enuresis.Â  Studies have found gene linkages on chromosomes 8, 12, 13, and 16.

Constipation is also a cause of enuresis due to bladder pressure.
