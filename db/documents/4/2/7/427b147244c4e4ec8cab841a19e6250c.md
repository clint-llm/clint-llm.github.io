Neck masses are commonly seen by primary caregivers, nurse practitioners, and internists. In most cases, the diagnosis of the neck mass is made by fine-needle aspiration. When medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is diagnosed, the patient should be referred to a surgeon and an oncologist. In about 25% of cases, MTC is associated with the MEN syndrome.

Surgical resection is the primary treatment modality for medullary thyroid cancer. Medullary thyroid cancer does not respond to RAI or conventional chemotherapy. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression is not required for medullary thyroid cancer as C cells do not have the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor. As mentioned previously all patients should be evaluated for hyperparathyroidism and pheochromocytoma. If pheochromocytoma is found, it should be removed before thyroid surgery.

Total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection is indicated for all patients with medullary thyroid cancer. Following surgery, patients need lifelong thyroxine and require monitoring for recurrence, which is rare. Most patients have a good prognosis after surgery in early-stage disease.
