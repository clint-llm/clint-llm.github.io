A pediatric or neonatal provider can manage most patients with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. However, patients suspected of genetic causes of hyperbilirubinemia may need consultations and follow-ups with a pediatric gastroenterologist, hematologist, and medical geneticist.

Patients suspected of neonatal cholestasis should be referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist at the earliest. Most of these patients will need a battery of investigation, and once a cause of cholestasis is identified, more referrals would be warranted. Infants diagnosed with biliary atresia also need a referral to a pediatric gastrointestinal surgeon for corrective surgery. Likewise, patients with inborn errors of metabolism would need a consultation with a metabolic specialist as well as a medical geneticist and a Dietician experienced in metabolic disorders.
