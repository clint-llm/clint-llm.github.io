Light travels through the cornea, anterior chamber, pupil, lens, and the posterior chamber, eventually reaching the retina. Photoreceptor cells in the outer layers of the retina, which are called rods and cones, convert light stimuli into neuronal impulses. These signals are then relayed to the bipolar cells, which interact with ganglion cells, which in turn coalesce to form the optic disc and optic nerve (CN II). The optic nerve sends impulses to the brain for further processing and image recognition.
