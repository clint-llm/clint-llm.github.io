Superior mesenteric artery syndrome, also known as Wilkie syndrome, is a rare disorder that results in compression of the vessel. It is believed thatÂ there is an acute angulation of the superior mesenteric artery which results in compression between the third part of the duodenum and the abdominal aorta. The syndrome is known to occur in patients with low body weight, most notably young children.

Dissection of the superior mesenteric artery is a rare, but severe condition that has been reported. It presents with severe abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea and is often confused with acute mesenteric ischemia. It is most commonly found on CT angiogram of the abdomen. There is no consensus opinion on the ideal management of superior mesenteric artery dissection. Options include surgery, interventional radiology placement of a stent, or conservative management.
