Anterior lenticonus is an acquired ocular disorder usually associated with Alport syndrome, and posterior lenticonus is an isolated ocular pathology that is congenital. Patients with lenticonus should be examined holistically to decide whether the eye needs surgical intervention.

A systemic examination is mandatory in these cases to rule out life-threatening sequelae. The visual outcome is usually good in these cases, and visual acuity improves after IOL implantation. It is vital to implant foldable IOL in the bag or the sulcus in cases with pre-existing posterior capsular defects or deficiencies. Children having amblyopia and strabismus usually have poor outcomes.
