Cardioplegia administration can be anterograde, retrograde, or both. The anterograde cardioplegia is inserted in the proximal aorta and contains three lumens: one to administer the cardioplegia, another for suctioning, and the third to measure intraluminal pressure.

During cases with anatomical variants such as an incompetent aortic valve, severe coronary artery stenosis, previous coronary artery bypass graft to the internal mammary artery, or previous damage to coronary arterial ostia are all indications to supplement cardioplegia with a retrograde cardioplegia approach. The cardioplegia catheter is inserted via atriotomy in the right atrium into the coronary sinus, and flow is administered in a retrograde fashion. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography is used to confirm the position of coronary sinus cannula. Using only retrograde cardioplegia into the coronary sinus may be insufficient for adequate myocardial protection to the right ventricle due to the anterior cardiac veins draining directly into the right atrium and not to the coronary sinus.
