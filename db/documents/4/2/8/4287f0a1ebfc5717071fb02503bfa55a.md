# Introduction

Antithrombin is a plasma glycoprotein consisting of 432 amino acid residues integral in the regulation of the coagulation process during bleeding. Antithrombin most notably binds to serine proteases factor II (thrombin), factor IXa, and factor Xa which inhibits the blood clotting process involved in the coagulation cascade pathway. As part of the normal physiological response to bleeding, platelets circulating the plasma become initially activated by multiple factors produced from endothelial cells to aggregate and form a plug. Circulating fibrinogen is then converted into fibrin by thrombin through a series of protease activations, which constitute the reactions of the coagulation cascade pathway. Fibrin acts to stabilize the initial platelet-created plug which determines the completion of the clot formation.

Antithrombin is among the number of regulatory mechanisms of the coagulation cascade which provides a counter mechanism to clot formation. It serves as up to 80% of the inhibitory component to thrombin formation, as well as factor IXa and factor Xa inhibition.

# Molecular Level

Antithrombin is part of a family of serine protease inhibitors known as serpins. Serpins generally consist of a highly conserved structure of amino acid chains organized into three beta-sheets, nine alpha sheets, and a reactive center loop (RCL) designated as the sequence of amino acids which serve as the reactive site for protease interaction

Synthesis of antithrombin occurs primarily in the liver initially as an immature protein chain made up of 464 amino acid residues. The amino acid chain is then cleaved at the N-terminal by 32 amino acids, thereby creating a mature 432 amino acid sequence protein. The mature protein contains three disulfide bonds that intermolecularly link six cysteine residues together. This configuration allows for four potential glycosylation sites to exist within the molecule.

Alpha antithrombin refers to antithrombin in which oligosaccharides bind all four glycosylation sites. It is the predominant configuration of antithrombin, presenting as around 90% of the antithrombin in the plasma.

# Mechanism

Antithrombin has two specific binding sites- the reactive site consisting of the reactive center loop (RCL) which binds proteases such as thrombin, factor Xa, IXa, and the heparin-binding domain which, as the name suggests, binds heparin.

The reactive center loop of antithrombin located at the arginine residue at 393 and the serine residue at 394 near the carboxyl-terminal functions to bind to the active site of proteases through a complex mechanism involving a conformational change of the antithrombin reactive site.

The inhibitor-protease complex is then rapidly removed from the circulation no more than 5 minutes after formation, which removes thrombin from the circulation, disrupting the clotting effect of the coagulation cascade. While the exact mechanism is still uncertain, evidence may suggest receptors on hepatocytes to be involved in the removal of the complex from the plasma.

The formation of the antithrombin-protease complex, while irreversible, is a naturally slow and inefficient reaction. The process can be rapidly increased up to 1000-fold with the presence of sulfated polysaccharides in the form of heparin and heparan sulfate.

The heparin-binding domain located on the surface of antithrombin, on the other hand, contains positively charged arginine and lysine which bind to the negatively charged domains of the heparin pentasaccharide sequence through partially an allosteric mechanism.

The successful binding of heparin activates a conformational change within the antithrombin, which increases its affinity towards protease, promotes the formation of the antithrombin-protease complex, and ultimately inhibits blood coagulation.

Allosteric activation induced by heparin to the antithrombin serpin structure has been the object of extensive study, and while the kinetics of the reaction is quite complex, generally the allosteric activation of antithrombin induces structural changes within the RCL, the heparin-binding site, and the hydrophobic core that constitutes the antithrombin. The exact interactions involved in the conformational change are still a topic for research and revision.

# Clinical Significance

The estimated prevalence of hereditary antithrombin deficiency is generally between 1 in 2000 and 1 in 5000.

Acquired antithrombin deficiency is generally associated with either decreased production as a part of impaired synthesis in the instance of acute liver failure, cirrhosis, malnutrition, a direct loss of antithrombin in conditions including nephrotic syndrome, or due to an increase in consumption.
