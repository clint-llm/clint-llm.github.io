The blood supply of the sympathetic trunk can divide into anatomic thirds. The lower third, which begins superior to the stellate ganglion and extends to the middle cervical ganglion, is supplied by branches from the inferior thyroid artery and the subclavian and ascending cervical arteries.

Despite being anatomically adjacent to the sympathetic trunk, the cervical sympathetic ganglia tend to have a different blood supply:

**Superior Cervical Ganglion:**The superior cervical ganglion has been shown in cadaveric studies to mostly receive blood supply from branches of the ascending pharyngeal artery with rare branches from the superior thyroid artery.

**Middle Cervical Ganglion:**The middle cervical ganglion has a variable blood supply, with cadavers demonstrating consistent contributions from either inferior thyroid or ascending cervical arteries.

**Inferior Cervical/Stellate Ganglion:**The inferior cervical ganglion (when present) and the stellate ganglion both receive vascular supply from the supreme intercostal branch of the costocervical trunk of the subclavian artery.
