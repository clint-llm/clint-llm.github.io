Preoperative planning requires close communication between breast oncologic surgeons, medical/radiation oncologists, and plastic surgeons. Preferably, breast margins should be marked before the patient going under anesthesia while in the standing position. Important measurements to take into consideration are the distance from the sternal notch to the nipple, the distance between the nipple-areolar complex and the inframammary fold, and the total width of the breast.

Smoking cessation is strongly advised before any type of reconstruction due to an increased risk of complications such as skin flap necrosis and infection. A window of at least three weeks between smoking cessation and breast reconstruction is recommended.
