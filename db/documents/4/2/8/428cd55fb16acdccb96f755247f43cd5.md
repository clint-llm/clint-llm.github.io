Histopathological evaluation remains a gold standard for the diagnosis of these rare tumors. They are characterized by numerous interconnecting vascular channels with papillary projections or tuft like structures as observed in renal glomeruli. Endothelial cells lining the vascular channels have a classic hobnail or matchstick appearance due to an apically placed nucleus that produces a surface bulge.

Immunohistochemistry further aids in diagnosis by identifying the tissue origin. EPA tumor cells react positively to vascular and lymphatic markers. They are classically positive for CD34, VEGFR - 3, CD31, D2-40, and factor VIII related antigen.

Small storage granules consisting of von Willebrand factor and P-selectin, called Weibel Palade bodies, might be demonstrated upon examination under the electron microscope of the tumor cells. Also seen are irregular nuclei, abundant perinuclear cytoplasmic filaments, and pinocytotic vesicles.
