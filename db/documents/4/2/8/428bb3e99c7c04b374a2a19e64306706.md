The symptoms of the early stages of the disease are nonspecific. Differential diagnosis should include the possibility of a wide range of infectious and non-infectious (e.g., vasculitis, dermatomyositis) respiratory disorders.

- Adenovirus

- Influenza

- Human metapneumovirus (HmPV)

- Parainfluenza

- Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)

- Rhinovirus (common cold)

For suspected cases, rapid antigen detection and other investigations should be adopted for evaluating common respiratory pathogens and non-infectious conditions.
