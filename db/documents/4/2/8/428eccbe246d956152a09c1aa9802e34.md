A lumbar puncture is necessary unless there are contraindications such as focal neurologic deficits, papilledema, recent seizures, age 60 or greater.

Because of the lack of clinical findings to help distinguish between viral and bacterial meningitis and the risk of untreated bacterial meningitis, there has been much interest in identifying predictors of bacterial meningitis. The bacterial meningitis score (BMS) was originally developed for and validated in children with meningitis. The score is comprised of four laboratory predictors (positive Gram stain, CSF protein over 80 mg/dL, peripheral absolute neutrophil count greater than 10000 cells/mm3, CSF absolute neutrophil count over 1000 cells/mm3) and one clinical predictor (seizure at or before the presentation). A positive Gram stain is worth 2 points, and the other predictors are worth 1 point each if present. The negative predictive value for a score of 0 was 100%; a score of more than 2 predicted bacterial meningitis with 87% sensitivity.

In adults, researchers have studied individual predictors of bacterial rather than viral meningitis. In one study, these predictors included CSF glucose less than 34 mg/dL, CSF WBC over 2000 cells/mm3, CSF neutrophils greater than 1180, CSF protein over 220 mg/dL, and a ratio of CSF to blood glucose less than 0.23.15.
