The fascia lata holds particular clinical significance for a variety of reasons. In orthopedics, the fascia lata, superolateral mass, is used as an important landmark for surgical approaches. It is to be closed as the deepest layer of fascia is total hip arthroplasties secondary to the hip capsule being removed. It acts as a pseudo-capsule to maintain the structural stability of the prosthetic hip. The term “snapping hip” was coined to describe ITB laxity that “snaps” over the greater trochanter of the femur.

An inflammation from biomechanical causes of the fascia lata at the level of the iliac crest can cause structural alterations, such as thickening or weakening until partial rupture.
