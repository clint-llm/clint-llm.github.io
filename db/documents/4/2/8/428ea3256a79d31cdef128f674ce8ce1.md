The pathogenesis of IBM is not completely understood, but probably consists of an interplay between inflammatory and degenerative pathways

The presence of inflammatory cells, mostly cytotoxic CD8+ T Cells with some macrophages invading and the CD4+T cells and macrophages surrounding the non-necrotic muscle fibers indicates an inflammatory component in the pathogenesis of IBM. The activation of T cells is likely an antigen-driven response and is suggested by the presence of abundant antigen presenting cells(APCs) in the muscle fibers. Apart from these, the identification of Anti-Mup 44 antibody targeting a muscle protein cN1A supports a humoral component in the pathogenesis of IBM.

Abnormal protein processing associated with aging and subsequent deposition of toxic polymers can cause muscle damage and can also trigger inflammation in the muscle fibers. Beta-amyloid, a degenerative protein identified in the muscle fibers of patients with IBM supports the theory of degenerative pathway. The beta-amyloid protein has been demonstrated to stimulate human myoblasts to produce IL-6. This continuous stimulation of IL-6 production could augment the local immune response.

In short, some myofibers appear to be injured by invading cytotoxic T cells, while others have no apparent cause for their morphological abnormalities and have been called degenerative. There is no single, well-supported theory to explain all the features seen in this condition.
