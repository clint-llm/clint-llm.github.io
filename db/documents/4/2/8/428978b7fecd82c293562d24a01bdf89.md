The prevertebral muscles are located anterior to the cervical column and primarily function in motions of the head and neck at the craniocervical junction.

The longus capitis extends from the occipital bone to the inferior cervical vertebrae from C1-C6.

The longus colli consists of a long, flat muscle that sits on the anterior surface of the spine. It functions to connect the cervical vertebral bodies to associated transverse processes. The longus colli spans multiple cervical motion segments.

The rectus capitis lateralis and rectus capitis anterior function to connect the occipital and atlas bones. They originate over the transverse process of C1 and insert onto the jugular process of the occipital bone.

The prevertebral muscles are enveloped by the prevertebral fascia, which invests in the carotid sheath along with the pretracheal and investing fascia.
