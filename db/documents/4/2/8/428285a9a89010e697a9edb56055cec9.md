The breast has a high level of vascularization, including the internal mammary and lateral thoracic arteries. There also are numerous lymphatic vessels in the breast and axilla. The lymphatic vessels follow the lactiferous ducts and converge near the nipple. Lymphatic fluid can accumulate during the engorgement phase of breastfeeding, usually 3 to 5 days postpartum, and contribute to the visible distention of the breasts. The components of milk are synthesized in the alveoli, including protein, fat, and carbohydrates, or are retrieved from maternal plasma (vitamins and minerals).
