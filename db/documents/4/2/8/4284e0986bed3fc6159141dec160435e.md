Hypotension is a common presentation. At times, the available history is limited, and the physical exam alone can be misleading. Multiple ultrasound protocols have been proposed for the evaluation of the hypotensive patient. This activity reviews the commonly used rapid ultrasound in shock (RUSH) protocol and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of hypotensive patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for the rapid ultrasound in shock (RUSH) protocol.
- Explain the steps involved in performing the rapid ultrasound in shock (RUSH) protocol.
- Summarize how ultrasound can be a useful modality for the evaluation of hypotensive patients.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the use of ultrasound to evaluate hypotensive patients to improve patient outcomes.
