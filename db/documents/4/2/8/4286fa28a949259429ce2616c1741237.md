- Glicentin (69 amino acids) is present in alpha cells of the pancreas, intestinal L cells (duodenum, rectum, distal ileum, proximal colon, caecum, proximal jejunum). Researchers have also found the glicentin gene in the central nervous system.

- GLP-1 (30 amino acids) is also in the alpha cells of the pancreas, L cells of the intestine (proximal small intestine, colon, and distal ileum), and in the central nervous system (nucleus tractus solitaries of the brain stem).

- GLP-2 (33 amino acids) is in the L cells of the intestine (colon and distal small intestine).

- Oxyntomodulin (37 amino acids) is likewise present in the L cells of the intestine.
