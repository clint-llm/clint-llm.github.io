Cardioselective beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with marked sinus bradycardia, cardiogenic shock, complete heart block and should be monitored carefully in patients with second or third-degree heart block.

In addition, patientsÂ with a history of recent fluid retention should not use beta-blockers without concomitant use of diuretics.

New studies suggest that cardioselective beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with severe asthma or COPD, while it is entirely safe in patients with mild to moderate diseases.

In patients with diabetes mellitus, it may lead to masked hypoglycemia, so careful monitoring is necessary.

Bisoprolol should not be abruptly withdrawn as it can cause rebound hypertension and tachycardia. In addition, some patients have developed or exacerbated existing angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmia when cessed therapy abruptly.
