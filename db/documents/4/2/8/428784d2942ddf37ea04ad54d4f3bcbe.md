CALMs should be first differentiated from the diffuse causes of hyperpigmentation like Addison's disease, hemochromatosis, and phototoxic allergic reactions. These conditions do not contain the well-demarcated, round borders, as seen in most of the CALMs.

The differential diagnosis of CALMs includes:

- Congenital melanocytic nevus

- Becker nevus

- Nevus spilus

- Lentigo

- Urticaria pigmentosa

- Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation

- Plexiform neurofibroma

- Segmental pigmentation disorder

- Mastocytoma

- Phytophotodermatitis
