- Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, previously known as Churg-Strauss syndrome, is a multisystem disease of the immune system.

- Poorly controlled asthma over months with sinus and nasal symptoms, particularly when associated with high blood eosinophil count, should prompt a red flag to search for this possibility.

- Early initiation of treatment with steroids and other immunosuppressants usually leads to a favorable outcome and long life expectancy.

- Bronchial asthma and some muscle and nerve weakness may remain lifelong.

- Careful periodic screening for corticosteroid-induced adverse effects becomes essential as the disease may require long-term treatment with high-dose steroids over months.

- Compliance with the diagnostic procedures and treatment recommendations is essential, and therefore, regular follow up with the healthcare provider should not be ignored once the disease is diagnosed.
