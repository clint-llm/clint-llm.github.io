These fractures are usually a result of a ground-level fall in the elderly population and are classified as either stable or unstable. Determination of stability is important as it helps determine the type of fixation required for stability. Stable fractures have an intact posteromedial cortex and will resist compressive loads once reduced. Examples of unstable fractures include: comminution of the posteromedial cortex, a thin lateral wall, displaced lesser trochanter fracture, subtrochanteric extension and reverse obliquity fractures.Â  This Evans classification breaks down intertrochanteric femur fractures based on displacement, number of fragments and the type of fragment displaced. Type I is a 2 part fracture, Type II are 3 part fractures and Type III are 4 part fractures. The A subclassification in type I fractures is used for non displaced fractures while B fractures are displaced. In type II fractures, the A subclassification describes a 3 part fracture with a separate GREATER trochanter fragment while the B subclassification describes a 3 part fracture with a LESSER trochanter fragment. Type III fractures are 4 part fractures.
