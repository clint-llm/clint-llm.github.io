CDC and FDA continuously monitor vaccine safety and will inform health officials, health care providers, and the public when necessary.

CDC uses three systems of vaccine safety monitoring:

- The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): an early warning system that helps CDC and FDA monitor problems following vaccination.  Anyone can report possible vaccine side effects to VAERS.

- The Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD): This collaborative effort between the CDC and nine other healthcare organizations allows ongoing monitoring and proactive searches of vaccine-related data.

- The Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Project: a partnership between CDC and several medical centers conducting clinical research on vaccine-associated health risks.
