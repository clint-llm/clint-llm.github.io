The diagnosis and management of patients with Lambert Eaton myasthenia syndrome requires an interprofessional team because of the diverse presentation. The disorder is usually seen in the presence of a malignancy and hence the team should include an oncologist, surgeon, hematologist, ophthalmologist, neurologist, primary care provider and nurse practitioner. The initial treatment for the symptomatic management of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome with or without malignancy is geared towards increasing the levels of acetylcholine.Â  For patients with refractory weakness, immunosuppression with IVIG as the first-line agent is recommended. Other suggested alternatives include prednisone, rituximab, azathioprine, or plasma exchange.

The prognosis for patients with this syndrome depends on the primary malignancy. With advanced cases, the prognosis is poor. However, if the primary malignancy is controlled, symptomatic improvement does occur over time but often full recovery is not possible.
