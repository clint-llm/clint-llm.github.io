The blood supply of the medial lemniscus varies according to the level of the brainstem. The nuclei gracilis and cuneatus are located in the medial posterior aspect of the medulla and receive vascular supply from the posterior spinal artery. The arcuate fibers decussate in the medial-anterior aspect of the medulla and are irrigated predominantly by the anterior spinal artery. The medial lemniscus begins ascending contralaterally in the brainstem in the medial aspect of the medulla and is supplied by the anterior spinal artery. As the medial lemniscus continues to ascend, it begins shifting posteriorly and laterally; at the level of the pons, the medial lemniscus receives supply from the basilar artery. By the time the medial lemniscus makes it to the midbrain, it is predominantly in the posterior lateral aspect of the midbrain, and the posterior cerebral artery irrigates it.

Infarction of certain regions of the brainstem may present with loss of conscious proprioception, vibration, fine touch, and 2-point discrimination due to the medial lemniscus beingÂ at different positions of the brainstem, and thalamus.
