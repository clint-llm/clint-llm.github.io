Understanding proper pedal evaluation and which populations are at risk help identify situations in which intervention is absolutely necessary. All practitioners must understand that although diabetes mellitus is the most commonly associated underlying disorder leading to plantar ulcers in neuropathic patients, increased age, obesity, improper healing of pedal injuries, and underlying neuropathic causes should all be evaluated. Early intervention and proper offloading are the keys to decreasing morbidity and mortality associated with neuropathic ulcers.

To that end, an interprofessional healthcare team approach to neuropathic ulcers is crucial. This team will include clinicians (MDs, DOs, PAs, NPs), specialists (including but not limited to endocrinologists, dermatologists, surgeons, etc.), nurses, and other ancillary staff depending on the underlying neurological etiology (e.g., diabetes educators). Nurses are vital assets that can coordinate communication between various clinicians, counsel patients, and answer patient questions about their condition and ongoing treatment. All team members must communicate openly with the rest of the team if they note changes in the patient's condition, and it is incumbent on all team members to maintain accurate and updated patient records so that everyone has access to the most current and accurate patient case data. This interprofessional approach will yield the best results. [Level 5]
