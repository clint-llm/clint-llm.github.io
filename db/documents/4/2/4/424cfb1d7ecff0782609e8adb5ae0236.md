There are multiple interfering factors with the monospot test, leading to significantly decreased levels of sensitivity and to decreased specificity as well.

Regarding the sensitivity of the test, there are many factors that contribute to high rates of false negative testing.  The first involved is patient age.  It has been demonstrated that children four years old and younger have unacceptably high false negative findings when compared to EBV-specific antibody testing.  In one study, children under the age of 4 who showed evidence of disease through EBV-specific antibody testing had agglutination testing sensitivity rates between 27 to 76%.

Although sensitivity rates have been reported anywhere between 70% and 90%, these numbers appear to be somewhat dependent on the time at which the blood sample is taken.  Heterophile antibodies are present in peak concentrations between 2 and 6 weeks of disease.

In addition to varying sensitivity rates of detecting heterophile positive IM, the monospot test is unable to identify cases of heterophile negative IM.  Approximately 90% of IM cases are caused by EBV.

The specificity of the monospot test is considered to be quite reliable and has a specificity rate between 95 to 100%.Cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, lupus, lymphoma, rubella, and herpes simplex virus.  It is also noteworthy that low levels of heterophile antibodies may persist at low levels for 9 months to 1 year after resolution of symptoms.
