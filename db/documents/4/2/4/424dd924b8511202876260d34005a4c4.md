Cyclodiode is an evolving treatment in the management of glaucomatous disease, not solely resigned to managing refractory cases. A thorough preoperative workup and assessment must be completed to ensure patient suitability and attain satisfactory IOP reduction while minimizing potential postoperative complications. The patient is consented to and made aware of other treatment modalities that can be considered.

On the day of surgery, the interprofessional team consists of an ophthalmic surgeon, ophthalmic nurses, and operating room staff. The team is required to ensure consent is obtained and the eyes for surgery are appropriately marked. During the procedure, local laser safety protocols and procedures must be adhered to. Postoperatively, the nursing staff will ensure the patient's prescription is available, inform them of the drop regime, educate the patient on potential symptoms and complications, and arrange further follow-up in the eye clinic.
