In orthopedics, there are four basic surgical approaches to the hip joint: the anterior, anterolateral, posterior, and medial. The TFL is used as a surgical landmark in both the anterior and anterolateral approaches. The anterior approach to the hip is performed using the internervous plane between Sartorius (femoral nerve) and the TFL (superior gluteal nerve). The anterolateral approach to the hip uses the intermuscular plane between TFL and gluteus medius. Since the gluteus medius and TFL are both innervated by the superior gluteal nerve, there is no true internervous plane with this approach. However, the superior gluteal nerve enters the TFL very close to its origin at the iliac crest. Therefore, as long as the surgical plane is not extended proximal to the TFL insertion, the nerve will remain out of the surgical field and safe.

In reconstructive surgery, the TFL can be used for soft tissue coverage. There are case reports of it being used for local flaps, regional flaps, and free flaps. Due to its small size, TFL is not often the first choice for free flaps, but there are case reports of using TFL free flaps when latissimus dorsi and rectus abdominis flaps are unavailable. When a large area needs coverage, the TFL can be used in conjunction with an anterolateral thigh flap by using the lateral circumflex system of the femoral vessels.
