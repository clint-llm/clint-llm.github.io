A suggested approach to pancreatic abscess:

- CBC with differential

- Blood cultures

- CT scan with contrast or MRI with gadolinium. (MRI without contrast can be used in patients with renal failure)

- Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated if cultures are positive, or there are systemic signs of infections. IV imipenem 500 mg IV q8h for 14 days is the drug of choice.

- Consider CT-guided fine-needle aspiration if a collection is visualized on imaging and infection is suspected.

Treatment

- For hemodynamically unstable patients, surgical debridement is the treatment of choice.

- For hemodynamically stable patients, minimal-invasive methods of necrosectomy and drainage can be performed using endoscopy.

The resolution of tachycardia, fevers, hypotension, as well as improvement in the patients' abdominal pain, are all markers of clinical improvement. However, they are not specific to the pancreatic abscess.

Daily CBC should be performed to ensure that the leukocytosis is resolving. For patients with diagnosed pancreatic abscess and bacteremia, serial blood cultures should be obtained to confirm the eventual clearance of theÂ infection.
