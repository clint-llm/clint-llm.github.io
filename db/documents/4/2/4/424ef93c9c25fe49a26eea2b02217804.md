Coprolalia comes from the greek "kopros," which means "dung, feces" and "lalein," which means "to babble." It's a tic-like occurrence that involves non-intentional obscene and socially inappropriate vocalizations. In 10 to 33% of cases, it may correlate with tic disorders, in particular with Tourette syndrome (also known as Gilles de la Tourette syndrome). Gilles the la Tourette is believed to occur in approximately 1% of the population worldwide, in the range between 0.4% to 3.8%. Coprolalia also occurs in patients with brain lesions, "senility" and in those with neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders. It has can also occur in association with seizure disorders, in ictal or post-ictal status. This activity outlines the identification, evaluation, and management of coprolalia.
