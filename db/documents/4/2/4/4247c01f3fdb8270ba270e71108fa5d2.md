Numerous trials have demonstrated the high level of safety and tolerance of bimatoprost when applied to the ocular surface or eyelids.

A four-year safety study of bimatoprost eye drop application revealed that other than transient eyelash prominence, the most common adverse events included:

- Conjunctival hyperemia (46% of patients)

- Eye pruritus (9% of patients)

- Dry eye syndrome

- Burning irritation

- Pigmentation of eyelid margins

- Visual disturbances

- Eye pain

- Foreign body sensations

A series of more recent studies have also highlighted prostaglandin-associated periorbitopathy that is commonly seen in all prolonged use of topical prostaglandin analogs, especially with bimatoprost. The periorbitopathy is seen typically with periorbital fat atrophy, mild ptosis, and deepening of upper lid sulcus (seen in 80% of patients using bimatoprost).

Several case reports have illustrated an association between bimatoprost use and herpetic keratitis.

Bimatoprost applied as an eye drop has also been associated with the alteration of iris pigmentation. This is thought to be due to an increased number of melanosomes. In addition, multiple case reports have suggested various prostaglandin analogs such as bimatoprost and latanoprost can be associated with cystoid macular edema (CME) due to their pro-inflammatory effects.

Recent evidence suggests that the safety profile for dermal application of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% is more favorable than that seen with topical eye drop application. The following have been reported to occur in fewer than 4% of patients following dermal application:

- Conjunctival hyperemia (most common at 3.6% of patients)

- Eye pruritus

- Skin hyperpigmentation

- Ocular irritation

- Dry eye syndrome

- Eyelid erythema

One significant but rare side effect is the development or re-exacerbation of anterior non-granulomatous uveitis.

The significant difference in the likelihood of adverse effects between the two methods of bimatoprost application may be explained by the sheer difference in dose. A single application of a bimatoprost 0.03% dermally results in only about 5% of the amount applied for treatment for glaucoma.
