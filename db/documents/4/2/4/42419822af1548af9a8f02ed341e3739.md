Before exploring the anatomy of the capillary, it is first reasonable to better understand the anatomy of the arteriole and venule that directly surround it. Arterioles vary from 8 to 60 micrometers in diameter and may even further subdivide into meta-arterioles.

Upon arriving at a tissue, arterioles branch into capillary beds that provide the means of gas and nutrient exchange. Capillaries are thin-walled vessels composed of a single layer of simple squamous epithelium, a basement membrane known as tunica intima, and scattered connective tissue cells called pericytes. The bloodflow into the capillaries is primarily controlled by precapillary****sphinctersÂ (smooth muscle bands that wrap around metarterioles).

There are a few different structural types of capillaries that research has identified in the human body. One subtype is known as continuous non-fenestrated capillaries and is present in the skin, lungs, and blood-brain barrier. They are connected via cellular junctions, contain a basement membrane, and lack fenestrations (pores) in the plasma membrane. Continuous, fenestrated capillaries, found in intestinal villi and endocrine glands, have a similar structure however contain diaphragmed fenestra in the membrane. Discontinuous capillaries, found in the liver, have large gaps and an incomplete basement membrane.
