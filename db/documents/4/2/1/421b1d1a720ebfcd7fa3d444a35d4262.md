With the prevalence of knee injuries, there are constant attempts to introduce new and effective treatments. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is one of these new controversial treatments being investigated. Data is limited, and research remains earlyÂ in the process, but it is already being used to treat a variety of different knee injuries. PRP is thought to contain concentrated growth factors and other growth-promoting cytokines. It is produced by centrifuging whole blood to remove the red blood cells with the remaining PRP injected into the injury site in a series of injections. The concentrated growth factors are supposed to promote better and faster healing.
