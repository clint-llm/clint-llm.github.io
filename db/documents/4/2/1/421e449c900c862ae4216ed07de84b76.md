Uremic encephalopathy is an absolute indication to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT). Yanai et al. observed three cases of uremic encephalopathy in anuric patients getting peritoneal dialysis; all cases were resolved with the institution of hemodialysis.

Providers should address the following factors when managing uremic encephalopathy, which is included in the standard management of any patient with ESRD:

- Adequacy of dialysis

- Correction of anemia

- Regulation of calcium and phosphate metabolism

There is clinical evidence that intermittent hemodialysis (HD) is more effective than continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). However, there is a danger of causing or precipitating dialysis disequilibrium syndrome (DDS) due to the risk of rapid osmotic changes at the start of HD.

Studies have shown that the measured blood osmolality change is reduced by 60% with mannitol (10 mmol/kg fall in plasma osmolality was decreased to 4.3 mmol/kg with intravenous mannitol before HD). The symptoms of DDS were mild in the mannitol group and occurred in 10% of patients compared to 67% in the non-mannitol group despite similar ultrafiltration rates.
