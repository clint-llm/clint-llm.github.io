Strain counterstrain (SCS) is a type of indirect osteopathic manipulative soft tissue technique developed by Lawrence Jones in 1955 to passively treat musculoskeletal pain, decreased range of motion, and somatic dysfunction by bringing about a change in cellular function of the tissues being treated.

Facilitated positional release (FPR), developed in 1990 by Stanley Schiowitz, is similar to strain counterstrain in that the physician places the patient in a position of ease based on palpation of the tender-point.
