Syndromes of excess can result from adenomas, carcinomas or hyperplasia of the adrenal gland. Destruction of the adrenal gland by autoimmune processes or tuberculosis can cause primary adrenal insufficiency. Finally, deficiency in enzymes such as 21-OH-lyase can cause congenital adrenal hyperplasia. For syndromes of excess, imaging using CT,Â MRI among others can be most useful, and further discussion is beyond the purview of this review on physiology.
