There is no single etiology for BPSD. Instead, a biopsychosocial model has been proposed that attributes neuropsychiatric symptoms to interactions between an individual’s biology, prior experiences, and current environment. Dementia-related agitation, disinhibition, and psychosis are associated with volume reductions and decreased metabolism in the orbital and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, insula, and temporal lobes – parts of the brain that mediate emotional regulation, self-awareness, and perception; and apathy is associated with small vessel white matter disease.

A review addressing non-biological determinants of BPSD identified pre-morbid neuroticism (a personality trait characterized by a tendency to respond to challenges with exaggerated negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and anger), pre-morbid post-traumatic stress disorder, problematic caregiver communication styles, and environmental factors (e.g., sensory over-or under-stimulation, or surroundings that are too hot, cold, or loud) also contribute to BPSD.
