The DCML pathway may be affected at numerous points throughout its first, second, and third-order neurons. The clinical presentation may be convoluted due to its proximity to other neurologic tracts; furthermore, the absence of conscious proprioception, vibration, fine touch, and 2-point discrimination of skin and joints is pathognomonic for damage of the DCML pathway. The level at which the DCML pathway is affected will determine the clinical presentation. Below is a list of pathologies in which the DCML pathway is affected.

- Tabes dorsalis: This pathology results from the spirochete Treponema pallidum in advanced tertiary syphilis. Although rarely seen due to T. pallidum sensitivity to penicillin, tabes dorsalis results in demyelination of the dorsal column and roots, typically affecting the lower limbs due to the lumbosacral region being the one that is predominantly affected. The lack of conscious proprioception, vibration, fine touch, and 2-point discrimination of skin and joints results in neuropathic osteoarthropathy (Charcot joint). The Charcot joint presents with progressive degeneration of weight-bearing joints; the most common joint affected is midfoot. Accompanying complications include bone fractures and ulcerations of the site of injury. Management of this condition is targeting the underlying infectious agent with intravenous penicillin.

- Vitamin B12 deficiency: Subacute, combined degeneration is the demyelination of the dorsal columns, lateral corticospinal tracts, and spinocerebellar tracts due to vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is rarely deficient in the United States; however, one must always rule it out in specific patient groups at higher risk such as strict vegans, patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic malabsorption, pernicious anemia, history of gastrectomy, diphyllobothrium latum infection, and cystic fibrosis. The condition is diagnosable by obtaining methylmalonic acid levels. The treatment is vitamin B12 supplementation; however, the extent of recovery will be dependent on the duration and extent of the neuronal damage.

- Brown-Sequard syndrome: This pathology is a theoretical injury that is rarely seen in practice as clear cut as described in medical textbooks. It is composed of a hemisection of the spinal cord, typically due to trauma, ischemia, a large unilateral tumor, or infectious agents. The hemisection results in loss of the ipsilateral DCML pathway, ipsilateral corticospinal tract damage, contralateral spinothalamic tract damage; also, it results in flaccid paralysis and loss of all sensation at the level of injury. The clinical presentation is with loss of conscious proprioception, vibration, fine touch, and 2-point discrimination of skin and joints on the ipsilateral side of injury, spasticity, and hyperreflexia on the ipsilateral side of injury, loss of pain and temperature in the contralateral side of injury, and flaccid paralysis and loss of all sensation at the level of injury. Diagnosis is possible through magnetic resonance imaging, and a neurologic exam detailing a clinical presentation similar to those mentioned above. Treatment is specific to the underlying pathology.

- Medial medullary syndrome: Medial medullary syndrome is an infarction of the medial aspect of the medulla oblongata due to occlusion of the paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery. The infarction results in loss of conscious proprioception, vibration, fine touch, and 2-point discrimination of skin and joints of the contralateral side due to damage to the medial lemniscus. Also, it presents with contralateral hemiparesis due to damage to the corticospinal tract before decussation at the medullary pyramids and ipsilateral tongue deviation due to hypoglossal nerve fibers damage. The evaluation includes coagulation studies, echocardiogram, and CT angiography. Management is dependent on the time of onset, and type of stroke (ischemic versus hemorrhagic).

- Paramedian artery occlusion: The paramedian arteries are a branch of the basilar artery that supplies oxygenated blood to the pons. Paramedian artery occlusion is also a condition that rarely presents clinically. However, it is essential to point out that the paramedian arteries irrigate the medial basal pons, pontine nuclei, corticospinal fibers, and the medial lemniscus as it ascends through the pons. The evaluation includes coagulation studies, echocardiogram, and CT angiography. Management is dependent on the time of onset, and type of stroke (ischemic versus hemorrhagic).

- Upper dorsal pontine syndrome: This syndrome is also known as “Raymond Cestan syndrome” and is due to occlusion of the long circumferential branches of the basilar artery. The occlusion of the results mentioned above in damage to the medial lemniscus pathway, resulting in contralateral loss of conscious proprioception, vibration, fine touch, and 2-point discrimination of skin and joints. Furthermore, it may present with ipsilateral ataxia, ipsilateral paralysis to the muscles of mastication, ipsilateral sensory loss of the face, horizontal gaze palsy, contralateral loss of touch pain and temperature, and contralateral hemiparesis of the face and body. The evaluation includes coagulation studies, echocardiogram, and computed tomogram (CT) angiography. Management is dependent on the time of onset, and type of stroke (ischemic versus hemorrhagic).

In addition to the syndromes above, the following may present with damage to the medial lemniscus pathway:

- Dorsal midbrain syndrome due to occlusion of the paramedian branches of the basilar artery may result in medial lemniscus damage if the occlusion has a lateral extension.

- Thalamic strokes causing damage to the ventral posterolateral nucleus due to occlusion of thalamic branches of the posterior cerebral artery could result in damage to the third-order neuron of the DCML pathway.
