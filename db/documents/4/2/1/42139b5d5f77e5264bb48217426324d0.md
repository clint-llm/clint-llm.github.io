The fecal occult blood test results are primarily affected by how patients prepare for the test, so it is important to follow the instructions carefully. Because certain foods can alter the test results, a special diet is often recommended for 48 to 72 hours before the test. In addition, patients should avoid drugs like anticoagulants, aspirin, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiarthritics, iron preparations, and steroids for at least seven days before the test.
