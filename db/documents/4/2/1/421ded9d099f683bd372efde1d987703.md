Management of these toxicities should focus on prevention, early identification, decontamination, close hemodynamic monitoring and observation, and supportive care. Early administration of activated charcoal within the first few hours of exposure to limit may benefit via the adsorption of toxins and reduced gastrointestinal absorption, but it is contraindicated in cases of an unprotected airway or decreased intestinal motility, as it may cause aspiration or bowel obstruction.

Benzodiazepines are first-line agents for acute agitation and seizures. For severe anticholinergic poisoning, the administration of a reversible anticholinesterase inhibitor should be considered. Classically, physostigmine was used, but it is not currently available.Â Rivastigmine and pyridostigmine have been proposed as alternatives but are not approved for this indication. Conversely, atropine is given as the antidote to reverse the cholinergic toxidrome.

In acute cocaine toxicity, beta-blockers should be avoided to prevent potential unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation. Sodium bicarbonate should be considered for wide-complex dysrhythmias. In opioid toxicity leading to respiratory depression, naloxone is indicated in addition to supportive care measures and close monitoring.
