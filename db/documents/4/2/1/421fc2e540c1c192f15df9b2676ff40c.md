The presentation in a patient with a pneumothorax can range from asymptomatic to life-threatening based on the size, rate of development, and the health of the underlying lung. An iatrogenic pneumothorax is part of a differential diagnosis in a patient with pleuritic pain and dyspnea, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Decreased or absent breath sounds on the affected side is highly suspicious. Any pneumothorax can become a tension pneumothorax. Findings could include hypoxia, hypotension, distended neck veins, a displaced trachea, and unilaterally decreased breath sounds.
