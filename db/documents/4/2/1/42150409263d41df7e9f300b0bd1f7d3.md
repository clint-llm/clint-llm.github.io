Most of the patients diagnosed with Lafora disease are either Mediterranean (Spain, France, and Italy), Northern African, or central Asian (India and Pakistan). The disease has been found in more than 250 families throughout the world, resulting from EPM2A (responsible for Laforin) and EPM2B (responsible for E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase NHLRC1) mutations, and the prevalence seems to be close to four cases per one million persons. However, the number of mis- and undiagnosed patients may be higher, especially in developing countries.
