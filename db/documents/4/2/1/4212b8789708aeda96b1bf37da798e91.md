Renal insufficiency is the major complication of Potter syndrome. Major electrolytes imbalances such as hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia are due to renal failure. Obstructive uropathy favors urinary tract infections and hydronephrosis. Renal tubular dysplasia has many drawbacks likely erythropoietin deficient anemia, vitamin D insufficiency, and alteration of the renin-angiotensin system.

Most cases of Potter syndrome are associated with pulmonary hypoplasia. This ultimately leads to pulmonary insufficiency and respiratory distress syndrome. Such a neonate is cyanotic and suffers from respiratory acidosis due to the accumulation of CO2 and ventilation-perfusion mismatch.

Physical structures deformities are the prominent characteristics associated with Potter syndrome. Insufficient amniotic fluid for proper fetal movement and body parts development, as well as uterine compression of the fetus, leads to deformities of the face and extremities. Genital abnormalities are present in up to 70% of cases. Other congenital heart defects, pancreatic cysts, esophageal atresia, duodenal abnormalities, colonic agenesis, Meckel diverticulum may be present. Subtype II is associated with hepatic fibrosis and biliary tree abnormalities. Multiple pregnancies are reported with intrauterine growth retardation, preterm labor, and preeclampsia.
