If ocular melanoma is suspected, monitoring for metastasis should be performed regularly with emphasis on compliance with follow-up visits, regardless of stage and treatment. Patients should have dilated fundal examination, liver function test, alkaline phosphatase, LDH, and CT or right upper quadrant ultrasound to assess for liver metastasis. Frequency depends on the stage of the tumor, and those that have a high risk of metastasis should be monitored as frequently as 3-4 months.

The best way to screen for ocular melanoma in the general population is to get regular, complete eye exams.
