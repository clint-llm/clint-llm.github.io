Patients who are prescribed pantoprazole require monitoring for signs and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease. If symptoms of these conditions arise, an increase in dosage or medication change should merit clinician consideration. Pantoprazole can decrease the concentration or increase the absorption of other medications such as CYP2C19 inducers, bisphosphonate derivatives, amphetamines, fluconazole, and methotrexate, to name a few. Therefore, the affected efficacy of these medications also requires vigilance, and appropriate changes made when necessary. Finally, pantoprazole sounds and looks similar to the antipsychotic aripiprazole. Prescribing healthcare professionals and patients should acknowledge this and be cautious to avoid mistakes.
