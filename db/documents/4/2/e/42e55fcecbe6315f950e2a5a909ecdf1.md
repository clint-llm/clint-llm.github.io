**Surgical Intraoperative Monitoring**

In the last few years, VEPs have been considered for intraoperative monitoring of visual function using several protocols; however, current literature and clinical evidence in this field are very limited. The use of total intravenous anesthesia, the introduction of light-emitting diode technology, electroretinography, and electroencephalography have increased the reliability of VEP neuromonitoring by enhancing the techniqueâ€™s reproducibility and interpretability and working to make it more reliable and easier to integrate it into the operative workflow.

Recent studies have applied these tools in orbital and transsphenoidal surgery.
