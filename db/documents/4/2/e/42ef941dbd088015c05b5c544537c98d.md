ANUG diagnosis may be confused with other bacterial conditions and also many viral conditions. Considerations for a differential diagnosis should include bacterial infections like gonococcal or streptococcal gingivitis, acute herpetic gingivostomatitis, infectious mononucleosis, and also with some mucocutaneous conditions such as desquamative gingivitis, multiforme erythema, and pemphigus vulgaris.
