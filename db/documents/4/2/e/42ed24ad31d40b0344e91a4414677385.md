The treatment and prognosis of bullous myringitis are similar to AOM without bullae, with the exception being that pain management may require more aggressive treatment. Also, the more common “watch and wait” method of AOM may not be appropriate in BM cases, as these have a higher reoccurrence rate, and the majority of patients have a positive bacterial culture of their middle ear effusion.

A recent review evaluating therapeutic options for myringitis found no well-designed randomized studies, although surgery showed better treatment results than topical agents and laser-assisted treatments.

Due to the high occurrence of hearing loss in a patient diagnosed with bullous myringitis, recommendations include a pure tone audiogram in all patients diagnosed with bullous myringitis.  This evaluation is key in identifying the specific type and quantity of hearing loss.

Myringotomy may be necessary in refractory cases or cases with impending complications.
