History taking is a significant aspect of forming a diagnosis of hamartoma and related syndromes. It is crucial to understand the cause and associated conditions. Although hamartomas are usually asymptomatic, complete family and case history can help determine the prognosis. Patient history specific to the related condition is also necessary. Common symptoms and physical findings related to the site of origin are as follows:

**Hypothalamus**: seizure, altered mental status, vision changes, early-onset pubarche, behavioral changes.

**Lung**: chronic cough, hemoptysis, fever,  respiratory sounds, e.g., coarse crackles on inspiration, obstructive symptoms

**Heart**: chest pain, palpitations, edema, dyspnea, cyanosis, cool and clammy skin, murmur, arrhythmia

**PTEN/Cowden Syndrome:**These syndromes involve multiple tissues, i.e., breast, thyroid, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and mucocutaneous, and clinical manifestations depend on the extent of involvement of these

Other less common symptoms and physical findings involving the kidney, spleen, and other organs include flank pain, abdominal pain, recurrent infections, fever, night sweats, palpable abdominal mass, increased testicular size, and increased breast size.
