Monkeypox resembles smallpox clinically with similar lesions and timeline but often presents with lymphadenopathy. Caution is advisable as human/human spread has been confirmed but on an order of magnitude less than variola.

Severe cases of chickenpox should also be ruled out, especially if the vesicular rash spares the palms and soles and demonstrates variability in size and development. Although secondary syphilitic rashes also involve the palms and soles, they would not convert or evolve as rapidly.

Drug-induced and hypersensitivity exanthemas such as toxic epidermal necrolysis should be ruled as well with a proper history.
