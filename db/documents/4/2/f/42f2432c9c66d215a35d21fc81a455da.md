This type of spirochete is a tick-borne obligate parasite whose preferred naural reservoir is small mammals and birds; it does not cause disease in these natural hosts. When the parasite infects a human, Lyme borreliosis or Lyme disease may develop. The main route of dissemination for B. burgdorferi is through the tick species Ixodes scapularis, more commonly known as the black-legged tick.
