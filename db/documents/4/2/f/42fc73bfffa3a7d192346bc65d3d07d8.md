Subfalcine herniation is a secondary intracranial injury causedÂ by several primary injuries. The list below represents a sample of lesions associated with subfalcine herniation. In each case, a change in volume in one compartment precedes herniation.

- Increased brain volume

- 
              
- Traumatic brain injury (TBI)
              
              
- Hemorrhage (epidural, subdural, intraparenchymal)
              
              
- Ischemia due to stroke
              
              
- Tumor
              
              
- Cytotoxic/vasogenic/osmotic edema
              
              
- 
                  
- Status epilepticus
                  
                  
- Hyperosmolality (hyponatremia)
                  
                  
- Diabetic ketoacidosis/diabetes insipidus, hyperammonemia

- Change in CSF volume

- 
              
- Increase
              
              
- 
                  
- Choroid plexus tumor
                  
                  
- Obstructive hydrocephalus
                  
                  
- Non-obstructive hydrocephalus
                  
                  
- Pseudotumor cerebri
                  
                  
- Meningeal inflammation or granulomas

- Change in intracranial blood volume

- 
              
- Increase
              
              
- 
                  
- Loss of autoregulation due to TBI
                  
                  
- Increased cerebral blood flow (hypercapnia, hypoxia)
                  
                  
- Venous sinus thrombosis
                  
                  
- Elevated right atrial pressure (heart failure)
                  
                  
- Acidosis
                  
                

              
              
- Decrease

- Rapid decompression of a hematoma
