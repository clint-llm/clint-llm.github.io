Selecting the correct lasers with the appropriate parameters, individualized to each patient, is very important, particularly in patients with intrinsically dark skin. Most complications are preventable when adequate precautions are taken with adjustment of the fluence, spot size, wavelength, and the use of appropriate cooling. Thus, it is all the more important that trained personnel with a thorough knowledge of the mechanisms, techniques, and complications carry out these procedures.
