Wernicke encephalopathy is an acute neurological condition characterized by a clinical triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion. This disease is caused by thiamine deficiency, which primarily affects the peripheral and central nervous systems. This should be differentiated from Korsakoff syndrome, a neuropsychiatric disorder associated with confabulation and significant deficits in anterograde and retrograde memory. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and evaluation of Wernicke encephalopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with this illness.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Wernicke encephalopathy.
- Identify the causes of Wernicke encephalopathy. 
- Explain the treatment for Wernicke encephalopathy.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to enhance outcomes for patients affected by Wernicke encephalopathy.
