Early identification of risk factors associated with MAS is crucial. This allows for early preparation through communication and interprofessional partnerships. The obstetrician can help identify patients with infants at risk for MAS. Delivery should happen in a specialized center with access to a neonatal intensive care unit. This will allow trained personnel, including a midwife, nurse, pediatrician/neonatologist, and respiratory therapist, to be present for the delivery and ready for the eventual need for respiratory support. Pediatric pulmonologists and pediatric cardiologists should be included in case complications like PPHN or air leak syndrome arise. In extreme cases, a pediatric surgeon is needed for ECMO cannulation or severe air leak syndrome requiring surgical attention. This highlights the importance of interprofessional communication. Creating an interprofessional working group or engaging in interprofessional rounds to discuss these patients as a team will impact care positively and improve outcomes.
