**Classic/adult Refsum Disease**

- Nerve biopsy on electron-microscopy reveals an onion bulb formation and targetoid inclusions in Schwann cells.

- Microscopy of the liver shows a severely low amount or absence of peroxisomes. They are reduced in numbers with a proportional increase in size. These unusual liver peroxisomes lack catalase.

- Skin biopsy exhibits features of ichthyosis vulgaris, such as moderate hyperkeratosis and acanthosis with a thin granular layer. Many variably sized vacuoles can be seen in basal and suprabasal keratinocytes. On staining, cryostat-cut sections by lipid stain exhibit the presence of lipid aggregation in vacuoles.

**Infantile Refsum Disease**

- Pathologically, notable findings include the complete absence of peroxisomes on liver biopsy and degeneration of all retinal layers evident on electroretinography.
