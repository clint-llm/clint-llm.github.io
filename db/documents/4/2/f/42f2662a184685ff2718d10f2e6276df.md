Complications of adductor strains primarily include acute pain and missed playing time. In some cases, the pain may be more chronic with associated weakness and inability to return to sport.

Because sport-related groin injuries are a significant contributor to missed playing time, prevention is essential in maintaining a healthy athlete. Prevention programs are directed at adductor strengthening. Maintaining adductor strength at a minimum of 80% of abductor strength has been shown to reduce adductor injuries. One program among NHL players identified as having weak abductors participated in a 6-week preseason strengthening program which reduced adductor strains from 3.2 injuries per 1000 player-game exposures to 0.71.
