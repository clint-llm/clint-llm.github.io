Glycogen is a storage polysaccharide consisting of D-glucose residues. The glucose residues are joined by α-1,4, which represents most of the linkages, and α-1,6 linkages, which constitute the branch points. Together, they give the molecule a branched structure. The advantages of the highly branched nature are the increased solubility and the ability to concentrate a larger molecule in a shorter space.
