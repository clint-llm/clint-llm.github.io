DPN is presumed to be a variant of seborrheic keratoses (SKs); however, some clinicians believe it to be a clinically and histopathologically distinct entity. There are key differences between DPN and SKs that lead to this debate. The two lesions affect different demographics, with DPN affecting darker skin types with a female predominance. SKs are found in all skin types with a predominance in lighter-pigmented individuals with Fitzpatrick skin type I to II.FGFR3; however, DPN lacks the mutation in PIK3CA that is found in SKs, suggesting different genetic causes.
