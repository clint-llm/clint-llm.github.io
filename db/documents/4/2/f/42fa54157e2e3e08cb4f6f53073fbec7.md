Differential diagnosis of pancreatic cystic lesions could be difficult, especially if it is based solely on radiological studies. It is known that most of the pancreatic cystic lesions are inflammatory, which are considered pseudocysts, and the minority are considered neoplastic.

The differential diagnosis for serous cystadenomas can be summarized as follows:

- Non-neoplastic pancreatic cysts: true cysts, retention cysts, mucinous non-neoplastic cysts, lymphoepithelial cysts.

- Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), solid pseudopapillary neoplasms.

- Cystic degeneration in solid pancreatic tumors: include ductal carcinoma, acinar cell carcinoma, and endocrine tumors.
