The majority of patients who have a cardiac arrest have underlying coronary artery disease. Alteration of modifiable risk factors and medication adjustmentÂ can delay the onset of coronary heart disease, potentially delaying cardiac arrest. Despite the many treatments available for cardiac arrest, the majority of patients have a poor prognosis. However, many lives can still be saved with the basic, the most important interventions, including defibrillation and bystander CPR. Promotion of such education to loved ones and others interested can be lifesaving.
