Classically, a pericardial cyst is considered a congenital anomaly whereby incomplete fusion in embryogenesis leads to herniation or weakness in the pericardial sac, forming a diverticulum. This outpouching can either persist as a pericardial diverticulum or form a pericardial cyst when the communication to the pericardial sac becomes obliterated. These cysts usually contain clear fluid.

Some retrospective data suggest the average diameter of these cysts is about 5.4cm.
