Good personal hygiene is recommended as well as hand-washing, cleaning fruits, vegetables, discriminate defecation, and avoiding soil consumption. Walking barefoot outdoors is generally discouraged. Public health education about proper hygiene with improved sanitation may reduce the risk of infection. Travelers should avoid contact with fresh-water in endemic areas; many infections are silent and may remain asymptomatic; that is why people should be screened by serologic testing of schistosomiasis for those who returned from endemic areas.

Patients with positive serologies should be screened with urine and stool examination for species identification. For taeniasis, sanitary disposal of human and pig excreta should be in a proper way to avoid water contamination. Thorough cleaning, washing, and proper cooking of raw and water-grown vegetables, as well as proper cooking of beef, pork, and fish, is highly appreciated to prevent infection with intestinal flukes. With the above-mentioned measures, the patient should be educated with the regulation of their pets, dogs, and avoidance of unregulated dogs for the prevention of echinococcosis.
