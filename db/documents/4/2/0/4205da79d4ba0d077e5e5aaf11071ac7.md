In the superficial variant of EAC, an infiltrate of histiocytes, lymphocytes, and, rarely, eosinophils are present around vessels of the superficial vascular plexus. The infiltrate is well-demarcated, with fairly tight aggregate around vessels, otherwise known as "coat-sleeve" distribution. Cells may reach into the walls of the small vessels. EAC is considered a pseudovasculitis rather than a vasculitis as there is never any fibrin extravasation. The advancing edge, which is slightly raised, may also show edema in the papillary dermis. The central area of clearing may contain dermal melanophages.

In the deep variant of EAC, the epidermis is usually unremarkable, and a mononuclear cell infiltrate with a sharply demarcated perivascular arrangement is present primarily in the mid and lower dermis. Due to the deeper dermal involvement, the lesions are elevated and are more indurated than in the superficial form of EAC, and they do not have a trailing scale. Some dermatopathologists believe thatÂ the deep form may be a manifestation of tumid lupus.
