There are reports of more than 30 medications as a cause of drug-induced esophagitis.

- Antibiotics: One of the most common causes of drug-induced esophagitis. These include tetracyclines, especially doxycycline. Other antibiotics that can cause esophagitis include clindamycin, amoxicillin, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, rifaximin, etc.

- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): aspirin and aceclofenac can lead to esophageal mucosal injury

- Bisphosphonates: alendronate, ibandronate. Risedronate seems to be slightly safer than alendronate in terms of gastrointestinal side effects

- Ascorbic acid

- Potassium chloride and ferrous sulfate

- Acetaminophen

- Warfarin

- Chemotherapeutic regimens: dactinomycin, daunorubicin, bleomycin, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, cytarabine, and vincristine cause esophagitis perhaps due to oropharyngeal mucositis.

- Thoracic irradiation â€¢ Other medications: anti-hypertensives, quinidine, glimepiride, tiropramide, pinaverium bromide, esomeprazole, etc.
