Headache and pain disorders constitute the leading causes of morbidity and disability in the world.

Although relatively rare, these headache attacks are easy to recognize, given their constellation of signs and symptoms. SUNCT and SUNA classify as part of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs). They are considered to be the headache with the most frequent attacks that range from 2 to 600 times daily, but averaging < 100/day. The attacks are usually of moderate to severe intensity and can have throbbing pain or the pain can be sharp at times.
