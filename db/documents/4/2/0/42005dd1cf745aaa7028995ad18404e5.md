Retinal hemorrhages are a common clinical manifestation in patients visiting an eye clinic. Retinal hemorrhages give a clue to an underlying systemic disorder or an uncontrolled ocular disorder. The extent, depth, and pattern of distribution of the hemorrhages give us a clue as to what might be the underlying cause. A detailed slit-lamp examination with fundus photography and an optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan is essential to diagnose the cause and help in deciding the various treatment options to prevent vision loss. This activity highlights the importance of an interprofessional team in the evaluation and treatment of retinal hemorrhages.

**Objectives:**
-  Identify the different types of retinal hemorrhages.
- Review the etiopathogenesis of retinal hemorrhages.
- Summarize the different diagnostic methods for evaluating retinal hemorrhages.
- Explain the role of an interprofessional team and how coordination is required with providers to manage the systemic disorders and with retinal surgeons to manage complications arising from the retinal hemorrhages.
