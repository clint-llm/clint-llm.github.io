The primary congenital Brown syndrome can be observed as many cases do result in spontaneous improvement. Furthermore, there is less a need for upgaze as the child grows, unless the final height is below average. Surgery is unpredictable, with subsequent procedures often necessary to treat an iatrogenic superior oblique palsy caused by tenectomy or tenotomy. Inflammatory causes are characterized by the ocular motility findings of Brown syndrome associated with pain, which can be localized to the affected trochlea region. Local tenderness on palpation is often present and can fluctuate with relapsing episodes. Peri-ocular corticosteroid injections to the affected area have been described with a good response.

Post-traumatic Brown syndrome has become less frequent in countries that have stricter road safety regulations. Surgical treatment, such as superior oblique tenotomy, often requires a second procedure on the ipsilateral and contralateral vertical recti and oblique muscles to improve the field of binocular vision.
