One of the main functions of the hypothalamus is to maintain homeostasis by controlling the endocrine and autonomic functions. Clinical manifestations vary, depending on the affected hypothalamic nuclei and their function.

The hypothalamus participates in other functions such as body temperature regulation, appetite and weight, childbirth, growth, breast milk production, sleep-wake cycle, sex drive, and even emotions and behavior. Symptoms may include anovulation and amenorrhea, increased appetite, sleep disorders, and behavior disorders.

Many etiologies can not be prevented, but nutritional deficiencies like anorexia nervosa can be avoidable.Â Nutritional guidance is advised.

Many of the conditions caused by hypothalamic dysfunctions are treatable, in particular, hormone deficiency or overproduction. In patients with a hormone deficiency, hormone replacement therapy is the primary treatment.
