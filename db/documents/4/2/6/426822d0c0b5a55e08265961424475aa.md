Patients undergoing surgical correction for astigmatism should be prescribed postoperative eye drops as per the regimen.

In LASIK, the same steroid and antibiotic regimen is offered four times weekly, and lubricants are continued for three months. Astigmatism management with cataract surgery is the same as post-cataract surgery topical drug regimen.

Patients have been prescribed steroid and antibiotic combinations such as 0.5 % gatifloxacin and 0.1% dexamethasone in the dose of 6/5/4/3/2/1 for one week each and plain topical antibiotics such as 0.5% gatifloxacin or moxifloxacin for four times per day for 15 days. The patient should be counseled regarding the importance of using medications and regular follow-up.
