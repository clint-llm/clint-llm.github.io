The concept of asepsis or antisepsis was established in the 19th century by Semmelweis, who used carbolic acid as an antiseptic and showed that hand washing before a delivery reduced puerperal fever and surgical infection rates. He has seen a decrease in mortality due to puerperal sepsis from 12% to 2%. Before this concept was established, the risk of surgical infection was significantly higher. Acknowledgment of the aseptic approach made a significant impact on outcomes. In current times it is challenging to provide accurate data for postoperative wound infections as the term covers a wide variety of specialties, operations, patients, and geographies.

Also, identifying wound infections is more challenging due to increased prevalence of day case surgery, and shortened hospital stays.CDC data from 2018 is to be read with the above precautions. The morbidity for 2018 in the US was 157,500 for surgical site infections (SSI), with an estimated mortality of 8,205. 11% of all deaths in intensive care units were associated with SSI. It is a burden for the patient with an additional 11 days of hospitalization for each SSI and a burden to the system with an overall cost of $3.2 billion per year. SSI rates also depend on what type of surgery is performed:

- 2.1 for every 1000 operations, for clean surgery

- 3.3 for every 1000 operations, for clean-contaminated surgery

- 6.4 for every 1000 operations, for contaminated surgery

- 7.1 for every 1000 operations, for dirty surgery
