In the seminal report "To Err is Human," in 1999, the Institue of Medicine detailed the impact of medical errors within healthcare in the United States. At that time, estimates were that between 44,000 and 98,000 people died each year due to preventable medical errors. The focus of this report was not that there were bad people, but rather there were inadequate systems in place to keep patients safe while delivering high-quality medical care. It called upon the medical community to evaluate the systems and practice of healthcare delivery to improve patient safety and develop better systems to reduce errors.
