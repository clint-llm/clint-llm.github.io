Lichen striatus is a rare skin lesion seen in children. The diagnosis is clinical and the rash is benign. Healthcare workers including pharmacists and nurses who see these patients should not resort to unnecessary treatments because the condition resolves on its own. The few patients with pruritus may benefit from topic steroids.

The outcomes are excellent.
