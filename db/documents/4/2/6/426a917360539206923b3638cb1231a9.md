Laryngoceles are anomalous air sacs within the supraglottic larynx and are classified as internal or external based on their relationship to the thyrohyoid membrane. Internal laryngoceles are comprised of a collection of air or serous fluid in the anterior portion of the laryngeal ventricle within the confines of the thyroid cartilage, versus external laryngoceles whose sacs protrude through the thyrohyoid membrane. Internal laryngoceles will typically present as cough, hoarseness, odynophagia, or airway obstruction. External laryngoceles will cause an anterior neck mass resembling an abscess or cyst.
