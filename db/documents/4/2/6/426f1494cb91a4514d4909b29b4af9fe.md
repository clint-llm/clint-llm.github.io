Clinical photos of all lesions are present at the end of this activity.

Pseudomembranous candidiasis presents as either white or erythematous. The white presentation, commonly known as “thrush,” will present with thick, white, patchy lesions throughout the mouth, most often on the tongue and buccal mucosa.

Morsicatio buccarum presents as shredded oral mucosa, either on the cheek or tongue (linguarum).

Linea alba presents unilaterally or bilaterally, depending on the patient’s habits, as a white line on the buccal mucosa.

Leukoedema presents as a grayish-white lesion on the oral mucosa.

Lichen planus typically presents as white striations, known as Wickham’s striae, on the buccal mucosa or tongue but can also appear as white papules, plaques, or erosions.
