The extensor hallucis longus arises from the anterior surface of the fibula and inserts at the base and dorsal center of the distal phalanx of the hallux. Its location is between the tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus muscles on the anterior side of the lower limb, coursing inferiorly and medially to its insertion point at the base of the distal phalanx of the great toe. The anterior tibial artery and vein and deep peroneal nerve run between the extensor hallucis longus and the tibialis anterior muscles. The muscle fibers of the extensor hallucis longus course inferiorly and medially, ending in a tendon that passes under the inferior extensor retinaculum, which prevents the muscle from bowstringing or subluxation.

The principal function of the extensor hallucis longus is to extend the hallux and dorsiflex the foot at the ankle. Due to its origination on the fibula—the lateral bone of the anterior leg—and insertion on the tendon of the distal phalanx of the hallux, muscle contraction lifts the foot and the big toe upward toward the shin (dorsiflexion). This movement is critical to gait because it allows clearance of the foot off the ground during the swing phase. Consequently, damage or loss to the muscles or deep peroneal nerve, the innervation of the anterior compartment, can result in foot drop—loss of dorsiflexion—and a characteristic high-stepping gait.

In addition to extending the hallux and dorsiflexing the foot at the ankle, the extensor hallucis longus has a role in weakly inverting the foot due to its insertion on the distal phalanx of the hallux—the most medial toe. Consequently, loss of the extensor hallucis longus can also result in weakness in foot inversion, although typically not clinically significant due to the strong action of the tibialis anterior in inverting the foot.
