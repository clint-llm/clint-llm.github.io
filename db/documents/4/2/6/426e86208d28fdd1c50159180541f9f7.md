In fibrofolliculomas, there is a fibrous pink orb or amphophilic fibro mucinous orb with epithelial strands (sometimes in an anastomosing pattern) radiating outward from a central follicle-like structure. The strands of epithelium are not differentiated well enough to form hair fibers. Furthermore, the hair bulb inner or outer root sheath is not present.
