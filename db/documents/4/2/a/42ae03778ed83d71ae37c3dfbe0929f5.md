People traveling to the filarial endemic regions like the Indian subcontinent,Â South East Asia, South America, and Africa should follow adequate protective measures to prevent mosquito bites. Filariasis spreads from person to person by mosquito bites, which serve as a vector. Travelers should use vector controlling measures like insecticide-impregnated bed nets and permethrin-treated clothing.
