Diaper dermatitis can affect any individual using diapers without any gender preference. Newborns and infants are at an increased risk due to skin immaturity. Peak incidence is around 9 to 12 months of age. Diaper dermatitis occurs in about 50% of infants, and it accounts for about 25% of visits to primary care physicians related to dermatologic complaints in the first year of life.

There are risk factors associated with the development of diaper dermatitis, such as:

- Age: newborn and infant skin are more immature and show increased susceptibility.

- Diet: changes in diet as the infant grows are related to changes in intestinal microbiota and stool pH. Breastfeeding has been proven to be a protective factor.

- Frequency of diaper changes: prolonged contact with irritants such as urine and feces increases the risk of skin inflammation. Newborns and young infants whose diapers are changed more frequently tend to be less affected than older infants.
