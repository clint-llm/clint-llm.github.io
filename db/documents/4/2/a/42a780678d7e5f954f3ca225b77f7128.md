Research has reported variations in the anatomy of the structures of the cubital fossa:

- Radial nerve - the main variations occur at its site of bifurcation. As described above, this most commonly occurs within the cubital fossa but may occur proximal or distal to the fossa.

- Biceps tendon - the distal tendon may appear bifurcated if there has been continuing separation of the short and long heads.

- Brachial artery - similarly to the radial nerve, the main variations occur relative to its bifurcation. While most commonly occurring at the apex of the cubital fossa, this can occur more distally down the arm. There have even been reports of an absent brachial artery, with the ulnar and radial arteries coming directly from the axillary artery.

- Median nerve - the anatomy is relatively constant at the cubital fossa, with the majority of variations occurring further down the arm at the level of the carpal tunnel.

- Median cubital vein - there are several variations of the vein, with previous criteria developed as
- A dominant median antebrachial vein of the forearm joining the basilic and cephalic veins in the fossa
- The median cubital vein connecting the basilic and cephalic veins (the most common, and as described above)
- Median cubital vein present, but absent development of the cephalic artery in the upper arm
- No communication present between the cephalic and basilic veins
