Treatment for posterior tibial tendon dysfunction is a complicated subject, so this review will attempt to simplify by each stage for the reader:

- All Stages initially:

- Conservative management with NSAIDs and activity modification. Also meant for non-surgical candidates or low demand, elderly patients.

- Stage 1:

- Conservative management through immobilization in a walking boot or cast for up to 3 to 4 weeks to allow for healing of the posterior tibial tendon may be warranted followed eccentric strengthening with physical therapy.
- If immobilization and physical therapy are successful, transitioning into custom-molded orthotics or AFO is appropriate to maintain relief. Emphasis on medial forefoot posting is critical. University of California Biomechanics Laboratory (UCBL) orthoses are a form of a custom insert with a lace-up component that can help maintain midfoot height.
- Conservative therapy should be for 3 to 4 months, and if it fails, then surgical intervention may be warranted. A tenosynovectomy, with tubularization, may be indicated

- Stage 2A:

- Conservative immobilization and physical therapy with orthotics or ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) as recommended in stage 1
- Surgical treatment involves medial calcaneal osteotomy with posterior tendon debridement and repair. Ancillary procedures may include any or all of the following: flexor digitorum tendon (FDL) transfer, spring ligament reconstruction, or Achilles tendon lengthening.

- Stage 2B:

- All of the previously listed procedures in Stage 2A +/- lateral column lengthening, or isolated subtalar joint arthrodesis

- Stage 3:

- Conservative therapies, as mentioned above.
- Surgical treatment is often warranted as it involves rearfoot arthritic changes and a medial double arthrodesis or triple arthrodesis common (subtalar, calcaneocuboid, and talonavicular arthrodesis) is indicated with or without deltoid ligament repair.

- Stage 4

- Conservative therapies, as mentioned above.
- Surgical treatment is often necessary as it involves arthritic changes in the ankle, as well as rearfoot. Surgical options include any combination of Triple arthrodesis with Achilles tendon lengthening, deltoid ligament reconstruction, and total ankle arthroplasty with replacement.
- Tibiotalocalcaneal (TTC) arthrodesis for rigid hindfootÂ with significant valgus alignment of the talus within the ankle mortise.
