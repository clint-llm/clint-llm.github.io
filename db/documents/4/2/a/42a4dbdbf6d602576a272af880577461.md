Diagnosis of prolapse has mainly been by physical exam. Laboratory and imaging studies are not routinely needed. Since 1996, the International Continence Society (ICS), the American Urogynecologic Society (AUG), and the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons (SGS) agreed on the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system (POP-Q) examination. Previously other conventional evaluation methods, including the Baden-Walker grading system, were in use.

- Stage 0 – No prolapse demonstrated

- Stage 1 – The most distal portion of the prolapse is more than 1 cm above the hymen level

- Stage 2 – The distal-most portion of the prolapse is between 1 cm above the hymen and 1cm below the hymen level

- Stage 3 – The distal-most portion of the prolapse is more than 1 cm below the hymen, but not completely everted

- Stage 4 – There is a complete eversion of the uterus

Procidentia is a stage 4 prolapse. Most women who become symptomatic from their prolapse are usually at stage 2 or higher.
