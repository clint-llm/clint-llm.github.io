Although bowel obstruction alone can be suspected with an accurate patient history and presentation, the current standard of care to confirm the diagnosis in small and large bowel obstruction is an abdominal CT with oral contrast. CT allows for visualization of the transition point, the severity of obstruction, potential etiology, and assessment of any life-threatening complications. This information enables the provider to be more effective in identifying patients who will require surgical intervention.  Laboratory evaluation is essential to evaluate for any leukocytosis, electrolyte derangements that may be present as a result of the emesis. Labs also evaluate for elevated lactic acid that may be suggestive of sepsis or perforation, which at times may not be visible on CT if it is a microperforation and early in the course, blood cultures, or other signs of sepsis/septic shock. Although the lactic acid is often looked to in order to determine if there is a sign of perforation or ischemic gut, it should be noted this can be normal even with a microperforation present, initially. Physical examination of the patient remains an essential diagnostic tool regarding the patient's severity and the need for emergent surgery vs. medical management.
