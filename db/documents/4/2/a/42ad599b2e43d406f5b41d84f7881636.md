A chest X-ray may demonstrate bilateral pulmonary edema on the initial radiograph in about one-third of patients. Nearly all patients will have findings of interstitial edema at 48 hours after admission. Almost two-thirds of patients will develop bibasilar opacities or perihilar opacities with some degree of pleural effusions.

Thrombocytopenia may be present on blood count once admission is necessary due to the staging of the disease. Another critical laboratory finding is that of circulating immunoblasts, atypical lymphocytes, and elevated hematocrit. Once the patient needs hospitalization, a peripheral blood smear may demonstrate myelocytes, metamyelocytes, and promyelocytes with severe thrombocytopenia and hypocapnia. Hyponatremia may also be present along with slightly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, a decreased protein level, mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein level, and microscopic hematuria.

Diagnosis can be made by immunofluorescent or immunoblot assay. ELISA utilizing IgM is preferred. Virus isolation, however, is not useful due to the low yield despite demonstrating easy detectability by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
