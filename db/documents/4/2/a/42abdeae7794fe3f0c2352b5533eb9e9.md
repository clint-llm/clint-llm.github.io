Managing headaches with the greater occipital nerve block requires an interprofessional team that can include a variety of healthcare professionals, including nursing, surgical technicians, physician assistant, and physician. Incorporating a team approach has proven to optimize patient outcomes and prevent adverse reactions. Coordination of care requires communication and participation among team members, including the following:

- Ordering the anesthetic and steroid

- Maintaining patient position and support while the procedure is being performed

- Monitoring the patient for adverse reactions, including signs and symptoms consistent with respiratory compromise, cardiac arrhythmia, and central nervous system depression

- Consulting with a neurologist about further neurological testing and long-term management if required
