Acute HP typically presents with fever, malaise, cough, and dyspnea within a few hours of heavy exposure to a specific antigen. Symptoms usually resolve within 1 to 2 days of avoiding exposure. Prolonged exposure to the sensitized antigen results in subacute and chronic forms. A cough is a predominant symptom due to airway-centered nature of inflammation. Patients also report shortness of breath, malaise, weight loss. A thorough history including hobbies and occupational should be obtained to identify specific exposures in the patient’s environment that could be causing disease. Reportedly in up to 60% of cases, a trigger is not identified. The physical examination is often normal, but inspiratory crackles or inspiratory squeaks that reflect small airway inflammation can be heard on pulmonary examination. In chronic HP, crackles may be more prominent, and clubbing may be seen.

Some patients with chronic HP may develop acute worsening of their respiratory condition which can appear similar to acute exacerbations of IPF.
