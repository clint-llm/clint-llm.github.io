The majority of patients suffer from chronic symptoms, but there is a wide variation in prognosis and resolution. Patterns of the disease have been observed and described. These are

- Complete resolution

- Relapsing-remitting

- Intermittent disease flares

- Chronic progression.

The patient may also experience spontaneous resolution and unexpected recurrences regardless of treatment.

IC/BPS appears to be an extremely stable condition as urinary symptoms and discomfort tend to remain unchanged in severity for up to nine years.
