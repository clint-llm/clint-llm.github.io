Post-mortem studies of the patients suffering from dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy show interesting features including atrophy in the entire spinal cord neuraxis, neuronal apoptosis, and astrocytosis in the dentatorubral and pallidoluysian systems (globus pallidus, red nucleus, and to a lesser degree, the dentate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus). It can cause severe diffuse cortical white matter disease. Frontal lobe and pontine atrophy are present in the juvenile-onset cases, characterized by a severe clinical phenotype with cognitive deterioration and seizures. Interestingly, hippocampal regions are relatively spared.

Chemical staining for protein structures encoded by a mutant ATN1 protein shows poly-Q deposition of diffuse intraneuronal accumulation within the nucleus of affected neurons. The latter are spherical, eosinophilic non-membrane bound structures that contain a mixture of granular and filamentous ubiquitinated structures, containing inclusions of the mutant ATN1 protein.
