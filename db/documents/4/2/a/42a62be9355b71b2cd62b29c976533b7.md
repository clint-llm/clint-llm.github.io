The following workup is optional and typically not needed to make the diagnosis. The history and physical are the mainstays of diagnosis. However, some elect to include additional tests or imaging to aid in the diagnosis, such as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), EEG (electroencephalography), or CT (computed tomography).

Laboratory studies are tailored to the patient’s history, especially for those who have an atypical presentation.

- Complete blood count (CBC)

- Lipid panel

- Urine drug screen

- Urine pregnancy test

- Urinalysis

- Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level

- Rapid plasma reagent

- HIV test

If the patient's neurologic exam is found to be aberrant, performing a brain MRI or CT to rule out any suspected intracranial abnormalities may be considered.
