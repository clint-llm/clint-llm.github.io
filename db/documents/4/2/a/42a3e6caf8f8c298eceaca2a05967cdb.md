Carbidopa alone has few contraindications; however, because its administration is always in combination with levodopa, it shares the same risks. Because of limited data, carbidopa should not be used in those under 18 years old and should be avoided in pregnancy. It is contraindicated to give carbidopa/levodopa capsules along with nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors due to a risk of hypertension. These include but are not limited to phenelzine, isocarboxazid, and tranylcypromine. Any nonselective MAO inhibitor should be stopped at least two weeks prior to beginning treatment with carbidopa/levodopa.
