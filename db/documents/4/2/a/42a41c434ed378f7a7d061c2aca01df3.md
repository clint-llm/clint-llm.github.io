The diagnosis of esophageal reflux is usually based on symptoms, objective testing with endoscopy, ambulatory reflux monitoring, and response to a PPI therapy. However, upper endoscopy is not required in patients presenting typical esophagitis symptoms. In addition, patients presenting with chest pain require investigation to exclude cardiac causes of chest pain.
