Various processing techniques have been suggested and studied in the literature, exploring different fixing and demineralizing solutions of tooth and periodontium. In light microscopy (LM) analysis done on histological processing of teeth and periodontium, it was demonstrated that 10% buffered neutral formalin was used as a fixative solution and 10% pH 7.3 EDTA, as a demineralizing solution, has shown satisfactory results. To obtain morphometric and morphological satisfaction, paraffin-embedded sections of the sample are obtained, each with a thickness of 6 μm. These slides were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). This routine protocol is also beneficial since it allows the possibility of serial sectioning for more specific techniques. For instance, techniques such as histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses that are more fitting for evaluating cellular components and extracellular matrix of the periodontium can be done using this routine protocol.

In a cross-sectional study conducted in Turkey by Alkan et al., the effects of antibiotic therapy in oral histology were studied. The results showed that in healthy participants in oral histology trials, a minimum of 3 months should pass after the final dose of amoxicillin to avoid the negative effect of gingival tissue smear samples.
