Pilocytic astrocytoma is the most common childhood brain tumor and most often found in the posterior fossa. Complete resection usually cures the patient; however, the patient can present with brainstem compression and hydrocephalus, which are both potentially life-threatening. Therefore, it is essential to achieve early diagnosis and treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of pilocytic astrocytoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pilocytic astrocytoma.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of pilocytic astrocytoma.
- Outline the management options available for pilocytic astrocytoma.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of pilocytic astrocytoma and improve outcomes.
