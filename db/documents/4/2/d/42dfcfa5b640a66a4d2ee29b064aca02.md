Vestibular dysfunction is a disturbance in the body's balance system due to an insult to the vestibular system of the inner ear, the central nervous system processing centers, or both. The symptoms of peripheral and central vestibular dysfunction may overlap, and a targeted physical examination will often help to differentiate between the two. Symptoms typically consist of vertigo, nausea, vomiting, intolerance to head motion, unsteady gait, and postural instability, with nystagmus often clinically apparent as well. The most common form of acute peripheral vestibular dysfunction is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, whereas an ischemic stroke of the posterior fossa is the most common cause of acute central vestibular dysfunction. This activity describes the evaluation and management of vestibular dysfunction and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe how the time course of vertigo elicited in the patient history narrows the differential diagnosis.
- Review the risk factors for developing acute central vestibular dysfunction.
- Outline the clinical examination techniques that differentiate peripheral from central causes of vestibular dysfunction.
- Summarize the epidemiology of vestibular dysfunction.
