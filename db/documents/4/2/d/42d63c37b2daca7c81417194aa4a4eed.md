As there is no specific treatment for Venezuelan equine encephalitis, avoiding infection is the best prevention. Outbreaks may be controlled by reducing mosquito populations, as arthropods serve as the primary vector of infection. Humans, especially those who have frequent contact with equines, should limit physical exposure to mosquitos, wear protective clothing, and use frequent applications of repellants. Aerosolized insecticide applications in endemic areas will also contribute to a reduction in mosquito populations.

Epizootic outbreaks may also be prevented through mass vaccination of horses with the TC-83 live-attenuated vaccine.
