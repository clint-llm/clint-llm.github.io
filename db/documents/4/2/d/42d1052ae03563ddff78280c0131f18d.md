Hantavirus infections occur via the inhalation of viral particles and subsequent deposition in terminal respiratory bronchioles. Alveolar macrophage infection is followed by viremia which results in widespread infection of the pulmonary capillary endothelium and can also disseminate to other organs via the lymphatic system. Hantavirus entry into endothelial cells is mediated by beta-3 integrins leading to dysregulation of cell migration. Furthermore, the release of proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1, and interferon-gamma,Â are suspected to lead to increased vascular permeability causing noncardiogenic pulmonary edema resulting in the cardiopulmonary phase of the disease.
