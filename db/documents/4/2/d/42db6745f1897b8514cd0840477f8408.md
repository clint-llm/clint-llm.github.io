IBD patients presenting to the clinic require a thorough evaluation for signs and symptoms of EIMs. Common presenting complaints include abdominal pain and bloating, diarrhea/constipation, fever, fatigue, weight loss, tenesmus, inflammation of joints, skin, eyes, and liver. A thorough family history of IBD is essential as having a family member with IBD increases the likelihood of having the disease.
