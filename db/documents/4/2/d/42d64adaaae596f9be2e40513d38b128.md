It is helpful to know if the vomitus is bilious or not in developing a differential diagnosis. Primary considerations for cases of bilious vomiting in neonates are duodenal atresia, duodenal stenosis, annular pancreas, but particularly malrotation of the intestine caused by midgut volvulus whereby superior mesenteric artery flow to the distal bowel is compromised. Midgut volvulus usually presents days later in life than duodenal atresia. It is important to look for other gastrointestinal abnormalities associated with Down syndrome, such as anal atresia, Hirschsprung disease, diaphragmatic hernia, and omphalocele.
