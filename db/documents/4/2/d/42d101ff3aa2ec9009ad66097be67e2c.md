The submental lymph nodes collect lymph from the central area of the lower lip, the skin of the mental region, the tip of the tongue, and the incisor teeth. Next, they drain into the submandibular lymph nodes and the deep cervical group, which eventually drains into the jugular lymph trunk.

The submental artery is the largest of the cervical branches of the facial artery. It emerges just after the facial artery exits from the submandibular gland. The submental artery delivers vascular supply to the skin of the submental area and the muscles that border the submental triangle, and it anastomoses with the inferior alveolar artery and the sublingual artery. It runs between the mylohyoid muscle and the mandible; it travels either deep or superficial relative to the anterior belly of the digastric muscle
