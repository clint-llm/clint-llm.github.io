Different layers of the epidermis are visible by examining sectioned epidermal tissue under hematoxylin and eosin staining under light microscopy:

- **Stratum Basalis:**characterized by cuboidal or low columnar cells with basophilic cytoplasm and melanocytes. Melanocytes present as rounded cell bodies with clear cytoplasm and slender cytoplasmic processes

- **Stratum Spinosum:**characterized by desmosomes attaching polyhedral shaped keratinocytes with a round to oval nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Desmosome junctions appear as spines between cells

- **Stratum****granulosum:**characterized by keratinocytes with dense, ovoid, and basophilic keratohyalin granules

- **Stratum****lucidum:**characterized by a thin homogenous eosinophilic zone that is difficult to identify in H&E sections

- **Stratum****corneum:**characterized by keratin in anucleate cells in a basket weave pattern

The dermis is more visible with a Verhoeff’s stain. The interlacing collagen appears in red with elastic fibers in black.
