Despite being a preventable and curable disease, tuberculosis is the leading worldwide cause of death due to infectious etiology. Approximately one-third of the world’s population is presumed to be infected with MTB. Tuberculous meningitis carried a fatal prognosis before the development of anti-tuberculous medications, and it remains the number one cause of death and disability in children infected with MTB. TBM may also occur during immune reconstitution syndrome that can occur shortly after treatment initiation for HIV with antiretrovirals when undiagnosed MTB infection is present.

Tuberculous meningitis presents in 1% of all cases of extra-pulmonary TB. In the developed world, where there is a lower prevalence of TB in the population, estimates are that TBM accounts for 6% of all causes of meningitis. In locations with a higher prevalence of MTB in the population, estimates are that TBM accounts for up to one-third to one-half of all bacterial meningitis.
