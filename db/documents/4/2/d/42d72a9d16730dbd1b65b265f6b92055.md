Surgical considerations within the submandibular triangle involve detailed knowledge of the anatomy of the area to avoid post-operative complications. This anatomical understanding should include both the structures containedÂ in, as well as those surrounding structures of the triangle. The most common post-operative complications from excision of both benign and malignant submandibular triangle masses include temporary or permanent marginal mandibular nerve weakness, and hematoma. Resection of other nerves present within the triangle may be necessary depending on the depth of invasion of the neoplasm. This may involve damage to the lingual or hypoglossal nerves.
