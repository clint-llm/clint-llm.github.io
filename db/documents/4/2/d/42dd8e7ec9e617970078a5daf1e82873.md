The majority of the blood supply to the orbit is supplied by the ophthalmic artery, which branches off of the internal carotid artery. A branch of the external carotid artery, the infraorbital artery, also contributes blood supply to the orbital floor. There are many branches of the ophthalmic artery, including the central retinal, supraorbital, supratrochlear, lacrimal, dorsal nasal, short posterior ciliary, long posterior ciliary, posterior ethmoidal, anterior ethmoidal, and anterior ciliary (off of the muscular branches of the ophthalmic artery) arteries. Except for the central retinal artery and the ciliary arteries, which supply intraocular structures, these branches, as well as the infra-orbital artery off of the external carotid, all contribute to the vascular supply of the extraocular muscles and structures. The superior and inferior ophthalmic veins are responsible for venous drainage of the orbit.

The existence and location of orbital and eyelid lymphatics are a current area of ongoing research and debate.
