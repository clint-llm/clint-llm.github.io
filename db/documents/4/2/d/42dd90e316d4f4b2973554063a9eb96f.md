The mediastinum is divided compartmentally and consists of subdivisions that house and support vital structures within the thorax. Below are the borders of each region of the mediastinum.

- Superior Mediastinum: bordered by the thoracic outlet superiorly, transverse thoracic plane (the plane of Ludwig) or sternal angle inferiorly, medial border of the pleural sacs laterally, dorsal surface of the sternum anteriorly, and ventral surface of the first four thoracic vertebral bodies posteriorly

- Anterior Mediastinum: bordered by the pericardium posteriorly, medial border of the pleural sacs laterally, and the sternum, transversus thoracis muscles, and fifth, sixth, and seventh left costal cartilages anteriorly

- Middle Mediastinum: formed by the borders of the pericardial sac anteriorly and posteriorly, reflected to the medial borders of the pleural sacs bilaterally, transverse thoracic plane superiorly, and thoracic surface of the diaphragm inferiorly

- Posterior Mediastinum: bordered by the pericardium anteriorly, the thoracic surface of the diaphragm inferiorly, the transverse thoracic plane superiorly, the bodies of the fifth to the twelfth thoracic vertebrae posteriorly, and theÂ pleural sacs laterally

Each region of the thoracic mediastinum contains unique structures. Listed below are the different regions of the thoracic mediastinum and a high-level overview of their components.

- Superior Mediastinum:

- 
              
- Organs: thymus, trachea, esophagus
              
              
- Arteries: aortic arch, brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery
              
              
- Veins and lymphatics: superior vena cava, brachiocephalic veins, the arch of the azygos, thoracic duct
              
              
- Nerves: left and right vagus, recurrent laryngeal, cardiac, left and right phrenic nerves

- Anterior Mediastinum:

- 
              
- Organs: thymus
              
              
- Arteries: internal thoracic branches
              
              
- Veins and lymphatics: internal thoracic branches, parasternal lymph nodes
              
              
- Nerves: none

- Middle Mediastinum:

- 
              
- Organs: the heart and its great vessel roots, trachea and main bronchi
              
              
- Arteries: ascending aorta, pulmonary trunk, pericardiacophrenic arteries
              
              
- Veins and lymphatics: superior vena cava, pulmonary veins, pericardiacophrenic veins
              
              
- Nerves: phrenic, vagus, sympathetics

- Posterior Mediastinum:

- 
              
- Organs: esophagus
              
              
- Arteries: descending thoracic aorta
              
              
- Veins and lymphatics: azygos hemiazygos veins, thoracic duct
              
              
- Nerves: vagus, splanchnic, sympathetic chain

Each region of the mediastinum can be considered to serve a primary function.

The superior mediastinum is essentially a conduit space allowing structures to pass between the head, neck, and thorax.
