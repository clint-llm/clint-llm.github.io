Causes of uremic encephalopathy generally include all the factors that can lead to the accumulation of uremic toxins in a patient, such as the causes of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Many compounds have been implicated in the pathogenesis of uremic encephalopathy, known as uremic toxins (UT). Urea is the most studied UT. While severe cognitive changes of uremic encephalopathy develop when eGFR falls below 15 mL/min, mild to moderate cognitive changes can be identified at eGFR in the range of 40 to 60 mL/min.

Generally, uremic toxins build up in a patient's blood when they develop acute kidney injury, secondary to a number of reasons. They are either unable to get the solutes cleared up with the help of renal replacement therapy, or they fail to respond to therapy. The list of these causes is extensive, for example, drugs, toxins, prolonged hypotension, dehydration, sepsis, blood loss, etc.
