The disease spectrum caused by N. meningitidis ranges from asymptomatic carriage to death due to fulminant meningococcemia. Meningococcal meningitis and septicemia are the common syndromes reported, although both clinical pictures present in some cases.

The signs and symptoms of meningococcemia include an early upper respiratory tract infection with coryza, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and laryngitis. Patients are febrile with a headache, vomiting, and lethargy. Typically, patients with meningococcemia have a fever and hemorrhagic rash, followed by signs of severe circulatory collapse. Purpura and shock often develop within hours. Diffuse mottling to extensive purpuric lesions are the skin manifestations. Petechiae or purpura are seen in 50% to 60% of patients. Twenty percent to 30% of children may not have a rash on presentation.

Chronic meningococcemia is defined as meningococcal septicemia with fever for at least a week before antibiotic therapy and with no meningeal symptoms. In chronic meningococcemia, bacteria are never found by biopsy or culture of skin lesions. Researchers postulate that the skin changes and arthritis may result from antigen-antibody complexes. The diagnosis is established by identifying the organism in blood cultures. Recovery is prompt following antibiotic therapy.

A number of investigators have stressed myocardial manifestations associated with meningococcal meningitis, including heart failure with pulmonary edema and high central venous pressures accompanying signs of poor peripheral perfusion. Treatment of myocardial failure can ameliorate the situation. Increased levels of interleukin 6 may be a mediator of myocardial depression in septic shock due to meningococcal infection.
