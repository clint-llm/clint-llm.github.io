The human retina is the most metabolically expensive tissue in the human body. Processing visual input in the retina requires high quantities of arterial blood and, subsequently, venous drainage. The congregation of retinal venules forms the central retinal vein which flows into the cavernous sinus. The blockage of this venous drainage from the retina can be of 2 varieties: central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) or branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). This activity describes the pathophysiology of BRVO and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the cause of branch retinal vein occlusion.
- Describe the pathophysiology of branch retinal vein occlusion.
- Summarize the treatment options for branch retinal vein occlusion
- Explain the pathophysiology of BRVO and the role of the interprofessional team in its management.
