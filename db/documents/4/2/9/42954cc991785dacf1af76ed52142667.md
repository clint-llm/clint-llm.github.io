While it is clear that the ability to conceive is not the same across all populations and can vary due to many factors, patterns of predicted infertility have been established. Studies have analyzed the average age of infertility in many countries. In Japan, it has been found that fertility was highest at women aged 24 or younger and that their fertility decreased with age, which correlates to similar data from a study on European women.

As fertility can be linked to many different factors, it is difficult to define the exact prevalence alone for age-related reasons. However, based on data from multiple trials of both insemination and IVF, the chances of conception both naturally and via artificial reproductive technology decrease with age. As many as 10 to 15% of all couples attempting conception have reported difficulties with infertility.
