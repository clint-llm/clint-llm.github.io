Sweat chloride levels:

-  Less than 30 mmol/L: CF is unlikely

- 30 to 59 mmol/L: CF is possible, further testing may be required

- 60 or greater mmol/L: diagnostic of CF

Sweat chloride in patients without cystic fibrosis should be less than 30 mmol/L. Values greater than 60 mmol/L are diagnostic of cystic fibrosis. Intermediate values between 30 to 60 mmol/L are considered to be an elevated but not diagnostic level. Cystic fibrosis is possible in these patients, but repeat or alternative testing is necessary.

For patients with intermediate sweat chloride levels (30 to 60 mmol/L), genetic testing may help to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. In patients with two CF-causing mutations on separate chromosomes, no further diagnostic testing is necessary, and CF diagnosis is confirmed. For patients without CF-causing mutations, no further testing is indicated as CF is unlikely. In patients with undefined CFTR mutations or CFTR mutations of varying clinical consequence, the clinician should pursue further testing if clinical features are present; this may entail NPD (nasal potential difference), ICM (intestinal current measurement), semen analysis, or pancreatic function testing.
