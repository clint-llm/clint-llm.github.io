**Ocular Evaluation**

**Visual Acuity**

A routine visual acuity examination is mandatory in each case to document Snellen's uncorrected, best-corrected, and pinhole visual acuity.

**Subjective Refraction**

Subject refraction should be documented to know astigmatism and rule out amblyopia. Regular documentation of refraction is necessary as these patients can have a sudden myopic shift.

**Cycloplegic Refraction**

Cycloplegic refraction in a dilated pupil is an integral part of the workup of these patients to rule out amblyopia, and pupil dilatation is needed to provide refraction peripheral to the area of the lenticonus**.**

**Intraocular Pressure**

To rule out pre-existing glaucoma, it is mandatory to document IOP in each case using non-contact tonometry or contact tonometry.

**Ultrasound B Scan**

Ultrasound B scan reveals the existence and extent of lenticonus. On B scan, lenticonus appears as herniated lenticular material suggestive of lenticonus.

**Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography**

ASOCT is mandated to assess the configuration of the anterior or posterior lenticonus and to know the integrity of the posterior capsule. In cases with pre-existing posterior capsular defects or posterior capsular dehiscence, ASOCT is a viable tool.

**Ultrasound Biomicroscopy**

It is a helpful investigation to rule out lenticonus.

**A Scan**

A scan documents keratometric value, astigmatism, and axial length and calculates the IOL power. A scan also documents increased lens thickness.

**IOL Master**

In clinics where IOL master is available, it is a handy tool and more reliable for calculating IOL power.

**Neuroimaging**

These patients suffer from neurological problems, so this warrants neuroimaging. MRI usually reveals light ventriculomegaly and periventricular cystic lesions.

**Laboratory Analysis**

The lab diagnosis of Lowe syndrome rests on the reduction in inositol polyphosphate-5 phosphate activity of OCRL-1 cultured in skin fibroblasts. Genetic analysis for OCLR gene. Electromyography and electroencephalography to assess neurologic and musculoskeletal sequelae. Serology to rule out metabolic acidosis, reduced glomerular function, hypovitaminosis D, raised CPK, and liver transaminases. Urine analysis will reveal aminoaciduria and proteinuria.

**Systemic Evaluation**

**Audiometry**

Audiometry is a vital tool for assessing hearing loss and the type of hearing loss. Alport usually has high-tone bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). The hearing loss is most pronounced at a frequency of 2000 and 8000 Hz, which makes it difficult to distinguish sounds, and there is increased sensitivity to loud noise, which is characteristic.

**Blood Pressure Assessment**

It is mandatory to assess blood pressure in these patients as these cases are prone to renal hypertension.

**Complete Blood Count**

To complete the list and assess the patient holistically, CBC is needed for these cases.

**Kidney Function Test**

Patients with Alport have chronic haematuria, edema, hypertension, and glomerulonephritis; hence kidney function test is mandated in these cases.

**Urine Analysis**

Routine urine analysis is essential to rule out microalbuminuria/proteinuria.

**Ultrasound Abdomen**

It will reveal renal parenchymal disease.

**Renal Biopsy**

To assess the GBM ultrastructural characteristics, collagen 4 composition, and extent of glomerular damage.

**Genetic Analysis**

To know the lamellated GBM, a COL4A5 mutation and two COL4A3 or COL4A4 mutations.
