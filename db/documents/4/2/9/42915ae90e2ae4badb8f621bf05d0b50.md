The interprofessional team surrounding the practice of MET and Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine (OMM) includes the healthcare professionals trained in OMM and MET, the patient themselves, and likely nursing staff. When performing MET on a patient, it is important to keep the patient informed on what is involved before and during the treatment. The physician should be aware of how the patient experiences the procedure and should inquire if the patient is experiencing worsening or new pain throughout the procedure. If at any point, the patient is uncomfortable, the procedure should be terminated. Therefore, communication between the physician and patient is paramount in the treatment process. [Level 2]
