LCD is a progressive disease, resulting in the eventual loss of vision without treatment. For the subtypes limited to the cornea, patients tend to respond exceptionally well to surgical intervention, as described above. In these patients, symptoms may recur due to continued amyloid invasion of the grafted tissue, requiring further or repeated treatment.

In type II LCD, there is a broader range of symptoms that may have an impact on a patientâ€™s life. While the ocular symptoms may be treated with a high degree of success, the neuropathy and facial paralysis are harder to treat and likely to cause long-term symptoms.
