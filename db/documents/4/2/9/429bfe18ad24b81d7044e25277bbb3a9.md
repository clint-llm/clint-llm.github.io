Patients starting or continuing ruxolitinib need to be monitored in multiple domains. Due to the increased risk of infection, all patients require monitoring for signs of infection throughout treatment while taking ruxolitinib. Studies have shown increased rates of urinary tract infections, hepatitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and herpes zoster infection; therefore, clinicians should keep this in mind, and patients should be screened for signs of infection.

It is also recommended to check the patient's complete blood count in individuals with myelofibrosis before starting ruxolitinib and continue to check this every two to four weeks until the dose of ruxolitinib has stabilized. Once drug levels have stabilized, a complete blood count only needs to be done every eight to twelve weeks or when clinical suspicion warrants it.
