Research suggests that comparative analyses of cases on tissue eosinophilia against a baseline control from retroactive studies from healthy individuals will improve outcomes. Overall the clinical course of eosinophilic gastroenteritis is unknown, therefore warrants an urgent need for long-term follow-up studies.

An interprofessional team plays a crucial role in managing eosinophilic gastroenteritis, which includes gastroenterologists, allergists, pathologists, gastroenterology specialty-trained nurses, pharmacists, and dieticians.
