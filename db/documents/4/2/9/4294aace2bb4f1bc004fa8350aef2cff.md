The prognosis is assessed by the size of the thrombosis, duration of time in place, and the amount of resulting infarction. In the case of an infarction, 8% of patients will have progressively worsening kidney function that will result in the initiation of dialysis therapy. Most patients, however, will experience resolved renal function once improved perfusion of the kidney is achieved. Without infarction, laboratory testing findings are likely to be transient and not have major long-term implications for the patient. Prevention of further events with anticoagulation, sometimes chronically, will lead to better prognoses in the future.
