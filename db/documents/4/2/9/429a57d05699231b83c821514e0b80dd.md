Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) is a category of cervical epithelial cell abnormalities described by the Bethesda system for reporting cervical cytology. It refers to abnormal cytologic changes that are suggestive of the squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) but are qualitatively and quantitatively less than those of a definitive SIL diagnosis. Based on the patient's age and the estimated risk of possible underlying neoplastic lesions, an ASC-US report requires further follow-up by doing repeat cytology and HPV tests to guide the management of potential precancerous/cancerous cervical lesions. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of ASC-US and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in this process.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the term "ASC-US" and identify its etiology.
- Describe the diagnostic workup tests used to evaluate a patient with a cervical cytology report of ASC-US.
- Outline the management of a patient with a cervical cytology report of ASC-US, based on the most recent practice guidelines.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure a thorough evaluation and management of a patient with a cervical cytology report of ASC-US.
