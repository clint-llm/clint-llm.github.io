The incidence and prevalence of FED are challenging to determine, since many patients present with corneal guttata that never progress to FED, and most patients with FED have signs and symptoms that manifest only after several decades. FED initially presents with corneal guttata in the fourth decade of life, but most patients do not require surgical intervention until the sixth or seventh decades.

Although guttata may occur in up to 4% of patients older than 40 years old in the U.S., they less commonly co-occur with corneal edema, and therefore, many patients with guttata do not receive the diagnosis of FED.

There are several risk factors associated with FED that are not heritable. Age and gender are important factors that influence the development of FED. People older than 40 years old and women have a higher risk of developing FED.
