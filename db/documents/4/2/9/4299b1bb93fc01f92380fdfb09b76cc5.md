Richter hernia is a herniation of the anti-mesenteric portion of the intestine through a fascial defect. Patients often present with symptoms similar to other incarcerated hernias, such as abdominal discomfort, distention, nausea, and vomiting. The incidence of Richter's hernia has been increasing with the growing popularity of minimally invasive surgery. Operative treatment of these hernias depends on the viability of the involved portion of the bowel and may often require resection in addition to repair of the fascial defect. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of Richter hernias and highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of a Richter hernia.
- Review the workup of a patient with a Richter hernia.
- Summarize the treatment options for a Richter hernia.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to repair the fascial defect and resent the non-viable bowel, which will improve outcomes for patients with Richter hernias.
