CPET, by nature of its complex setup and interpretation, is a specialty diagnostic examination. Therefore primary care practitioners must have open lines of communicationÂ with consultant specialists and subspecialists. Their recommendations are lost if the information is not readily available between members of the patient's care team. Concerning the conduction of CPET, respiratory therapists, nurses, nursing assistants, and technicians are integral to a successful examination. Without interprofessional collaboration and mutual respect, the performance of the test is difficult, if not impossible.
