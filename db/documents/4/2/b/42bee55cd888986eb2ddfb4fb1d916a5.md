Injuries to the vasculature of the groin/inguinal region have high rates of associated morbidity and mortality. Of these injuries, external iliac vessel injuries have a significantly higher rate of complications than femoral injuries; these include higher mortality (41.4% external iliac vs. 6.6% femoral), permanent disability (13.8% vs. 0.9%), and any complication (48.3% vs. 17.9%). Rates of DVT (0 to 5%), SSIs (4 to 7%), and length of stay (6 to 9 days) were similar between external iliac and femoral vessel injury.

Approximately 34% of patients with penetrating injury to the colon or rectum require ICU admission with a hospital length of stay 10 to 14 days. A 3% leak rate from the repair/anastomosis site and been documented in the literature. 67% of patients will experience a morbidity complication, including anastomotic leak, intraperitoneal sepsis, and wound complications. Mortality estimates are at 10%.

Bladder injuries are mostly extraperitoneal (63%) and are associated with a mortality rate of 8%.
