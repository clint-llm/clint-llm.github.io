The leptomeningeal cyst is benign and carries a good prognosis. However, timely diagnosis and prompt surgical repair are crucial to avoiding long-term complications. The cyst can remain asymptomatic in some individuals; however, it still requires repair, given the risk of progressive enlargement and irreversible neurological complications. In addition, epilepsy, brain herniation with neurological deficit, and mental retardation can be associated with poor quality of life and significant morbidity.

Good-to-excellent outcomes, even in the delayed presentation, are observed in most cases.

Poor prognostic factors in one study included:

- Significant bony defect (>7 cm).

- Initial severe head injury.

- Calvarial defects crossing the midline, and

- Delayed repair (>8 months).

Comminuted fracture (OR, 7.572) and the degree of diastasis (OR, 2.081 per mm diastasis) have a significant role in developing growing skull fractures.
