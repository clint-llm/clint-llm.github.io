In addition to history, physical examination, and direct visualization of the larynx with tissue sampling as described above, other studies are necessary. Multiple methods of obtaining tissue are feasible. The most valuable are biopsy during direct laryngoscopy of the suspected primary lesion, and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of any suspected nodal disease.For all laryngeal cancers, whether suspected to be early or late stage, imaging of the primary lesion and draining lymph nodes is indicated, usually with contrast-enhanced CT of the neck. This study visualizes the neck lymphatics, as well as structures that cannot be assessed adequately even with direct laryngoscopy, such as the subglottic region, as well as to detect subtle signs of disease extension such as minor invasion into the thyroid cartilage, all of which are crucial for accurate staging.

The suspected locally advanced disease would prompt contrast-enhanced CT of the chest as well as PET/CT to rule out distant metastases. Suspected invasion into the hypopharynx may prompt esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and/or barium swallow, which may differentiate the correct aerodigestive tissue of cancer origin.

Prior to any surgery, blood work is necessary that includes CBC, platelet count, liver and renal function, blood type, thyroid function, electrolytes, and albumin levels.

During the workup of laryngeal cancer, the following factors are considered:

- Vocal cord mobility

- Number of regions involved

- Presence of cervical or distant metastatic lesions

- Involvement of the base of the tongue

- Involvement of the paraglottic and pre-epiglottic space

- Involvement of the thyroid cartilage

- Involvement of the carotid artery and sheath

- Invasion of the esophagus

- Invasion of soft tissue and adjacent laryngeal muscles

- Involvement of neck lymph nodes
