Infliximab is a biologic, monoclonal-antibody drug. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved infliximab for moderate to severely active Crohn disease in adults and children (six years and above), ulcerative colitis, active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and chronic severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients. This activity describes the mode of action of infliximab, including adverse event profiles and other key factors, e.g., dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and monitoring, and highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the mechanism of action of infliximab.
- Describe the adverse effects of infliximab.
- Summarize the precautions that are necessary before administering infliximab.
- Explain the importance of care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients treated with infliximab.
