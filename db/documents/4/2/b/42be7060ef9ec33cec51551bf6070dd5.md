Hepatic Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive investigative tool that can help clinicians, especially if added to an abdominal ultrasound exam. The procedure is cost-effective and has no complications.

Doppler ultrasound is the first imaging technique used in assessing the vascular condition in the following diseases:

- Portal hypertension associated with cirrhosis

- Portal or hepatic vein thrombosis

- Vascularity of the hepatic focal lesions

- Follow-up after TIPS or liver transplantation

- Measuring the hepatic vein and artery patency, blood velocity, and direction

Referral to other invasive investigative or treatment procedures such as hepatic venous pressure gradient HVPG, angiography, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt TIPS, and other procedures depends on initial assessment on Doppler ultrasound.
