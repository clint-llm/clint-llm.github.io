The diagnosis of IH is by excluding other reasons and causes of hypersomnia. However, history alone is insufficient to make the diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia.

A total sleep time must be longer than or equal to 66O minutes, especially when the mean sleep latency on the MSLT is longer than 8 min. However, MSLT is not a sensitive diagnostic test for IH.

Valid MSLT requires that it is performed on the day following nocturnal PSG (with sufficient sleep >6 hours). Usually, the MSLT should have five daytime nap opportunities in IH, and the mean sleep latency is less than 8 minutes with SOREMPs or less than two.

Actigraphy can be helpful as multiple-day recordings occur in a home environment and can corroborate the history with sleep logs- at least over seven days with unrestricted sleep.

The CSF hypocretin is usually unnecessary and can be used to confirm the diagnosis of narcolepsy but not IH. When suspicion of accurate diagnosis remains, repeating MSLT would be needed.

According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) -the third edition, the diagnostic criteria are as follows:

- Daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep

- No cataplexy

- MSLT  with mean sleep latency <8 minutes or TST >660 minutes on 24-hour PSG or actigraphy with a sleep log.

- No evidence of insufficient sleep (from the sleep diary).

- MSLT findings or symptoms of hypersomnolence are not better explained by alternate etiology.
