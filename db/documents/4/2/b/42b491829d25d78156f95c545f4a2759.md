Although the events leading to separation of the primitive trachea and esophagus are not completely understood, the most commonly accepted hypothesis is that a defect in the lateral septation of the foregut into the trachea and esophagus causes TEF and EA. The trachea and esophagus develop from a common primitive foregut, and at approximately 4 weeks of gestation, the developing respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are separated by epithelial ridges. The foregut divides into a ventral respiratory tract and a dorsal esophageal tract; the fistula tract is thought to derive from an embryonic lung bud that fails to undergo branching. These defects of mesenchymal proliferation are thought to lead to TEF formation.

The VACTERL complex refers to anomalies of the vertebrae (V), anal or gastrointestinal tract atresia (A), congenital cardiac defects (C), tracheoesophageal defects (TE), renal and distal urinary tract anomalies (R), and limb lesions (L). In esophageal atresia, the sonic hedgehog (SHH) gene, which encodes for an intracellular signaling molecule,  appears to be implicated. Investigators have shown that mice deficient in the regulation of the SHH gene exhibit VACTERL type anomalies.SHH, was investigated in animals with TEF and in controls. Gli-2 messenger RNA was reduced in the fistula tract when compared to the adjacent esophagus.
