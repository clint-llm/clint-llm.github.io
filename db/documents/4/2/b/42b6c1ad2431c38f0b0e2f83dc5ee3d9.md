Ecthyma gangrenosum (EG) is a cutaneous infection that most commonly occurs in immunocompromised individuals with fulminant bacteremia. EG was first described in 1897 by Canadian pathologist Dr. Lewellys Barker as a manifestation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although P. aeruginosa remains the most frequent organism identified in EG, other causative pathogens have since been described. This activity reviews the cause and presentation of ecthyma gangrenosum and highlights the interprofessional team's role in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of ecthyma gangrenosum.
- Describe the presentation of ecthyma gangrenosum.
- Summarize the treatment options for ecthyma gangrenosum.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by ecthyma gangrenosum.
