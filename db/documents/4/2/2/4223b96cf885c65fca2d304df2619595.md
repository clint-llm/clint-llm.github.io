Peripheral nerve neuralgia or peripheral neuropathic pain may result from damage of a nerve due to various etiologies including medical conditions such as diabetes, infections (e.g., postherpetic neuralgia), kidney diseases, or nerve compressions such as entrapment, as well as peripheral nerve injury due to trauma, cancer, or a combination of the above. Although treatment strategies for neuralgia usually start with pharmacotherapy, drug treatment often fails to obtain effective results and can expose the patient to side effects with poor improvement in the quality of life. It is often necessary to resort to non-pharmacological strategies such as neurolytic blocks. Peripheral neurolytic blocks are indicated to alleviate severe intractable pain. This activity reviews severe intractable pain and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for peripheral neurolytic block procedures.
- Summarize the mechanism behind the efficacy of a peripheral neurolytic block procedure.
- Identify the potential complications of peripheral neurolytic blocks.
- Explain the significance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the efficacy of peripheral neurolytic blocks and to improve patient outcomes.
