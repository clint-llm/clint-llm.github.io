Benign occipital seizures are not very common, but it is very important to be recognized by all healthcare workers, including pediatricians and nurses who work with children. Since symptoms like nausea, vomiting, blindness, pallor, hypersalivation are atypical for seizures, referral to a neurologist for neurodiagnostic workup is not generally obtained. Education of this condition can help early identification of children with these stereotypical events.

An interprofessional approach is recommended when treating a child with benign occipital seizures. Some children do not need daily medication but will need rescue medication, and education about this must be provided to the school nurse, parents, and family members. Pharmacists can help with educating the children and their parents about the side effects and the importance of compliance with medications.
