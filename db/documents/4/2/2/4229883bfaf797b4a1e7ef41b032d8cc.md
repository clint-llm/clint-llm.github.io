Patients typically need reassurance for this condition since they may be worried about more sinister conditions. They should be discouraged from scratching or picking at the lesion and must take some precautions to avoid trauma or secondary infection of the lesion. They should be advised about the risk of recurrence with partial excisions and the risk of scarring with a total surgical excision. The decision of which modality to use for the lesion must be arrived at jointly by the patient and their physician.
