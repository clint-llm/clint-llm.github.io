Treatment and management of male breast cancerÂ typically follow the same rationale of breast cancer in females, which consists of resection followed by adjuvant endocrine therapy, chemotherapy (CT), or radiotherapy.

Simple mastectomy is the option for T1 and T2 cancers.

Radiation therapy is usually offered to men with T3 or higher tumor stage, positive surgical margins, or four or more positive lymph nodes.

Tamoxifen is recommended as adjuvant therapy for at least 5 years.

Most metastatic male breast cancers are estrogen receptor-positive, and thus tamoxifen is preferred.
