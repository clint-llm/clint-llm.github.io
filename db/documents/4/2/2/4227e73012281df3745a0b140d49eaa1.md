Symptomatic discoid meniscus most commonly presents with anterior and/or lateral knee pain with or without mechanical symptoms.

The discoid meniscus has classically been referred to as “snapping knee syndrome,” where a clunk may be heard at terminal flexion. This is typically related to the unstable Wrisberg variant, where there are no posterior meniscotibial attachments.

In the setting of a displaced meniscal tear, the patient may present lacking the ability to extend the knee fully. If a discoid meniscus is symptomatic, the patient will often present during adolescence.

A comprehensive knee examination should be completed, including visual inspection, range of motion, neurovascular evaluation, ligamentous stability testing, and meniscus-specific special testing.
