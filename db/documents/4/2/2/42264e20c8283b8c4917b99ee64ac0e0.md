Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is an extrapulmonary complication of cystic fibrosis (CF) and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in affected individuals. Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes results from abnormal glucose metabolism primarily characterized by insulin deficiency and intermittent insulin resistance. It is crucial to recognize the early signs of abnormal glucose metabolism in individuals with CF to diagnose CFRD. Early diagnosis and treatment correlate with slower rates of pulmonary decline and improved growth. This activity aims to provide an overview of CFRD.
