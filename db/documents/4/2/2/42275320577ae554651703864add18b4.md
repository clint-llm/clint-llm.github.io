There are multiple indications for allergy testing. The most common causes are persistent asthma, suspected drug allergy, suspected insect allergy, suspected food allergy, seasonal rhinitis, rhinoconjunctivitis, and rhinitis with otitis media.

Serum IgE and skin prick tests are frequently used together for food allergy testing to confirm a true food allergy before eliminating it from the patientâ€™s diet.

If an IgE test is performed and has unexpected results when considering the history, skin prick testing should be done to solidify the diagnosis of an allergy further.
