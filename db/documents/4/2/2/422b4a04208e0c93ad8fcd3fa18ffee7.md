Microdontia is a rare dental anomaly in which teeth appear smaller than is normally expected. Patients who present with true generalized microdontia, a rare condition where all teeth are affected, often have other systemic syndromes, such as pituitary dwarfism, oro-faciodigital syndrome, or oculo-mandibulo-facial syndrome.

Macrodontia, also known as megalodontia, has an unknown etiology; however, genetic and environmental factors have been attributed to the development of this condition.

Taurodontism has commonly been attributed to the failure of sufficient invagination of the epithelial root sheath during tooth development, which results in misplaced dentin deposition, creating a larger than normal pulp chamber.

Fusion involves joining two developing tooth buds that result in a larger-sized tooth with two distinct tooth germs. This fusion may be due to tooth germs being in too close approximation, or the developing supernumerary tooth bud is in too close a proximity to a normally developing tooth bud.
