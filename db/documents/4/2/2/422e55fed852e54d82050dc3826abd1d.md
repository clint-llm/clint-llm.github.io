Diagnosing and treating cor-triatriatum requires an interprofessional approach.

Cor-triatriatum is a very rare congenital heart disorder. However, most infants are symptomatic at birth and need neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care. Nurses play a vital role in the monitoring of these infants both pre and post surgery. The infants need to be monitored for arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, or right heart failure. The outcomes for untreated infants is poor. The outcomes for other infants with cor triatriatum depend on the presence of other co-existing heart defects. For those with only the cor triatriatum defect, the outcomes are excellent. The surgery is best done at centers with experience with this disorder. While it appears that only the accessory membrane needs to be resected, the small size of the left atrium and collapse of the structure during cardiopulmonary bypass can make visualization difficult.
