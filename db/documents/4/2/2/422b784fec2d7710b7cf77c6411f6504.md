Neuronal and glioneuronal brain tumors are a heterogeneous group of tumors, so their presentations and management are variable. Therefore, effective evaluation and treatment require interprofessional input, which typically occurs in the form of epilepsy or tumor board conferences. Epilepsy evaluation requires the coordinated efforts of technicians, nurses, advanced practice providers, and physicians to appropriately identify seizure foci and ensure accurate and effective treatment for patients.

The recognition of acute neurological status changes by emergency medical personnel is important to expedite emergency evaluation and medical or surgical responses, which helps minimize morbidity and mortality related to brain tumors. The inpatient care of postoperative brain tumor patients is complicated and requires the coordinated care of therapists, nurses, advanced practice providers, physicians, and other healthcare team members.

Specialty training regarding neurological evaluation is of utmost importance so that changes to a patientâ€™s status are promptly recognized and action can be taken. Therefore, increasing the awareness of these tumors among various healthcare providers will help facilitate early recognition and the effective care of these patients. [Level 5]
