Neonates with congenital hypothyroidism are often asymptomatic at birth and detected by newborn screening (NBS). NBS is obtained via heel prick on dried whole blood spot samples on filter paper cards. NBS for CH is routine in most countries worldwide. Methods for NBS detection and criteria for CH diagnosis vary throughout the United States and other countries. The priority of the NBS is the early detection of primary CH. The most specific test for detecting primary CH is a TSH measurement, while the T4 test is more sensitive as it includes babies with rare hypothalamic-pituitary-hypothyroidism.

Multiple factors may affect newborn thyroid screen results as thyroid physiology in neonates is dynamic. Interpretation of thyroid function test requires awareness of the newborn screening method, age at specimen collection, prematurity status, and clinical state of the newborn.

NBS for CH should ideally be performed between 2 and 4 days of life. If this is not possible, testing should be done before discharge from the hospital.

**There are 3 Screening Methods**

1) Initial TSH with backup T4 measurement. Typically TSH cutoff is 20 to 50 U/L. This method is utilized by most programs in Europe, Japan, Canada, and the US. With this approach, central hypothyroidism, primary CH with delayed elevation of TSH, and hypothyroxinemia will be missed.

2) Initial T4 with backup TSH measurement. This method will miss mild cases of primary CH (subclinical hypothyroidism) where T4 is normal, but TSH is elevated. Initial T4 measurement can detect central hypothyroidism.

3) Simultaneous T4 and TSH measurements. This is an ideal screening method, however, more expensive.

**Repeat Screening**

Primary CH may be masked due to the suppression of TSH secretion caused by hypothalamic-pituitary immaturity, medication administration, and the effects of serious neonatal illness. Delayed TSH elevation (defined as elevated TSH in the second neonatal screening after normal TSH in the initial screening) is observed in one-half of preterm infants.

The second screening at two weeks of age or at discharge from the hospital is also recommended for infants with specimen collection within the first 24 hours, multiple births, particularly in cases of same-sex twins (concern for fetal blood mixing).

Infants exposed to iodine should be monitored for up to 1 month after exposure to identify iodine-induced hypothyroidism (with low T4 and elevated TSH) following exposure.

When abnormal results on the NBS for CH are reported, a confirmatory venous sample for thyroid function test (free T4 and TSH) should be obtained immediately. Further evaluation of the etiology of CH should not delay treatment initiation.

**Interpretation of Thyroid Function Tests**

1. Low free T4 and high TSH: These results confirm the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism.

2. Normal free T4 (or total T4) and high TSH: These results define compensated or subclinical hypothyroidism. If serum TSH is more than 20, mIU/L, treatment with levothyroxine should be initiated. If serum TSH is mildly elevated (e.g., 6 to 20 mIU/L), clinicians may observe the patient clinically and repeat TFT in 1 week. In many cases, the TSH will be normalized on the repeat TFT. However, if serum TSH remains elevated at 10 mIU/L or above by 4 weeks of age, the infants should be treated.

3. Low free T4 and low or normal TSH: These results suggest the possibility of central hypothyroidism that is usually accompanied by other pituitary hormone deficiencies, such as growth hormone or ACTH deficiency (infants may present with hypoglycemia due to these 2 hormone deficiencies) or diabetes insipidus. Besides neonatal hypoglycemia with cortisol and/or growth hormone deficiency, other clues for central hypothyroidism that should prompt clinicians to obtain serum free T4 and TSH are nystagmus, micropenis, midline defect such as cleft lip/cleft palate. Treatment with levothyroxine should be promptly initiated for central hypothyroidism. Other possibilities for this abnormal thyroid function test include primary hypothyroidism with delayed TSH elevation (rare), nonthyroidal illness, or transient hypothyroxinemia of prematurity (in premature infants). In sick neonates, low T4 can result from dopamine or high-dose glucocorticoids. Low total T4 and normal TSH may also be due to thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) deficiency, which does not require treatment.

**Additional Laboratory Evaluation**

1. Thyroid imaging studies: Imaging studies are not routinely recommended, as the results do not alter the treatment plan. The decision to start therapy is based solely on abnormal thyroid function tests. Imaging studies may be performed to determine an underlying etiology and occasionally help establish a cause of CH in a patient with a permanent form, as long as they do not interfere with medical therapy. Those circumstances include infants with a goiter, or infants with mildly elevated TSH (e.g., TSH 6-10 mIU/L), in whom thyroid dyshormogenesis is suspected.

1.1 Thyroid ultrasound: This imaging study is safe and can be performed after treatment initiation. Thyroid ultrasound can visualize the presence or absence, size, echogenic texture, and structure of a thyroid gland. However, it may not reliably detect the ectopic thyroid gland (lingual and sublingual).

1.2 Thyroid radio nuclear uptake scan: An iodine 123 uptake scan or sodium pertechnetate 99 m, can be used to determine the size and location of the thyroid gland, and to diagnose ectopic thyroid, thyroid aplasia, or hypoplasia. A thyroid scan shows no uptake in patients with thyroid blocking antibodies, and patients with iodine trapping defects will have no uptake on the thyroid scan with a normal or enlarged thyroid on ultrasonography.

2. Thyroid autoantibodies: TSH-receptor blocking antibodies may be useful in diagnosing infants with transient CH due to maternal autoimmune thyroid disease, or infants with a sibling with a transient course of CH.

3. Serum thyroglobulin: A low or absent thyroglobulin level demonstrates a lack of any thyroid building architecture and suggests thyroid agenesis. However, intermediate levels may not differentiate the cause of CH.

4. Urine iodine concentration: CH may be caused by iodine excess or deficiency (in infants born in an area of endemic goiter or iodine deficiency). Measurement of urine iodine can identify the excess or deficient state.

5. Radiographs of the knees may be obtained at diagnosis. The absence of a lower femoral epiphyseal center indicates severe CH and correlates with later intelligence and motor scores.
