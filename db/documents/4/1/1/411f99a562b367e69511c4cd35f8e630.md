Oral lichen planus can pose a diagnostic dilemma as patients may exhibit non-specific clinical and histologic features that may overlap with several other conditions. A thorough history taking and clinical and histopathological examination are necessary to arrive at an accurate diagnosis. A dentist or oral surgeon is usually involved in caring for patients with OLP. For patients who present with extra-oral involvement, an inter-professional team including dermatologists, gynecologists, gastroenterologists, otorhinolaryngologists, or ophthalmologists may be involved, depending on the sites affected.

The use of pharmacotherapy, patient education, and lifestyle modification form the cornerstone in managing OLP and ensuring favorable patient outcomes.
