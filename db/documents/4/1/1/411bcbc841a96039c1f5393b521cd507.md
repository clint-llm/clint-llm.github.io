Parathyroid hormone deficiency, also called hypoparathyroidism, results in hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and increased neuromuscular irritability. Patients may present with myalgias, muscle spasms, and in extreme cases, tetany. Though there are multiple causes of hypoparathyroidism, most cases occur as complications of thyroidectomy and other types of head and neck surgery. This activity reviews when this condition should be considered on differential diagnosis, how to properly evaluate for it, and the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the causes of hypoparathyroidism. 
- Describe the features commonly seen in patients with hypoparathyroidism. 
- Summarize the management strategies for hypoparathyroidism. 
- Review the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism.
