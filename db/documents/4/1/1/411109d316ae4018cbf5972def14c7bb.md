During both cardiovascular operations, difficult endotracheal intubations and self-extubation by a patient, there is an increased risk for arytenoid cartilage subluxations.

Asphyxiation may occur secondary to immobility of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, as the patient will be unable to abduct the vocal cords, preventing them from opening the rima glottidis.

High-frequency jet ventilation may provide superior hemodynamic stability in comparison to standard endotracheal intubation, specifically during endolaryngeal surgical approaches. Despite the increased frequency of respiratory hazards (such as barotrauma and air entrapment), high-frequency jet ventilation is recommended as the method of airway management during cases involving the posterior aspect of the larynx.
