The massage technique, as we have illustrated, is indicated in:

- All newborn infants seen with epiphora caused by congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction

- The treatment is commenced in all children when first seen for congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction, irrespective of the age of the child.

- The treatment is used even when a child is awaiting a more invasive procedure like probing, intubation, or balloon dilatation.

- If a child has mucoid discharge and is awaiting a dacryocystorhinostomy, the administration of this technique reduces the amount of mucous that persists in the eye during the day
