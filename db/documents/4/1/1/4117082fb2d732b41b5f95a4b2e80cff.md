The underlying pathologic condition of phlegmasia dolens is acute extensive VTE occluding the venous outflow of an extremity. The lower extremities are more commonly affected than the upper extremities. In the lower extremities, almost always, the iliofemoral segment is involved and occluded. In 20%-40% of cases, phlegmasia has been associated with malignancy. However, other risk factors for VTE include hypercoagulable disorders, venous stasis or insufficiency, May Thurner syndrome (left iliac vein compression by the overlying right iliac artery), surgery, trauma, pregnancy, IVC filter placement, the use of hormonal therapy or oral contraceptives, prolonged immobilization, inflammatory bowel disease, heart failure, and central venous catheterization. In approximately 10% of cases, the etiology remains unknown.
