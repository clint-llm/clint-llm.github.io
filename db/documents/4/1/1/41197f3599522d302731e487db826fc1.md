Treatment options for plica syndrome include stretching and strengthening, intraplical corticosteroid injections, and arthroscopy.

The Sakakibara classification system is important when considering treatment because type A and B have a low likelihood to cause pain. Type C and D, on the other hand, can impinge on the medial condyle due to their larger size. Type A and B respond much better to conservative therapies than C and D do. As a result, patients with type A and B should be encouraged to attempt conservative therapy first.

Conservative treatment for plica syndrome can either be performed at home by the patient or via formal physical therapy. Either way, this would involve lower extremity stretching and knee extension exercises with the goal of strengthening the joint capsule musculature, hamstrings, and quadriceps. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and ice are reasonable treatments at this stage to calm down inflammation. Conservative management also includes avoiding activities that incite pain. At least 3 months of conservative treatment is recommended before advancing to more aggressive therapies. One study demonstrated that 49 of 55 patients treated conservatively returned to their prior baseline without a return of symptoms. The remaining 6 patients were also able to return to their prior baseline, but they reported an occasional return of symptoms, which were tolerable.

Often the next step if stretching and strengthening do not release symptoms is intraplical corticosteroid injection. This is a reasonable treatment option, especially early in the disease process when conservative management has not provided relief. Research of 31 patients with medial plica syndrome treated with intraplical steroid injection found that 73% had a full return to activity with complete pain relief.

Resection via arthroscopy is a favorable option for medial plicae that do not respond to conservative treatment. Resection is also reasonable when cartilage damage is suspected, such as in type C and D lesions, even if conservative measures have not been completed for 3 months. Another study showed that compared to conservative treatment, arthroscopy yields a greater therapeutic effect for plica syndrome and the effect is longer lasting.
