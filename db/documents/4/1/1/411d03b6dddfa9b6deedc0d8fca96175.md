Initial tests include anal examination or anoscopy for Gram-stained smear of anorectal exudates to check for polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Stool culture is used for E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Shigella, and amebiasis. Serological markers (p-ANCA, and ASCA) have low sensitivity in UP. STD testing include nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for Chlamydia trachomatisÂ and NAAT or culture for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to test HSV, LGV and C difficile toxin in stool. ELISA is used to test HIV, and darkfield and serologic testing are used for T. pallidum. STD-related proctitis indicates sexual abuse if found in infants or children. Diagnostic procedures include anoscopy, proctosigmoidoscopy and biopsy if there is suspicion for IBD. In CRP, endoscopic biopsies should be taken from the postero-lateral walls due to concerns about fistula formation.
