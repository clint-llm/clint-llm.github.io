**High Index of Suspicion**

Labs are used to exclude other diagnoses (complete blood cell count, ESR within reference range)

**Diagnostic Imaging**

- Early radiographs can be normal

- Plain films are preferred

- Standard anteroposterior pelvis and frog-leg lateral (Lauenstein) views

- If in doubt or plain films are normal, try a bone scan or MRI

**Early Findings**

- Widening of joint space (epiphyseal cartilage hypertrophy)

- Changes in the epiphysis (smaller, appears denser)

- Â "Crescent sign:" subchondral radiolucent zone of the anterolateral epiphysis (subchondral fracture)

**Late Findings**

- Flattening of the femoral head, fragmentation, healing (sclerosis)

- Bone scans show decreased perfusion to the femoral head

- MRI shows marrow changes suggestive of Legg-Calve-Perthes
