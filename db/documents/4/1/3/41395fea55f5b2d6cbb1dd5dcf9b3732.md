An overtly infected wound is the primary contraindication to the primary repair of an ear laceration. The physician should also be alert to signs of more serious concurrent injury, such as nausea and vomiting, ataxia, hemotympanum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea, Battle's sign, or facial nerve dysfunction. These are more common in high-velocity injuries and poly-trauma patients.
