The first step in diagnosing the MPO deficiency is determination of peroxidase activity by histochemical staining of leukocytes, immunocytochemistry, or, more commonly, flow cytometry which allows assessment of functional MPO within neutrophils. Immunoblotting of isolated leukocytes for MPO protein also provides additional information into the molecular basis of the observed absence of functional enzyme independent of its enzymatic activity.

Differential diagnosis of MPO deficiency from disorders presenting with similar clinical signs and symptoms includes Chediak-Higashi syndrome, Hyperimmunoglobulinemia E, leukocyte adhesion deficiency, neutropenia,Â neutrophil actin dysfunction, lazy leukocyte syndrome and any condition that can cause secondary MPO deficiency. In any patient with disseminated fungal infections, MPO deficiency should be considered as a differential.
