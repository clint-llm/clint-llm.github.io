Femoral artery pseudoaneurysms caused by endovascular access used to be treated exclusively by surgical means, but in the last few decades, the paradigm has shifted to less invasive measures. Options for management include observation, ultrasound-guided compression, ultrasound-guided thrombin injection, and surgical repair — the characteristics of the false aneurysm guide treatment choice.

Femoral artery aneurysms less than 2 to 3 cm in diameter may undergo spontaneous thrombosis and regression with observation.  Those that are larger rarely spontaneously thrombose, though this is not an absolute rule.

Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection is a well-established, minimally invasive method for treating pseudoaneurysms that are accessible. Several studies have reported a very high success rate (97% to 100%) for femoral pseudoaneurysms with a single treatment, even while patients are on anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet agents.

Surgical management of femoral pseudoaneurysm is reserved for those who fail at least one unsuccessful duplex-guided compression or thrombin injection,

Visceral artery pseudoaneurysms are typically treated by endovascular means first, with surgery reserved for failure; this is highly effective, with one study reporting a 98% success rate in control of pseudoaneurysms and ruptured true aneurysms.

Aortic pseudoaneurysms are now preferably treated with thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).
