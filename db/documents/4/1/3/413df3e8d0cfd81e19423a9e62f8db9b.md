Evaluation of an athlete at risk for sudden death should be performed with an interprofessional team that includes the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, cardiologist, pediatrician, and internist. Patients should receive education about their diagnosis, their prognosis, and how it is affected by physical exertion. Certain conditions require the patient to avoid any and all physical exertion until the establishment of a treatment regime. Patients should also avoid other potentially dangerous triggers. It is critical to provide all of the relevant information to the patient so that the healthcare provider and patient can engage in shared decision-making about whether or not to continue the chosen sport.

The prognosis depends on the type of heart pathology, the age of the patient, other comorbidities, and level of physical activity.
