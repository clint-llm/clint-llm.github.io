Clinicians should perform the following clinical investigations in all patients suspected of having LHON: visual acuity, color vision, fundus examination, visual field perimetry, and OCT imaging. For childhood disease, they should measure the optic disc vertical diameter on OCT Larger diameter may be associated with a better visual prognosis. For late-onset LHON cases it is important to consider toxic exposure (e.g., smoking, drinking, and environmental factors).

The tests to determine optic nerve function like visually evoked potential(VEP) and retinal status like electroretinogram(ERG) may be abnormal. The Earliest VEP findings are prolonged latency and abnormal morphology of waves. The latency further prolongs as the disease progresses. Unaffected carriers can also reveal ERG changes like a decrease in amplitude of N95 waveform even in an asymptomatic state. Thus these modalities help in long-term monitoring.

When any extraocular features are present, an MRI of the brain should be performed.

ECG should also be ordered for all patients with LHON as it may reveal cardiac conduction abnormalities.
