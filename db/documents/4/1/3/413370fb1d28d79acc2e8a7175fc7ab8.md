There is no role for routine prophylaxis for candidemia.Â Prophylaxis should be considered in the ICU for selected patients at high risk of candidemia as in those individuals with recurrent gastrointestinal perforations, anastomotic leakage, and small bowel or pancreas transplant. Prophylaxis, when indicated, is done with fluconazole.

All patients with candidemia should undergo an ophthalmologic evaluation to rule out endophthalmitis.
