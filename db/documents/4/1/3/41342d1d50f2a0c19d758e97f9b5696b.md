The etiology of cardiovascular diseases of pregnancy is variable and dependent on the pathology involved. The following summarizes some common cardiovascular diseases of pregnancy and their hypothesized etiologies:

- Cardiomyopathy: There are several hypotheses regarding the etiology of this disease process. Some of the most common theories are viral myocarditis, autoimmune causes, hemodynamic instability, microchimerism, as well as others.

- Coronary artery disease: The etiology of ischemic heart disease in pregnant women is similar to that of non-pregnant women. Risk factors that expose these individuals to ischemic heart disease include hypertension, hyperlipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, smoking, and immobility.

- Pregnancy-associated myocardial infarction: The same risk factors for coronary artery disease also exist for pregnancy-associated MI. It hasÂ been hypothesized that certain conditions of pregnancy, such as preeclampsia and eclampsia, could contribute to myocardial infarction.

- Valvular disease: Although the hemodynamics of pregnancy can exacerbate certain valvular diseases, it is inconclusive whether pregnancy has a specific role in the etiology of newly diagnosed valvular disorders of pregnancy.
