Tolterodine administration occurs in two different ways – orally or transdermally as a topical gel formulation (proniosomes).

**Oral**

Orally, it is available in two forms: immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (ER) (i.e., administering tolterodine ER 4mg once daily is pharmacokinetically equivalent to tolterodine ER 2mg twice daily).

**Adults**

The initial dosage for IM begins at 2mg, twice daily, and has been shown to decrease the number of micturition every 24 hours, whereas EM is given as 4mg once a day.

A clinical study regarding male overactive bladder symptoms shows an increased effect of tolterodine ER compared to tolterodine IM.

**Pediatric**

Doses from 0.03 to 0.12mg/kg are considered safe for children from the ages of 1 month to 15 years. A clinical study showed that the drug was well-tolerated, and there was no relationship between the dose levels and adverse events; however, complete safety and efficacy have not been established.

**Transdermal Topical Gel Formation (proniosomes)**

A study on transdermal patches demonstrated similar therapeutic effects as the oral dose form, but it showed a decrease in the adverse effects of the drug, such as dry mouth and constipation. Both transdermal and oral administration of tolterodine had a similar level of inhibitory effects in the bladder.
