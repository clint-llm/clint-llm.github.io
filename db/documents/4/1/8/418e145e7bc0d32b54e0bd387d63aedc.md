The clinician and histopathologist need a high index of suspicion for diagnosis. A thorough examination helps with localizing the extent of the lesion. In some cases, the clinical picture might be obvious, but definitive diagnosis relies on demonstrating fungal elements and diagnostic culture findings. Leukocytosis with eosinophilia can be present.

Inoculation of culture specimen should be done soon after specimen collection as organisms do not survive at 4 degrees Celsius.

Imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging should be performed for further evaluation to assess the extent of infection, track therapeutic response, and also helps surgeons plan invasive procedures. If the gastrointestinal disease is suspected, colonoscopy should be considered which would allow for visualization of the lesions and obtain biopsies.
