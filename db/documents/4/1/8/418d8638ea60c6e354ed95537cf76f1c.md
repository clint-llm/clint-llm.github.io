Patients with arsenical keratosis often present to their primary care clinician. These patients need to be referred for further evaluation to a dermatologist as several skin diseases can be clinically similar, and a dermatologist will be able to diagnose them based on the concomitant signs and risk factors. As it is an early manifestation of CAT, a missed diagnosis can have adverse long term outcomes. Once diagnosed and initiated on treatment, the patient can be referred to their primary care clinician for further management of arsenical keratosis. A dermatopathologist has an important role in management when a malignant transformation is suspected; if the histology reveals malignancy, surgical excision is done by a plastic surgeon.

Regular follow-up visits to identify systemic complaints and timely referral can lead to early diagnosis and treatment of associated systemic diseases, including malignancies. Hence, holistic management by an interprofessional team consisting of a dermatologist, primary care clinician, dermatopathologist, and plastic surgeon improves the outcomes of this multisystem disorder of public health relevance.
