Clinical reasoning involves pattern recognition developed through repetitive exposure to similar situations.

Deliberate practice with task trainers allows learners to hone skills and build confidence in their abilities. Advancements in technology are enabling task trainers to become very specialized; for instance, cardiology programs can offer learners simulators for transesophageal echocardiography, coronary angiography, electrophysiology, and transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The experience gained through the use of these devices reduces the risk to patients.

Several studies indicate HFS increases the participantâ€™s confidence in their knowledge and skills.
