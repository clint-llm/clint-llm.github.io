The larynx has a cartilaginous framework that houses the muscles and ligaments that are primarily and uniquely designed to prevent the aspiration of ingested material into the airway. These same structures are involved in the production of voice as airflow from the lungs passes through the vocal folds (housed in the larynx) and creates various frequencies of sound that can ultimately produce a person's unique voiceprint. The larynx subdivides into three parts: the supraglottis (the epiglottis and false or ventricular folds), the glottis (the true vocal folds) and the subglottis. Any alteration in the function of the larynx can affect breathing, swallowing, or voice.
