At the clinics, the distal (peritoneal or atrial) catheter of the patients has to be evaluated for adequate length and revised accordingly. Knowing the signs of increased ICP, shunt malfunction, and infection is mandatory for patients and their families to look for emergent medical support.Â Scheduled periodic shunt reevaluations are necessary to evaluate for evidence of shunt malfunction, shunt disconnections, short peritoneal catheter, or adjustment of medications. Patients should be careful not to damage the superficially positioned valve and tubing system by trauma or by continuous scratching of the skin. Some patients require antibiotic prophylaxis for dental or other invasive procedures or diagnostic tests to prevent shunt infection.
