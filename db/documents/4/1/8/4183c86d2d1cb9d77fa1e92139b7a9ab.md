Hamstring injuries are among the mostÂ frequently encountered muscle injuries in athletes and correlate with significant time away from the sport. Injuries typically occur during rapid acceleration or high-speed running. The biceps femoris generally is the most commonly injured muscle of the posterior compartment; however, the semitendinosus muscle has also been implicated in hamstring strains.
