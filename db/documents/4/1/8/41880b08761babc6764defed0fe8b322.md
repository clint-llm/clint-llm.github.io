One of the most common reasons for clinical visits in the United States is sinusitis, also known as rhinosinusitis. It is also one of the top reasons that antibiotics are prescribed. Over a one-year period, there were up to 73 million restricted-activity days related to sinusitis and total direct medical costs of almost 2.4 billion, not including surgery or radiographic imaging. In addition, up to 14.7 percent of individuals surveyed in the National Health Interview Survey reported having had sinusitis the preceding year. This activity reviews the cause, presentation, and pathophysiology of sinusitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.
