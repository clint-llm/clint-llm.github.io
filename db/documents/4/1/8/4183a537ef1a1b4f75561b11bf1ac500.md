In adults the majority of parenchymal hamartomas produce no symptoms, often being incidental findings. Depending on the location and size of the lesion, however, patients can still develop an array of complaints, including persistent coughing or wheezing, dyspnea, hemoptysis, rhonchi, higher likelihood of pneumonia, atelectasis or even pneumothorax. Endobronchial masses additionally pose the danger of airway obstruction. Hamartomas that have become symptomatic require a thorough diagnostic approach, and surgical resection can become necessary.
