- Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as kidney damage or an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m persisting for three months or more irrespective of the cause.

- CKD is usually asymptomatic till stages IV and V.

- The KDOQI guidelines recommend screening high-risk populations which include individuals with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and those older than 65 years with a urinalysis, a urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR), measurement of serum creatinine, and estimation of GFR preferably by chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.

- Calcium and phosphorus are not useful to distinguish AKI from CKD. However, normal PTH suggests AKI rather than CKD.

- Systemic hypertension, proteinuria, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic acidosis cause progression of CKD and need to be treated aggressively.

- Bicarbonate supplementation to reach a serum bicarbonate target equal to 23 delays the progression of CKD.

- All CKD patients need to be evaluated for anemia, hypertension, metabolic acidosis, and bone and mineral disorders.
