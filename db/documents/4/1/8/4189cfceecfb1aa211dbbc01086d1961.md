As with any medical condition, early detection significantly improves outcomes. This requires patient education about the risk of the condition and the importance of evaluation and follow-up. An interprofessional team-based approach is often recommended for patients, including primary clinicians, otolaryngologists, plastic surgeons, neurotologists, audiologists, and speech therapists. Genetic counseling may be of benefit in syndromic cases. All team members must openly communicate with the rest of the team and maintain accurate and updated records so the entire team can access patient information to guide their decision-making process.

Ordering inappropriate tests and imaging without sound clinical reasoning should be avoided. In the case of aural atresia, performing a temporal bone CT scan in an infant less than five years of age exposes them to unnecessary radiation, which can be particularly harmful. CT scans are indicated when the patient is at or above the age of 6 and surgical correction is desired.
