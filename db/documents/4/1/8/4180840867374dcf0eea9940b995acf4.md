- Trismus most commonly occurs in the setting of uncomplicated common conditions (e.g., wisdom tooth extraction); it may also be a relatively common complication of uncommon diseases (fibrosis following head and neck radiotherapy).

- Trismus is best addressed by identifying the inciting etiology and directing treatment to the underlying cause.

- Most cases of trismus resolve following symptom-directed treatment with heat therapy and NSAIDs.

- Refractory chronic trismus may require physiotherapeutic interventions.

- Implementing a checklist to identify cases of trismus with an atypical presentation may help identify cases of malignancy at early stages.

- Mandibular opening devices are usually prescribed by a specialist or physiotherapist.
