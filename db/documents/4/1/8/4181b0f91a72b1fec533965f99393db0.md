The external jugular vein derives from the union of the posterior auricular vein and the posterior division of the retromandibular vein, which occurs in the substance of the parotid gland at the level of the angle of the mandible. Â It also may receive blood from the transverse cervical vein, the suprascapular vein, the superficial cervical vein, and the anterior jugular vein in some instances. The retromandibular vein anterior division joins with the facial vein to form the common facial vein. The anterior jugular vein is a related vein that is formed from submandibular veins and can drain into the external jugular vein or the subclavian vein directly, with the latter being more common.
