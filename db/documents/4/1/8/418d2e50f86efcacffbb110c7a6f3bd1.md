The velum interpositum (VI) is a membrane resulting from the superposition of two layers of the tela choroidea of the third ventricle demarcating a potential space containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) located in the region between the internal cerebral veins (ICV) and the posterior medial choroidal artery. The dilatation of this space is "cavum veli interpositi" (CVI). This activity describes the anatomical characteristics of the cavum veli interpositi and highlights its role in human pathology. The part the interprofessional team plays in the care of these patients will be reviewed.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of cavum veli interpositi and the medical conditions associated.
- Review the evaluation of cavum veli interpositi.
- Outline the management options available for the complication of cavum veli interpositi.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance and improve outcomes in this kind of disease associated with the presence of this anatomical variant.
