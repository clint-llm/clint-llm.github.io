Sick sinus syndrome, also known as sinus node dysfunction, is a disorder of the sinoatrial node caused by impaired pacemaker function and impulse transmission producing a constellation of abnormal rhythms. These include atrial bradyarrhythmias, atrial tachyarrhythmias and, sometimes, bradycardia alternating with tachycardia often referred to as tachy-brady syndrome. These arrhythmias may result in palpitations and decreased tissue perfusion and consequent fatigue, lightheadedness, pre-syncope, and syncope. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of sick sinus syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the presentation of a patient with sick sinus syndrome.
- Describe the pathophysiology of sick sinus syndrome.
- Explain the treatment of sick sinus syndrome.
- Describe how an optimally functioning interprofessional team would coordinate care to enhance outcomes for patients with sick sinus syndrome.
