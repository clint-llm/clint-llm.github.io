Fluphenazine is a high-potency typical antipsychotic used for the symptomatic management of psychosis in patients with schizophrenia. There is a long-acting fluphenazine decanoate formulation used primarily as maintenance therapy for chronic schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders in patients who do not tolerate oral formulations or in patients where medication compliance is of concern.

Although frequently prescribed off-label for psychosis or psychotic symptoms related to the major neurocognitive disorder and related dementing illnesses, all antipsychotics (including fluphenazine) are not FDA-approved for these purposes, and clinicians should avoid their use in such cases. Fluphenazine is not FDA-approved for augmentation of mood stabilization or treating concomitant psychotic symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder. Fluphenazine has also been used off-label to manage chronic tic disorders and Huntington disease to control abnormal movements and chorea.

Like many other first-generation antipsychotics, fluphenazine has seen substantially decreased usage in developed countries after the advent of second-generation, atypical antipsychotics. It was first used in 1959, but its use has fallen out of favor in recent years since newer drugs are equally effective.
