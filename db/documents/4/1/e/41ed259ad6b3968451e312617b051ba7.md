As discussed above, these viral illnesses may result in serious complications and profound vision loss. Hence, it is important to work up all cases of posterior uveitis to rule out an infectious etiology and act promptly in managing these diseases.

The diagnosis and management of necrotizing retinopathies like ARN is complex, and only a prompt diagnosis can help salvage vision. Healthcare workers, including primary care physicians and nurses who see patients with herpes infection of the eye, should immediately refer these patients to an ophthalmologist. The goal of immediate treatment of such patients is mainly to decrease the incidence in the fellow eye.
