The prognosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy can be variable but is largely determined by the location and size of the ICH. Unfavorable outcomes are associated with larger hematoma size and the age of the patient (≥75). Favorable ICH outcomes are associated with sparing of the ventricles and a superficial location. Mortality ranges from 10% to 30%, with the best prognosis seen in patients with increased consciousness and smaller hematomas (<50 mL). CAA has a high hemorrhage recurrence risk when compared to a hypertensive hemorrhage. Studies have revealed recurrence rates of around 21%.

CAA is commonly associated with both transient and cognitive neurological impairment. Transient neurological symptoms are characterized by brief, recurrent spells of numbness, paresthesias, and weakness. The pathogenesis is not fully understood, but symptoms are typically only transient. At the same time, the cognitive impairments have revealed diminished cognitive speed and episodic memory loss. Interestingly, Alzheimer disease and CAA frequently coexist. CAA has also been found to correlate with vascular dementia.
