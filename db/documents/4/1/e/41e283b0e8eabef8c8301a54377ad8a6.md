Acute DVT and chronic venous disease are common conditions with a significant burden on patient morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. Duplex ultrasound of the peripheral venous system is an easily accessible and reliable method of diagnosis, evaluating the extent and severity of the disease and monitoring progression and planning treatment. This activity describes how to perform a complete duplex ultrasound exam of the peripheral venous system and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and managing care for patients with these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Review the general pathophysiology of venous thrombosis, post-thrombotic syndrome, and chronic venous insufficiency.
- Explain how to perform a complete duplex ultrasound exam of the lower extremity peripheral venous system, including assessing for thrombosis as well as valvular insufficiency.
- Describe the typical imaging findings of acute versus chronic deep venous thrombosis and valvular insufficiency.
- Outline how interprofessional team coordination can improve diagnostic results when using vascular sonography to evaluate conditions for which it is indicated.
