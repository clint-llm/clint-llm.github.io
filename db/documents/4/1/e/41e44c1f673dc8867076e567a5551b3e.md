A central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is a laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection not related to an infection at another site that develops within 48 hours of central line placement. Most cases are preventable with proper aseptic techniques, surveillance, and management strategies. This activity describes the evaluation and management of patients undergoing central line placement and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of CLABSI.
- Review key history and physical exam findings of patients with CLABSI.
- Summarize the treatment options for CLABSI.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by CLABSI.
