Short stature is present in about 10 to 15% of the general population, and it should be part of an interprofessional team of nurses and primary care providers in providing appropriate screening. A good follow-up protocol and well-documented growth charts are required to know when would be beneficial a referral to the pediatric endocrinologist.

It is important to remember that only about 3% of short stature patients have an actual endocrinologic problem that will need further treatment, which is why it is important to take a good history. If there is a concern in growth delay after proper height documentation, the patient needs to be sent for GH levels, IGF-1, and bone age. If this results within normal limits including a delay in bone age that correlates with the height of the patient, most likely it is safe to continue to monitor the patient. If taking this approach, and any of the laboratory workup or bone age are uncertain, or this type of lab workup cannot be done or properly interpreted, a specialist referral is in order.

These are other recommendations on when to refer a patient

- Any patient who is below two standard deviations on their height

- Any patient whose growth velocity is below the expected one in a 6 to 12 months period follow-up. (please see up for normal growth velocities by age)

- Any patient that crosses two percentile lines for their height (even if still within "normal" standard deviations)

- Patient with known or suspected comorbidities (thyroid disorder, turner, septo-optic dysplasia, etc.) - this type of population will need a full workup
