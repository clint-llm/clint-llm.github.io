Mycobacterium tuberculosis is responsible for 5.9% of community-acquired CNS infections worldwide.

The diagnosis is fraught with challenges and is often delayed due to the varied and non-specific presentation.

Advanced radiological imaging techniques are usually of great assistance in making presumptive diagnoses. CNS-TB is frequently complicated by vasculitic infarcts, cranial nerve palsies, multiple neurological deficits, and hydrocephalus. A strong clinical suspicion is enough to start prompt anti-tubercular therapy. A 4-drug regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol with adjunctive corticosteroid reduces morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis and management of CNS-TB may be complicated by drug resistance, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection.

Treatment efficacy depends upon how early it is instituted. Multiple factors determine the prognosis, the most important being the clinical stage of TBM at initial presentation. Untreated or unrecognized TBM may cause death within 5 to 8 weeks of the onset of the disease.
