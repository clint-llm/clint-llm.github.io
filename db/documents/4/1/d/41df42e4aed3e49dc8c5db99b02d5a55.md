Intersection syndrome was first described in the literature by Alfred-Armand-Louis-Marie Velpeau a French anatomist and surgeon in 1841. He is also credited for the first accurate description of leukemia. The term of intersection syndrome was first coined by James H. Dobyns in 1978 at the Mayo Clinic. Although the accepted vernacular is intersection syndrome, it has been described in the medical literature by many other names: Oarsmen's wrist, crossover syndrome, squeaker's wrist, abductor pollicis longus bursitis, abductor pollicis longus syndrome, subcutaneous polymyositis, and peritendinitis crepitans.
