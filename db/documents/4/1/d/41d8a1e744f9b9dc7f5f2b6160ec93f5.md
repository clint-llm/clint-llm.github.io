Contraindications to laser therapy include the use of oral retinoids within the past year, pregnancy or breastfeeding, immunosuppression, connective tissue disorders, and the presence of any concomitant skin disease at the site of treatment. It is important to elicit information regarding herpes simplex virus (HSV) history so prophylactic antiviral therapy can commence before the laser treatment.
