Researchers performed the HAVEN 2 trial on children with hemophilia with inhibitor development. Typically they develop inhibitors within 50 days of Factor VIII therapy. Children with hemophilia require high-volume infusions requiring a central venous access device (CVAD), which can lead to increased possibilities of infection/thrombosis.

An open study was conducted in children with one treatment arm receiving emicizumab and the other with no inhibitors. Results supported a decrease in bleeding events throughout the year. It also supported decreased anxiety associated with possible bleed causes, including activity levels. Subjects reported increased physical activity during the trial. Patients received either 2-week dosing or 4-week dosing. Both regimens showed an appropriate decrease in bleeding and disruption in daily living.

Regarding adults with hemophilia A and no inhibitors, dosing once every four weeks is adequate for bleeding control and well tolerated by patients. [Level 3].

Typically emicizumab will be prescribed by a hematologist, but it still requires the efforts of an entire interprofessional team. Management of hemophilia requires comprehensive diagnostic and treatment services, pain control, patient education, and genetic, psychosocial, and vocational counseling. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) operates in collaboration with the U.S. Hemophilia Treatment Center Network (USHTCN), a federally funded, specialized health care center called hemophilia treatment centers or HTCs. HTC are specialized, multidisciplinary healthcare centers with expertise in providing care for Patients with Hemophilia(PWH). To achieve this goal, a core interprofessional team consisting of a hematologist, certified pediatric hematology-oncology nurse, physical therapist, social worker, and a comprehensive multidisciplinary team including pediatricians, internists, orthopedic surgeons, dentists, genetic counselors, pharmacists, nutritionists, vocational rehabilitation counselors, and other healthcare providers all play a vital role in the care of the patient with hemophilia. This interprofessional care provided by HTCs optimizes patient outcomes and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with hemophilia by decreasing the probability of serious adverse events.
