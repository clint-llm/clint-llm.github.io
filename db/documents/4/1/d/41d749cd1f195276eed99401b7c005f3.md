Patients with spina bifida have a mortality rate of about 1% per year from 5 to 30 years. The higher the lesion, the greater the morbidity and mortality. The consequences of neural tube defects massively impact the quality of life among survivors. Psychosocial issues like increased incidence of depression, anxiety, and risk-taking behaviors are common in this group. Studies have shown that the areas most likely to be affected are employment, romantic relationships, and financial independence.
