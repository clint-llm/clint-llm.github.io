The major immediate and intraoperative complications specific to truncal vagotomy include death, bleeding, and injury to the stomach or esophagus. Other complications such as staple line leak, anastomotic leak, and internal hernia may be inherent to the specific type of intestinal reconstruction done.

The postoperative complications of truncal vagotomy are well documented. Resection of the vagal nerve trunks above the celiac and hepatic branches (differentiates TV versus SV) leads to parasympathetic denervation of the pylorus, liver, biliary tree, pancreas, and small and large intestines.

- Delayed gastric emptying: The stomach loses the vagally mediated receptive relaxation. This leads to an increased intragastric pressure causing an increased emptying of liquids. The pylorus does not relax effectively, and a decrease in solid food emptying is seen. This is the reason the majority of surgeons perform a concomitant drainage procedure at the time of TV.

- Postvagotomy diarrhea: Results from unconjugated bile salts entering the colon, thus leading to osmotic diarrhea. This complication is rarely seen with HSV but is the most common undesirable sequela of TV. It is first treated with codeine/loperamide along with cholestyramine.

- Postvagotomy hypergastrinemia: The parietal cells are denervated, causing a decrease in stomach acid output. This leads to G-cell hyperplasia and hypergastrinemia due to the loss of negative feedback mechanisms.

- Ulcer recurrence: TV has the lowest rate of ulcer recurrence compared to the other vagotomies. Recurrence is further prevented with the addition of an antrectomy.

- Dumping syndrome: This typically is seen only when an antrectomy or drainage procedure is done concomitantly with a TV.
