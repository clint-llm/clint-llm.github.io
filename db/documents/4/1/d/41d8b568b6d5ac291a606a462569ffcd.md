Wyburn-Mason syndrome is a congenital, nonhereditary, sporadic disorder. The precise risk factors associated with this condition are presently unknown and some anomaly in the organogenesis is explained to be the etiology. An embryonic defect is believed to result in the spread of vascular lesions from the cephalic origin along the route of migration before the actual migration of the vascular cells to their final destination. The concept of cerebrofacial arteriovenous metameric syndrome (CAMS)****is a classification system that describes the spectrum of phenotypical expression of AVM in the cerebral, orbital, and facial region. There are 3 types of CAMS. CAMS1 involves corpus callosum, hypothalamus, olfactory tract, forehead, and nose. CAMS2 involves cortex and diencephalon, optic chiasma, optic nerve, retina, sphenoid, maxilla, and cheek. Wyburn-Mason syndrome has been named as CAMS2 according to this system of classification. CAMS3 involves the cerebellum, temporal bone, and mandible.
