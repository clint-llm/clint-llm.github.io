The histopathological features usually depend upon the type of lesion sampled

- Epidermis: Usually insignificant, however, the occasional spillover of dermal neutrophils may occur, producing sub-corneal pustules. There can be epidermal spongiosis. Sometimes reticular degeneration of the keratinocytes may lead to frank intraepidermal and or subepidermal vesiculation.

- Dermis: Diffuse nodular and perivascular neutrophilic infiltrate without evidence of vasculitis. Leukocytoclasia, with endothelial swelling without fibrinoid necrosis, is a usual finding. Vasculitis may be seen as a secondary epiphenomenon in this setting.

- Subcutaneous fat: Extension of dermal infiltrate into subcutis may lead to septal or lobular panniculitis. Isolated neutrophilic panniculitis has also been observed.

Histopathological variants:

- Histocytoid: Infiltrate composed of immature spindle-shaped histiocyte like cells. Immunohistochemistry shows the presence of myeloperoxidase activity in these cells. They have to be closely differentiated from leukemia cutis.

- Lymphocytic: Infiltrate is predominantly lymphocytic, usually associated with myelodysplasia.

- Eosinophilic: Infiltrate is rich with eosinophils. A case has been observed in the settings of enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma.
