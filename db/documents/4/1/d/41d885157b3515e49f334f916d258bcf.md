It is critical to appreciate the unique anatomy of the C2 vertebra. The dens extend superiorly to communicate with C1 via the ligamentous anatomy.  Lack of intervertebral discs, unique ligamentous attachments, vertebra anatomy, and vertebral artery vasculature makes this area biomechanically unique from the subaxial cervical spine. For example, C1-C2 is generally responsible for 50% of the rotation movement.

C2 fractures can be divided into 2 kinds: odontoid and hangman's.

**Odontoid Fractures**

**Location**

- Fracture through the dens, flexion, or extension injury

**Nomenclature**

Anderson and D’Alonzo classification is the most ubiquitous.

- Type-1 fractures: Upper portion of the odontoid peg, above the transverse portion of the cruciform ligament, these are generally stable

- Type-2 fractures: These are the most common; they fracture through the based of the odontoid below the transverse portion of the cruciform ligament, they have a high risk of non-union

- Type-3 fractures: These fracture through the odontoid peg and into the body of C2, generally well tolerated

The Roy-Camille classification of odontoid fractures is another but less frequently used nomenclature format focusing on the direction of the fracture line.

**Hangman’s Fractures**

**Location**

- Fracture is generally through the bilateral pars, usually from hyperextension and axial loading

- Stable 90% heal with immobilization alone

**Nomenclature**

Levine and Edwards Classification

- Type 1: Less than 3 mm subluxation of C2 on C3, due to axial loading, stable, rigid cervical collar treatment

- Type 2: disruption of the C2 to C3 disc, posterior longitudinal ligament, greater than 4 mm subluxation, greater than 11 degrees angulation, less than 5 mm requires a reduction in axial traction and halo fixation for 6 to 12 weeks while those with greater than 5 mm can require surgery

- Type 2a: Less displacement more angular deformity, flexion injury, unstable, not suitable for axial traction; treatment in halo

- Type 3: C2 to C3 facet capsule disrupted, anterior longitudinal ligament disruption, unstable, may have a deficit; surgical candidates
