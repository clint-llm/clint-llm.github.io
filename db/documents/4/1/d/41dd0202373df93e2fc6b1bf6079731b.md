Cryoglobulinemia is a rare condition and is clinically significant in about 1 in 100,000. Cryoglobulins have been identified in several situations, specifically, including 15% to 20% of HIV-infected individuals, 40 to 65 percent of Hepatitis C-infected patients, and approximately 64 percent of HIV/HepC coinfected individuals.

Patients with type 1 cryoglobulin are anywhere from 5% to 25% of the cases based on the currently available case series.
