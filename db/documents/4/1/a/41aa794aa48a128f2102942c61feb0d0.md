The penis innervation is from spinal cord segments of the S2 to S4.  These cord segments pass through the pelvic splanchnic nerves.  The spinal ganglia of S2 to S4 passes through the pudendal nerves.  The dorsal nerve provides sympathetic plus sensory innervation to the penis.  The pudendal nerve branches to become the dorsal nerve of the penis.  The nerve runs next to the dorsal artery and supplies the skin and glans penis also.  The glans penis has a copious amount of sensory nerve endings.  The root of the penis has innervation from the ilioinguinal nerve.  The cavernous nerves have parasympathetic fibers that innervate the helicine arteries which supply erectile tissue.
