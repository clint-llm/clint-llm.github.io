The incidence of dysbaric osteonecrosis is highly variable which is likely a result of its insidious nature and the logistical difficulty of thoroughly screening high-risk individuals. In various Japanese studies, the incidence has been seen as high as 50% of Japanese commercial divers, while the US Navy reports only a 2.5% in military divers. There is a strong association with increased frequency and length of time exposed to compressed air and gas. Overall, the incidence is higher in males given the proportion of males employed in fields that involve exposure to breathing compressed gases. This is also consistent with the fact that the incidence of avascular necrosis from all causes is more common in men as well. Multifocal disease is prevalent, and the average age at presentation is 30 to 50 years.
