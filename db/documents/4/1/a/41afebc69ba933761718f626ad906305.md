Salzmann nodular degeneration (SND) resembles many conditions related to cornea. It is essential to differentiate it from these. Following differential diagnosis should be considered when making the diagnosis of SND.

- Bullous Keratopathy

- Usually associated with Descemet membrane folds, corneal stromal edema, raised intraocular pressure. Bullae may be differentiated from Salzmann nodules at the slit lamp by the presence of water.

- Climatic Droplet Keratopathy

- Golden-yellow or translucent droplets in the intrerpalpebral area bilaterally.

- Corneal Amyloidosis

- Primary amyloidosis, gelatinous drops like dystrophy or primary familial amyloidosis, presents with a bilateral raised multinodular mound of amyloid in the central cornea. These deposits are typically subepithelial.
- Secondary amyloidosis present in the area of past trauma as a yellow-white to the pink waxy nodular lesion.

- Corneal Keloid

- These are typically seen in younger age groups, with a history of inflammation, trauma, or in association with the Lowe syndrome.

- Hereditary Hypertrophic Scarring

- Nodular scaring after minor trauma or surgery. Difficult to differentiate from SND at the slit lamp.

- Peripheral Hypertrophic Subepithelial Corneal Degeneration

- Salzmann-like corneal opacities localized to the palpebral aperture.
- Typically bilateral and involve nasal as well as temporal cornea.
