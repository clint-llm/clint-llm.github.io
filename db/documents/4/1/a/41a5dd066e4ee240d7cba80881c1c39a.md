If acute leukocytosis is identified quickly with the underlying process treated appropriately, there are few, if any, complications. Complications are usually associated with treatment rather than the leukocyte elevation, which represents the natural immune system response to the stress being put on the patient. Chronic leukocytosis is not itself fatal but may be an ominous sign of a significant underlying process that must be appropriately identified and treated.

Acute or chronic significant leukocytosis above 25x10^9/mL, however, can have severe complications and potentially be fatal. WBC counts 25x10^9/mL and above can cause a hyperviscosity type syndrome, which can be seen in leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloproliferative disorders. Presenting symptoms of this oncological emergency include vision changes, bleeding, stroke or neurological changes, infarction, ischemia, and/or multi-organ failure.

Notably, tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an extremely dangerous complication of patients receiving treatment for malignancy, especially hematologic malignancies that may be the cause of leukocytosis. This syndrome presents when the patient receives appropriate treatment that causes a dramatic number of cancer cells to die quickly. The metabolic abnormalities that arise can cause symptoms of nausea, emesis, weakness, muscle cramping, renal failure, seizures, and possibly death if left untreated.
