The two most common complications after lung transplant are infection and rejection, and they cannot be differentiated based on presentation, as they both have the same signs and symptoms; they both can also be present without any symptoms. Rejection is very common within the first six months following a lung transplant but can occur at any time, and patients should be educated that lifelong follow-up, testing, and treatment with anti-rejection medications are essential to carefully monitor for lung transplant complications.
