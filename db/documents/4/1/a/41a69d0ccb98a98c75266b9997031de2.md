Progesterone enters the cell by passive diffusion through the plasma membrane and binds to the progesterone receptor in the nucleus. When unbound, the progesterone receptor exists as a monomer. After binding progesterone, the receptor undergoes a conformational change and becomes a dimer, which increases receptor binding to DNA. Most progestins exert their contraceptive effects by suppressing the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by the hypothalamus and luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by the pituitary gland. ThisÂ suppression alters the menstrual cycle to suppress ovulation. Norethindrone can be somewhat of an exception, as half of the women taking it still ovulate.
