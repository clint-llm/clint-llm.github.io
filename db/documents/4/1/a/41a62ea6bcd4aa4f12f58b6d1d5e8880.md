Following an initial physical exam, proceeding according to ATLS may be necessary if other traumatic injuries require imaging. For the specific evaluation of hyphema, a slit lamp examination is performed. On the slit lamp exam, fluorescein is used to assess for a corneal abrasion. This is done before the measurement of intraocular pressure, as using fluorescein later may result in false-positive corneal abrasion testing. After an open globe injury has been ruled out, intraocular pressure is measured. Any measurement greater than 21 mm Hg is considered elevated. A complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation profile on those with bleeding diathesis or anticoagulants is obtained and coagulopathies are corrected. Patients with a family history of sickle cell disease or trait or patients with uncertain status should be tested for sickle cell hemoglobinopathy.

Computerized tomography (CT) of the orbit should be utilized in patients with a concern for an open globe, an intraocular foreign body, or a suspected orbital fracture. Ultrasound of the orbit may be beneficial to evaluate for lens dislocation, intraocular foreign body, retinal detachment, and posterior vitreous hemorrhage.
