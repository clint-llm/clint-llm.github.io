As multiple variables regulate the selectivity in photodynamic therapy, the clinical response in an individual patient is difficult to anticipate. These variables include uptake of the photosensitizer into the target tissue, metabolism of the prodrug into active photosensitizer, penetration, and selectivity of the light source. Another variable affecting PDT is the temperature of the tissue, with the warming of the tissues being reported to result in better efficacy of PDT.

The advent of newer drug delivery systems and newer photosensitizers has propelled the field of photodynamic therapy forward. A combination of photodynamic therapy with other treatment modality has come up as a promising approach for improving the efficacy and decreasing the adverse effects associated with photodynamic therapy. The improved clinical outcome has been reported with the use of immunomodulation therapy like imiquimod cream along with photodynamic therapy.

A novel concept of ambulatory phototherapy has opened avenues for the delivery of photodynamic therapy with significantly less pain and more convenience to the patients as compared to the standard photodynamic therapy.
