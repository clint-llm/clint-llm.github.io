Polymyositis, a relatively uncommon autoimmune disorder, develops due to abnormal activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8 cells) and macrophages against muscular antigens that result in rhabdomyolysis and ultimately presents as a proximal myopathy. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of polymyositis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of polymyositis.
- Describes the appropriate evaluation process for polymyositis.
- Outline the management options for polymyositis.
- Summarize the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the care of patients with polymyositis.
