The anatomical components of the upper extremity receive their vascular supply via the subclavian artery and its branches. The subclavian artery arises from the brachiocephalic arterial trunk on the right side. The brachiocephalic arterial trunk is the first branch of the arch of the aorta. The left subclavian artery arises as a direct branch from the arch of the aorta. The subclavian artery becomes the axillary artery as it passes over the lateral border of the first rib. The axillary artery supplies the shoulder muscles via its six branches: the superior thoracic artery, the thoracoacromial arterial trunk, the lateral thoracic artery, the subscapular artery, and the anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries.

The axillary artery ends at the lower border of the teres major muscle, where it gives rise to the brachial artery. The brachial artery supplies the arm and then divides to form the radial and ulnar arteries, which supply the forearm and hand. The deoxygenated blood of the upper extremity drains via the cephalic, basilic, and brachial veins, which then flow into the subclavian vein and ultimately to the heart. The extracellular fluid is cleared by the lymphatic system. The right upper extremity feeds the right lymphatic duct, and the left upper extremity empties into the thoracic duct.

- Brachium - Latin = arm

- Subclavian - Latin = beneath the clavicle; "little key")

- Brachiocephalic - Latin brachium = arm + cephalic (Latin from Greek = head)
