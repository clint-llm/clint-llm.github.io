Several nerves pass through the foramina, fissures, and canal in the sphenoid bone. The optic canal allows passage to the optic nerve (CN II). The superior orbital fissure transmits the superior and inferior divisions of the oculomotor nerve (CN III), the trochlear nerve (CN IV), the ophthalmic nerve (CN V1), the abducens nerve (CN VI), and the sympathetic fibers from the cavernous plexus. The foramen rotundum contains the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V2). The foramen ovale allows passage to the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3), the motor root of the trigeminal nerve, and the lesser petrosal nerve. The mandibular nerve's meningeal branch passes through the foramen spinosum.
