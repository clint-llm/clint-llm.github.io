Three entities require differentiation from the conjunctival concretion:

- Conjunctival foreign body: if small and buried in the conjunctiva with a part protruding from the conjunctiva the foreign body may mimic a concretion

- Epidermal inclusion cyst: can be congenital or acquired. These are cystic lesions in the subepithelium space but have clear fluid, unlike concretions that are solid and filled with keratin.

- Lymphoid follicle: these are also found in the subepithelial space but are usually diffuse and multiple. Histologically they have central immature lymphocytes and surrounding mature cells.

- Rarely with ophthalmia nodosa: ophthalmia nodosa is a conjunctival or corneal inflammatory response to hair, caterpillar spines, and other foreign bodies. They may also cause multiple linear abrasions on the cornea. However, unlike with concretions, these eyes show more inflammation and a granulomatous reaction around the foreign body. ophthalmia nodosa and termed the disease "caterpillar hair ophthalmia." Wagenmann reported a case in 1890, and mistakenly called it pseudotuberculosis. Saemisch, in 1904, gave the condition the correct name. In the early 20th Century, the condition was termed "nursemaid's disease" because of the frequency with which nursemaids who sat under the trees in Hyde Park as they watched children became afflicted by urticaria and conjunctivitis caused by hairs from the vapourer moth (Orgyn antiqua).
