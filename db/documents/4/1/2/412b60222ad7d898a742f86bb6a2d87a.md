The majority of illnesses caused by enteroviruses are mild and self-limited. The severity of the reported disease is associated with specific strains and with comorbidities and risk factors. Symptoms usually resolve within 7-14 days, with a full recovery. Persistent encephalitis, paralytic poliomyelitis, and severe respiratory illness causing respiratory failure portend the gravest prognoses.
