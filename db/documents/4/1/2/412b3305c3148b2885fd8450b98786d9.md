Personality is the set of established patterns of behavior by which one relates to and understands the world around them. A personality disorder arises when one develops an inflexible and intransigent pattern of maladaptive thinking and behaving, which significantly impairs social or occupational functioning and can cause interpersonal distress.

Histrionic personality disorder, or dramatic personality disorder,  is a psychiatric disorder distinguished by a pattern of exaggerated emotionality and attention-seeking behaviors. Histrionic personality disorder falls within the “Cluster B” of personality disorders.

People with histrionic personality disorder may feel underappreciated or disregarded when they are not the center of attention. These people are typically the life of the party and have a “larger than life” presence.
