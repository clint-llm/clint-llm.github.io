The neural connections to and from the superior colliculus are complex and are still not entirely understood. As stated above, the superior colliculus receives visual information mainly from the retina via the optic nerve and tract, and less so from the visual cortex. The superior colliculus also receives auditory input from the inferior colliculus to coordinate a movement response. Additional somatosensory projections to the deep laminae allow the superior colliculus to respond to tactile stimuli. The superior colliculus also receives inputs from the prefrontal cortex involved in the regulation of attention and distractibility. These efferent fibers leave the internal capsule, follow a pedunculotegmental route to the lower midbrain, and then rise to the caudal superior colliculus. Outward tracts from the superior colliculus have been shown to project to the central gray matter overlying the rostral oculomotor nucleus as well as areas adjacent to the contralateral trochlear nucleus and contralateral abducens nucleus.
