A thorough history and physical examination alone may yield a diagnosis in up to 50% of patients presenting with syncope. History of syncope should focus on duration, preceding events or precipitating events, and post-event findings.  The position of the patient at the time of the event is important. Syncope in a standing position can suggest vasovagal and in a supine position can be due to neurocardiac causes. A detailed history of the patient's medical problems and medications must be included. The physical examination in syncope should center around vital sign abnormalities as these can often suggest underlying disease processes such as orthostatic hypotension or cardiovascular compromise. Detailed cardiovascular and neurologic examinations should be included looking for signs of vascular disease, congestive heart failure, or an acute cerebrovascular event masquerading as syncope.
