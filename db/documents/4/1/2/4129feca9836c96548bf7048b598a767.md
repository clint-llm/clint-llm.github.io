Long-term survival of patients with vasculitis highly depends on the diagnosis, response to therapy, and adverse effects of drugs, including the occurrence of infections. In a study assessing long-term survival in ANCA-associated vasculitis: the 1-, 2- and 5-year survival was 88%, 85%, and 78%, respectively. The mortality ratio was 2.6 compared with the general population.
