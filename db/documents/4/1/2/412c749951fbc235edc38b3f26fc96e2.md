The etiology of cutaneous horns varies as it is a secondary manifestation of a benign, premalignant, or malignant primary disease.

The most common cause of benign cutaneous horns is seborrheic or lichenoid keratoses.

Actinic keratoses are the most common premalignant primary cause of cutaneous horn, while squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common malignant cause.

Although the exact pathogenesis of the cutaneous horn is unknown, it is assumed that cellular aging, photodamage, and subsequent epithelial dysfunction contribute to their manifestation. This is supported by findings of sun exposure and old-age being the most common comorbidities in patients with cutaneous horns.
