- Control should be given to the patient regarding the choice of medications, route of medication and nonpharmacological calming techniques.

- Restraints whether manual, physical, or any other physical restrictions should be the last report in agitated patients.

- Seclusion can be given a trial and works if we have a good rapport with the patients.

- There is no difference in efficacy of first versus second-generation antipsychotics in agitation, but keep in mind the increased side effects when using first-generation antipsychotics vs second-generation antipsychotics

- The term "chemical restraints," is an obsolete term as it implies using harmful chemicals and not medications thatÂ we use on a daily basis. Also restraining using medications is discouraged where possible.

- Agitation resulting from stimulant use/abuse should be treated with benzodiazepines alone.

- If agitation is due to CNS depressants, the use of Haldol and other first-generation antipsychotics have shown greater efficacy than second-generation medications.
