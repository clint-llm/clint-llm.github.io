Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a severe complication that can occur in patients exposed to any form or amount of heparin products. A fall in platelet counts and a hypercoagulable state characterize HIT. Patients who experience HIT may also develop thromboembolic complications that are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This is a significant burden since heparin is widely used for treatment and prophylaxis of thromboembolism, line flushes, and heparin-coated catheters. This activity will review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and highlight the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical presentation of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
- Explain the potential complications of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
- Review the recommended treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
- Summarize the importance of an interprofessional approach to the identification and management of patients who are at risk for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
