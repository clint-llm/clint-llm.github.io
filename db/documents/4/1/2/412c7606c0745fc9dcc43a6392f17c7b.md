Given the wide array of toxins used as rodenticides, symptoms will vary depending on the toxin ingested. Rodenticides are often categorized on their label regarding toxicity.

- "Danger" or highly toxic rodenticides include thallium, sodium monofluoroacetate (fluoroacetate), strychnine, zinc phosphide, aluminum phosphide, elemental phosphorus, arsenic, and barium carbonate. Rarely used or banned dangerous toxins are tetramethylene disulfotetramine (TETS, tetramine), aldicarb, alpha-chloralose, and pyrinuron.

- "Warning" or toxic rodenticides include alpha-naphthyl thiourea (ANTU) and cholecalciferol.

- "Caution" or less toxic rodenticides include anticoagulants (superwarfarins, warfarin), norbormide, bromethalin, and red squill.
