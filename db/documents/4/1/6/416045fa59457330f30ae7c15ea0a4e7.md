**Baseline Monitoring**

- Routine blood tests: complete blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, and inflammatory markers (CRP/ESR)

- Varicella antibody status should be clarified, and vaccination considered in appropriate patients

- Screening for tuberculosis should be done with a chest X-ray and interferon-gamma release assay

- Hepatitis B, C, and HIV

- Pregnancy testing should be performed in female patients where pregnancy is a possibility

**Ongoing Monitoring**

- The patients must be monitored clinically for the development of severe infections, including TB, jaundice, malignancy, non-infectious pneumonia, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, or serious skin conditions such as exfoliative dermatitis or erythrodermic psoriasis. Patients additionally should be encouraged to report any concerning symptoms.

- Routine blood tests, including full blood count, urea, electrolytes, liver function tests, and inflammatory markers (CRP/ESR), should be checked approximately every 4 to 6 months.

- Clinical monitoring for efficacy should be carried out using disease-specific measuring systems for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease.

- Re-testing for hepatitis and HIV can be considered if clinically indicated.

- There are experimental data to suggest that monitoring serum drug levels may be beneficial during ustekinumab treatment, but this is not the current standard of care.
