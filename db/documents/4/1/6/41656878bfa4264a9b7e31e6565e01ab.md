**Nonfluent/agrammatic variant of PPA (nvfPPA)**

NfvPPA is most commonly associated with a form of FTD-4R tau.

The nfvPPA is the most variable of the PPAs and lacks clinicopathologic associations.

**Semantic Variant of PPA (svPPA)**

SvPPA is nearly always associated with underlying TDP-43-C pathological aggregates (75–100% in clinicopathological correlation series), and for the remainder of patients, most often with FTD tau.

**Lopogenic variant of PPA (lvPPA)**

LvPPA is most often caused by AD pathology in as many as 95% of cases.
