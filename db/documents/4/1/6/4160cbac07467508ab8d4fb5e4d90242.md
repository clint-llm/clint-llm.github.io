The natural history of ONSM is characterized by slowly painless and progressive visual loss in the affected eye. If left untreated, this tumor can lead to complete blindness. Visual loss, optic atrophy, and optociliary shunt vessels is the classic triad in patients with an ONSM but most patients do not present the three components.

In the early stages, patients can present with chronic optic nerve edema. This occurs because the tumor compresses the intraorbital portion of the optic nerve. Eventually, the edema subsides, and optic pallor develops. Optociliary shunt vessels can develop in about 30% of patients as the optic disc edema resolves. These represent venous collaterals that are connected to the choroidal circulation. They appear after chronic central retinal vein obstruction, such as in ONSM, but can also be found in other conditions such as central retinal vein occlusion, optic nerve glioma, and sphenoid wing meningioma. When vision is affected, there is a relative afferent pupillary deficit in the involved eye. Visual field defects can be present in the affected eye and are not specific; these can be seen as altitudinal defects, generalized constriction, or enlarged blind spots.
