The results from most of these tests can, in most cases, be communicated immediately to the patient. One of the main indications for the tests for potential vision is to manage patient expectations regarding the visualÂ outcome of surgery. It is important to ensure that the patients understand the results of these tests as they are indicative of the outcome of the surgery. This makes tests for potential vision a very important tool in patient safety and education. It is also important to explain the procedure as patient cooperation will affect the result of most of them.
