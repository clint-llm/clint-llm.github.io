Otosclerosis is a disease of the bony structures in the middle and inner ear, most prominent involving the stapes but also the promontory. This condition leads to characteristic conductive and/or sensorineural hearing loss. Differentiating between stapedial and inner ear involvement is crucial in determining the choice of treatment. A stapedectomy is therefore only an option in cases with fixation of the stapes, and there is no known treatment for symptom improvement in cochlear or sensorineural otosclerosis

The Schwartze sign is a characteristically reddish discoloration of the promontory seen during an otoscopic examination. This discoloration is the result of the increased blood flow to the promontory due to the characteristic otosclerotic lesion. Observation of the phenomenon occurs in up to 10% of patients with otosclerosis.

Patients with a positive Schwartze sign may be more likely to have sensorineural (cochlear) otosclerosis.
