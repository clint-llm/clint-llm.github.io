The management of patellofemoral arthritis is by an interprofessional team that includes an orthopedic surgeon, physical therapist, rheumatologist, internist, and physiatrist; the reason is that there are many causes for this disorder and there is no one treatment that works consistently for all patients. For the majority of patients, the treatment is conservative and non-surgical.

Physical therapy is a mainstay for treatment and can alleviate patellofemoral pain by strengthening the quadriceps femoris complex, most often the vastus medialis, as well as stretching the lateral patellar retinaculum.

Analgesics, preferably non-opiates such as NSAIDs and acetaminophen, can be used to help treat pain. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate may reduce or decrease the degree of knee pain. Intra-articular injections can also reduce pain symptoms. Corticosteroid injections are generally first-line therapy with the most robust evidence supporting their use. Viscosupplementation is an alternative option for some patients, but the evidence is mixed as far as efficacy. Platelet-rich plasma and other regenerative medicine modalities may have a role in treating patellofemoral osteoarthritis although the evidence is mixed with these options as well and more research is generally required.

When these modalities fail to work, the patient should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon for more definitive care.
