Lung cancer should always be considered in a smoker or former smoker who presents with new onset cough or hemoptysis. It is important to compare new imaging with prior imaging, noting any changes. Patient’s suspected of having lung cancer will undergo an extensive imaging workup and biopsy for diagnosis with most patients being diagnosed based on small biopsy and cytology specimens.

Initial imaging workup includes plain film radiography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and upper abdomen, brain MRI and PET/CT.

Laboratory studies ordered to evaluate for the presence of neoplastic syndromes include complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, and creatinine.

The method of attaining tissue depends on tumor location. A biopsy is typically obtained via CT-guided biopsy or transbronchial.
