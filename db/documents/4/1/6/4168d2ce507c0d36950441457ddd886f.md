Rebound pain is possible since the analgesia provided by bupivacaine typically lasts around six hours. Local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) is a potential complication of regional anesthesia. For this reason, dilute anesthetic is used, and a maximum dose of 2 mg/kg of bupivacaine is the recommendation.
