The treatment of Blount's disease depends upon the age of the child and the severity of the deformity.

**Brace**

Bracing used generally extended from the upper thigh to the foot and applied valgus force to the knee. Commonly, KAFO is used. Orthotic treatment may be useful when started before three years of age in non-obese children who wear the brace chiefly at night. The treatment should be continued for one year. However, even with orthotic treatment, osteotomyÂ must be performed before four years of age when indicated. The available level of evidence is not sufficient to support the efficacy of orthotic treatment. An important limitation of this treatment is that braces are complicated to impose on boisterous obese children younger than three years of age.

**Graded Growth**

Hemiepiphysiodesis of the lateral epiphysis with staples, pin, tension band plating is commonly used procedures. A minimum of 4 years of growth should be there to make this procedure successful. According to the Hueter-Volkmann principle, compression inhibits longitudinal growth. This forms the basis of this type of treatment modality.

**Osteotomy**

Re-alignment osteotomy is usually performed before four years of age in patients with documented and progressive Blount disease (FDF stage 1) who exhibit risk factors.

There are also a variety of fixation devices, including cast, pins and wires, screws, plates, and screws. Along with varus distal fragment is fixed in translation and external rotation to correct external rotation deformity. Other associated surgical procedures such as bar resection and medial plateau elevation should be done in the same sitting along with osteotomy. If the bar is more than 50% area, hemiepiphysiodesis should be done. The level of osteotomy should be below tibial tuberosity to avoid patella Baja leading to extensor insufficiency and knee pain. Any child more than three years irrespective of the stage, stage III patients irrespective of age are ideal candidates of osteotomy.in adolescent variant, and the osteotomy is the only available treatment.

Post-operatively, the patient should be limited weight-bearing with use of crutches for 6-8 weeks. The pros of this approach are that this results in an immediate correction, with cons that there is potential for neurologic injury due to acute lengthening and potential for the development of compartment syndrome. Another common technique is the osteotomy with external fixation and gradual correction. First, an osteotomy is performed, with the connection of the frame that allows for progressive correction. The Taylor Spatial Frame or Ilizarov ring external fixator is commonly used. Post-operatively, 12 to 18 weeks of treatment are needed. The pros of this approach are that this enables gradual correction, which limits the risk of neurovascular compromise and the risk of compartment syndrome with the high tibial osteotomy approach. Furthermore, it allows for the correction of deformity in all planes. Limitations of the method are pin site infection, which may develop as well as the duration of treatment is prolonged.
