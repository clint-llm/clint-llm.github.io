Around 15 to 20% of all adult males will have a varicocele, and up to 40% percent of men who are evaluated for infertility will also have it.

There appears to be a significant delay in the male evaluation in infertile couples for possible varicoceles.  18% of men referred to one academic center after various costly assisted reproductive procedures, were ultimately found to qualify for a simple varicocelectomy. The female partner had no identifiable fertility findings in 70% of these couples.
