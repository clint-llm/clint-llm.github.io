The prognosis of seat belt injuries depends largelyÂ on which type of injury is involved.

- Damage to the mesentery or bowel can cause severe morbidity, especially if not detected early. However, with timely operative intervention, most patients will recover with no sequelae.

- Fractures of the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine will have prognostic features dependent upon the severity of bony disruption and the neurologic deficits present.

- For vascular injuries, again timely diagnosis is key. However, some carotid or vertebral injuries, even if diagnosed early, can lead to irreversible neurologic disability.
