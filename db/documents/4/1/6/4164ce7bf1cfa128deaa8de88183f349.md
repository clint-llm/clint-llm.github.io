The recipient and donor sites can be approached simultaneously by two surgical teams to decrease operative time and related complications.

**Recipient Site**

Actions at the recipient site depend on the indication for grafting and the nature of the defect. Oncologic resection and lymph node dissection, as well as frozen section clearance, may be required, or work may be limited to simple debridement. Proximally and distally, the periosteum is ideally preserved to aid healing and bony union. The length of the defect should be measured after recipient site work is complete in order to inform the graft harvest team's efforts. If vascularized tissue transfer is planned, the recipient site team will also need to identify and isolate appropriate caliber vessels to support the flap.

**Donor Site**

Harvesting of the fibular graft is often performed through the anterolateral approach described by Gilbert.

**Graft Placement**

The graft may be fixated into the defect in an end-to-end fashion if the thickness of the fibular segment and the recipient site roughly match; however, when the defect is broader than the fibula's caliber, a "double-barrel" technique may be appropriate, for example in femoral or tibial defects. In these cases, the fibula is divided, keeping the periosteum intact to the greatest extent possible to preserve blood flow, and then folded upon itself to effectively double its breadth. The graft is otherwise trimmed to fit the recipient site and fixated into the defect as necessary. Fixation is generally accomplished with a small plate and screw constructs, Rush rods, or K-wires. For vascularized fibular graft transfer, arterial anastomosis is performed with 8-0 or 9-0 nylon on a tapered needle, generally under an operating microscope. Incorporating a skin flap, supplied by the peroneal artery, is useful not only for composite reconstruction of bone and soft-tissue defects but also to facilitate postoperative monitoring of the flap's viability. Distal tibiofibular fusion is generally performed as described by Langenskiöld to prevent a postoperative valgus deformity of the ankle.

**Postoperative Care**

Patients should be given low-molecular-weight heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis and aspirin for two weeks. In the case of osteocutaneous grafts, the flaps are monitored by visual inspection of the cutaneous paddle and by Doppler ultrasound. When a skin graft is required to cover the donor site, the patient wears a posterior splint and should remain on non-weight-bearing status for at least 48 to 72 hours postoperatively. After this, a walking boot will help avoid plantar or dorsiflexion of the ankle, thereby preventing shearing of the skin graft from the leg before it has completely healed. At this point, the patient is allowed to bear weight progressively as tolerated.
