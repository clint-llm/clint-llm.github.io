Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is the administration of 100% oxygen at pressures greater than one-atmosphere absolute pressure (1 ATA) for a therapeutic purpose. HBOT thus involves a patient being confined within an airtight vessel, compressed to pressures above ambient, and breathing 100 percent oxygen. HBOT can cause vision changes and lead to the development of cataracts. This activity describes the potential for cataract development after HBOT and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the prevention of hyperbaric oxygen therapy-induced eye damage.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of cataract development following hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
- Describe ocular changes found in patients that develop cataracts after hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
- List the treatment and management options available for eye changes after hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the prevention of cataracts following hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
