Spongiform pustulation can also present in pustular psoriasis, subcorneal pustulosis, acute generalized subcorneal pustulosis conditions. Hence, special stains should be used to exclude fungal etiology in psoriasis.

Impetigo also shows spongiform pustulation. Bacterial colonies in impetigo may be seen by using Gram stain, which GMS and PAS stains will not stain fungal forms.

Spongiform pustulation is a characteristic of tinea cruris and corporis. Special stains reveal septate hyphae without the budding yeasts of candida. The distinction can occasionally be challenging. Candida usually infiltrates the keratinized epithelium, whereas dermatophytosis usually involves only the stratum corneum.

The correct diagnosis of laryngeal candidiasis is difficult for the otolaryngologist, and a high level of suspicion is in order. This condition should also be part of the differential diagnosis in patients with predisposing factors presenting with suspected lesions.
