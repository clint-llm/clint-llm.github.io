Eosinophils are a kind of blood granulocytes that express cytoplasmic granules that contain basic proteins and bind with acidic dyes like "eosin." They derive from bone marrow, and their production is stimulated by IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF. They have a circulating half-life of 4.5 to 8 hours. They can reside in tissues, mostly in the respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract, for 8 to 12 days. Eosinophils are less than 5% of circulating leukocytes. Eosinophilia is defined as an increase of circulating eosinophils >500 /mm^3. Based on the counts, eosinophilia can be divided into different categories: mild (500 to 1500/mm^3), moderate (1500 to 5000/mm^3), and severe (> 5000/mm^3). Hypereosinophilic syndrome is defined as an absolute eosinophil count greater than 1500/mm^3 on two occasions at least one month apart or marked tissue eosinophilia. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of eosinophilia.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the possible etiologies for developing eosinophilia.
- Review the steps in the evaluation of eosinophilia.
- Summarize management options available for eosinophilia based on specific etiology.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes.
