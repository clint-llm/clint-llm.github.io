EN is the result of a nonspecific cutaneous reaction to various antigens. The mechanism involved would be immunologically mediated. Numerous direct and indirect evidence supports the notion of type IV delayed hypersensitivity response to many antigens. ItÂ is postulated that the pathogenesis may be due to the deposition of immune complexes in the venules of subcutaneous fat, the production of oxygen free radicals, TNF-alpha, and granuloma formation. However, this hypothesis is not accepted by all authors.
