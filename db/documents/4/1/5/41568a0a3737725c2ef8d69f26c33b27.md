Patients most often presenting with rodenticideÂ toxicity are children with oral ingestion. The most common rodenticide used in the United States is a long-acting anticoagulant. The presenting symptoms include hematuria, hemoptysis, epistaxis, flank pain, easy bruising, or petechiae under the blood pressure cuff.

- Danger (very toxic): LD50 is 0-50 mg/kg

- Warning (toxic): LD50 is 50-500 mg/kg

- Caution (less toxic): LD50 is 500-5000 mg/kg

Physical findings in patients with rodenticide toxicity are categorized as follows:

- Neurologic toxicity

- Seizures: SMFA, fluoroacetamide, arsenic, tetramine
- Cranial neuropathy, coma: arsenic, thallium, bromethalin, pyriminil, alpha-chloralose

- Musculoskeletal toxicity, including muscle rigidity, facial grimacing, trismus

- Strychnine

- Cardiovascular toxicity, including arrhythmias, refractory shock, cardiac arrest

- Zinc or aluminum phosphide, white phosphorus, barium carbonate, arsenic, thallium, sodium monofluoroacetate, fluoroacetamide
