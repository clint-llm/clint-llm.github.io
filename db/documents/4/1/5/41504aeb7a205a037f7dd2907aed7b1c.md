Oral candidiasis can occur in immunocompetent or immunocompromised patients but is more common in immunocompromised hosts. More than 90% of patients with HIV develop oral candidiasis at some point during the duration of the disease.

Oral candidiasis occurs equally in males and females.Â It typically occurs in neonates and infants; it is rare in the first week of life. It is most common during the fourth week of life and less common in infants older than six months, likely secondary to the development of host immunity. Signs and symptoms of immunosuppression in these patients are diarrhea, rashes, repeated infections, and hepatosplenomegaly.
