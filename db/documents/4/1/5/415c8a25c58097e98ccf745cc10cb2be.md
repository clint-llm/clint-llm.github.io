Initial evaluation starts with a chest radiograph to rule out other pathologies. Visualization of a tracheal mass or narrowing was noted in only a minority of cases at presentation.

After the initial evaluation by imaging, bronchoscopy evaluation provides the opportunity for direct visualization of the mass and obtaining tissue biopsy for diagnosis. This is essential to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. Endobronchial ultrasound allows for a better evaluation of the extent of wall invasion and enables the detection of paratracheal tumors invading the trachea; hence aids in the decision-making when assessing the resectability of the tumor.

Spirometry can further provide information pertaining to the type of tracheal obstruction based on the flow volume loops. The characteristic flow volume loop patterns of large airway obstruction include fixed, intrathoracic, and variable extrathoracic patterns.
