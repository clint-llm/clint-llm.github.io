Allergic rhinitis is largely a clinical diagnosis made based on a thorough history and physical. A positive response to empiric treatment with a nasal glucocorticoid can help clinch the diagnosis. A formal diagnosis is possible with either serum testing for allergen-specific IgE or allergy skin testing.

Radiographic imaging is not routinely recommended for the diagnosis of ARÂ and is mostly used to rule out other conditions such as rhinosinusitis.
