VEP application requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including nurses, neurophysiopathology technicians, neurologists, and ophthalmologists. This team is fundamental for correctly applying this tool both in the clinical field and in intraoperative surgical monitoring. VEPs are regularly used in diagnosing pre-chiasmatic, chiasmatic, and retrochiasmatic neurological pathologies.

In this scenario, the neurophysiopathology technician provides for the preparation and control of the instrumentation of the equipment it is equipped with and fully manages to collect and optimize the various diagnostic methods on which, upon request, it must draw up a descriptive report from the technical aspect.

Recent studies have applied VEPs in orbital and transsphenoidal surgery but without standardized protocols and homogeneous results.

An interprofessional team that provides an integrated approach to patient care and comprehensive diagnostic management can help achieve the best possible outcomes. Collaboration, multidisciplinary shared decision-making, and open communication between team members are key elements for a proper diagnosis and a good outcome. The interprofessional care provided to the patient must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to planning and evaluating all joint activities.
