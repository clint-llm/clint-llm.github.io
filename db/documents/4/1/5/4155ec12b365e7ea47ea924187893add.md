The abdominopelvic splanchnic nerves, which form the sympathetic aspect, consists of three branches. The first is the lower thoracic splanchnic nerves that contain greater, lesser, and least branches, which originate from the thoracic division of the sympathetic trunks, and the second one is the lumbar splanchnic nerves that arise from the lumbar division of the sympathetic trunks. The third one is the sacral splanchnic nerves. In comparison, the parasympathetic part consists of the pelvic splanchnic nerves.

**The Lower Thoracic Splanchnic Nerves:**

**Structure:**

These nerves are long, and they divide into the greater, lesser, least splanchnic nerves. The greater splanchnic nerves hold branches from T5-T9 thoracic sympathetic ganglia, while the lesser splanchnic nerves emerge from T10-T11 thoracic sympathetic ganglia. The least splanchnic nerve arises from branches of T12.

The greater splanchnic nerve passes through the diaphragm by aortic hiatus and ends in the superior preaortic ganglia. The postsynaptic fibers then run toward the organs of the foregut, which is the celiac plexus.

**Function**

The greater splanchnic nerve plays a significant role in the inhibitory effects of the foregut. It leads to inhibition of the secretions and motility of the distal esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Additionally, the greater splanchnic nerve causes inhibition of the bile emptying beside the inhibition of the contraction of the gallbladder smooth muscle, which leads to inhibits the pancreas to secrete their enzymes that stimulate glucagon release which leads to the inhibition of the insulin release. Also, this nerve plays a role in the stimulation of glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glucose release. Eventually, this nerve innervates the capsule of the spleen, which is responsible for splenic pain.

**The Lumbar Splanchnic Nerve:**

**Structure:**

This nerve also consists of paired nerves on each side of the human body that originates from the sympathetic branches of the L1 and L2 nerve roots.

**Function:**

The postganglionic sympathetic fibers vasoconstrict blood vessels, innervate and cause secretions from sweat glands, and contraction of the arrector pili muscles. The never fibers that supply the blood vessels of skeletal muscle cause vasodilatation. Eventually, the fibers that reach the viscera regulate glandular secretions, allow for general vasoconstriction, and inhibit smooth muscle contraction of the gastrointestinal system.

The postganglionic sympathetic fibers control the secretions from the sweat glands also give motor to arrector pili muscle by vasoconstrictor blood vessels, while the fibers that enter the skeletal muscle provide motor nerves by vasodilators.

**The****Sacral Splanchnic Nerve:**

**Structure:**

The sacral splanchnic nerves are paired nerves that run on each side of the human body. These two parallel nerves form the inferior hypogastric plexus to join with the sacral part of the sympathetic trunk.

**Function:**

The sacral splanchnic nerve gives both sensory and motor to the posterior aspect of the leg, foot, and the muscle and the skin of the pelvis. The main branches of this splanchnic nerve join and form parts of the superior, inferior gluteal, posterior cutaneous, sciatic, and finally, the pudendal nerves.

**The Pelvic Splanchnic Nerves:**

**Structure:**

The PSNs join the inferior hypogastric plexus (IHP) at the lower medial edge of the coccygeus muscle.

**Function:**

These nerves are responsible for the parasympathetic activity and nociception of the bladder, left colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum, and are at risk during any radical pelvic surgery.
