The emergency department assessment begins with rapid assessment and stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation, in addition to finger-stick glucose, oxygen saturation, and core temperature. Re-warming for hypothermia, dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia, in addition to intravenous crystalloid volume replacement may be necessary.Â  In rare cases, a bicarbonate drip may be indicated, or vasopressor support. Some severe cases have required transfusion of fresh frozen plasma or packed red blood cells. In patients who develop severe hepatotoxicity, consultation with gastroenterology is necessary for consideration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) therapy and possible liver transplant. While the flushing can be alarming to the patient, it is self-limiting and does not require medication, although it would be responsive to the anti-prostaglandin properties of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ketorolac. Nevertheless, in most cases, discontinuation of the niacin product, along with reassurance and follow-up, will be the only treatment indicated.
