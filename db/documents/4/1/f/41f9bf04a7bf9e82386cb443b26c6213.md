The prevalence of PEX increases markedly with age. It is estimated that up to 20% of the over-60 population may be affected.

Risk Factors include:****

- Age (strongest risk factor; PEX rarely occurs below the age of 50, with an incidence increasing with age).

- Race (Nordic and Eastern Mediterranean populations have increased risk).

- high altitude and/or solar/cosmic radiation.

- Female sex (possible risk factor with more recent studies showing equal prevalence in males and females). Studies reporting on association with gender have produced conflicting results, and so the link remains unclear.

- Low consumption of dietary anti-oxidants, smoking, caffeine, alcohol, and factors that favor oxidative stress

The diagnosis of secondary glaucoma or PEG is reached when PEX is associated with elevated and fluctuating IOP levels, in addition to functional alterations in computerized perimetry and/or defects in the optic nerve and retinal nerve fiber layer. PEG accounts for 25 % of individuals with open-angle glaucoma worldwide, in which PEX shows a cumulative probability to develop in PEG in 15% of cases within 10 years.
