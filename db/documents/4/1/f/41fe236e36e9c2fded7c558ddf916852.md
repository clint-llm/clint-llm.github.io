First-degree AV block is almost universally without associated symptoms. Patients will frequently be unaware of the condition until it appears on routine electrocardiography. Upon recognition of the PR interval prolongation, a thorough history should be obtained, with a specific focus on any history of congenital or acquired heart disease, risk factors for heart disease, family history of cardiac disease, the presence ofÂ neuromuscular disease, or family history of neuromuscular disease. In higher-grade first-degree block (PR interval greater than 0.30 seconds), patients may develop symptoms similar to pacemaker syndrome: dyspnea, malaise, lightheadedness, chest pain, or even syncope due to poor synchronization of atrial and ventricular contractions.
