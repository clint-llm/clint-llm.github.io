Cholangiocarcinoma is a recognized complication of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis. One retrospective study from Hong-Kong sought to explore whether a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma on a background of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis carried a worse prognostic outcome than cholangiocarcinoma without associated recurrent pyogenic cholangitis.

Propensity score matching was used to compare post-hepatectomy outcomes in cholangiocarcinoma patients with and without a diagnosis of pyogenic cholangitis (n=143). It was found that aÂ history of pyogenic cholangitis carried a significantly worse outcome for both disease-free survival and overall survival in this patient group.
