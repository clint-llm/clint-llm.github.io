The management of intracranial hypertension is with an interprofessional team consisting of a neurologist, neurosurgeon, intensivist, ICU nurses, internist, and pulmonologist. Treatment of chronic intracranial hypertension is mainly focused on treating and reversing the etiology. These patients need ICU admission and continuous monitoring. In addition, the patients  should have close monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, ventilation and oxygenation, blood glucose, input and output, and ECG. Patients with suspected intracranial hypertension, especially with severe traumatic brain injury, should also have ICP monitoring. In patients in whom the intracranial pressure is short-lived and treated promptly, the prognosis is good but in those patients with delay in treatment or a malignant cause, the prognosis is abysmal. even those who survive develop permanent neurological deficits.
