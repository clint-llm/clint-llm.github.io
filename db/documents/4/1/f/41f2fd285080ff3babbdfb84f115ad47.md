The exact etiology behind the development of CNH remains unclear. Most authors believe it is caused by chronic and excessive pressure on the pinna. Consistently sleeping on the same side seems to contribute to the condition. Other causes of pressure include the continuous and prolonged use of hearing aids, headphones, and other headgear. CNH may also be associated with autoimmune and connective tissue disorders, especially in young female patients. Anatomical features like a protruding helix or antihelix have also been considered potential contributing factors. Additional predisposing conditions include repeated trauma, solar damage, and exposure to cold weather.

Additionally, certain unique anatomical features make the pinna vulnerable to the development of CNH. These include minimal subcutaneous tissue and a limited blood supply. The auricular cartilage is at risk for damage due to pressure and cold as a result of the thinness of its skin and subcutaneous tissue. The nature of the auricle as an appendage on the side of the head also limits its vascularity, which further compounds the problem by causing a delay in the healing process and enhancing the chances of ischemia.
