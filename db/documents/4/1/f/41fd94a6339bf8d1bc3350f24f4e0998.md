As noted above, therapeutic communication has shown multiple clinical benefits in the literature. Indeed, therapeutic communication has demonstrated improved patient satisfaction, among other noted benefits. Patient satisfaction as a concept is a complex and subjective concept, but it has contributed to improved medical outcomes. The mechanism by which therapeutic communication improves patient satisfaction is thought to occur by fulfilling the patient’s expectations and values for the encounter. In turn, this fosters maintenance of the patient-provider relationship.

Each healthcare team member plays a vital role in therapeutic communication with the patient. Each team member gathers information from and subsequently communicates information to the patient in various contexts. This can be illustrated through a sample inpatient medical-surgical admission, where it is estimated that patients may see nearly 18 different healthcare providers through the course of the admission.

The American Nurses Association released guidelines in 2014 regarding psychiatric-mental health nursing and the importance of therapeutic communication as a standard of practice.

Pharmacists also play an important role in therapeutic communication with patients and providers.

Effective interprofessional communication is also considered critical in improving patient safety and improving outcomes. IPEC, in collaboration with the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, American Dental Education Association, Association of American Medical Colleges, and the Association of Schools of Public Health, developed expert consensus guidelines on interprofessional collaborative practice.
