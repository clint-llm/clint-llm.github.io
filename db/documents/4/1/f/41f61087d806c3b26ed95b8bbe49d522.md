Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve has the potential to cause unilateral vocal cord paralysis. Patients with this typically complain of new-onset hoarseness, changes in vocal pitch, or noisy breathing. Bilateral vocal cord paralysis is much less common due to both left and right recurrent laryngeal nerves being affected but can present with more serious symptoms, including significant difficulties breathing and swallowing. Recent surgeries of the head/neck or recent intubation should prompt suspicion of possible injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Signs of underlying malignancy should also be investigated, such as hemoptysis, severe coughing, unexplained weight loss, tobacco/alcohol use, or dysphagia. Less common causes, including recent viral illness or neck trauma, may also point towards an underlying RLN injury.

Physical examination of the head and neck may show lymphadenopathy secondary to underlying malignancy. Examination of the thyroid may also show thyroid nodules or irregularities, prompting further investigation for malignancy as a cause. Unilaterally decreased breath sounds in the lung apex may also point towards a tumor of the pulmonary apex, also known as a Pancoast tumor. In this case, clinical symptoms of Horner syndrome, thoracic outlet syndrome, or superior vena cava syndrome may also be seen on examination.
