The ophthalmic artery (OA) is the major artery perfusing the optic nerve and is the first branch of the internal carotid artery (ICA). The OA branches from the ICA just distal to the cavernous sinus and passes through the optic canal. Within the optic canal, the OA courses inferior and lateral to the optic nerve. Numerous branches arise from the OA, but theÂ 2 primary branches are the central retinal artery (CRA) and posterior ciliary arteries (PCAs). The CRA is the first branch of the OA, running within the dura mater of the optic nerve. The CRA then pierces the optic nerve at around 12 mm posterior to the globe and courses anteriorly to perfuse the inner layers of the retina. Several PCAs arise from the OA. The PCAs course anteriorly and penetrate the sclera to perfuse the optic nerve and posterior uveal tract.
