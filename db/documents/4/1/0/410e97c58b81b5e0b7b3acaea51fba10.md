Severe protein C deficiency resulting from congenital homozygous mutations presents in neonates soon after birth and characteristically presents as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and purpura fulminans (PF). Affected individuals experience recurrent episodes of PF, which may be triggered by infection, trauma, or surgery.

Patients with moderately severe protein C deficiency may not present until adolescence and often experience recurrent venous thrombotic events (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary emboli (PE), parenchymal thrombi and a tendency for DIC.

Individuals with heterozygous protein C deficiency and mild deficiency in protein C activity can range in symptom severity from asymptomatic to experiencing recurrent thromboses leading to post-thrombotic syndrome. In addition to DVT and PE, these patients may develop sequelae including ischemic arterial stroke and pregnancy-associated thrombosis.
