Induction of anesthesia is a crucial time when a patient is given sedation medications that decrease respiratory drive. After induction of anesthesia, the proceduralist must be able to ventilate the patient either through a mask or by placing an advanced airway (ETT or LMA) to maintain oxygenation and ventilation. While the overall majority of patients are relatively easy to mask, ventilate and intubate, about 1 to 5% of patients are difficult to mask, ventilate, and 5% of patients are difficult to intubate.

According to the ASA Practice Guidelines, difficult mask ventilation is the inability to ventilate (as confirmed by end-tidal carbon dioxide). Difficult intubation requires multiple attempts or if tracheal intubation fails after multiple attempts.

According to one closed claim analysis, 67% of difficult airway claims arose during the induction of anesthesia. Therefore the ability to predict and prepare for a patient who will be difficult to mask, ventilate or intubate can help avoid these adverse outcomes.
