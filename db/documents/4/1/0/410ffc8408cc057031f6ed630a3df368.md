Laryngeal complaints similar to LPR manifestations have myriad etiologies. Most commonly, LPR may be misdiagnosed as GERD, although the consistent presence of hoarseness in LPR and absence in GERD is helpful for differentiating the two clinical entities. Other causes of chronic cough and globus sensation include post-nasal drip (which may be caused by allergies, LPR, rhinosinusitis, or vasomotor rhinitis), viral or autoimmune laryngitis, esophageal dysmotility, myasthenia gravis or other neurological disorders, vagal nerve injury, functional voice disorders, and tumors of the larynx, pharynx, or esophagus.
