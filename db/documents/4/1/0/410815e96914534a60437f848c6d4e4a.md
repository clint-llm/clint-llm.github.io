Single ventricle lesions include various congenital cardiac lesions with heterogenicity in anatomy and physiology. They present to the operating room for various emergent and elective cardiac or non-cardiac surgeries. With the development in cardiology, imaging modalities, anesthesia, surgical techniques, and intensive care services, around 70% of infants born with a single ventricle are expected to live into adulthood.

Understanding the complex anatomy of conduits and physiology of the lesion is fundamental for standard care of these patients—the management centers on maintaining balanced circulation, myocardial function, and adequate systemic oxygen delivery. Close coordination and communication among cardiologists, surgeons, anesthesiologists, critical care physicians, respiratory therapists, and nursing professionals, working cohesively as an interprofessional team, are instrumental for better outcomes in patients with single ventricle physiology.
