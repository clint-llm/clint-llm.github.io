Erlotinib is a medication used to manage and treat some types of non-small cell lung cancer and advanced pancreatic cancer. It is in the tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor class of medications. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, and contraindications for erlotinib as an agent in the management of certain types of lung and pancreatic cancer. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the healthcare team in the management of patients treated with erlotinib.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the approved uses of erlotinib. 
- Describe the potential adverse effects of erlotinib. 
- Review the pathophysiology behind EGFR mutation in cancer noting risk factors for this mutation and monitoring for developed resistance to anti-EGFR therapies. 
- Summarize some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of patients being treated with erlotinib and improve outcomes.
