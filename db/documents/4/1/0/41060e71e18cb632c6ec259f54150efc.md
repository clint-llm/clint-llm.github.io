As mentioned above, the most common differential diagnosis includes borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, and even primary psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders. As mentioned, patients with DID often present with symptoms of dissociation and amnesia, which are also seen in patients with borderline personality disorder. Often patients' symptoms are considered symptoms of psychosis as alters as mistaken as hallucinations and which often precipitate the use of antipsychotic medications. Given that trauma is a focus, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is also a differential diagnosis.

The most common differential diagnosis is borderline personality disorder.
