Conductive hearing loss results from impaired transmission of sound from the external auditory canal across the middle ear structures to the cochlea of the inner ear. Â A variety of disorders can affect the sound transmission pathway at the level of the ear canal, tympanic membrane, and ossicles prior to reaching the hearing organ. This discussion will focus on surgical correction for the restoration of ossicular continuity known as ossiculoplasty.

Causes of conductive hearing loss secondary to ossicular disorders include trauma, cholesteatoma, chronic infection and inflammation, congenital abnormalities and malformations, neoplasms, and idiopathic.

Ossiculoplasty has continued to evolve, employing a variety of techniques, materials, and prostheses with their advantages and limitations.
