Archer et al. classified retinal arteriovenous malformations into 3 groups:

- Group 1 consists of retinal AVM consisting of a major artery and vein with an abnormal capillary network. These are small arteriole-venule anastomoses which can be subtle and difficult to detect clinically. These are stationary and rarely cause visual symptoms.

- Group 2 consists of retinal AVM between an artery and vein without a capillary network with the marked hyperdynamic flow in between the AVM. Vision may be affected if macular edema or hemorrhage resulting from the breakdown of blood-retinal barrier or venous thrombosis.

- Group 3 consists of markedly convoluted, dilated, tortuous retinal vessels without a capillary network in between and presence of retinal disorganization. It can be nearly impossible to separate arteries from veins. These eyes usually have severe vision loss and more likely to have intracranial malformations. These patients are usually diagnosed in childhood, and they have a higher risk of systemic vascular involvement.
