The seventh to eleventh intercostal (T7-T11) and subcostal (T12) nerves travel with the corresponding posterior intercostal arteries and veins to form intercostal neurovascular bundles in the relevant intercostal spaces.

The structures of the anterolateral abdominal wall receive arterial supply from the superior and inferior epigastric, superficial epigastric, musculophrenic, posterior intercostal, and anterior intercostal arteries.

Venous drainage of the anterolateral abdominal wall consists of a large venous plexus that drains into the superior epigastric, internal thoracic, and lateral thoracic veins superiorly and the inferior and superficial epigastric veins inferiorly.
