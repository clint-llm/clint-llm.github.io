The exact origin of the tissue, which gives rise to the serratus anterior, is uncertain. In the 9 mm embryo, the serratus anterior begins to differentiate from the mesenchyme locatedÂ at the ventral ends of the lower cervical myotomes. At this point, the pre-muscle mass is a continuous column with no defined attachments to the vertebrae or ribs over which it extends. In the 11 mm embryo, the muscle mass that will become the serratus anterior is a well-defined muscular column from the cervical region to the thorax. The thoracic portion, which eventually differentiates into the future serratus anterior muscle, gradually becomes more slender in the caudal region and forms distinct digitations to the upper nine ribs. At this stage, while attachments to the cervical vertebrae have formed, the serratus anterior has not attached itself to the scapula. In the 14 mm embryo, the serratus anterior begins to resemble the adult form, differentiating into a broad and flat muscle that attaches to the scapula.
