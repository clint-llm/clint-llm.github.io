The prognosis of sideroblastic anemia differs depending on the underlying cause. In secondary acquired sideroblastic anemia, the prognosis is good once the drugs or toxins involved are discontinued. In X-linked sideroblastic anemia, proper pyridoxine replacement and iron overload management will improve the prognosis. However, if not well managed, the prognosis may be poor.
