Most patients need surgical intervention, which is earlier in cases of DAA, around 1.4 months after the presentation and 4.9 months after being symptomatic. The site of operation depends on the non-dominant arch, which is generally left-sided in around 71% of the patients. So, lateral thoracotomy via the left side is usually performed.

Alternatively, there is a minimally invasive surgery using video-assisted thoracoscopic techniques division of vascular ring, which seems safe and effective in children.
