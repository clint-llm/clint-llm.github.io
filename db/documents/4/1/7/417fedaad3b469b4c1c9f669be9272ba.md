The following diseases, among others, should be considered to prevent misdiagnosis.

- Infections- orbital cellulitis

- Systemic diseases such as thyroid ophthalmopathy

- Malignancies: Lymphoma, metastatic carcinoma, leukemia

- Autoimmune disorders: Systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis

- IgG4-related orbital disease

- Sarcoidosis

Orbital and systemic diseases that may present with similar signs and symptoms include orbital cellulitis, thyroid eye disease, sarcoid, orbital lymphoma, lymphangioma, metastatic carcinoma, leukemia, lymphoproliferative disorder, and rhabdomyosarcoma.

Bilateral sclerosing orbital pseudotumor should alert the physician. This subset of IOI leads to serious morbidity with a chronic, severe, progressive disease commonly manifesting with proptosis, restricted ocular motility, and pain.

In children, the differential diagnoses include orbital cellulitis, orbital trauma with retained foreign body, ruptured dermoid cyst, lymphangioma, neuroblastoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and pediatric malignancies such as rhabdomyosarcoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma and, metastatic retinoblastoma.

Distinguishing among the various clinical entities that mimic orbital pseudotumor may require the use of ancillary laboratory exams, CT, MRI, and biopsy.
