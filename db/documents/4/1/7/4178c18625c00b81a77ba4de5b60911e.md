Cardiac catheterization is one of the most widely performed cardiac procedures. In the United States, more than 1,000,000 cardiac catheterization procedures are performed annually. As expected, in any invasive procedure, there are some patient-related and procedure-related complications. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques of cardiac catheterization and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with CAD.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the technique of cardiac catheterization.
- Describe the indications for cardiac catheterization.
- Review the complications of cardiac catheterization.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.
