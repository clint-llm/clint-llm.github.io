Phlebotomy for blood alpha-fetoprotein assay requires little or no preparations as this is mainly safe when performed by qualified health workers. However, patients need to be counseled on the possible discomfort from the needle prick, although mostly bearable.

It is pertinent to explain that this is a screening test. Depending on the outcome, more tests may be ordered to establish a diagnosis.

Patients with amniocentesis must be duly counseled about the procedure and the associated risks. There is a risk of obstetric mishap following amniocentesis; a miscarriage can happen in less than 1% of cases.

Following amniocentesis, patients may experience some cramp-like discomfort in the first few hours but are usually allowed to go home after a short rest.
