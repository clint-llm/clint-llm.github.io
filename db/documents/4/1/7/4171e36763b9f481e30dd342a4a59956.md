The majority of dopamine production occurs in the brain, and the dopaminergic pathways it follows have vast implications on cortical neurophysiology. Dopamine is chemically classified as a catecholamine, undergoes some synthesis in the adrenal medulla, and has an affinity for adrenergic receptors. However, it is not typically considered in the context of clinical adrenal physiology to the same level of depth as norepinephrine and epinephrine. Clinically, dopamine has applications for treating hypotension in patients with shock. It has a particular affinity for receptors located in the renal arteries that, when activated, relax and dilate the renal vasculature.
