Cefotaxime is a bactericidal agent that exerts its mechanism of action by binding penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) via beta-lactam rings and inhibiting the definitive activity of transpeptidation in peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacterial organisms.

The inability to form a bacterial cell wall further causes the autolysis of the bacteria.

**Resistance**

Beta-lactamases can cause hydrolysis to cefotaxime, further hindering its bactericidal effects. Although susceptive, cefotaxime is quite durable against the activity of most β-lactamases.

**Metabolism**

Once administered, cefotaxime undergoes metabolism within the liver, and the majority of it is excreted renally. In the liver, cefotaxime converts to desacetylcefotaxime, which is further converted to desacetylcefotaxime lactone and then to M metabolites.
