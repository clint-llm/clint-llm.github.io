An investigational pentavalent botulinum toxoid is available for the people at elevated risk for BoNT exposure, such as laboratory workers and military personnel. No FDA-approved vaccine exists for the general public. The pentavalent toxoid is not under consideration for public use due to cost, the number of required vaccinations, and the recent decline in immunogenicity.
