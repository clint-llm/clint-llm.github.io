High Flow nasal cannula has many clinical applications. Some of the potential areas of clinical application where there is evolving evidence is listed below:

- Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure

- Post-surgical respiratory failure

- Acute heart failure/pulmonary edema

- Hypercapnic respiratory failure, COPD

- Pre and post-extubation oxygenation

- Obstructive sleep apnea

- Use in the emergency department

- Do not intubate the patient

Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) occurs due to intrapulmonary shunting of blood because of airspace collapse or filling. It is usually refractory to supplemental oxygen. This occurs when there is an increase in alveolar-capillary hydrostatic pressure, increased alveolar-capillary permeability, blood due to hemorrhage, and/or fluid because of an inflammatory condition such as pneumonia. As previously discussed, high-flow nasal cannula therapy provides PEEP. The FLORALI trial found that although high-flow nasal cannula did not reduce intubation rate among immunocompetent patients with non-hypercapnic hypoxic respiratory failure, patients who received high-flow nasal cannula therapy experienced reduced mortality, both in the intensive care unit (ICU) and at 90-days.

The study was underpowered for the primary outcome of intubation rate. It was not replicated by two subsequent randomized controlled trials. However, both studies (Stephen et al. and Maggiore et al.) showed high-flow nasal cannula to be equally efficient as non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in avoiding intubation and reducing mortality.

Physiologically, the ability to independently control FIO2 and oxygen flow in NIV and high-flow nasal cannula renders a clear advantage over regular oxygen therapy in patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, prone to hypercapnia. A high-flow nasal cannula certainly provides a more comfortable alternative in patients who struggle with tolerating an NIV modality. Finally, the adverse effect on the logistics of patient location on NIV, nursing, and respiratory therapy workload needs to be accounted for.

Pre-oxygenating a patient before intubation is essential. High-flow nasal cannula therapy can provide this in an alert awake patient by achieving a high-flow rate and very high amounts of FiO2, thus increasing PO2. This gives more time for the process of intubation before desaturation happens. Historically, a non-rebreather mask (NRM) has been used to do this. However, Miguel-Mantanes et al. (2015) found that high-flow nasal cannula therapy significantly improves oxygenation during intubation compared to a nonrebreather mask (NRM). While one retrospective analysis found that NIV such as BiPAP yields similar results to HFNCrelative to outcomes, patient compliance decreases significantly (Besnier, Emmanuel, et al. 2016). This suggests that high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy is superior to both NRM and NIV in the pre-intubation period.

Oxygenation is also important post-extubation. Arman et al. (2017) found that while there was no significant difference in post-extubation oxygen saturation between low-flow nasal cannula and high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy in the ICU, there was a difference in heart rate and respiratory rate, suggesting that low-flow nasal cannula required an increased quantity of both of these to achieve the same oxygen saturation. Post-extubation after surgery also necessitates oxygen therapy. Youfeng et al. (2018) completed a meta-analysis that concluded that high-flow nasal cannula could reduce the need for respiratory support compared with the low-flow nasal cannula in cardiac surgical patients. Hernandez and colleagues published 2 seminal papers in JAMA regarding the use of high flow nasal cannula in high and low-risk post-extubation patients. They found that high flow nasal cannula was superior to standard care in low-risk patients post-extubation and non-inferior to non-invasive mechanical ventilation in high-risk patients post-extubation.

Immunocompromised patients carry increased mortality when undergoing endotracheal intubation. This is largely due to the increased risk of infection in these patients. The HIGH trial, performed in immunocompromised patients, did not show a significant decrease in 28-day mortality or reintubation rates in patients admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory failure when comparing high flow nasal cannula to standard oxygen therapy.

The emergency department is the first stop for most patients who are admitted to the hospital. Acute dyspnea and hypoxemia are 2 of the most common reasons for emergency department visits. Nuttapol et al. (2015) completed a prospective randomized comparative study to ascertain whether high-flow nasal cannula therapy is superior to conventional oxygen therapy in the emergency department. They found high-flow nasal cannula therapy improves dyspnea and comfort in subjects presenting to the emergency department for dyspnea and/or hypoxemia.

According to the National Center for Health Statistics, 51,811 people died from pneumonia, and 544,000 visited the emergency room (ER) for pneumonia as the primary discharge diagnosis in 2015. Pneumonia is also a common cause of ARHF, which was previously discussed. Omote et al. (2018) found that high-flow nasal cannula therapy improved 30-day survival in patients with acute respiratory failure due to interstitial pneumonia as compared to NIV.

All patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will eventually need supplemental oxygen, provided they do not first die from another cause. COPD exacerbations are also a common reason for hospital admission. Many patients with COPD benefit from NIV in the acute setting. However, a large limitation of NIV is the low level of patient compliance and comfort. High-flow nasal cannula therapy provides the benefit of PEEP and increased oxygen saturation that NIV supplies but increases patient comfort and compliance. In addition, Dzira et al. (2017) discovered that in GOLD stage III and IV COPD patients, high-flow nasal cannula at flow rates greater than 30 L per minute decreased the respiratory rate, inspiratory time to total breath time ratio, and diaphragmatic work of breathing compared to NIV.
