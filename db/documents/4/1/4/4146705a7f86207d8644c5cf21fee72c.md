General anesthesia induces physiological responses, potentially resulting in morbidity and mortality when emergency situations are not properly addressed. Therefore, it is regarded as a high-risk activity where the benefits of surgery must outweigh the potential harms. Mortality directly related to anesthetic management is rare but may result from pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, asphyxiation, or anaphylaxis.
