Any Pythium patient presenting to an emergency department with pain, redness, and photophobia must be urgently referred to an ophthalmologist, preferably a corneal disease expert. Prompt diagnosis and tailored therapy can prevent blindness in these patients.

Smear and culture are mandatory to diagnose Pythium keratitis, and the in-house microbiologist plays a critical role in rapid diagnosis. The patient must be treated with topical 0.2% linezolid and 1% azithromycin as the first-line drugs for at least 2Â to 3 months. The ophthalmologist plays a critical role in patient education and counseling regarding general hygiene measured to be followed, meticulous use of contact lenses, and proper medication usage post-infection. Close follow-up is mandatory since the organism is highly virulent and can result in permanent blindness. The nursing team and the pharmacist also play a critical role in patient education.
