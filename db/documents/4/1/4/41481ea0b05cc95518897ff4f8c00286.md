Toxoplasmosis is the commonest central nervous system (CNS) infection in patients with HIV/AIDS who are not on appropriate prophylaxis.Â The usual manifestation of cerebral toxoplasmosis is typically one or more CNS mass lesions. Other opportunistic conditions seen in AIDS that may present with mass like lesions include primary CNS lymphoma (typically associated with the Epstein-Barr virus) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) which is caused by JC polyomavirus.
