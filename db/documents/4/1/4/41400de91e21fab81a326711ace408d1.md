Complications include chronic inflammation, secondary glaucoma, corneal decompensation, and in severe cases, phthisis bulbi. Glaucoma is common with the diffuse sheet-like form and may occur due to blockage of the trabecular meshwork by the epithelium directly or by mucin from conjunctival goblet cells.
