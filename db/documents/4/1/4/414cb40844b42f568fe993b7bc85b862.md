Percutaneous tricuspid valve intervention is a new upcoming intervention for the treatment of tricuspid valve lesions. Percutaneous intervention offers patients repair and relief when, in the past, most high surgical risk patients were turned away with tricuspid valve disorders and were not open surgical candidates. Tricuspid valve disorders have often been overlooked or not treated in the past. Tricuspid valve lesions are a serious risk factor to patients and often causes morbidity and mortality if not treated. In order to avoid future morbidity and mortality, tricuspid valve lesions should be promptly diagnosed and treated accordingly. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and percutaneous treatments for patients with tricuspid valve disease.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of tricuspid stenosis.
- Review the presentation of patients with valvulopathy.
- Outline the indications of percutaneous valve interventions.
