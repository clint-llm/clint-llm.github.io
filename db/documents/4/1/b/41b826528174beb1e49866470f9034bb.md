Glossopharyngeal neuralgia has a variable prognosis based on the patientâ€™s symptoms. Most of the patients have a single episode of painful paroxysmal attacks. The annual recurrence rate is as low as 3.6%. Only 25% of patients require surgery, and the rest are manageable medically. Less than one in four patients will have bilateral pain.

Bilateral pain, multiple bouts of severe excruciating pain, and constant pain are poor prognostic indicators.
