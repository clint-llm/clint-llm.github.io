Most cases of tetanus take place in developing countries where immunity is lacking, and particularly in areas where natural disasters have occurred. The spores of C. tetani are present in the environment irrespective of geographical location. The spores reside in the soil and can enter through an opening in the skin. All ages are susceptible to infection, and the case-fatality rate can approach 100% if immediate medical intervention is not available. Neonates are at increased risk in under-developed areas of the world when non-sterilized medical equipment is used to cut the umbilical cord. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in 2015, approximately 34,000 neonates died from neonatal tetanus. Tetanus is a vaccine-preventable disease for which tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines (TTCV) are included in the routine childhood immunization schedule. The average annual incidence in the United States fromÂ 2001 to 2008 was 0.01 per 100,000 population per WHO. The age groups at the highest risk are children and the elderly secondary to reduced immunity. Tetanus toxin vaccine was first produced in 1924 and used extensively for the first time among soldiers during World War II. Currently, the pentavalent vaccine, which protects against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Hib, and hepatitis B (DTP-Hib-HepB), is the most commonly used childhood vaccine worldwide.
