Reentry arrhythmias can manifest in a multitude of ways depending on the specific variation of the abnormal rhythm. If the origin involves the atrioventricular (AV) node, the arrhythmia purely occurs due to an anatomic abnormality in the AV node associated with the different conduction pathways in the node itself.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and multiple cardiac and non-cardiac causes and triggers of atrial fibrillation have been reported in the literature. The most common cardiac triggers of atrial fibrillation include mitral valve diseases, heart failure, myocardial infarction/ischemia, intracardiac shunts, and hypertension. Advanced age is one of the major causes of atrial fibrillation in people with structurally normal hearts.

The reentry ventricular arrhythmias are caused by structural heart diseases and scars in the myocardium. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is the main etiology of reentrant ventricular tachycardia, followed by non-ischemic, dilated cardiomyopathy.
