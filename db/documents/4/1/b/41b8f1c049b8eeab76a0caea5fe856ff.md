DBA is a chronic form of macrocytic-normochromic anemia with low reticulocytes, normal platelets, normal WBCs in the bone marrow. Laboratory workup is significant for elevated MCV and erythrocyte adenosine deaminase (eADA). Persistently elevated hemoglobin F is commonly seen as well in patients with DBA.

Of all the ribosomal protein genes, RPS19, which codes a small ribosomal protein unit, is the most commonly involved mutated gene occurring in approximately 25% of cases of DBA.

RPS19 plays an essential role in 18S rRNA maturation and 40S synthesis. RPS19 mutation causes decreased production of RPS19 and 40S ribosomal subunits by reducing translation initiation. With the decreased initiation of translation of the gene, there is a negative impact on normal primary hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation and production due to increased apoptosis.

As per the ‘ribosomal stress’ mechanism, ribosomal deficiency activates and stabilizes p53, subsequently initiating apoptosis to cause bone marrow failure by terminating cell lines. Murine double minute (MDM2) is a ringer figure ubiquitin ligase that controls the level and activity of p53. When interacting with the normal ribosomal protein, MDM2 enhances p53 degradation.

DBA also results from non-Rp gene mutations such as GATA1.  GATA1 encodes for transcription factors.
