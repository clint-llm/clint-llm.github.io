Chediak Higashi syndrome (CHS) is an autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by easy bruising, oculocutaneous albinism and recurrent pyogenic infections. The defect is caused by a mutation in the lysosomal trafficking regulator protein that leads to decreased phagocytosis and predisposition to recurrent bacterial infection. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Chediak Higashi syndrome and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mutations in LYST or CHS1 gene as the underlying defect in the etiology of Chediak Higashi syndrome.
- Describe the pathophysiology of Chediak Higashi syndrome.
- Summarize the use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as the only cure of Chediak Higashi syndrome.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to educate the caregiver on methods to prevent complications, remain compliant with medications and undergo the recommended immunizations to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by Chediak Higashi syndrome.
