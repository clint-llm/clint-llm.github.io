Both distal ulna and radius fractures are usually the result of a fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH). The predominant wrist position is dorsiflexion. In advanced age individuals, the fracture pattern is usually extraarticular from low-energy causes. The opposite is true of younger patients who suffer intraarticular injuries from high-impact trauma. High energy mechanisms also increase the likelihood of a simultaneous distal ulna fracture.

The ulna styloid is fractured more than any other part of the ulna and is found in 80% of intraarticular distal radius injuries.

Isolated fractures of the distal ulna occur without an accompanying radius injury. A nightstick fracture (isolated ulnar shaft fracture) is usually the result of a direct blow to the ulna while a person is attempting to shield themselves with their arms.

Isolated ulnar physeal injuries are extremely uncommon and have a greater propensity for early growth plate arrest.
