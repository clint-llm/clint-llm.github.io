Despite the advent of a better understanding of COVID-19, the mortality and morbidity in hospitalized individuals with mild to moderate disease remain unacceptably high. During phases of overwhelming crisis as seen in countries worldwide over the past year, it has become evident that healthcare infrastructure across the globe can get overwhelmed. While oxygen supplementation can be provided in regular ward settings, mechanical ventilation with endotracheal intubation requires a significant amount of resources. Specialized equipment, trained physicians, and nursing staff fluent in managing critically ill patients and ICU beds remain in shortage across the globe. Combination therapy with Remdesivir and Baricitinib holds the promise of potentially decreasing oxygen requirements, as well as avoiding worsening in patients with an ordinal score of 5 and 6. This group of patients is at a high risk of requiring escalation of care, as well as having clinical worsening requiring mechanical ventilation. Hence the combination therapy can avoid significant morbidity as well as conserve valuable resources. Further studies are underway for the evaluation of Baricitinib and Remdesivir in combination with corticosteroids.
