For a transabdominal scan, a distended bladder is recommended to displace the bowel and provide an acoustic window to visualize the pelvic structures. For a transvaginal scan, SIS, or sonohysterosalpingogram, an empty bladder is recommended.

It is ideal for performing SIS or sonohysterosalpingogram during the mid follicular phase when the patient is no longer bleeding to reduce the false-positive rate for detecting polyps or adhesions and better visualization of any pathological conditions. A urine pregnancy test is performed to confirm that the patient is not pregnant before performing SIS or sonohysterosalpingogram.
