A popliteal artery aneurysm is defined as a focal dilation in the artery, with the largest diameter being more than 50% of the normal. These focal dilations are classified as either fusiform or saccular. Popliteal artery aneurysms are associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms 40% to 50% of the time. They are usually asymptomatic, but may present with chronic symptoms due to mass effect. This activity describes the risk factors, diagnosis, and management of ruptured popliteal artery aneurysms and the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical presentation of a patient with a popliteal artery aneurysm.
- Outline the evaluation for popliteal artery aneurysms.
- Explain the complications of popliteal artery aneurysms.
- Review the role of an interprofessional team in caring for patients with popliteal artery aneurysms and improving chances for survival and recovery.
