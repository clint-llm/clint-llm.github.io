In the primary form (PSS), repeated motions of the upper extremity result in hypertrophy of the scalene muscles, compromising the neurovascular bundle as it exits the thorax between the cervical rib and surrounding musculature. Repeated compression of the subclavian vein results in venous stasis and perivenous microtrauma, activating the intrinsic coagulation pathway with eventual thrombosis. In the secondary form, catheterization disrupts the endothelial lining and activates a similar coagulation cascade. Additionally, congenital and acquired cases of coagulation disorders such as Factor V Leiden mutation or malignancy also increase the risk for upper extremity DVT.
