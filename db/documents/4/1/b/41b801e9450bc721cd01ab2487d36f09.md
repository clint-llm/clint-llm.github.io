From 2000 to 2014, a total of 25,397 cases of vitamin D toxicity were reported. Between 2000 and 2005, the annual mean of vitamin D toxicity cases was 196. However, there was a substantial increase of 1600% in exposures from 2005 to 2011, resulting in a new annual mean of 4535 cases.

According to the latest report from America's Poison Centers (APC), there were 11,718 cases of vitamin D exposure recorded in the National Poison Data System. More than half of these cases were in children younger thanÂ 5 years. The vast majority of cases were from unintentional exposures. The total number of vitamin D toxicity cases was greater than the total number of vitamin (vitamins B, A, C, and E) toxicity cases combined. This illustrates the widespread use of vitamin D supplements.
