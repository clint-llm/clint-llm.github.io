Within the cerebellar vermis, Purkinje cells, which constitute the main afferent pathway for the fastigial nucleus, transmit inhibitory GABAergic axons that contain integrated information within the cerebellar vermis to the fastigial nucleus.

The fastigial nucleus also has many efferent pathways. First, it sends descending pathways to the vestibular nuclei along with medullary/pontine reticular formations.

The fastigial nucleus also sends signals to many nonmotor regions in the brain. Many animal studies revealed that the fastigial nucleus could reach structures within the medullary/pontine reticular formations, including the gigantocellular nucleus and nucleus ambiguus.
