Omphalocele complications can be categorized according to their time of occurrence. Prenatally and during delivery, the omphalocele may rupture, and in the case of a giant omphalocele, the liver can be injured. The majority of infants with omphalocele have a small thorax with varying degrees of pulmonary hypoplasia. Thus, mechanical ventilation is often required for weeks or even months until the lungs mature.

Infants with omphaloceles often need parenteral nutrition, which can lead to cholestasis and hepatomegaly. Thus, large omphaloceles need a staged repair. Tracheostomies are often needed until the lung mature.

Postnatally and after surgical repair, the complications consist of feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, inguinal hernias, gastroesophageal reflux, and occasionally esophagitis. Compared to gastroschisis, omphaloceles carry much higher mortality.
