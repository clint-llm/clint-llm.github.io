Although sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, by definition, is a fatal condition, the prognosis of patients with epilepsy, in general, can range from poor to excellent. The prognosis regarding developing SUDEP in a patient with epilepsy can be assessed using a variety of tools, including the SUDEP-7 inventory. This determines a patient's risk based on multiple factors, including:

- Three or more tonic-clonic seizures in the past year

- One or more tonic-clonic seizures in the past year

- One or more seizures of any type in the past year

- More than 50 seizures per month in the past year

- Duration of epilepsy greater than or equal to 30 years

- Treatment with three or greater anticonvulsants

- Intellectual disability with a measured IQ of less than 70

The presence of any of the above risk factors increases the risk score (with a maximum score of 12). However, the individual risk score has not been validated as a means to predict SUDEP. In general, the chance of dying from SUDEP is 1 in 1000, and patients with poorly controlled epilepsy have a greater risk.
