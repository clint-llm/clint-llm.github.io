Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic disease that requires patients to adopt a long-term gluten-free diet. Those who are able to do this and respond, seem to have excellent long-term survival and can decrease or discontinue dapsone treatment. Recent data suggest that patients with GSE who do not respond to a gluten-free diet do poorly. While the disease is a chronic one, remission is recognized and seems to be more common in adult patients over the age of 40.
