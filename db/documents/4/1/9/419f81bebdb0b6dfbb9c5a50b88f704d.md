Patients with symptomatic vertebral hemangiomas present to their primary care physician with either back pain or neurologic symptoms. In the setting of back pain, a coordinated approach between a primary care physician and a radiologist is important in understanding and identifying whether a vertebral hemangioma or another pathology is the pain generator during a specific complaint about back pain. In more severe cases of back pain, a physiatrist can play an important role in managing pain. In cases of neurologic symptoms, surgical intervention is often necessary, and a coordinated approach with a radiologist in identifying the degree of extension into the spinal cord or neural foramina is important.
