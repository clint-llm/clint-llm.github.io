Plain radiography represents the earliest form of diagnostic imaging. X-rays are used to generate image contrast based on differences in tissue attenuation. Because the soft tissues of the brain exhibit similar attenuation characteristics, the use of plain radiographs to evaluate for structural lesions within the brain is extremely limited. As such, plain radiographs play no role in the diagnostic workup for patients suffering from seizures.
