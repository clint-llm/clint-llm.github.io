The most significant risk factors for prostate cancer are not modifiable. These are:

- Age - Prostate cancer is rare under the age of 50 (1 in 350); incidence steeply increases to 1 in 52 by age 59, and at age 65, the incidence is greater than 1 in 2, although many men will not be aware they have the disease. In the modern era of wide-spread serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, the majority of men have localized disease at diagnosis with a mean age of 66.

- Race - Worldwide, African-American men are the most likely racial group to develop prostate cancer and are also more likely to develop the disease at a younger age, with high rates evident in Afro-Caribbean men and those of West African origin. Hispanics are at lower risk than Caucasians, as are those from South-East Asia.

- Family history – although a minority of cases of prostate cancer are truly hereditary, a family history of prostate cancer increases the risk. The relative risk if a first-degree relative is affected is a two-fold increase, with the risk increased around eight-fold if two or more first-degree relatives are affected.

Other risk factors, responsible for a minority of cases, include inheritable gene mutations (e.g., BRCA2 and HOXB13) and anthropometry; taller men are at a higher risk. No consistent link has been found between the incidence of prostate cancer and dietary factors, although obesity does represent a risk factor for progressive or advanced disease.
