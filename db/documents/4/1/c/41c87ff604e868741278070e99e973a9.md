The left ventricular is made up of a thick muscle and forms the thickest muscle of the heart. It subsequently is prone to pseudoaneurysm development more commonly than true aneurysms. A pseudoaneurysm, also known as a false aneurysm, is when the wall is injured, and the leaking blood collects in the surrounding tissue. It should not be confused with a true aneurysm which occurs when the walls itself bulges from the fluid collection. A left ventricular pseudoaneurysm is a rupture of the left ventricular wall that is contained by adherent pericardium or scar tissue. Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm requires immediate intervention with either surgery or minimally invasive percutaneous transcatheter closure.

According to a study by Yeo et al, there is an association between the location of a pseudoaneurysm and the etiology of its presence. For example, following myocardial infarction, 82% of pseudoaneurysms are located in the inferior or posterolateral wall. Following congential cardiac surgery, pseudoaneurysms are found in the right ventricular outflow tract 87% of the time. After mitral valve replacement, 100% of pseudoaneurysms are located in the posterior subannular region of the mitral valve, and following aortic valve, replacement pseudoaneurysms are located in the subaortic region 100% of the time.
