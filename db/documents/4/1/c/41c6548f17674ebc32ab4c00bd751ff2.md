Acne conglobata is not very common. Overall, it is more common in men than women. Over the past 30 years, many reports have been published on athletes with this type of acne, which is felt to be primarily due to the use of anabolic steroids. Outside the US, not much is known about acne conglobata. The condition is usually seen in young adults and very rarely seen in children or older adults. The onset is usually in the second and third decades of life. Whether it occurs more frequently in any specific race is not known.
