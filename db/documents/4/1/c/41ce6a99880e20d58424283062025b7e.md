There are five layers of the epidermis, each with different properties. Moving from the most superficial to deep layers, they are as follows:

- Stratum corneum

- Stratum lucidum

- Stratum granulosum

- Stratum spinosum

- Stratum basale

MicrodermabrasionÂ removes the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis.
