The nipple-areolar complex (NAC) has robust and overlapping vascularity from different arterial sources. The internal mammary artery (IMA) perforators are the dominant blood supply to the nipple, especially the second, third, and fourth perforators used in superomedial pedicle based mastopexies. The lateral thoracic and thoracoacromial arteries supply the breast and the nipple's superolateral aspect, and the intercostal arteries supply the anteromedial and anterolateral aspect of the breast.

The degree of ptosis can be categorized by the Regnault classification, which assesses the breast according to the relative position of the nipple to the inframammary fold (IMF). Grade 1 or mild ptosis is when the nipple is at the level of the fold. Grade 2 or moderate ptosis is when the nipple is below the level of the fold, but it is not at the most dependent part of the breast. Grade 3 or severe ptosis is when the nipple is below the fold and is the most dependent part of the breast. Pseudoptosis is when the nipple is above or at the level of the fold, most of the breast is well below the fold, and the nipple to IMF distance is usually more than 6cm.
