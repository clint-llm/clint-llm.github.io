Doxorubicin is frequently listed as a contraindication to hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO). Animal studies of the combined administration of HBO and doxorubicin have shown different results, leading to controversy about whether HBO is contraindicated in patients receiving the drug. HBO was studied in 1985, along with the use of antioxidants, as a potential nonsurgical remedy for skin necrosis due to doxorubicin extravasation. In this study, researchers fed groups of rats antioxidants (beta-carotene and/or butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), a common food preservative and known free radical scavenger). Subsequently, the rats were anesthetized and injected intradermally with doxorubicin. Some rats were then exposed to HBO at 2.5 ATA after the doxorubicin injections. The rats that were fed BHT before doxorubicin injection exhibited improved wound healing. The group of rats that received HBO after doxorubicin injection experienced an 87% mortality rate, which the authors attributed to the formation of free radicals by both HBO and doxorubicin.

While the results of this single study suggest that the concurrent administration of HBO and doxorubicin may be associated with increased mortality, subsequent studies have not demonstrated an increase in mortality or cardiac toxicity after administration of HBO and doxorubicin. The effects of HBO after remote doxorubicin administration are unknown. It may be safe to administer HBO after doxorubicin has been cleared from the body, in other words, after five to six elimination half-lives, or 12 days). Still, additional studies are necessary for further exploration of this topic.
