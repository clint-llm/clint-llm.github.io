As expected, the best possible outcomes for patient care involve an integrated and interprofessional team approach that includes an internist, nurse practitioner, pulmonologist, intensivist, and laboratory specialist. If a patient is seen to be tachypneic, the role of the clinical physical exam, imaging, and laboratory values are significant. The patient should not be discharged until the tachypnea has resolved and consultations or referrals occur as deemed necessary. Healthcare professionals should discuss amongst themselves any significant complications or comorbidities.

Collaboration and teamwork, as well as communication, are necessary for good outcomes and prognosis. This collaboration should involve the entire interprofessional team, including all physicians, specialty-trained nurses, pharmacists, and respiratory therapists, using an integrated and evidence-based approach to determining the plan and treatment leading to optimal patient care and outcomes.
