The indications for autotransfusion are relatively straightforward and merit consideration in every trauma patient with active extravasation. However, often the more important question is to consider the contraindications.

For autotransfusion to be a worthwhile procedure, there should be signs of significant blood loss, typically greater than 1000 mL.

Differences in autotransfusion systems and indications for their use are influenced by resource availability.

The following are some recorded indications of autotransfusion:

- Ruptured ectopic pregnancy (REP)

- Ectopic pregnancy

- Hemothorax

- Vaginal postpartum hemorrhage

- Abdominal trauma and REP

- Blood from the peritoneal cavity

- Ruptured uterus
