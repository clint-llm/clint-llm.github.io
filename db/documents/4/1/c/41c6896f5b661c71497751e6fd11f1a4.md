With each breath a person takes, the negative intrathoracic pressure causes the alveoli and distal pulmonary structures to collapse (similiar to deflating a balloon) but with patients that have stiff lungs [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary fibrosis patients] there is an abnormal residual pressure due to air trapping referred to as auto-PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure).Usage of continuous positive airway pressure allows for a constant pressure throughout the ventilatory cycle (inspiration and expiration phases) and does not allow for the alveoli to completely collapse during the exhalation phase. This positive pressure will reduce the surface tension on the walls of the alveoli by increasing the intrathoracic pressure which helps to reduce the work of breathing.  Similarly, there is also an increase in the surface area of the alveoli which allows for an increase in gas exchange. The positive pressure from CPAP allows for individuals to overcome the auto-PEEP and will help reduce the work-of-breathing. With the increase in intrathoracic pressure, there is also a reduction in preload coming back to the heart which allows for a fluid shift out of the lungs and back into the pulmonary vasculature.
