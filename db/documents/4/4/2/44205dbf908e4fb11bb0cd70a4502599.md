The team of the ophthalmologist and the assisting nurse takes consent and counsels the patient before the procedure. Pushing the ICG dye while the ophthalmologist or the technician is capturing the images, monitoring the patient for any adverse reactions during the procedure is also carried out by the nursing staff. Anesthetists or critical care specialists are required in cases of severe allergy and anaphylactic reaction. An interprofessional team approach helps to prevent and manage complications. It helps in carrying out ICG angiography with minimal risk.
