- Femoral head trauma: Anterior hip dislocations commonly are associated with femoral head trauma and therefore have a higher incidence of long-term decreased functional outcomes and post-traumatic arthritis. Moreta et al. found that 13.3% of patients that suffered a complex dislocation had radiographic signs of osteoarthritis.

- Osteonecrosis: This complication ranges from 5% to 40% of all hip dislocations but is related to the time before the joint's reduction, with over 6 hours increasing the risk. Up to 20% of all traumatic hip dislocations will suffer osteonecrosis of the hip.

- Thromboembolism: Patients are at an increased risk of thromboembolism due to both immobility post-injury and due to vascular intima injury related to traction. Rezaie et al. found a 0.5% risk of venous thromboembolism after surgical hip dislocation. Prophylaxis should be the standard for this group.

- Recurrent dislocation: This occurs in approximately 2% of patients. Itokawa et al. found that 40% of patients who dislocated after total hip arthroplasty, suffered repeat hip dislocations.

- Neurovascular injury: Although the injury to the femoral nerve or vasculature has been reported, it remains relatively rare. Cornwall et al. found 10% of adults and 5% of children will suffer neuropraxia following hip dislocation. Fortunately, 60-70% of patients had partial resolution of symptoms.
