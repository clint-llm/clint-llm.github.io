**Compartment Syndrome Surgery**

Patients who have acute compartment syndrome or CECS that has not responded to conservative treatment require surgical intervention to relieve the symptoms associated with their condition and to prevent progressive damage. Patients with CECS of their lateral compartment have high surgical success rates at an average of two years following surgery, with a systematic review finding that 90% of patients had successful lateral compartment surgery. However, the success rate of surgical intervention for CECS as a whole (with different compartments being affected), was lower at 66%. Therefore, surgical intervention in patients who have lateral compartment CECS is more efficacious than surgical intervention in other lower leg compartments.

Surgical Techniques:

- Compartment-Specific Open Fasciotomy

- 
              
- 86% of all surgeries for CECS were compartment-specific open fasciotomies, with the anterior compartment being the most commonly released compartment.

- Fasciotomy with Partial Fasciectomy

- 
              
- 12% of all CECS operations were a fasciotomy with a partial fasciectomy.

- Endoscopic Fasciotomy

- 
              
- 2% of all CECS surgeries were done endoscopically, with no significantly better outcomes over the open techniques.

Many different incision locations and techniques are used. It is imperative that incisions are placed in locations that provide access to the fascial compartment that is being treated, and that incisions minimize iatrogenic neurovascular injury. It has been shown that while performing a fasciotomy of the anterior and lateral compartments, ultrasound can be utilized to locate the intermuscular septum separating the anterior and lateral compartments, providing a good location for surgeons to place their incision directly over the septum, in order to prevent damage to neurovascular structures in the area. Limitations of US include that it is not effective in patients with increased BMIs, especially patients who are obese, and the accuracy of US is heavily operator-dependent. Therefore, when properly trained individuals are utilizing US to locate the intermuscular septum between the anterior and lateral leg compartments, it can be an effective guide on the surgical incision placement.

With a complication rate of 13%, it is important to be aware of the complications of surgical intervention for compartment syndrome. They include:

- Hemorrhage

- Nerve damage and altered sensation

- Infection

- Damage to the venous and arterial structures

- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)

- Skin breakdown

- Nerve entrapment

- Chronic pain

Patients, especially athletes, should be warned that recurrence of compartment syndrome is possible. Recurrence rates between 0% and 44.7% have been reported. Recurrence may also result from an incomplete fascial release, excessive scarring, or inadequate rehabilitation. A second-time fasciotomy should be open and more extensive than the first one.

**Surgical Precautions**

Well-leg compartment syndrome (WLCS) occurs in patients who have been in the lithotomy position for a prolonged time. It is an acute compartment syndrome in the anterior and lateral compartments.

It is also important to be careful when performing surgical operations that utilize lower limb compression stockings for DVT prophylaxis. Acute compartment syndrome of the lateral compartment has been reported in a patient who had compression stockings on his leg during a surgical procedure for the patientâ€™s foot and ankle. The patient returned two days following the operation with symptoms of acute compartment syndrome and needed surgical intervention. Therefore, proper fitting compression stockings should be utilized for DVT prophylaxis to minimize the risk of acute compartment syndrome.

When surgical interventions are being performed for conditions around the fibular head and popliteal region, it is important to be aware of the anatomically variable splitting of the common fibular nerve, in order to avoid iatrogenic injury.
