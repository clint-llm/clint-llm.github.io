Pentosan polysulfate (PPS) is a semisynthetic pentasaccharide heparinoid with anticoagulant properties and was initially used in the 1950s as a thrombolytic due to the ability of the molecule to bind the glycocalyx of circulating red blood cells.

Interstitial cystitis is characterized by bladder pain (suprapubic, pelvic, urethral, vaginal, or perineal) caused by filling and relieved by emptying with petechial bladder mucosal hemorrhages on endoscopy and decreased bladder compliance on urodynamics.

Twenty-two years after its approval as a second-line agent for interstitial cystitis, a six-patient case series described a progressive maculopathy associated with long-term use of the drug, an associationÂ that researchers have demonstrated and characterized multiple times.
