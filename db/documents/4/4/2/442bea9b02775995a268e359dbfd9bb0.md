Hypertensive urgency isÂ a marked elevation in blood pressure without evidence of target organ damage, such as pulmonary edema, cardiac ischemia, neurologic deficits, or acute renal failure. Specific cutoffs have been proposed, such as systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 110 mmHg, but these are arbitrarily derived numbers that have not been associated with short-term morbidity or mortality.
