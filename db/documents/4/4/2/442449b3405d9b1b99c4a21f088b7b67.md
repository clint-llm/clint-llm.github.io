The pathophysiology of borderline personality disorder is likely a combination of genetic predisposition combined with early childhood environmental factors and neurobiological dysfunction. A greater understanding of neurobiology and, specifically, neurotransmitter dysfunction may lead to improved therapeutic options for treating borderline personality disorder. A recent study published in 2015 examined the role of oxytocin in the regulation of social reward and empathy networks as a contributing cause of borderline personality disorder and other personality disorders. Specifically, serotonin dysregulation reducing the sensitivity of the 5HT-1A receptor may contribute to borderline personality disorder. Increased rates of learning disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and neurocognitive deficits, as well as abnormal electroencephalographic findings, have also been reported in patients with borderline personality disorder.
