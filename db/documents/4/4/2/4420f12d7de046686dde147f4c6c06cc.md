- Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis occurs primarily in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis.

Clinical presentation

- History of recurrent episodes of wheezing with radiological evidence of patchy fleeting pulmonary infiltrates and bronchiectasis. Wheezing is not always evident, and some patients present with asymptomatic pulmonary consolidation.

- History of uncontrolled asthma with increased frequency and severity despite optimum asthma medications.

- History of cystic fibrosis.

- A presentation of cough, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, blood-stained sputum, or sputum with brown mucus plugs.

- There are non-specific complaints like anorexia, fatigue, generalized aches and pains, low-grade fever, and loss of weight.

- ABPA may occur with allergic fungal sinusitis having symptoms of chronic sinusitis with purulent sinus discharge.

On physical examination:

- In asthmatic patients with ABPA, wheezing, and/or rhonchi present on auscultation.

- In cystic fibrosis patients with ABPA, crepitations present on auscultation due to bronchiectasis.

- Tachypnea may present in case of asthma exacerbation or due to a secondary lung infection.
