A retinal migraine is a rare disorder, but the prevalence is not known. Data specific to retinal migraines do not exist, but migraines, in general, have a prevalence of 18.2% in females and 6.5% in male patients, with a higher prevalence in whites followed by blacks followed by Asians.  Retinal migraine can start as early as 7 years of age, but most cases start in the second decade and peak in the fourth decade of life. Based on a study by Pradhan et al., it was found that 50% of retinal migraine patients said the vision loss was complete in one eye, up to 20% said it was just blurring, 12% reported an incomplete loss, 7% dimming, and 13% scotoma. More than 75% of patients had a headache on the same side as the vision disturbance within an hour.

Twenty-nine percent of retinal migraine patients have a history of migraine headache, and 50% have a family history of migraine headache.
