The prognosis depends on the type and extent of nerve injury. For mild nerve injury, recovery is possible, but if the nerve was transected, recovery is rare. Even those who recover may require prolonged hand rehabilitation and may never regain full strength of the hand muscles. Poor prognostic factors include:

- Advanced age

- Coexisting diabetes

- Absent sensory response

- Muscle atrophy

Some studies do not show much improvement even after transposition of the ulnar nerve.
