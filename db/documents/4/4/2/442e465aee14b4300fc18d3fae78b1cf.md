The continuum of care for an ocular chemical burn may start with activating emergency medical services. Prehospital providers must ensure a safe environment for themselves and the injured patient by performing adequate decontamination. Early communication with the hospital-based team must include information about patient stability, mental status, any concerns for airway involvement, the suspected extent of injury, and information about the chemical agent if known. This will allow for the emergency department to be prepared for patient arrival. After the acute care providers have stabilized the patient, adequately irrigated the eyes, decontaminated the patient, and assessed the extent of injuries, a call must be placed to ophthalmology to discuss further care. Early consultation with ophthalmology will optimize patient care in the immediate stage when initial care is being provided by a generalist like the emergency medicine physician. Coordinated care with the hospital pharmacist may be needed to ensure the patient has access to the appropriate therapeutic agents in the early acute phase of the injury.
