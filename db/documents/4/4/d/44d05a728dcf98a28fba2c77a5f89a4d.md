Chronic pancreatitis has many complications including:

- Formation of a pseudocyst, which can obstruct the bile duct

- Recurrent acute pancreatitis, especially in alcoholics who continue to drink

- Splenic venous thrombosis

- Pancreatic ascites or pleural effusion (rare)

- Pseudoaneurysms (rarely of the vessels close to the pancreas)

- Pancreatic diabetes (later in disease course)

Of note, patients with chronic pancreatitis are at increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer.
