Carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) is an abnormal shunt from the carotid artery to the cavernous sinus. The symptomatology of CCFs is mainly a result of the effects on important neural and vascular structures in the cavernous sinus which include cranial nerves III, IV, V1, V2, and VI. CCFs can be classified based on the hemodynamic properties, the etiology, or the anatomy of the shunt. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of CCF and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes and types of carotid-cavernous fistula
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with carotid-cavernous fistula
- Summarize the treatment options for carotid-cavernous fistula
- Outline the importance of improving coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by carotid-cavernous fistula
