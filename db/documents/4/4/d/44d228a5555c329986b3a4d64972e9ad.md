Early development of the lateral geniculate nucleus characteristically demonstrates heightened retinogeniculate synaptogenesis (as early as 13 weeks of gestation) followed by the subsequent development of corticogeniculate connectivity. However, the structural development of retinogeniculate projections (without synapse formation) occurs as early as 7 weeks.
