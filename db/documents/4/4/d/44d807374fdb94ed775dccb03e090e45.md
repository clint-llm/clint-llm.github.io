The DPA supplies two closely associated muscles on the dorsum of the foot- the extensor hallucis brevis and the extensor digitorum brevis. The extensor hallucis brevis is the largest and most medially located muscle on the dorsum of the foot with its tendon attaching to the proximal phalanx of the great toe. The extensor digitorum brevis divides into three bellies with tendons ending at toes 2-4 to assist the extensor digitorum longus with toe extension. These muscles receive their vascular supply from the DPA and their innervation by the deep peroneal nerve.
