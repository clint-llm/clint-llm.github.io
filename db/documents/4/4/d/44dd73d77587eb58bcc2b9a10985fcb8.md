Closure of the physeal plates in both males and females in under the control of estrogen. Estrogen slows the proliferation, and hypertrophic changes in chondrocytes which then become replaces by bony elements. This is why Tilleau fractures usually occur at a younger age in females who will produce estrogen at an earlier age as compared to males. As the physeal plate closes, it closes in a distinct pattern. The central portion of the physis closes first followed by the anterior and medial portions. The anterior-lateral portion of the plate closes last. When an external rotatory force is applied to the physis, the weakest portion of the physis will fail first. This is the anterior lateral portion that will avulse or in other words fracture. As the force travels through the physis, it will reach a point where the physis is closed and then be directed through the weakest and most easily fractured part of the bone, the distal, bony epiphysis. This creates the classic Salter-Harris III fracture pattern of a Tillaux fracture.
