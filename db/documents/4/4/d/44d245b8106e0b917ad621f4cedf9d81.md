The risk of decompression sickness is reducible in several ways. Divers should avoid flying within 24 hours after their last dive and longer no-fly periods may be required based on dive profiles and guided by decompression tables or computers. The use of oxygen-enriched gas can also ameliorate risk if used on "air tables." Using a more conservative dive table or dive computer setting will likewise reduce risk. Isobaric decompression, breathing oxygen at depth, likewise can lessen the inert gas burden and reduce decompression sickness risk.

Cold exposure, heavy exercise, recent alcohol use, and dehydration all increase risk and should be avoided. Preliminary research also shows that exercise several hours before diving may be protective while exercise after diving may increase the risk of DCS.
