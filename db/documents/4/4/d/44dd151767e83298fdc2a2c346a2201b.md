To date, no management strategy has been found to cure bruxism; the treatment is directed at preventing further damage to the stomatognathic system.

Bruxism management relies on the recognition of the potential causative factors associated with the development of the condition. Diurnal bruxism can be managed by considering interventions such as habit modification, relaxation therapy, and biofeedback. In patients with sleep bruxism, which does not appear to be impacted by psychological or psychosocial factors,

Bruxism occurring in patients with neurogenic abnormalities such as dystonia may benefit from botox injection of the mastication muscles, which seems to decrease the frequency of parafunctional activity. Still, concerns have been raised regarding plausible adverse effects. Dietary counseling and management may be essential in some cases, such as excessive caffeine and tobacco use.

**Methods to Manage Bruxism**

The available treatments can be classified into occlusal, behavioral, and pharmacological.

**Occlusal Adjustments and Equilibration Therapy**

Premature contacts or occlusal interferences have been associated with the development of bruxism in the past, and some dental clinicians still advocate performing occlusal adjustments to treat bruxism. However, there seems to be no basis in evidence for performing such irreversible procedures since the etiology of the disorder is now known to be mainly regulated centrally, not peripherally.

The proposed idea that bruxism may be due to malocclusion makes orthodontic treatments viable options for managing the condition. But, this is still a controversy among dental clinicians and researchers, and there is no evidence to support it.

**Occlusal Splints**

Occlusal splints are worn at night on the maxilla or mandible,

Appliances vary in appearance and features. They may be constructed in the dental office or a laboratory and fabricated from hard or soft materials. Hard acrylic-resin stabilization splints are suggested to be more effective in reducing bruxism activity than soft splints. Soft-resin splints are more difficult to adjust than hard acrylic-resin devices and may increase the clenching behavior in some patients.

**Sleep Hygiene**

It is recommended to counsel patients on sleep hygiene practices, including avoiding tobacco, coffee, or alcohol at night, limiting physical activity and mental stimulation before going to sleep, and sleeping in a quiet and dark room.

**Psychotherapy**

Awake bruxism has been related to stress.

**Physical Therapy**

Physical therapy may be recommended if bruxism is associated with muscle pain and stiffness.

**Relaxation Training**

In this method, the patient is trained to relax the muscle group voluntarily.

**Biofeedback**

This technique utilizes positive feedback to enable the patient to learn tension reduction. It is based on the concept that bruxers can unlearn their behavior.

**Contingent electrical stimulation (CES)**

Contingent electrical stimulation (CES) intends to decrease the masticatory muscles activity by applying a low-level electrical stimulation when the muscles responsible for bruxism become active.

**Medication**

The use of drugs in treating bruxism should be limited to short periods and severe cases where occlusal devices and psychological approaches were ineffective.

Pharmacological management includes the use of antianxiety agents, tranquilizers, sedatives, and muscle relaxants. Medications such as diazepam can be prescribed for a few days to alter the sleep disturbance and anxiety level. Low doses of tricyclic antidepressants may be used to inhibit the amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.

**Botulin Toxin**

Botulin toxin, a neurotoxin synthesized by Clostridium botulinum,

Botulin toxin A injections in the masseter and temporal muscles have been demonstrated to improve the quality of life of patients with bruxism. Also, doses of <100UI carry a low chance of adverse effects.
