Treat victims of blast-burn napalm using a standard trauma evaluation paying careful attention not to over-focus on burns before the management of other life-threatening injuries.  Frequently early airway control and mechanical ventilation are required. Unstable patients may require chest thoracostomy, chest wound seals, escharotomy, blood transfusion, and prompt exploratory laparotomy or thoracotomy.  Unstable patients with high lactate levels and an enclosed space burn history may benefit from treatments aimed at cyanide toxicity. Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide exposure treatment is with supplemental oxygen.

Clinicians can achieve pain control with opioids, though the doses required may result in a drop in blood pressure or respiratory drive.  Alternatively, some military and civilian providers may use ketamine in either a low-dose or dissociative dose protocol to achieve initial control of pain.

While fluid resuscitation protocols for burns are well described, resuscitation in burn-blast victims may be complicated by blast injuries causing hemorrhage.  Some hypotensive patients will require a blood transfusion in addition to crystalloids. The volume of crystalloids infused for burn patients typically follows an algorithm such as the Parkland formula, which predicts fluid requirements over the first 24 hours from the time of the burn.  Four milliliters crystalloid per percent body surface area burned per kilogram of patient weight estimates the total volume for 24 hours, with half given in the first 8 hours from the time of the burn and the second half given for the remaining 16 hours.

Clinicians generally should transfer patients with napalm burns to a burn center, given the unusual nature of these burns and the tendency for complications such as keloids.
