Pulsus alternans (PA), not to be confused with pulsus paradoxus or electrical alternans, is an arterial pulse with alternating strong and weak beats. It is a hemodynamic phenomenon marked by a beat-to-beat alternation in the amplitude of the pulse resulting in a clinically identifiable pulse half of the electrical rate. In 1872, Ludwig Traube first described this phenomenon.

Pulsus alternans usually occurs in association with severe heart disease and can eventually lead to pulseless electrical activity.
