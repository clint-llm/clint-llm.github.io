The muscle cell, also known as the myocyte is the smallest subunit of all muscular tissues and organs throughout the body. It is here in the myocyte, where the physiological steps of muscle contraction and where the pathophysiology of numerous muscular diseases takes place. There are three types of muscle cells in the human body: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle. The common function of each specialized myocyte is the contraction of their various organs, some essential for life. Therefore, dysregulation of these crucial functions can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This article examines the role of the muscle myocyte in various systems, the physiology of myocyte contraction and the pathophysiology of diseases involving the myocyte.
