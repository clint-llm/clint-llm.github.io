Limited literature is available concerning toxicity in human subjects. However, a single dose of 583 mg sacubitril/617 mg valsartan in healthy volunteers and multiple doses of 437 mg sacubitril and 463 mg valsartan for 14 days were studied. Hypotension resulting from overdose requires prompt treatment. As mentioned in pharmacokinetics, sacubitril is converted to LBQ657. All three compounds (sacubitril, LBQ657, and valsartan) are highly bound (94% to 97%) to plasma protein. Hence, it is unlikely to be removed by hemodialysis.
