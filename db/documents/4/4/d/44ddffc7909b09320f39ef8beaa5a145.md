The rupture of the first liver schizont and the release of motile merozoites into peripheral circulation to invade red blood cells marks the start of a possible symptomatic infection. The first rupture and invasion are usually silent in most infected patients, but as the asexual cycle repeats itself in the next 24 to 48 hours, parasitemia rises, and immune response increases accordingly. It is usually associated with an increase of TNF alpha and other inflammatory markers in the cascade, including interleukin 10 (IL-10) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma).

The most important virulence determinant in P. falciparum infection is the parasiteÂ´s ability to modify the surface of the infected red blood cell, thus creating an adhesive phenotype. The cytoadhesion is mediated through the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1(PfEMP1) family, which is the product of var gene transcription. There is immense diversity in var genes in the parasite population, which has recently been a focus of research, due to its suggested association between increased transcription of specific var genes and the development of severe malaria.

In essence, the key features that render a fatal disease are the sequestration of P. falciparum in tissues, in conjunction with the up-regulation of cytokines and other toxic substances and an absence or an untimely provision of effective antimalarial therapy.
