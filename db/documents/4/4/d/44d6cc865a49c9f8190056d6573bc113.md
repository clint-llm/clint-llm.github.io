Two mechanisms may cause the lytic defect. The first is the pincer effect due to repeated hyperextension.

The spinopelvic balance and the global spinal alignment are essential in understanding the etiology, grading, and planning the treatment protocol.

- **Pelvic Tilt (PT)**is the angle measured between a line drawn from the center of the superior endplate of S1 to the center of rotation of the femoral head and the vertical reference line.

- **Sacral Slope (SS)**is the angle between the line drawn along the superior end of the S1 endplate and the horizontal reference line.

- **The Pelvic Incidence (PI)**is the angle between a line starting at the midline between centers of rotation of each femoral head drawn towards the midpoint of S1 superior endplate and a line perpendicular to the line drawn along the superior endplate of S1.[10]  The normal value is 50 degrees. An increased Pelvic Incidence (PI) is associated with higher severity of slips.**Pelvic Incidence = Pelvic Tilt + Sacral Slope**

- **Boxall’s Slip Angle**and**Dubosset’s lumbosacral angle**measures the relationship between L5 and S1.

Forward translation of the vertebrae may cause a narrowing of the spinal canal at the level of the slip. This situation is rare as most of the slips are only grade I or II, but the secondary canal and foraminal stenosis can occur due to subsequent degenerative changes in facet joints, hypertrophy of ligamentum flavum, hypertrophic fibrous repair tissue of the pars defect, or bulging of L5/S1 disc. In severe L5/S1 slips, the L5 nerve root is most commonly affected by being pulled forward by the superior vertebra.
