Cultural competence is important in the healthcare field and can play a role in active listening. Working and communicating with people from other cultures can alter the communication techniques outlined above. People from different cultures have their own set of "norms," and they do not necessarilyÂ conform to what people in the United States see as the "norm." Medical professionals need to attend training programs or informational sessions to understand different cultures, especially in the demographic region that they serve. These training sessions should be ongoing and include speakers of different ethnic backgrounds to speak on behalf of their culture and communication styles.
