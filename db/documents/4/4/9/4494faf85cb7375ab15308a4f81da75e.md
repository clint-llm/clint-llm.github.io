Molluscum contagiosum has not been shown to propagate in any sustainable manner outside of the basal keratinocyte, in vitro or otherwise, as such the disease is unlikely to spread beyond dermatological manifestations.

Variola, on the other hand, is much more indiscriminate and following a 2-week incubation phase, cab establish disseminated disease. Entering via the respiratory tract or mucosal lining, variola would start multiplying in the reticuloendothelial system before moving on into lymph nodes.

Clinically it starts with a prodromal phase lasting anywhere from 2 to 4 days. This involved severe headaches, backache, fever, arthralgia as well as other basic constitutional symptoms. Concluding eventually with a somewhat distinctive eruptive small red vesicular lesion inside and all over the oral cavity, including the tongue, oropharynx, palate mucosal membranes called “enanthema.”

The patient was supposedly infectious at this very point.

In less than 24 hours - the classic dimpled vesicular rash would begin to erupt – the “exanthema,” first in the face and extremities, this rash progressed more centrally to the trunk through the course of the illness. Somewhat uncommon for viral exanthems, they involved the palmar and plantar surfaces, and these would last the longest.

Not much is known about the systemic path to mortality (i.e., prognostic factors) – at least not to the equivalent degree of other extant viral syndrome or infections. Death was attributed to “toxemia” in relevant versus modern literature). What is known, however, is that immunomodulation and dysfunction were key; prokaryotic superinfections led to extensive morbidity, including pustular conversion of lesions, keratitis, pneumonia, and of course, sepsis.

Primary involvement with variola would not lend itself to be ignored; however, arthritis in children (metaphyseal fibroblast failure) and viral encephalitis were all well-known sequelae.
