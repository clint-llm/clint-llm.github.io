In Infants and children, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are the most common organisms isolated after hematogenous spread. In adults, it is usually S. aureus.

Infection can be caused by hematogenous spread or by direct inoculation of microorganisms into bone. Intravenous drug abuse has been linked to hematogenous osteomyelitis involving the long bones or the vertebrae.

Chronic refractory osteomyelitis is a subset of osteomyelitis that does not respond to standard antibiotic courses and surgical debridement. To be considered "chronic" and "refractory" most sources state that the infection must have been under appropriate culture-directed antibiotic therapy and surgical debridement as warranted for at least 6 weeks without improvement or healing.  A problem commonly seen in the wound clinic is the patient who whether through nonadherence with medical treatment, or lack of awareness on the part of the treating physician receives too short a course of antibiotic therapy, or lack of follow up imaging and lab work to assess the response to treatment.  These patients invariably return months later with a re-opened wound or draining sinus as the body tries to rid itself of the indolent infection in the bone.
