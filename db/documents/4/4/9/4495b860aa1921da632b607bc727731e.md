Pneumonia is a lower respiratory tract infection, specifically involving the pulmonary parenchyma. Viruses, fungi and bacteria can cause pneumonia. The severity of pneumonia can range from mild to life-threatening, with uncomplicated disease resolving with outpatient antibiotics and complicated cases progressing to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. It affects all age groups, accounts for over 2 million emergency visits annually, and is a leading cause of mortality in both adults and children. Atypical micro-organisms are known to cause a disproportionate disease burden in children and adolescents. This activity reviews the causes, presentation and diagnosis of atypical bacterial pneumonia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the bacteria known to cause atypical pneumonia.
- Review the presentation of a patient with atypical bacterial pneumonia.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for atypical bacterial pneumonia
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with atypical pneumonia.
