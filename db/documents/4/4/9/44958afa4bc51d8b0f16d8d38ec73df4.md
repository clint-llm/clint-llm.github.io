Both the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) and the American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS) have patient fact sheets that clinicians can give to patients suffering from rectoceles. ASCRS has patient education videos for many conditions, including pelvic floor dysfunction, which can be helpful with educating the patient on their rectocele.

There is a commercially available pelvic prolapse quantification tool where a physician can input the patient’s measurements, and the software creates a model with the patient’s anatomy. This tool is useful in explaining the severity of the rectocele to the patient. The patient education handouts provided with the tool also include a pessary care handout, which would be necessary for patients electing to use pessaries for their treatment.
