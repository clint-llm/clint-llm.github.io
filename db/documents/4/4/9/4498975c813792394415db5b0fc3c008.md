Causes of chronic pancreatitis include alcohol abuse, ductal obstruction (malignancy, stones, trauma), genetics (cystic fibrosis, hereditary pancreatitis), chemotherapy, and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or autoimmune pancreatitis. New studies are finding that deficiencies in certain vitamins and antioxidants may be linked to the disease.

The most common cause is alcohol consumption. The alcohol increase secretion of proteins from acinar cells, causing the fluid to become viscous, leading to ductal obstruction, acinar fibrosis, and atrophy. Fortunately, less than 10% of alcoholics develop

Inchronic pancreatitis, suggesting that other mechanisms play a role in the pathology.

Other common causes include:

- Hypercalcemia

- Hyperlipidemia (usually types 1 and V)

- Nutrition

- Obstruction of the duct (either congenital or acquired)

- Medications
