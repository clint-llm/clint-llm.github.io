Management of mycobacteria infections requires the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team, including family clinicians, NPs, and PAs, nursing staff, and pharmacists. If infection with atypical mycobacteria is suspected, an infectious disease specialist should be consulted to help guide diagnostic testing and treatment management. A pharmacist specialized in infectious disease treatment may also provide consultation. Coordination with surgical specialists is necessary for many presentations of mycobacterial disease. Diligent office managers and nursing staff are vital to treatment outcomes due to the need for frequent follow-up appointments and long term treatment in select patients.
