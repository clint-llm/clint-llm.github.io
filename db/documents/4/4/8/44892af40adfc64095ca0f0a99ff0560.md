Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a highly aggressive mature T-cell neoplasm associated with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection, which affects around 10 million people in the world. Of them, approximately 1-5% eventually develop symptomatic ATL.

ATL is classified into four clinical subtypes: acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering type. Aggressive ATL (acute, lymphoma, and chronic type with unfavorable prognostic factors) have a poor prognosis with an overall survival rate of less than a year. The favorable chronic and smoldering subtypes carry a relatively good prognosis, and watchful waiting is generally preferred until disease progression occurs. Patients whoÂ have rapidly progressive disease carry a poor prognosis due to the chemo-resistance of malignant cells and severe immunosuppression.
