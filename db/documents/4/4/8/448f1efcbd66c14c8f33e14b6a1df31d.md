Proper thyroid function is necessary for the proper development of the growing brain throughout embryologic development. Both iodine deficiency and congenital hypothyroidism, due to absence, malpositioning, underdevelopment, or failure to make thyroid hormones, can cause fetal hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism during embryologic development may result in intellectual disability, dwarfism, deafness, and muscle hypertonia.

If a portion of the thyroglossal duct fails to obliterate during the fifth week of development, an enclosed thyroglossal cyst or a thyroglossal sinus, which opens to the skin, may form. Alternatively, a portion of the developing thyroid gland may detach at any point along its descent, forming hormone-producing ectopic thyroid tissue. Most commonly, this occurs at the superior pole of the thyroid gland, forming the pyramidal lobe, which may be considered a normal anatomic variant and is present in up to half of adults.
