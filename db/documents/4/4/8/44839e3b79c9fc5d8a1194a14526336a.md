Chronic biceps tendon rupture is defined as a tendon tear for more than 4 weeks. Chronic rupture may be due to missed diagnosis or failure of conservative treatment. Partial tear or other coexisting pathology may complicate the diagnosis.Â MRI helps differentiate partial and complete tears of the biceps tendon.
