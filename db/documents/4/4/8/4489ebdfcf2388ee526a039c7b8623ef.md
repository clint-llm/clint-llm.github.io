The exact etiology of GCT is not fully understood yet. It remains uncertain whether it is a true neoplasm or just a reactive condition. A 20q11 amplification is seen in 54% of GCTs, over-expression of p53 in 20% of them. Centrosome amplification, and boosted telomerase activity with the prevention of telomeres shortening support a neoplastic etiology.
