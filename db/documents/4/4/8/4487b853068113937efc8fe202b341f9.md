Worldwide, the leading cause of constrictive pericarditis is tuberculosis, and the incidence is about 50% of patients with tuberculous pericardial effusion despite antitubercular therapy. In developed nations, the leading cause of this condition is idiopathic or post-viral infection with incidence being 40% to 60% of total cases. It is also a known complication of any cardiac surgery and is a fairly common complication of mediastinal radiation therapy with an incidence ranging from 2% to 30% in patients treated with radiation. It has also been associated with connective tissue disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupusÂ erythematosus (SLE). The diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis may be fairly simple however most of the time it is much more difficult to establish a cause. In many cases, a cause cannot be identified and is attributed to be an asymptomatic episode of viral pericarditis.
