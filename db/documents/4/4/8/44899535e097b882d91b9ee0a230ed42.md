After an injury, the skin attempts to restore its normal blood flow and function: this occurs through a very orderly three-phase process known as wound healing. The three steps or phases of wound healing are inflammation, proliferation, and maturation. A study by Dunkin et al. found permanent scars occur when the reticular dermis has been violated. Scars are a natural and normal part of healing following an injury to the integumentary system. Ideally, scars should be flat, narrow, and color-matched. Several factors can contribute to poor wound healing. These include but are not limited to infection, poor blood flow, ischemia, and trauma. Proliferative, hyperpigmented, or contracted scars can cause serious problems with both function and emotional well-being.
