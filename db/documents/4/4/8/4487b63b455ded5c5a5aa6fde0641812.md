Congenital syphilis is a serious infection with potential for long-term complications. In the United States, each CS case must result in notification to the public health department. Besides adequate treatment of both the infant and the mother, sexual partners of the mother need to be tested and adequately treated. The treatment of CS involves a team approach including infectious disease, neonatology, pediatrics, obstetrics, and nursing staff. Infectious disease specialists, pediatricians, and neonatologists are usually involved in the acute treatment of the disease. Pediatricians also have the task of following up on successful eradication of the disease and monitoring for disease complications. Obstetricians have the important task of testing pregnant women for syphilis and treating syphilis in pregnancy which significantly decreases the incidence of CS.

The US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) is an independent panel of national disease prevention and evidence-based medicine experts. The task force improves the health of all Americans by making evidence-based recommendations about clinical preventive services. USPSTF developed the current guidelines after an exhaustive review of current medical literature. A recent Cochrane review performed by USPSTF concluded Level A recommendation (high certainty of substantial net benefit) for screening for syphilis in pregnancy as well as screening for syphilis in high-risk individuals.
