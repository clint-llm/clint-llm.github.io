When sending a patient for cardiac surgery, the following preparations should be taken:

- Blood tests to assess a broad range of body systems function (kidney and liver function tests, coagulation, complete blood count [CBC], electrolytes)

- ECG to check for normal cardiac rhythmic activity

- Echocardiography and cardiac catheterization to detect coronary artery disease and valvulopathies

- Chest x-ray or chest computed tomography to visualize thoracic comorbidities and plan operative technique

- Ultrasound of the neck vessels to evaluate stroke risk

- Ultrasound of lower extremity veins as possible grafts

Carotid doppler ultrasound examination should be done in patients with left main disease, peripheral vascular disease, carotid bruits, history of CVA, history of heavy tobacco use, and age older than 65 years. When significant stenosis is detected, further tests might be necessary and endarterectomy performed.

Anticoagulation in the perioperative period needs special consideration. Platelet inhibiting drugs should be stopped before operation depending on the kind of medication. For example, clopidogrel should be stopped 5 days before surgery, ASA and heparin can be continued until the operation. The benefit of revascularization should be balanced with bleeding risk. Strategies to reduce bleeding complication in patients requiring urgent surgery under the impact of anticoagulation include OPCAB, coagulation diagnostic and adapted management giving coagulation factors and platelet transfusion, and antifibrinolytic agents.
