Given the amount of information regarding multiple physiological systems, CPET has relevance as a diagnostic tool for several conditions. Generally, the indications for use are classified into five areas:

- Determining the etiology of exercise limitation

- Assessing functional status

- Stratifying risk for surgery

- Predicting outcomes of specific disease processes

- Creating individualized exercise prescriptions for rehabilitation programs

In patients with heart failure, both with and without preserved ejection fractions, the test can identify those with exercise intolerance, a common problem in this disease process. Further, a landmark application of CPET to cardiology was the classification of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction based on peak oxygen consumption.

As a tool for risk stratification prior to surgery, CPET has been used for both thoracic and extra-thoracic pathologies.
