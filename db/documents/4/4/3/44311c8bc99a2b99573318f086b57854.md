Patients need counsel regarding infection prevention. This includes information regarding getting the pneumococcal vaccine,Â as well as the influenza vaccine, which in addition to helping prevent influenza, can thwart possible complications, such as pneumonia. If the patient smokes, they should receive strong counsel and support to stop, as it can preclude pneumonia and other health concerns. Addressing any underlying conditions (e.g., asthma, diabetes, congestive heart failure) can also help prevent pneumonia.
