Historical treatment options for disc herniations include intradermal injections (chemonucleolysis) with the goal of de-innervating the receptors of pain at the disc. The advancement of disc degeneration and the various other complications has resulted in this treatment falling out of favor. Future studies on the inhibition of molecular mediators of degeneration are promising. Similarly, while it is known that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a major contributor to the degeneration and pain associated with disc disease, placebo-controlled, randomized, controlled studies with TNF-alpha inhibitors showed negative outcomes in those treated patients, which shows that more research is needed to determine the best molecular strategies for treatment.

In regards to microdiscectomy postoperative rehabilitation, one study showed superior results when neuromuscular exercise programs were started 2 weeks post-surgery (compared to those starting at the traditional 6-week mark). Furthermore, at 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively, evidence shows that intensive exercise programs result in a more rapid short-term improvement of function as well as a return to work when compared to mild intensity programs. Most importantly, these studies show that the more aggressive and sooner-onset therapies did not alter the rates of re-herniation or reoperation.
