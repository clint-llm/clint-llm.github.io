Patients with symptomatic spinal cord compression will often present with some degree of back pain and neurologic complaints. In addition to etiologies discussed in this paper, the broad differential diagnosis should include spinal cord infarction, transverse myelitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, aortic pathology, including dissection/aneurysm, and acute myocardial infarction.

Among patients presenting with symptoms and exam findings suggestive of cauda equina syndrome, differential considerations include MSCC, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, and non-neoplastic causes, including intervertebral disc extrusion and osteoporotic fracture.

When extrinsic spinal cord compressive disorders are ruled out based on MR or CT myelography imaging in a patient with acute neurologic deficits, inflammatory, demyelinating, or toxin-related disorders must also be considered. These might include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Guillain-Barre syndrome, HIV myelopathy, botulism, multiple sclerosis, or transverse myelitis and warrant further evaluation with neurologic consultation, as well as additional studies, i.e., lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, electromyography (EMG).
