Femoral artery pseudoaneurysm consists of an outpouching of 1 or 2 layers of the vessel wall. A true aneurysm, on the other hand, involves all the 3 layers including the intima, media, and adventitia. Clinically, it may present with pulsatile hematoma, pain, ecchymosis, or with active extravasation. In chronic scenarios, once a fibrous capsule has been formed, it may present with a persistent flow communicating with the arterial lumen. This activity describes the causes, presentation and pathophysiology of femoral aneurysms and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of femoral aneurysms.
- Recall the presentation of a femoral aneurysm.
- List the treatment and management options available for femoral aneurysm.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with femoral aneurysms.
