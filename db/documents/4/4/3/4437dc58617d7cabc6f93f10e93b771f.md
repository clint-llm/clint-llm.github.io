The Thebesian vessels appear to have two main roles. First, the Thebesian vessels help to provide an additional route for perfusion and drainage of the myocardium.

The alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient is the difference in the partial pressure of oxygen between the alveolar and the arterial blood. A normal gradient is 5 to 10 mm Hg. This difference exists in part due to the physiologic shunting of blood from the right side of the circulation, containing deoxygenated blood, to the left side of the circulation, containing oxygenated blood. Known shunts in the adult cardiovascular circulation include the bronchial veins, which supply the conducting airways of the lungs, and the Thebesian vessels of the left side of the heart draining deoxygenated blood into the newly oxygenated blood of the left atrium and ventricle.
