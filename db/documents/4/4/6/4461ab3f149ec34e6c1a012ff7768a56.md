Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome is a well-delineated bilateral panuveitis that may mimic the presentation of sympathetic ophthalmia both on the clinical exam and on various imaging modalities. However, unlike sympathetic ophthalmia, VKH is not associated with prior ocular trauma or surgery and tends to follow a more set evolutional disease progression.

Classification criteria for early-stage VKH include evidence of either exudative retinal detachment or panuveitis with at least two neurologic signs (headache, tinnitus, dysacusis, meningismus, or cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis) and no history of prior ocular trauma or ocular surgery.

Classification for late-stage VKH includes evidence of early-stage VKH and either presence of a sunset glow fundus or uveitis with cutaneous findings of vitiligo, poliosis, or alopecia.

VKH demonstrates a higher prevalence in certain groups, including Asians, Hispanics, and Middle Easterners, and it tends to affect women with a higher frequency.

Patients with bilateral uveitis must also undergo a full systemic workup to rule out masquerading diseases such as lymphoma, tuberculosis, syphilis, and sarcoidosis.
