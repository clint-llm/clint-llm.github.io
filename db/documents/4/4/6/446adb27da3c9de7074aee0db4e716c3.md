Adenomyosis is a difficult diagnosis to manage as multiple clinical factors must be considered, including fertility, confidence in diagnosis, side effects of medical management, and risk of invasive procedures. Recent data showing an increased prevalence of adenomyosis in younger populations and asymptomatic patients reflects a spectrum of disease which is incompletely understood. Symptoms seem to correlate with the number of adenomyosis foci and the depth of invasion.
