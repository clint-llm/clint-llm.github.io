A pure bacterial culture remains crucialÂ to assess its virulence, its susceptibility to antibiotic therapy, and its genome sequence in order to facilitate the understanding and treatment of caused diseases. MAC's selective and differentiating properties as a culture medium allow isolating colonies of pure bacterial culture from a source sample. Typically in a clinical setting, the collected sample is placed on a panel of many growth media for identification and isolation of bacterial cultures.Escherichia coli and Campylobacter jejuni are some of the common causes of bacterial gastroenteritis. When bacterial gastroenteritis is suspected, the patient's specimen can be sampled and cultured on a panel of bacterial cultures, which includes MacConkey medium. MAC contributes to the identification of the causal agent by providing lactose-fermentation profiles in gram-negative species.
