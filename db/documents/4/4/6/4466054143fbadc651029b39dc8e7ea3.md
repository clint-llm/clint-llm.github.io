There are usually two main mechanisms that cause this type of injury: direct, and indirect. A direct mechanism of injury occurs as a crush injury to the joint region from an event such as a motor vehicle collision or industrial accident. Because of the mechanisms' high levels of force, there is usually no pattern or classic appearance. An indirect injury is more common than a direct injury and is often associated with sports participation. This mechanism of injury usually involves a longitudinal force while the foot is plantar flexed with a medial or lateral rotational force. Another frequent presentation is stepping awkwardly off a curb with the foot forcefully plantar flexed.
