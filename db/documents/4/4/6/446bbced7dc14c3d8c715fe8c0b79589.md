Anti-muscarinic drugs are a class of antisialagogue that works by competitively antagonizing acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors with minimal impact on nicotinic receptors.

If conditions such as infection cause dysfunction of the M2 receptors, severe hyperreactivity of the M3 receptors may ensue, which then causes increased secretion and bronchoconstriction. M3 receptors are exquisitely sensitive to any cholinergic stimulation, while M2 receptors are much less sensitive.
