**Limitations and Precautions**

BSID scores represent mostly the U.S. population. BSID assessment scores are impacted profoundly by testing conditions such as environmental, psychological, and physical. The development process is rapid so that a single assessment score will give only a snapshot of the current functioning level. BSID assessment is time-consuming and needs appropriate training. Knowing the strength and limitations will help to make diagnostic interpretations.

**Prematurity and BSID**

Preterm infants (born before 37 weeks gestation) are at risk for developmental delay.

**Risks**

There are no risks associated with administering BSID.
