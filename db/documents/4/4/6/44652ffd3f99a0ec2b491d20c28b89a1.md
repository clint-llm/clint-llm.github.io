A traumatic liver injury is common in both blunt and penetrating abdominal injuries. The liver’s anterior location in the abdomen, its fragile parenchyma, and the relative ease in which Gleeson’s capsule is violated makes it susceptible to injury from blunt forces. Its fixed location under the diaphragm also makes it susceptible to shear forces from deceleration injuries. The vasculature in the liver is made up of large but thin-walled vessels with high blood flow. The mechanism of injury for blunt abdominal trauma is often due to motor vehicle accidents, pedestrian accidents, and falls. Farming and industrial accidents can also lead to a number of liver injuries. In addition, the anterior location and large size relative to other abdominal organs make it prone to injury in penetrating abdominal penetrating trauma from gunshot or stab wounds. The right lobe of the liver is the most commonly injured portion in both blunt and penetrating injuries.
