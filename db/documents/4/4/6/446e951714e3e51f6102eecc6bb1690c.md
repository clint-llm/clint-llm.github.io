Urinary retention is rare in women and much more common in men due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). There are an estimated 3 to 7 cases per 100,000 women yearly, and the female-to-male ratio is 1 to 13.

Female urinary retention is also common after pelvic reconstructive surgeries and incontinence procedures. Preoperative voiding dysfunction and higher post-void residual volumes increased the risk for postoperative urinary retention.

Urinary retention is relatively common after a normal vaginal delivery, with 14% of women found to develop urinary difficulty immediately postpartum, typically recognized as not voiding by 6 hours after delivery.

Postoperative urinary retention after a cesarean section with epidural anesthesia will occur in about 25% of patients. Hysterectomy is also associated with postoperative urinary retention, which can be reduced by nerve-sparing techniques or otherwise minimizing pelvic dissection, which appears to cause some degree of recoverable denervation.

An unrecognized cystotomy as a complication of gynecologic surgery can also cause female urinary retention. The inadvertent cystotomy rate is reportedly about 1% to 3% after hysterectomy and 2% to 5% after retropubic sling surgery.
