Coronary artery fistulas areÂ often asymptomatic. The majority of presentations of patients with coronary artery fistulas are usually secondary to its complications. The following are the list of complications that could arise from coronary artery fistulas:

- Steal syndrome - Whereby blood is shunted away through the fistula, rendering decreased distal blood flow to the distal part of the original artery leading to myocardial ischemia.

- Thrombosis/embolism - Leading to myocardial infarction.

- Volume overload - Leading to cardiac failure.

- Arrhythmias

- Rupture - Leading to hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade.

- Endocarditis/endarteritis
