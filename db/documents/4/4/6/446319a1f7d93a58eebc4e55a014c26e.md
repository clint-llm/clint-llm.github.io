Interpleural analgesia provides a safe and effective regional anesthetic modality to improve pain control. The means by which interpleural analgesia works is likely by taking advantage of the retrograde spread of injectate to the intercostal nerves from the pleural cavity. It is particularlyÂ effective for thoracic and upper abdominal pain. The procedure may be used in the treatment of acute pain, but also for the treatment of chronic pain. Given the ease of performance, safety, and efficacy, interpleural analgesia may be deemed a reasonable alternative to epidural analgesia.
