Surgical excision occurs primarily through a closed hemorrhoidectomy (Ferguson technique), or open hemorrhoidectomy (Milligan-Morgan), which is more common in the United Kingdom and Europe. The Ferguson technique is the most common technique used in the United States, on which this article focuses.

The Hill Ferguson retractor is inserted in the anal canal to assess all three of the hemorrhoidal columns. The excision can be limited to only one column, but all three can be excised during the same operation if clinically indicated. The clinician should address the largest of the pathologic columns first.

The enlarged column should be compressed at the base with a DeBakey forceps to ensure the anoderm is tension free. A 10-scalpel blade is used to make an elliptical incision around the hemorrhoidal column. The pedicle is dissected off the surface of the internal anal sphincter using Mayo scissors up to the level of the pedicle. The pedicle is grasped with a large Kelly and is suture ligated with 3-0 Vicryl on a CT 2 needle. Deeper suture fixation of 3-0 Vicryl is used at the top of the anorectal ring to reduce the risk of recurrent prolapse. The suture is then used to close the rectal mucosa, anoderm, and perianal skin in a running fashion.

In addition to these conventional techniques, an additional surgical procedure is the stapled hemorrhoidopexy. During this procedure, the hemorrhoidal columns are not excised but are lifted above the anal verge and attached to each other. Studies show high rates of recurrence as well as microscopic incorporation of sphincter muscle in the resection specimens, which leads to transient flatus incontinence.
