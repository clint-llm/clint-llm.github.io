**Early T1-T2a Glottic Cancers**

Given the low incidence of nodal metastasis and the small, slow-growing nature of the primary lesion, early T1-2 glottic cancers can be managed very successfully with single-modality treatment. Transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) and radiotherapy are the most commonly employed treatments for early glottic cancer. Although there is no direct comparison in a randomized controlled trial, a Cochrane review has noted equivalent survival outcomes and local disease control in both methods.

The fundamental principles of transoral laser microsurgery are the preservation of the cricoid cartilage and of at least a single crico-arytenoid joint, failure of which can result in a narrowed airway and a non-functional larynx respectively.

Radiotherapy regimes for glottic cancers vary between centers. Usually, they range from 50–52 Gy in 16 fractions or 53–55 Gy in 20 fractions over three to four weeks, with a higher dose per fraction resulting in improved locoregional control for both T1 and T2 lesions.

Partial laryngectomy is less commonly performed for primary early glottic cancers but offers a viable alternative to radiotherapy and TLM in experienced centers. Systematic reviews have demonstrated comparable oncological outcomes in both de novo and radio-recurrent cancers to radiotherapy and TLM.

**Moderately Advanced T2b-T3 Glottic Cancers**

At present, UK and US guidelines advise organ preservation therapy for moderately advanced glottic cancer in the form of chemoradiotherapy.

Furthermore, a 10-year follow-up study confirmed the long term survival benefits of the concurrent chemotherapy group but did note a higher rate of non-cancer deaths in this treatment arm.

**Advanced T4 Glottic Cancer**

Chemoradiotherapy may be used effectively in some advanced T4 cancers; however, the high rate of the thyroid cartilage and neck soft tissue invasion means many patients will be unsuitable for laryngeal preservation and will require surgery in the form of total laryngectomy. The Veterans affairs study noted T4 laryngeal tumors had a reduced response to chemotherapy and a higher rate of salvage surgery, suggesting organ preservation is not effective in advanced laryngeal cancer.

**Postoperative Treatment**

Postoperative radiotherapy can improve locoregional outcomes in advanced head and neck cancer, and is therefore recommended in any T4 tumors, T2-3 lesions with significant nodal disease, and any patient with positive margins or extra-nodal extension.

**Treatment of Nodal Disease**

The rate of nodal disease in glottic cancer is considerably lower than the supraglottic disease, where bilateral elective neck dissection or nodal irradiation is advised even in clinically N0 necks.

In patients undergoing total laryngectomy, elective bilateral neck dissection for staging purposes is essential, which may prevent the need for postoperative radiotherapy if no positive nodes are present. In patients who have failed to show a complete response following completion of treatment, or before chemoradiotherapy in patients with significant volume neck disease that are less likely to respond to primary oncological treatment, neck dissection is considered.
