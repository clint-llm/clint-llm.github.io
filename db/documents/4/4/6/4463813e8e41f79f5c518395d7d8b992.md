The biggest challenge for the interprofessional health team in the case of FMF is to reach a diagnostic conclusion which might take a fair amount of time. Provider education of FMF is equally important not only in the areas where FMF is common but also in other parts where it is not as common. Thorough history taking skills are critical, and detailed family history and history of attacks can lead to the diagnosis. The team of clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists should all work closely with patients with FMF while initiating therapy with colchicine and assist patients in every possible way to help overcome its side effects and improve compliance.
