Interprofessional communication will be important to the management of shellfish toxicity. Upon identifying shellfish toxicity as the cause of a patient's symptoms, healthcare providers should contact their public health colleagues to discuss the diagnosis as well as a detailed patient history. Identifying how and where the patient contracted shellfish toxicity will be vital to preventing disease in others. Likewise, after an outbreak has been identified, public health officials should communicate with healthcare providers about likely sources of toxicity so that providers are aware of the sympoms and can ask patients about their potential exposure to the toxin. For large outbreaks, care coordination among multiple physicians, nurses, and hospitals may be necessary. (Level V)
