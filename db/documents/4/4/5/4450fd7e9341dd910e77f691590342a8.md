TB remains a significant public health threat worldwide, causing an estimated 10.4 million new infections and 1.4 million TB deaths in 2015. Present epidemiological forecasts indicate only marginal improvement in the elimination of TB as measured by acute disease, fatalities, and antibiotic resistance. The downward trend in such indicators underwent an evaluation to determine if the original 2020 goals were achieved, which included estimations of strengthened attempts to enhance treatment plans and prevention of TB. The belief was that if the rate evolved in a positive direction, it could have met the 2020 targets of the End TB Strategy. In most cases, initial infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is prevented or suppressed by the host immune response, and the diseaseâ€™s persistence is residual.

Conversely, tuberculosis could continue growing as it has the potential to be reactivated with resultant active TB. Diagnosis and management of both active and latent TB can significantly reduce the risk of developing the disease and are essential TB control strategies, particularly in settings with low TB incidence where the reactivation of LTBI often accounts for the majority of pre-imported TB infection.
