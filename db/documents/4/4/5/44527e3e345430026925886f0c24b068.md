The fibrates are a type of amphipathic carboxylic acids belonging to the class of drugs used to lower serum cholesterol levels. They are currently the most important class of drugs combating the worldwide epidemic of atherogenic dyslipidemia. Statins help reduce the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) but do not exert much of an effect on serum triglyceride or HDL levels, where the use of fibrates is required. Research shows that the effects of different fibrate medications, while essentially being the same, differ slightly regarding their impact on glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, intermittent claudication, and microvascular effects of diabetes mellitus; this provides the option of tailoring therapy as per the needs of every patient.

- For use as an adjunct to dietary modifications (restricted in saturated fats and cholesterol) in adults with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson type IIa and IIb). Fibrates help to reduce serum LDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B (Apo-B) and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL).

- To be used, an adjunct to dietary modifications in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson type IV and V).

A non-FDA-approved use of fibrates is primary biliary cholangitis.
