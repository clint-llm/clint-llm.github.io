Angelman syndrome (AS) is caused by a pathologic lack of expression of the UBE3A gene on the maternal chromosome in combination with physiologic genomic imprinting or silencing on the paternal chromosome in neurons. UBE3A gene is an example of an imprinted gene because it is expressed in a parent of origin-specific manner. The paternal UBE3A gene is imprinted mainly in the neurons and has some level of expression in the rest of the body.

AS is typically caused by a sporadic de novo mutation on the maternal gene UBE3A (part of the ubiquitin pathway) at chromosome 15q11-13. Around 70 to 75% of cases arise from maternal deletion within chromosome 15q11-q13, containing this gene. Approximately 2% to 3% can be due to paternal uniparental disomy (UPD), imprinting center defect (3% to 5%), or single gene point mutation in the maternal UBE3A allele (5 to 10%).

Inherited causes of AS are mostly either due to UBE3A mutation (mainly in the mother's paternally inherited allele), which is inherited by the baby and a subtype of imprinting defects called submicroscopic deletion of imprinting center.
