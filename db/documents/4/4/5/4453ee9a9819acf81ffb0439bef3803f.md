It is essential to monitor patients for unusual changes in behavior, anxiety, suicidality, or any other clinical signs of worsening illness. Regularly evaluate for depression and suicidality, especially when changing the dose of sertraline. Sertraline may also precipitate mania in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Monitor for symptoms of mania in patients who are started on sertraline, especially if they have a family history ofÂ mania or bipolar disorder.

Monitor for abnormal bleeding, adverse effects of medication use, or withdrawal symptoms from abrupt discontinuation in patients taking sertraline. The abnormal bleeding may primarily occur if used concurrently with aspirin, NSAIDs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants, as sertraline may impair platelet aggregation and cause bruising, epistaxis, or hemorrhage.

For geriatric patients, monitor for changes in mental status, and check their sodium concentration regularly due to the risk of SIADH or hyponatremia.

Sertraline is considered safe in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, heart failure, and other cardiac conditions. However, due to the minor effect of QT prolongation, it may benefit the provider to monitor the QT interval with electrocardiograms.

Sertraline is also considered safe in pregnancy and with breastfeeding. Although not mandatory, therapeutic drug monitoring may be a consideration to ensure the safety of pregnant patients and infants who may have exposure to the medication.
