The RER is morphologically distinguishable by its series of convoluted, flattened like membrane sheets (called cisternae) that arise near the nucleus and extend across the cytoplasm. Sections of the cisternae contain ribosomes, held together by microtubules of the cytoskeleton. Changes in the pattern of microtubule polymerization lead to a change in RER morphology. Furthermore, the ribosomes of the RER are not permanently attached to the membrane. They constantly attach and detach to the membrane as needed for protein synthesis.

Edges of the ER sheets tend to have a degree of high-curvature that require stabilization. Proteins that help with this stabilization are reticulons and DP1/Yop1p. These integral membrane proteins contribute to the curvature by forming a transmembrane hairpin that acts as a wedge.
