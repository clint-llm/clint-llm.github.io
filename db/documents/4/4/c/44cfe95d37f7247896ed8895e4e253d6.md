Lipids, such as cholesterol or triglycerides, are absorbed from the intestines and are carried throughout the body via lipoproteins for energy, steroid production, or bile acid formation. Major contributors to these pathways are cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). An imbalance of any of these factors, either from organic or nonorganic causes, can lead to dyslipidemia.
