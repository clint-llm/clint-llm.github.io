Hypocalcemia is the most important stimulus for increased secretion of PTH from parathyroid glands in SHPT. The increased stimulation also results in parathyroid hyperplasia. Increased PTH level results in increased calcium and phosphate absorption from the gut. PTH acts as a stimulus for increased osteoclast activity, which results in calcium and phosphorus resorption from the bone.

Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is secreted by osteocytes and plays an important role in phosphorus homeostasis by increasing phosphorus clearance in the renal tubules.

In chronic kidney disease, decreasing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) leads to increased secretion of PTH. Decreasing GFR leads to decreased phosphate clearance and hyperphosphatemia, which then stimulates the parathyroid glands to secrete PTH.
