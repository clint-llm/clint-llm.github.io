Newborn screening confers substantial benefits. Early detection of hearing loss has an estimated lifetime economic savings of greater than $400,000 per patient identified.

Newborn screening is an enormous healthcare initiative that requires the dedicated effort of the entire healthcare team. The principle opportunities for improvement involve screening procedures, family education, infant follow-through, and future directions.

**Screening Procedures**

A screening program of this magnitude requires significant administrative support. The equipment must be maintained, with the audiology equipment calibrated yearly.

**Family Education**

The obstetric team may play an increasing role in patient education regarding the process and value of newborn screening. Obstetricians should ensure that each mother has selected a pediatrician early in her second trimester for a seamless postpartum transition of care. Intake and triage staff should verify the current patient contact information. Nurses on the labor and delivery, as well as postpartum units, have perhaps the greatest opportunity to explain to the infant’s caregivers the role of newborn screening and the importance of close follow-up.

**Infant Follow-through**

Pediatricians and family physicians, when encountering positive newborn screening results, will need to promptly order follow-up tests and offer general counseling to the infant’s family. Providers should have a low threshold for referring families to geneticists and other specialists for more advanced counseling, whether concerning the infant’s prognosis or the parents’ future reproductive decisions.

**Future Directions**

Biomedical research is needed to expand the capacity and improve the precision of screening. A pharmaceutical investigation is required to offer effective intervention. As diagnostic and therapeutic technologies advance, specialists are needed to advocate for the inclusion of diseases into the recommended uniform screening panel. Furthermore, representation in government is needed to ensure appropriate screening legislation and adequate funding allocation. As always, the healthcare field should remain engaged in discussions of the ethical implications of newborn screening.
