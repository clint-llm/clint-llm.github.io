The abdominal fascia layers are essential considerations when it comes to surgery of the abdomen. Care is necessary to avoid important structures running within the fascial planes. Closure of the fascia is important to prevent dehiscence and the creation of possible sites of herniation and seromas. There are two main types of closures: mass closure with skin closure or individual fascial closure with skin closure. The mass closure is associated with fewer recurrences of herniations and seroma formation due to the closure of the space between the Camper's and Scarpa's fascia. Individual fascia closure runs the risk of creating a space between the layers, leading to the increased potential of a seroma and dehiscence. It is recommended to use a continuous suture with slowly absorbable sutures to decrease the incidence of herniation.

In the realm of obstetrics, the appropriate approximation of the Camper's fascia is of particular importance during cesarean delivery. In patients with >2 cm of subcutaneous adipose tissue, the approximation of the subcutaneous tissue has shown to reduce the risk of postoperative wound disruption after cesarean delivery.
