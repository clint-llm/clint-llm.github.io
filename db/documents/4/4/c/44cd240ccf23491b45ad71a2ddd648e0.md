Involvement of the bladder with an inguinal hernia is estimated to occur in 1% to 4% of all inguinal hernias and is more common than involvement of the ureter. Urologic organ involvement should be considered in any patient presenting with urologic symptoms in conjunction with an inguinal hernia.

The differential diagnosis includes the following:

- Inguinal hernia with bowel, omentum, or extraperitoneal fat

- Femoral hernia

- Hydrocele or varicocele

- Urologic malignancy

- Malignancy of the pelvic organs or retroperitoneal space
