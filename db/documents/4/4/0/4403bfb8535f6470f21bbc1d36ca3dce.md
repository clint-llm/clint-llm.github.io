Clinical examination is often sufficient in congenital or acquired—Iris ectropion syndromes. In bilateral neonatal congenital iris ectropion, genetic evaluation has been done. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy, gonioscopy, intraocular pressure measurement, and fundus evaluation are routinely performed. Anterior segment photography helps in documenting the disease.

Depending on the etiology, ultrasound biomicroscopy, anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fundus fluorescein angiography may be done. Specifically, evidence of peripheral capillary nonperfusion has to be looked for in the eyes with ectropion uveae. Ultrawide field fundus fluorescein angiography can pick up the peripheral areas of capillary nonperfusion even in small pupil and media haze.

The management of glaucoma needs evaluation of the central corneal thickness, OCT of the optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer, posterior segment photo, and Humphrey visual fields.
