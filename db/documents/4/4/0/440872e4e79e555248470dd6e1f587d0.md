Sanitation, meat inspection, and preparation are the cornerstone to preventing human infection of all three tapeworms. Â Since a single tapeworm can produce thousands of eggs per day, the environment can be easily contaminated if lacking basic hygiene.

The best prophylaxis for Diphyllobothrium is to avoid consumption of raw, smoked, or pickled fish. Fish should be well cooked or alternatively frozen for 24 to 48 hours at -18 C. The FDA recommends that fish intended to be consumed raw should be blast frozen to -35 C or below for 15 hours or frozen to -20 C or below for 7 days.

The current practice to prevent T. solium in pigs includes visual inspection of the meat for cysticerci. However, some studies suggest that inspection alone is not sufficient for control of bovine cysticercosis.Taenia. T. solium is killed by cooking pork to an internal temp of 65C (150F) or freezing at -20 C (-38 F) for at least 12 hours. Neither pickling nor salt-curing pork ensures infection prevention. For T. saginata, cook beef to an internal temperature of 56C (131F) or freeze at -10 C for 5 days. Pickling beef in 25% brine for 5 to 6 days is believed to render beef safe.
