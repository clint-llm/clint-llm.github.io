Isolated hypertelorism is rare. Thus it is important to evaluate a patient with hypertelorism for additional physical exam findings. Hypertelorism is typically noted at birth, and sometimes even before birth as fetal ultrasound becomes more sophisticated. Hypertelorism associated with medial clefting of the face and/or dysplasia of nasal capsule development is more likely to have other congenital anomalies. In one study evaluating prenatally diagnosed hypertelorism, karyotypic aneuploidy was the most common finding occurring in 82% of fetuses. All 11 fetuses showed additional anomalies of the nervous system (n = 10), skeleton (n = 6), heart (n = 5), kidneys (n = 5) and/or abdomen (n = 3).

Hypertelorism associated with craniofacial synostosis may be syndromic or nonsyndromic. Of the craniosynostosis syndromes, Apert syndrome is associated with a sunken appearance of the midface, beaked nose, teeth crowding second to the underdeveloped maxilla, vision problems second to shallow eye sockets, mild to moderate intellectual disability, syndactyly or polydactyly, hyperhidrosis, and cleft palate.

Ultimately, the physical exam is variable, depending on the underlying etiology of hypertelorism. Thus, when hypertelorism is discovered as a physical finding, a full head to toe physical exam is necessary to identify additional dysmorphic features or congenital abnormalities.
