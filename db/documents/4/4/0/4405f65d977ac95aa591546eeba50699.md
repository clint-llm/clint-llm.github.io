Allergic conjunctivitis is a common, under-appreciated, and largely benign process. It is rarely vision-threatening but can significantly decrease the quality of life for patients. There are three subtypes of simple allergic conjunctivitis: acute, seasonal, and perennial. There is considerable overlap with atopic conjunctivitis (vernal and atopic keratoconjunctivitis) and giant papillary conjunctivitis in both treatment and certain aspects of pathophysiology.Â As such, these are all considered to be ocular allergies. Initial treatment strategies can be similar, although outcomes and rates of complications vary.
