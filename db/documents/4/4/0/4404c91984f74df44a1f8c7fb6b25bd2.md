During the acute phase, parasitemia is high, and the diagnosis of Chagas disease is made by visualizing the parasite under microscopy.

There is minimal parasitemia with the chronic phase; therefore, T. cruzi PCR is less reliable, and the detection of serum antibodies is necessary.  These tests are typically enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or immunofluorescent antibody tests (IFAT) and rely on the detection of IgG antibodies against T. cruzi.

In patients diagnosed with Chagas disease, evaluation for visceral organ involvement should be performed. This is mainly done with a thorough history to identify early symptoms. Cardiac assessment for those with a history of Chagas disease includes electrocardiogram and echocardiogram.  Common electrocardiographic findings are right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, first degree AV node block, atrial flutter/fibrillation.
