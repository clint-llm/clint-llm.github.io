The pathophysiology of akathisia is poorly understood. Extrapyramidal side effects, particularly acute dystonia and pseudoparkinsonism, are thought to be due to an imbalance of dopamine and acetylcholine in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain induced by antipsychotic agents blockade of dopamine type-2 receptors. Dystonia and pseudoparkinsonism are often managed with concomitant anticholinergic agents such as benztropine. Akathisia is also observed with antipsychotic agents which block dopamine type-2 receptors, and this supports the notion thatÂ it is also linked to diminished dopamine transmission in the brain. However, akathisia does not generally respond to anticholinergic agents, suggesting an alternative pathophysiologic mechanism.
