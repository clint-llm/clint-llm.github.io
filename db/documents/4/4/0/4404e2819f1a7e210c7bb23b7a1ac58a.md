Any patient presenting with hallucinations and vision loss should undergo a detailed evaluation by an ophthalmologist and a neurologist.

The psychiatrist and the rehabilitation therapist also play an essential role in these patients. All patients should undergo a mini-mental state examination by a neurologist, and if needed, a psychiatric evaluation should be done if there is cognitive decline.
