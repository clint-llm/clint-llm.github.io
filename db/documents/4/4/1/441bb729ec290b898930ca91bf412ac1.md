The initial approach to any trauma patient is described in the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) course; it is a structured and standardized approach. The approach is meant to recognize and stabilize life-threatening injuries first. It is important to note an initial detailed history is not essential to begin evaluating a patient with acute injuries. The emergency medical services personnel bringing the patient to the trauma bay will provide a brief history of present illness. After the initial evaluation and stabilization of the patient, a detailed history can be obtained. Some useful information includes the mechanism of injury, whether ambulatory at the scene, bowel or bladder incontinence, and any numbness or weakness. Gross hematuria or blood at the urethral meatus can be a tip-off of genitourinary injury.

Patients with urethral injuries often present with blood at the urethral meatus, perineal laceration or ecchymosis, scrotal hematoma, urinary retention, superiorly displaced prostate on digital rectal exam, or an inability to pass foley catheter.
