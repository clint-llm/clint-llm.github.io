Successful organ transplantation and good quality of life for patients requires all members of the healthcare team to work together to provide bedside care, education, physical and psychosocial support, and continued follow-up examinations. Educating residents, organ transplant coordinators, specialty trained nurses, pharmacists, and mid-level practitioners on the latest research are vital in promoting the best perioperative and postoperative care.

Cancer screening and surveillance should be standard practice for healthcare policies in clinics and hospitals. All members of the team should be made aware of dermatological inspections, sun protection programs, and self-screening tools for all patients as a protocol in the posttransplant period. All the protocols should be standardized.

Transplant nurses arrange follow up for these patients, provide education to the patients and their families, monitor patient status, and provide feedback to the team. Pharmacists counsel patients about side effects, screen for drug-drug interactions, and assess compliance. These measures improve outcomes. [Level 5]
