The formation of the subphrenic abscess occurs after bowel content, and gut bacteria contaminate the peritoneal cavity.Â A retrospective review of 52 patients between 1974 and 1988 showed most infections to be polymicrobial, with predominantly aerobic isolates with Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp, Enterobacter, and Staphylococcus aureus. The most common anaerobes are Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides fragilis,
Clostridium spp, and Prevotella.

Staphylococcus aureus is the most common isolate after gastric surgery, and Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium spp are the most common after colon surgery and/or appendicitis. Enterococcus group D predominates after biliary surgery, and Fusobacterium and Prevotella species are the cause following gastric or duodenal surgery. Risk factors include previous abdominal surgery that involved significant contamination from the gastrointestinal tract such as perforated appendicitis, gastric ulcer, or diverticulitis, gastric and intestinal perforation, mesenteric ischemia, appendicitis, trauma, empyema, and sepsis.
