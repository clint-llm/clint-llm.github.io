There are several differential diagnoses to keep in mind when evaluating a patient for restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM).

- Constrictive pericarditis

- Acute or chronic heart failure

- Hypertensive heart disease

- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

- Acute or chronic pericarditis

Constrictive pericarditis (CP) is the most commonly mistaken for restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) out of the list above. That is why it is essential to explore the similarities and differences in more detail. The two diseases present almost identically, except for a few key signs and symptoms. Juglar venous distension, Kussmaul sign, and diastolic sounds are both seen in RCM and CP. However, there are some subtle differences. For example, S3 and elevated BNP are far more common in RCM. Whereas a pericardial knock, pericardial calcifications on chest x-ray, pericardial thickening on imaging, and BNP levels less than 100 are more likely seen in constrictive pericarditis. Furthermore, one clear difference between the two diseases is the presence of ventricular interdependence. Ventricular dependence seen only in CP is described as an increased filling of one of the ventricles only, with a reciprocal decreased filling of the other ventricle.
