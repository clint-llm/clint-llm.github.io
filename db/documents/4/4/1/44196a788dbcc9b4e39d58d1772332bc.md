Management of floppy eyelid syndrome can be divided into medical and surgical. The patient is first treated with a conservative approach, including artificial tears, nighttime ophthalmic ointment, eyelid taping, and shielding. If there is significant ocular inflammation, anti-inflammatory agents can be considered. Patients must treat underlying OSA with a CPAP machine, as properly managed OSA can improve the FES grade and dry eye symptoms. If a patient fails conservative treatment, surgical management can be considered. Various surgical techniques are currently employed for the correction of eyelid laxity. A lateral tarsal strip procedure can shorten the eyelid length and reduce laxity.

While this technique was mostly employed for the lower eyelids, it has recently become an option for upper eyelid disease.
