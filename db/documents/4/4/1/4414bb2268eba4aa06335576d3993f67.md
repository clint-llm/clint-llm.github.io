There is no curative treatment for DM. Thus, maximizing health and functional independence is the goal of supportive management. This is geared towards monitoring and treating all the medical issues associated with DM.

**Medical Treatment**

Cardiovascular: Cardiac monitoring with a 12-lead electrocardiogram should be performed in all patients once diagnosed with DM and annually to monitor cardiac conduction disturbances. Baseline cardiac imaging should be performed and serially every 1 to 5 years thereafter.

Pulmonary: Obtaining a baseline and serial pulmonary function testing to monitor for neuromuscular respiratory failure.

Daytime somnolence and obstructive sleep apnea: Evaluate for sleep apnea and prescribe continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) if required. Neurostimulants such as methylphenidate can be considered for excessive sleepiness.

Ocular involvement: Annual eye exam that includes slit-lamp examination is recommended annually. Surgical removal of cataracts that impair vision and function.

Obstetrics and gynecology care: A high-risk obstetrics evaluation is indicated for patients who are pregnant or considering pregnancy due to the risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, and respiratory difficulties during pregnancy.

Endocrine issues: These patients are at increased risk of diabetes mellitus from insulin resistance; thus, a baseline and annual fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1C are recommended. Screening for hypothyroidism is also required. Since primary hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction are commonly seen in men with DM1, questioning about erectile dysfunction is suggested and accordingly treated if low testosterone is detected on further testing.

Myotonia: Medications that reduce sustained myotonia are used and include sodium channel blockers such as mexiletine, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or calcium antagonists. Sodium channel blockers are contraindicated in those with second and third-degree heart block.

**Therapy**

Physical and occupational therapy is recommended for strengthening weakened muscles, evaluation for orthotics, and durable medical equipment needs. Speech-language pathology (SLP) is required for dysphagia and swallowing studies or dysarthria as indicated. SLP is also utilized for intellectual disabilities and learning strategies.
