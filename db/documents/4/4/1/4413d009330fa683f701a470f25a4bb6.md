Hepatitis D virus infection is an acute and chronic inflammatory process transmitted parenterally. Hepatitis D replicates independently within hepatocytes but requires hepatitis B surface antigen for propagation. Hepatic cell death occurs due to direct cytotoxic effects of hepatitis D virus or a host-mediated immune response.
