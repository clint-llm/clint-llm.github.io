Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas in organs. This condition mostly affects young adults and characteristically presents with reticular opacities in the lungs and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Other involved sites include eyes, skin, and joints, and in some cases, the reticuloendothelial system, musculoskeletal system, exocrine glands, heart, kidney, and central nervous system. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of sarcoidosis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the characteristic signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis. 
- Explain how to diagnose sarcoidosis.
- Describe the appropriate monitoring for asymptomatic, non-progressive sarcoidosis. 
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to monitor symptoms and progression of the asymptomatic disease, which will improve outcomes for patients with sarcoidosis.
