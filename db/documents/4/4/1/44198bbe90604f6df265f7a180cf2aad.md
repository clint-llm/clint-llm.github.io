The prognosis for isolated TEF is generally good.

Children with EA/TEF tend to have considerable deficiencies in their growth. Primarily, poor in utero development has been noted, with almost one third having birth weights less than the 5th percentile.

Respiratory complications are also common in children with TEF/EA.  Severe tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia occur in 10% to 20% of infants. Airway reactivity and instability can lead to life-threatening airway obstruction.

Once children reach late adolescence, respiratory morbidity decreases in frequency and severity.
