The TFL can become clinically significant in cases of tightening, friction between over bony prominences, or through its attachment to the IT band. The TFL can become tight, especially in situations of prolonged shortening, such as in a seated position. A shortened TFL can lead to an anterior tilt of the pelvis and/or medial rotation of the femur.

External snapping hip syndrome is a condition where patients describe a palpable snap on the lateral aspect of their hip that occurs with a variety of movements. Though this syndrome has multiple etiologies, the most common etiology is due to the IT band moving over the greater trochanter. This is thought to be due to a thickening of the posterior band of the IT fascia. Though patients will often not complain of pain from this syndrome, it can progress to become painful. Treatment is typically conservative with oral NSAIDs and physical therapy.

IT band syndrome is a common overuse injury observed in runners and cyclists. Patients describe lateral-sided knee pain. The etiology of IT band syndrome is controversial, although many authors agree the etiology can be divided into three main categories:

- IT band friction over the lateral femoral epicondyle,

- Compression of the fat and connective tissue deep to the ITB, and

- Chronic inflammation of the IT band bursa.

Treatment of IT band syndrome is conservative, starting with NSAIDS, physical therapy, and possibly a corticosteroid injection.

Geriatric patients may often suffer from weakened TFL actions due to Vitamin B12 deficiency.
