Fox-Fordyce disease (FFD), the eponym for apocrine miliaria, is a rare chronic inflammatory skin disorder of the apocrine glands characterized by a pruritic papular eruption in the apocrine gland-rich parts of the body, including the axillae, areolae, anogenital region, among others. This disorder was first described in 1902 by George Henry Fox and John Addison Fordyce as pruritic papules in the axillae.
