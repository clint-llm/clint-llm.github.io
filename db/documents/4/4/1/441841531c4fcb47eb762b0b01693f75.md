FDA-approved medications to improve cognitive function include cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. Cholinesterase inhibitors include donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine. Cholinesterase inhibitors prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine and aim to slow or delay the worsening of symptoms. Memantine is an NMDA antagonist and decreases the activity of glutamine. Donepezil is approved for all stages of Alzheimer disease, rivastigmine is approved for all stages of Alzheimer disease in its patch form, and mild to moderate stages with oral formulations. Galantamine is approved for mild to moderate stages, and memantine for moderate to severe stages.

Aducanumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody directed against amyloid beta that was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of mild Alzheimer disease. Its approval remains highly controversial. The drug is costly and does not have clear, proven clinical benefits. It was approved based on positive clinical results seen in only one of the two phase III trials, as well as aducanumab's effect on a surrogate endpoint (reducing amyloid beta plaques in the brain), which has not been proven to be clinically significant.

Lifestyle modifications to optimize cognitive function include optimizing sleep, eating an anti-inflammatory diet, adequate exercise, treating hearing or vision loss, minimizing stress, and maintaining normal blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels.

Behavioral symptoms include irritability, anxiety, and depression. Antidepressants and sometimes antipsychotics can help with these symptoms. In addition, non-drug approaches like supportive care, memory training, physical exercise programs, and mental and social stimulation must be employed in symptom control.

Patients and their families should be counseled about the disease and its consequences. They should be provided with all the necessary information in regard to what to expect and how to react to it. Patients and their families should also be encouraged to seek social service consultations and to register with support groups and societies. Coaching caregivers on skills such as redirection and reassurance as opposed to repeated correction of patients confused due to dementia can avoid or de-escalate possible behavioral symptoms. Driving restrictions may have to be imposed.
