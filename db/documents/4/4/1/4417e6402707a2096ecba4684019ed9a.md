**Presentation**

- Presenting symptoms include pain, altered gait, and increased bulk of joints leading to difficulty with shoe wear. The compression of the dorsal medial cutaneous nerve may lead to numbness along the medial border of the great toe.

**Physical Exam**

- The first MTP joint is often swollen and tender and may have palpable dorsal osteophytes.

- There is a decrease in passive and active range of motion (ROM), most commonly in dorsiflexion. The pain usually occurs at terminal ROM with milder diseases; however, pain occurring in midrange motion may indicate a more severe arthritic disease due to more global articular wear to the metatarsal head.

- There is the reproduction of pain with forced dorsiflexion and might be a positive grind test.
