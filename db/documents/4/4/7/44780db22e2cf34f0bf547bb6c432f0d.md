Optic pathway gliomas most commonly affect children under tenÂ years old and account for 3 to 5% of childhood central nervous system tumors.

Approximately 15% to 20% of patients with neurofibromatosis (NF) 1 eventually develop an OPG, but only 30% to 50% of those patients will be symptomatic.

Optic pathway gliomas occur equally in males and females. However, with gliomas confined to the optic nerve, there is an increased incidence in females (65%) compared to males (35%). When tumors involve the optic chiasm, males and females are equally affected.

Gliomas at presentation are confined to the optic nerve alone in 25% of cases, but this leaves 75% of cases that show chiasm involvement.
