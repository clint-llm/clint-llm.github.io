The primary symptomatic complaint of patients diagnosed with either spontaneous or iatrogenic ICH is a headache. Specifically, orthostatic (or postural) headache is reported, which was defined as headache induced with the free drainage of approximately 10% of total CSF volume. A postural headache occurs or worsens with upright positioning and typically improves once the patient lies in a recumbent position. Occasionally patients will report associated nausea, vomiting, and neck pain or stiffness. The onset typically occurs within 2 hours, most within 15 minutes. There have been a wide variety of associated symptoms reported, such as changes in hearing, anorexia, vertigo, dizziness, blurry vision, diplopia, photophobia, hiccups, unsteady gait.
