Methylxanthine toxicity can present with any of the following symptoms: intractable nausea, cardiac arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, seizures, or cardiac arrest. Charcoal or sorbitol may be administered to reduce further GI absorption of the drug (however, this is only effective with oral dosing of the drug). There is some evidence to suggest that beta-blocker administration may decrease cardiac adverse events in patients with methylxanthine toxicity. Intravenous administration of benzodiazepines may be employed to abort seizure activity induced by toxicity. Hemodialysis is proven to be efficacious in removing the drug from circulation by drastically expediting elimination (though usually only reserved for extremely severe cases).
