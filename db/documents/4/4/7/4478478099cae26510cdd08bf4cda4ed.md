- Palytoxin (PTX) is an ocular irritant potentially found in various soft corals (e.g., zoanthids) and other marine life commonly found in saltwater home aquariums.

- It is difficult to determine which soft coral species harbor PTX, and all should be assumed toxic.

- A careful history is necessary to assess for exposure to the toxin as the diagnosis is clinical.

- An ocular examination may be nonspecific but most often shows conjunctival injection, a ring-shaped inflammatory infiltrate, and folds in Descemet's membrane.

- Eye irrigation alongside topical corticosteroid use (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% at least six times a day) and prophylactic antibiotics are the recommended treatment, though no definitive guidelines are available. Most patients recover well.
