There is no definite contraindication for CPB; however, in certain situations, surgeons might opt to delay the timing of surgery, bearing in mind the complications/pathophysiology, including conditions such as acute impairment of kidney functions, acute cerebral stroke, chest infection, or acute exacerbations of asthma. In those particular situations, recovery is expected. Accordingly, if the situation permits, it is better to wait and thus improve the outcome and reduce the risk burden.
