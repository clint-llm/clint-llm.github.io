The palpation is the first evaluation: under the hand feels like a strong tension, which can involve the entire muscular district or a localized node.

Electromyography is another evaluation that can be carried out to understand the type of discharge of the motor units and diagnose a neurological pathology from events that do not concern the disease. The echocardiograph can evaluate morphological anomalies that could trigger the cramp phenomenon.
