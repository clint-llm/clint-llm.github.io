Leuprolide is an FDA-approved gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist used for the management of endometriosis, uterine leiomyomata (also known as uterine fibroids), treatment of central precocious puberty in children, and advanced prostate cancer. Off-label uses include management of breast cancer, hormone therapy for male to female transgender patients, premenopausal ovarian suppression, and management of paraphilia and hypersexuality.

In patients with endometriosis receiving this medication, the goal is to reduce endometriotic lesions and improve pelvic pain/tenderness, dysmenorrhoea, and dyspareunia.

In advanced prostate cancer, leuprolide is used as a palliative treatment to help reduce comorbidities and improve quality of life. Leuprolide lowers testosterone levels, which in turn minimizes the stimulatory effect it normally has on androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells, therefore causing them to undergo apoptosis.

For uterine leiomyomata, leuprolide is effective in multiple ways. Preoperatively it can be used along with iron to treat anemia, reduce fibroid volume, and ultimately reduce bleeding during surgery. Even if the patient isnâ€™t undergoing surgery, leuprolide can be used to reduce fibroid size and improve symptoms related to the fibroids.

In treating children with central precocious puberty with leuprolide, the goal is to slow down the progression of the secondary sex characteristics until an age when they are appropriate. If left untreated, these patients typically have diminished adult height. With the use of leuprolide, the predicted adult height increases because it slows down the closing of the growth plates. Leuprolide discontinuation should merit consideration when at the appropriate time for puberty.
