Diagnosis of pneumonia in a child with a respiratory illness can be challenging in a primary care setting.Â  It should involve a comprehensive assessment of the child, combined with the assessment of laboratory values.

Primary laboratory evaluation: Ideally, laboratory testing should start with non-invasive, rapid bedside testing, including nasopharyngeal swab assays for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus when available and appropriate. This can help minimize unnecessary imaging and antibiotic treatment in children with influenza or bronchiolitis.

Secondary laboratory evaluation: Children who present with severe disease and appear toxic should have complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, renal and hepatic function testing, and blood cultures performed.

There are no clear guidelines for the routine use of chest x-ray in the pediatric population.
