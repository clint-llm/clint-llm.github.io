Phlegmasia alba dolens (PAD) and phlegmasia cerulea dolens (PCD) are uncommon conditions that result from acute, massive venous thromboembolism. These conditions are associated with deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity and have high associated morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis is critical for the reduction of overall morbidity and mortality and treatment needs to be in a timely manner. This activity outlines the clinical manifestations and management of PAD and PCD and highlights the importance of timely diagnosis by the interprofessional team in the care of patients with these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of phlegmasia alba dolens and phlegmasia cerulea dolens.
- Outline the typical presentation and evaluation of phlegmasia alba dolens or phlegmasia cerulea dolens.
- Review the management considerations for patients with phlegmasia alba dolens or phlegmasia cerulea dolens.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure early diagnosis and prompt therapeutic intervention to improve outcomes for patients affected by phlegmasia alba dolens and phlegmasia cerulea dolens.
