Heart dominance is described by which coronary artery branch gives off the posterior descending artery and supplies the inferior wall, and is characterized as left, right, or codominant. The posterior descending artery (PDA) is also known as the posterior interventricular artery because it runs along the posterior interventricular sulcus to the apex of the heart. It is at the apex where it meets the left anterior descending artery that is traveling along the anterior surface of the heart. The posterior descending artery is responsible for supplying the posterior third of the interventricular septum, including the posterior and inferior wall of the left ventricle. The vessel most commonly originates from either the right coronary artery (right dominant), left circumflex artery (left dominant), or both (codominant). There have been physiologic variants described in case reports such as an origin from the left anterior descending artery, referred to as “superdominant.”
