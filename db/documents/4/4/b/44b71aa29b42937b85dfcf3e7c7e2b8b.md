Starting at the primary motor cortex, the upper motor neuron descends and passes through the ipsilateral posterior limb of the internal capsule. Most of the fibers will decussate at the pyramidal decussation at the caudal medulla. From here, the upper motor neuron is on the contralateral side of its origin. The upper motor neuron synapses with a lower motor neuron in the anterior horn of the spinal cord at the appropriate level. The lower motor neuron exits the spinal cord to synapse to a muscle.
