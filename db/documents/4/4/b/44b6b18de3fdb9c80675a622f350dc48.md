Aspergillosis is defined as infection with histopathological confirmation and a positive result of the specimen from a normally sterile site.

Biopsies carry the risk of bleeding, the reason for which noninvasive testing is usually done as the initial step. These include serum biomarkers and sputum analysis.

If a biopsy is warranted, it is usually guided by imaging such as bronchoscopy, video-assisted thoracoscopy surgery, or CT.
