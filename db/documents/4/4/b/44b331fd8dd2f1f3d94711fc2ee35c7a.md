HI is related to pigmentary mosaicism. The different pigmented skin areas correspond to the distribution of the two different cell lines with different pigment potential in single individuals. It is characterized by a clone of skin cells with a reduced capacity for melanin production. Chromosomal aberrations have been detected in a cytogenetic analysis in peripheral blood lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts. Chromosomal aberrations affect the locations of genes involved in pigmentation. Extracutaneous manifestations might be caused by the presence of different genetic defects. Hence it seems that HI is associated with a variety of chromosomal anomalies rather than a single gene disease.
