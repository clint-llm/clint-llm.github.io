Human bites account for a relatively low percentage (3%) of the total bites encountered in the ED, but they have the potential for severe morbidity due to challenges in identifying the injuries and late presentations complicated by established infection. The greater cost of care in these injuries is from infection and post-infection treatment, and therefore all efforts should be made to make the diagnosis early and prevent further deterioration. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of human bites and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of human bites.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with a human bite.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for human bite.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by human bites.
