**History**

Patients may report:

- A popping sensation

- Sudden onset of pain with decreased range of motion

- The sensation of joint rolling out of the socket.

Remember to ask about any previous dislocations. When the shoulder dislocates, the nerves can get stretched out. Some patients report stinging and numbness in the arm at the time of the dislocation.

**Physical**

The physical examination should confirm a suspected dislocation.

- Range of motion is diminished and painful

- Anterior dislocation, the anterior arm is abducted and externally rotated In thin patients, there may be a prominent humeral head felt anteriorly, and the void can be seen posteriorly in the shoulder

- Posterior dislocations are easy to miss because the arm is in internal rotation and adduction. In thin patients, the prominent head can be palpated posteriorly. Practitioners can miss posterior shoulder dislocations because the patient appears only to be guarding the extremity.

Performing a detailed neurovascular examination before reduction is imperative. Injury to the axillary nerve during shoulder dislocation is as high as 40%. Practitioners should record the neuromuscular examination before and after any dislocated shoulder.
