Estrogen is a steroid hormone associated with the female reproductive organs and is responsible for developing female sexual characteristics. Estrogen is often referred toÂ as estrone, estradiol, and estriol. Of the previously mentioned forms of estrogen, estradiol is the most common form of estrogen hormone for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in the treatment of symptoms of menopause. Estrogen for hormone replacement therapy has been heavily researched in medicine and remains a controversial topic. According to early studies, estrogen as hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women showed promising benefits of decreased risk of osteoporosis, coronary arterial disease, and mortality.

The Women's Health Initiative ended clinical studies prematurely because participants in the study developed an increased risk of breast cancer and coronary artery disease.

Clinically, the use of estrogen includes the following FDA-approved indications:

- Oral contraceptive pill (OCP) to prevent pregnancy
