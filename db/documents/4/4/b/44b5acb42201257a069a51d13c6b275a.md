The staging system devised by Scheuer isÂ as follows:

- Stage 1: Portal stage associated with bile duct changes, and/or portal inflammation

- Stage 2: Periportal fibrosis and/or inflammation with dilated but intact portal tracts

- Stage 3: Septal stage: Septal fibrosis with active inflammation and/or paucicellular septa

- Stage 4: Cirrhotic: Variously sized nodules and varying degrees of inflammation
