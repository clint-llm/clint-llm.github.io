Plain radiographs are of limited utility in diagnosing a pectoralis major tear but should be performed to assess for other pathology or associated abnormalities, such as bony avulsion injuries that occur in 2% to 5% of cases.

Ultrasound can be useful due to its relatively low cost and rapid availability. Tears are often identifiable by uneven echogenicity and muscle tearing in comparison with the contralateral side. The utility of ultrasound for this application, however, remains somewhat controversial, with some authors contending that the false-negative rate is unacceptably high.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the imaging modality of choice and can help differentiate between acute or chronic complete or partial tears. MRI can be used to assess the grade and site of injury and correlates well with surgical findings.

Tietjen, in 1980, developed a system for classifying the location and severity of the injury.
