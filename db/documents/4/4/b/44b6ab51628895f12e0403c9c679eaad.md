The main aim of treating stuttering priapism is to prevent future episodes from happening. An acute episode of prolonged ischemic priapism of more than four hours needs to be managed as an emergency. Aspiration of penile blood and intracorporal infusion of diluted α-adrenergic agents needs to be done within 24 hours. However, presenting with such episodes carries a high risk of developing complications, which is why the treatment aim in stuttering priapism is preventative. The advances in understanding the mechanism of stuttering priapism have led to the trial of new medications with the aim of prevention. The specific medical management of stuttering priapism options can generally be grouped into hormonal agents, drugs that change the corporal muscle tone, and others.

**Hormonal Manipulation**

There are multiple options for treatment with hormones for patients with stuttering priapism, but they all aim towards reducing the levels of circulating testosterone. Studies suggest that reducing testosterone level to 10% of its normal level will reduce libido and nocturnal erections, which will reduce the number of priapism episodes. The treatment lasts from 2 weeks to 2 months and was then stopped with sustained treatment results. Options for hormonal manipulation include gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRH) agonists/antagonists (downregulate the pituitary gland), antiandrogens (block androgen receptors), ketoconazole (reduces testosterone production as a side effect), and finasteride (5α-reductase inhibitor). However, these agents will affect sperm production, growth, and sexual maturation. This is why they are contraindicated in males who are still in their growth phase and relatively contraindicated in those wanting to conceive. Other treatment options, like self-administering α-adrenergic agonists in acute attacks, can be used cautiously in this patient group where possible.

A treatment regimen for ketoconazole has been suggested which involves an initial dose of 200 mg TID with prednisone 5 mg daily for 2 weeks followed by a reduced dose of 200 mg of ketoconazole nightly for an additional 6 months.

**Increasing the Cavernosal Smooth Muscle Tone**

The first option of these medications is the intracavernosal injection of diluted pseudoephedrine. This is usually used as an injection directly into the cavernosal tissue making it more of a treatment option for acute attacks rather than prevention. The standard recommended dilution is from****100 to 500 mcg/mL and treatment involves the injection of 1 ml roughly every 5 minutes until either resolution or 1 hour of treatment.

Digoxin inhibits the sodium-potassium pump and leads to increased intracellular calcium which causes smooth muscle contraction and detumescence. However, only a small study has been conducted on this agent.

Terbutaline, a β2-adrenergic agonist, has long been recommended for preventing recurrent episodes of stuttering priapism. The dosage of oral terbutaline is 5 mg immediately, with another 5 mg taken 15 minutes later. The prophylactic dose of terbutaline has been proposed as 5 to 10 mg daily. Recently, the role of terbutaline has been questioned due to lack of proven efficacy in acute priapism so ti si not currently recommended.

**Other Agents**

Gabapentin is used for the treatment of convulsions and as an anxiolytic. It has also been found to reduce the influx of calcium into smooth muscle cells and inhibits muscle contraction. This may explain why it has been sometimes been effective in treating refractory priapism.****

In SCD patients, hydroxyurea has been used with some success.

Other agents found to be effective against stuttering priapism are hydralazine, baclofen, and procyclidine. Also, conventional treatment of SCD has been found effective in the prevention of priapism in the patient group. This includes analgesia, fluids, oxygen, alkalinization, and transfusions. However, these treatments are useful only after the initial management of the acute priapism episode.

Sildenafil at a low daily dose (25 to 50 mg) has been investigated to help moderate nitric oxide signaling and normalize/reprogram phosphodiesterase type 5 activity. There have been some limited studies suggesting a benefit in stuttering priapism in men both with and without sickle cell disease.

Some patients can be taught how to prepare, mix and perform intracavernosal self-administration of diluted α-agonist medication.

**Special Considerations for SCD Patients Including Automated Red Cell Exchange Transfusions**

Initial therapy for SCD patients presenting with priapism generally includes alkalinization, adequate analgesia, IV hydration, and supplemental oxygen to prevent more sickling. The American Urological Association Guidelines on the Management of Priapism recommends intracavernosal therapy together with systemic treatment of SCD. Surgical shunts can be considered after intracavernosal therapy has failed. Initial shunting should be between the glans (corpora spongiosa) and the corpora cavernosa. Tunneling, where a dilator is passed through the corpora from the tip to the tail to provide additional drainage, may also help in some cases but is more invasive than just the shunt.

In SCD patients, hydroxyurea has been used prophylactically with some success.

Sildenafil can be used as an additional therapeutic option for those who continue to have episodes of priapism despite hydroxyurea therapy. It has shown some efficacy in resolving priapism in SCD patients.

Finasteride blocks the enzymatic conversion of testosterone to the more active dihydrotestosterone. There is some limited evidence of reducing the frequency of priapism episodes in SCD patients with stuttering priapism, but it can also cause gynecomastia, decreased libido, and ED in some individuals.

There are also very limited studies on using GnRH agonists for stuttering priapism in SCD patients, although we have used it anecdotally with success.

Standard transfusions can improve tissue oxygenation and reduce the percentage of sickled erythrocytes in the circulation for SCD patients suffering from stuttering priapism. They also have the advantage of not requiring any special staffing or equipment. Unfortunately, standard transfusions are also associated with iron overloads, are relatively slow, and are substantially less effective than exchange transfusions in reducing the Hb S level. Exchange transfusions can be performed manually using donor red blood cells and normal saline, but this is a lengthy and laborious process. In addition, it is not as rapid or effective as automated red cell exchanges and can still cause an iron overload.

Automated red cell exchanges are performed by using an apheresis system. The patient's blood is removed, and the red cells are replaced with donor erythrocytes, after which the blood is returned to the original patient. While this process requires special staffing and equipment, it can rapidly reduce the Hb S level and avoid excessive iron loading. Therefore, it is the recommended method of exchange transfusion in SCD patients.

**Insertion of a Penile Prosthesis**

When all other reasonable means fail, complete corporal dilation can resolve the priapism but will also destroy the patient's natural erectile function. A prosthesis is usually considered when the patient presents with an acute, low flow, ischemic priapism >36 hours duration or in those who have failed surgical shunting procedures. The insertion of a penile prosthesis at the time of the corporal dilation can resolve the ED problem if a suitable implant is available and the tunica has not been overly weakened, especially at the tip, by attempts at creating a shunt. To the extent that any prior shunt procedures may have weakened part of the tunica albuginea, the likelihood of an extrusion increases. However, waiting too long after a complete corporal dilation can lead to scarring and fibrosis making the eventual insertion of a prosthesis much more difficult. It is therefore recommended to implant the penile prosthesis either at the time of the corporal dilation surgery or shortly thereafter; preferably within a few weeks. Overall, there are higher failure rates with penile prosthesis implantation for priapism than for routine, elective placement.

Unfortunately, there are no clear guidelines on the management and prevention of stuttering priapism, and it is a topic that requires more research. In the absence of clear guidelines, the following is suggested:

- Any testosterone abnormalities should be corrected.

- There is good evidence that stuttering priapism patients with SCD will benefit from hydroxyurea.

- The prophylactic value of various oral agents, such as gabapentin, sildenafil, and finasteride, is somewhat uncertain.

- Terbutaline is no longer recommended.

- Of these, there is reasonable evidence of a prophylactic benefit to sildenafil and finasteride; either alone or taken together.

- If previous measures fail, third-line agents can be used such as digoxin and baclofen. However, digoxin can cause weakness or undesirable cardiac effects while baclofen may lead to drowsiness.

- Hormonal manipulation with GnRH therapy and/or ketoconazole appears reasonably effective prophylactically but may have side effects particularly with regards to fertility.

- Patients can give themselves diluted α-agonist medication intracavernosal injections at home, although there is a small risk of thromboembolic complications.

- SCD patients can benefit from prophylactic automated red cell exchanges.

- Consideration should be given to the early insertion of a penile prosthesis in difficult or intractable cases that do not respond to standard therapies. This will eliminate the recurrent priapism problem, but at the cost of a surgical implant.
