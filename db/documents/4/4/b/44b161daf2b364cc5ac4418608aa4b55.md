There are essentially no absolute contraindications to central venous catheterization, especially in emergent cases when the above indications are necessary for life-saving interventions. There are, however, several relative contraindications for PICCs.

- Burns, trauma, skin infections, radiation, history of venous thrombosis at insertion site

- Active bacteremia

- Chronic renal failure, end-stage renal disease (veins should be preserved for potential dialysis catheter placement)

- Small diameter of arm veins (smaller than 3 mm to 4 mm)

- Prior mastectomy and lymph node dissection (lymph system is compromised and unable to drain)

- Patient requires crutches (places pressure on veins of the arm)

- Persistent cough, vomiting (increased intrathoracic pressure can lead to catheter malposition, catheter erosion or cardiac tamponade)
