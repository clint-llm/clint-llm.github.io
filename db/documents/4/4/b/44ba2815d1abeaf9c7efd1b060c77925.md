It is unlikely that a crotalid envenomation will be mistaken for another disease process given that most patients will present complaining of a snakebite. However, patients do occasionally present reporting concerns for a snakebite even though they are unable to articulate the reason for this suspicion clearly. When evaluating envenomations, the primary decision point is to determine the degree of envenomation as this will guide further treatment. Non-venomous snakes can also cause snakebites; however, these bites will not show any signs of toxicity given the lack of venom.

Localized reactions from other envenomations, such as Hymenoptera, can also cause significant localized pain, erythema, and edema. These could be interpreted as a snake envenomation if a patient did not visualize the cause of their injury. However, unlike snakebites, one would expect only to see a single puncture wound as opposed to two and generally have limited localized edema and erythema.

Patients with skin and soft tissue infections may present with concern for a snakebite. Erythema and edema from secondary infection after an injury may be mistaken for an envenomation. The development of symptoms many hours or several days after an injury is much more suggestive of secondary infection.

Though not impossible, it is unlikely that a patient would suffer a snakebite without actually visualizing a snake.
