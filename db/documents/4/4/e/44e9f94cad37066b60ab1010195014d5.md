Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy is a significant and severe disease affecting parents and children of affected parents. Exhaustive counseling is needed for both generations. It is a hereditary disorder whose symptoms vary depending on whether they begin in childhood or adulthood. A parent with the disease has a 50% chance of passing it to their children, regardless of sex or gender; therefore, genetic counseling is important. It involves excessive protein deposition in the cells of the CNS, causing dysfunction and leading to the death of brain cells. There is no cure for this disorder. Prognosis is poor, mean disease duration is about 15 years, and life expectancy 8 to 16 years from symptom onset. Early recognition of the disorder may improve patient understanding, and access to services and treatments.
