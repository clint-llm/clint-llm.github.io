Migraines are a common primary neurologic headache that predominantly occurs in the working-age adult. Migraine attacks are frequently triggered by bright light, hunger, and loud noise. It is theorized that this causes contraction of facial and scalp muscles leading to irritation of the susceptible peripheral branches of the trigeminal nerves which creates a wave of spreading pain to the whole of the cranium. This peripheral theory of migraine is supported by pain relief that many patients report with Botulinum toxins or local nerve blocks. This activity describes the indications for surgical management of chronic migraines. It highlights the role of an interprofessional team comprised of neurologists, neurosurgeons, plastic surgeons, and psychologists, in caring for patients with this ailment.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of migraines.
- Review common physical exam findings of a patient with a migraine.
- Explain how surgical intervention can help stop migraines.
- Outline a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by chronic migraines.
