Malnutrition is a particular public health problem throughout many countries in the developing world, especially those in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

Pediatric malnutrition is frequently associated with pediatric hospitalization in the developing worldÂ and is associated with mortality rates up to 20%.

Malnutrition-associated mortality tends to have a seasonal fluctuation such that it is highest during the pre-harvest rainy season as a result of food scarcity and increased burden of infectious diseases.

It is estimated that 155 million children below the age of 5 suffered from growth stunting in 2016, 52 million suffered from wasting, and of these, 17 million children suffered from severe wasting.

Marasmus is equally distributed between the genders, however, as a result of cultural differences in some parts of the world women may be at an increased risk of marasmus.
