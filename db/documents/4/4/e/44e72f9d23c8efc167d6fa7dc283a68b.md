Mastoidectomy is a surgical procedure of the temporal bone that opens postauricular air cells by removing the thin bony partitions between them. Each mastoidectomy is unique because of the variable pneumatization patterns of the temporal bone. Pathology can also limit the pneumatization of the mastoid cells and further complicate the mastoidectomy procedure. This activity describes the indications, technique, and complications of a mastoidectomy and highlights the role of an interprofessional care team in evaluating and treating patients that undergo this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomy involved in a mastoidectomy.
- Identify the indications for a mastoidectomy.
- Explain the technique of a mastoidectomy.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the care of patients that undergo mastoidectomy.
