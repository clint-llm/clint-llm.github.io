In regular astigmatism, the parallel light rays are not focused on a particular point, but rather two focal lines are formed. The configuration of rays refracted through the toric surface is labeled as Sturm's conoid, and the distance between the lines is called the focal interval of Sturm.

Approximately 40 percent of newborns have approximately 1 D astigmatism since birth, and it is reduced to adult level by one year of age due to normal eye maturation and globe remodeling.

The palpebral fissure slant affects the corneal toricity, which in turn changes astigmatism. Patients with Down syndrome and Treacher Collins syndrome show oblique astigmatism due to upward or downward slant of the palpebral fissure. Corneal rigidity also affects astigmatism caused by eyelid pressure.

Patients with nutritional deficiencies affect the horizontal meridian while steepening the vertical one. The pupil size also affects astigmatism. Larger pupil size is correlated with high cylindrical power and with the rule astigmatism.

Larger pupil size is linked with higher-order aberrations like coma and may increase the cylindrical power in manifest refraction. Coma is linked with a higher amount of astigmatism. Tear film changes also affect the cornea and result in astigmatism.
