The diagnosis and management of gastrinomas are complex and require an interprofessional team that includes a general surgeon, endocrinologist, radiologist, pathologist, internist, and an oncologist. While the symptoms are manageable with PPIs, localized lesions can ve cured with surgery. All patients with sporadic gastrinoma in the absence of unresectable metastatic disease should receive a referral for surgery. In contrast, medical therapy is the current standard of care for most patients with MEN1 associated ZES due to the number of tumors, extra-pancreatic location, co-existent metastatic disease, and low chance of surgical cure. The recommendation os for surgical resection for MEN 1 associated gastrinomas > 2 cm.

The outcomes for patients with localized lesions that are excisable are good. Patients with metastatic disease have a poor outcome.
