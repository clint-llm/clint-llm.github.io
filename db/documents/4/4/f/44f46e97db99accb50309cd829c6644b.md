**Melanoma Risks**

- Ultraviolet (UV) light exposure: Frequent and intermittent exposure to sunlight appears to be the highest risk factor for cutaneous melanoma. UV light causes photochemical reactions and damage in DNA, leading to pyrimidine dimers (cytosine and thymine). UVB light (290 to 310 nanometers) is attributed to more potent damage of DNA. Although, in natural sunlight, UVA (320 to 400 nanometers) is present more so than UVB. However, UVA can also cause oxidative DNA damage. UVA is said to mutate DNA via non-NDA endogenous sensitizers.  Sunscreen and sunblock have SPF ratings, but SPF ratings only consider UVB light. There are products present that block UVA.  Recent evidence has shown that the risk of melanoma is higher in people using sunscreen because most work on UVB.  Tanning beds produce mostly UVA radiation, and some have varying amounts of UVB radiation. Frequent use of tanning beds shows an increased risk of malignant melanoma. Those living in low latitudes with increased sun exposure over a lifetime have an increased risk.

- Personal characteristics: Skin type (Fitzpatrick type I  and II), blonde or red hair, and blue eyes have a higher risk. The presence of more melanocytic nevi increases risk.

- Family history of melanoma or pancreatic cancer may suggest a deletion mutation in p16.

- Socioeconomic status: Lower socioeconomic status may be linked to more advanced disease at the time of detection.  This may be due to a decreased knowledge of the diseases and decreased perception of risk.

- Large congenital nevi (greater than 20 cm)

- Atypical mole syndrome (formerly termed B-K mole syndrome, dysplastic nevus syndrome, familial atypical multiple mole melanomas/familial dysplastic mole syndrome, autosomal dominant) The result of a genetic defect of CDKN2A gene that encodes for p16 (a transcription factor involved in apoptosis) and p14ARF. This gene is located on chromosome 9p21. There is a higher risk of melanoma depending on the number of family members affected. The risk is nearly 100% with relatives having melanoma or dysplastic nevi.

- Xeroderma pigmentosa (XP, autosomal recessive), a disorder of nucleotide excision repair, cannot repair DNA damage of thymine dimers. XP has an increased risk of all skin cancers.
