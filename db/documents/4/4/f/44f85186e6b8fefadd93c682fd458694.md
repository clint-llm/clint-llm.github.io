Patients should be made aware of the diagnosis and the related implications. The healthcare professional should explain specifically to the patient that definitive management of Heyde syndrome is accomplished with aortic valve replacement. Other therapies, such as endoscopic treatment of gastrointestinal lesions and blood products for the correction of anemia or bleeding disorders, only offer temporary benefit in most cases. Patients should be informed that aortic valve replacement is a first-line treatment recommendation that is curative in most cases. The healthcare professional should also instruct the patient on essential complications related to Heyde syndrome that may be life-threatening and warrant immediate medical attention, such as chest pain, syncope, or recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.
