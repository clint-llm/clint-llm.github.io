The mainstay of an initial evaluation is imaging studies. Sonographic findings include elongated or cystic lesions in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) with features of internal onion skin appearance representing lamellated mucin, which is a pathognomonic finding.

Evaluation of ileocolic nodal basin along with a comprehensive hepatic assessment to exclude liver metastasis has an important role in the management of appendiceal cancers, including theÂ GEP-NETs, or formerly named carcinoid tumors. Moreover, peritoneal evaluation should be considered in the patients who are diagnosed with goblet cell carcinoma, and appendiceal mucinous neoplasms, and the findings of the peritoneal cancer index score should be precisely recorded.

Despite the inconclusive role of abdominal radiological measures in the diagnosis of appendiceal cancer, malignant features of appendiceal cancers including wall irregularity and soft tissue thickening within a low attenuative, round, well-encapsulated cystic mass in the right or quadrant, is highly suggestive of neoplastic appendiceal mucocele. In these patients, further systematic evaluation to exclude the presence of ascites, peritoneal involvement, and scalloping of the liver surface, is mandatory.
