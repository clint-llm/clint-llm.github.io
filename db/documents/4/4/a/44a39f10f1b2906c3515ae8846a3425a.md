Commonly observed (over 10%) adverse drug reactions in patients who have treatment with ixekizumab are: neutropenia, hypersensitivity reactions, e.g., urticaria and angioedema, infections, injection site reactions, e.g., pain. Less commonly observed (less than 10%), adverse drug reactions are fungal skin infections (tinea), nausea, thrombocytopenia, and antibody development. Antibody development can decrease the concentrations of ixekizumab and decrease drug efficacy. Less than 1% of observed adverse drug reactions are Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, oral candidiasis (Candida albicans infection), influenza, conjunctivitis, and rhinitis. Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis include exacerbations in susceptible patients.

Miller J. et al. conducted research from several clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of ixekizumab in treating psoriatic arthritis.

Romozzi M. et al. reported that a 28-year-old man with psoriatic arthritis developed cervical myelitis during ixekizumab treatment.
