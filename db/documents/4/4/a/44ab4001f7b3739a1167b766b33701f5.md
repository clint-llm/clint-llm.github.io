Patient education during rehabilitation is vital to recovery. Physical therapy should be custom-made to the individual patient, which will vary based on the patient's age, baseline functional levels after injury, and the ability to recover. The clinician should carefully monitor the patient's gait, work volume, and rest periods throughout therapy so that the athlete does not overwork beyond prescribed limits leading to delayed healing, slower recovery, or reinjury.
