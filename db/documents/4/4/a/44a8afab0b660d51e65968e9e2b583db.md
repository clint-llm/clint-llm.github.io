Historically, an aldehyde fixation was used to fix the nervous tissue for use in electron microscopy. Today, histological fixing of the nervous tissue is commonly done via a high-pressure freezing technique which yields a better-contrasted specimen as well as better preservation of the nervous tissue with fewer artifacts due to better fixation. However, aldehydes, such as formalin, are still used as a fixation solution for purposes of light microscopy as the decreased contrast, and inferior preservation of the tissue is negligible for use in routine nervous tissue studies.
