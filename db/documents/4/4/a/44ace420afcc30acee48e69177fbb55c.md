Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae RNA virus family and classify into three distinct types based on their major antigenic differences; influenza A, influenza B, and influenza C. Influenza viruses cause annual human epidemics, seasonal and pandemics. Seasonal influenza epidemics caused by influenza A and B viruses result in 3 to 5 million severe cases and thousands of deaths globally yearly. The influenza A virus will cause epidemics and pandemics because of its spread from migrating birds, pigs, horses, and humans. Transmission can be human to human from fomites, coughing, and sneezing. Influenza B causes only human-to-human spread with a particular emphasis on the fact that no other hosts are involved, therefore, not involved in pandemics. Influenza C is a mild disease. This activity describes the mode of action of influenza vaccine, including modes of administration, formulations, adverse event profiles, eligible patient populations, and monitoring, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the types of influenza viruses requiring vaccinations.
- Summarize the absolute and relative contraindications of the vaccine. 
- Review the methods of administering influenza vaccination and eligible patients for each type of vaccine. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance influenza vaccination and improve patient outcomes.
