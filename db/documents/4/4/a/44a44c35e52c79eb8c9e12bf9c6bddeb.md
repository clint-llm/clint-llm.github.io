Borrelia is a member of the Spirochaetacea family. There are approximately 20 different genospecies, but only five pose a significant pathogenic risk to humans: B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. bavariensis, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, and B. spielmanii.Â Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans results predominantly from bacterial infection with B. afzelii. However, it can also be caused by European B. burgdorferi sensu stricto or B. garinii.
