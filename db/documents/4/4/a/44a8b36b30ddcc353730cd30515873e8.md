Central pontine myelinolysis was once thought to be fatal, with a mortality of 90% to 100%. This is likely because it was initially diagnosed at autopsy. The mortality rate has significantly decreased, with recent retrospective studies showing 94% survival. These studies cite that about 25%-40% make a complete recovery without deficits, and 25%-30% remain incapacitated.

Patients with risk factors for poor prognostic outcomes are those with serum sodium of <120 mEq/L, hypokalemia, and low Glasgow coma scale (GCS) during hospitalization. Autologous liver transplant patients who develop central pontine myelinolysis or osmotic demyelination syndrome were also reported to have worse outcomes, with a mortality of 63% at one year.

Clinical and radiological features were not found to be of prognostic significance. Improving prognostic outcomes focuses on early recognition of those patients that are at higher risk of developing CPM, avoiding rapid overcorrection of sodium, and making a prompt diagnosis of the condition. Favorable prognostic outcomes also include the avoidance of secondary complications of the condition such as aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or deep venous thrombosis.
