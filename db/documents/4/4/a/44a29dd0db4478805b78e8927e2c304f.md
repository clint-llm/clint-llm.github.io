Tissues and organs are procurable from a living or deceased donor. Live donation involves either kidney, partial liver, or lung. The Institute of Medicine - American National Academy of Sciences clarified thatÂ a clinician could declare death using either neurologic criteria or circulatory criteria.

Sadly, every day, patients suffer morbidity or mortality due to a lack of availability of tissue or an organ transplant.

There are numerous challenges to organ donation, especially at a time when the family is grieving. Further, few patients have discussed the issue with their families, as such, they may not be able to anticipate the desires of their passing family member.

Health providers must have the education to address family misconceptions and assist the team in donation recovery, preservation, and placement of tissues and organs from deceased and living donors. By educating practitioners about tissue and organ donation, more families will make the decision to donate and decrease the number of patients that pass due to lack of tissues or organs.
