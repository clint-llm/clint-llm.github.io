ADPKD: In a majority of patients, the renal function remains intact until the fourth decade of life. Once renal function is affected, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) starts to decline, at an average rate of 4.4 to 5.9 mL/min per year.

ARPKD: Prognosis is poor. Prognosis depends on the severity of renal disease. Neonates born with severe renal disease may not survive due to pulmonary hypoplasia and insufficiency.

The liver disease in ARPKD is relatively mild in neonatal and early infancy. The severity of disease is known to progress with age. These children develop features of portal hypertension because of chronic liver fibrosis. However as portal hypertension and variceal bleeding are not life-threatening if properly managed, many of these patients survive up to middle age.
