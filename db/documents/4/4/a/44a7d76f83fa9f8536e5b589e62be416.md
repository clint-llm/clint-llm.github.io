Intertrigo is a superficial inflammatory skin condition of the skin's flexural surfaces, prompted or irritated by warm temperatures, friction, moisture, maceration, and poor ventilation. Intertrigo's Latin translation, inter (between) and terere (to rub) helps explain the physiology of the condition. Intertrigo commonly becomes secondarily infected, notably with Candida; however, other viral or bacterial etiologies may play a factor in its pathogenesis. This activity reviews the presentation of intertrigo and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of intertrigo.
- Describe the presentation of intertrigo.
- Summarize the treatment of intertrigo.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by intertrigo.
