The dural septa, including the tentorium cerebelli, are rigid collagenous connective tissue structures; consequently, conditions necessitating an increase in intracranial pressure may cause portions of the brain to herniate beneath the free edges of the dural septa. The cerebrum and cerebellum occupy the supratentorial and infratentorial compartments of the cranial cavity, respectively. TheÂ event of an intracranial mass lesion may cause portions of the cerebrum to become entrapped beneath the rigid tentorium cerebelli.
