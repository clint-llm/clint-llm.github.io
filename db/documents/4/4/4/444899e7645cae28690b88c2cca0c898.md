Monitoring: The most common cause of pulmonary regurgitation encountered is iatrogenic following tetralogy of Fallot repair. According to the AHA/ACC guidelines for adults with adult congenital heart disease, patients must be followed up with history, clinical examination, and echocardiogram annually.

Recommended treatment modalities as per the AHA/ACA guidelines are based on the severity of symptoms and the progression of PR, as evidenced by the echocardiogram. In asymptomatic patients with PR, treatment is not recommended unless 2/4 of the following criteria are met. Criteria include mild or moderate RV or LV systolic dysfunction, severe RV dilation (right ventricular end-diastolic volume >160ml/m2), right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) due to right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) >2/3 of systemic pressure or progressively reduced exercise tolerance.

All symptomatic patients with PR should be treated with surgical methods.

Medical therapy is only recommended if the cause of pulmonary regurgitation is secondary to a primary medical condition such as pulmonary arterial hypertension or carcinoid disease. Medical therapy in the form of medications targeting heart failure such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers is only recommended in patients that are symptomatic with severe PR and are poor surgical candidates owing to age or comorbidities.
