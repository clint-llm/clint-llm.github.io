The abdomen and the pelvis contain several essential organs. However, it includes a vital network of nerves, as well. The autonomic nervous system control these organs, for which it includes two parts: the sympathetic part and parasympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system. These nerves emanate from the splanchnic nerves and cranial nerve X, which also called the vagus nerve. The first part consists of abdominopelvic splanchnic nerves, prevertebral sympathetic ganglia, and abdominal aortic plexus. While, the parasympathetic portion consists of anterior and posterior vagal trunks, abdominal autonomic nerves plexuses, pelvic splanchnic nerves, and intrinsic parasympathetic ganglia. The focus of this article is on the abdominopelvic and pelvic splanchnic nerves.

The splanchnic nerves are paired autonomic nerves that supply the abdominal and pelvic viscera. They are composed of motor nerve fibers passing to the internal organs, which also called visceral efferent fibers and the sensory nerve fibers that originate from these organs, which also named visceral afferent fibers.
