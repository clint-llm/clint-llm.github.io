Several muscles receive innervation from the vagus nerve: the middle and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscles, which are responsible for passage of food boluses; the palatoglossus, which elevates the posterior portion of the tongue on swallowing; and the laryngeal muscles, the aryepiglottic, thyroarytenoid, arytenoid, lateral and posterior cricoarytenoid, which are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The entire length of the esophagus is also the recipient of motor innervation.

The vagus nerve innervates the crural area of the diaphragm (where the esophagus passes or esophageal hiatus).

The tenth cranial nerve innervates the suspensory muscle of the duodenum or musculus suspensorius duodeni.
