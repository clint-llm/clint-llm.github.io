Laryngeal edema is the commonest laryngeal injury detected after intubation, and the majority of endoscopically visualized laryngeal edema after extubation remains asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Most patients with post-intubation laryngeal edema complain of mild symptoms like throat ache, difficulty to speak, or swallow. However, severe laryngeal edema makes a common etiology of post-extubation stridor in almost two-thirds of the cases, and nearly half of the patients with stridor get reintubated. Associated vocal cord edema may cause significant restriction of vocal cord movements, which will aggravate the stridor.

Though most cases of post-intubation laryngeal edema develop within 24 hours of tube placement and manifest immediately in the ensuing minutes to hours following extubation, a report of intractable post-extubation laryngeal edema presenting as late as 14 hours to 48 hours after post-surgery extubation is also observed in the literature.

Usually, the laryngeal inflammation and swelling usually resolve in one or two days after extubation. If symptoms persist, the possibility of other injuries sustained during endotracheal tube placement such as hematoma, laceration, avulsion, or due prolonged intubation such as ulceration, granulomas, adhesions, and paralysis needs to be looked into. Many of the reintubations in planned extubations occurs within the first 24 hours after the extubation, and rarely reach up to 72 hours.
