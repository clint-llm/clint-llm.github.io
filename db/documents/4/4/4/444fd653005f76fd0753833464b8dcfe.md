Partial epilepsy strongly affects a patient's lifestyle, secondary to the disruption of normal neurological processes. Patient-centered care requires an interdisciplinary, interprofessional team coordinating an evidence-based and holistic approach to optimizing patient outcomes and bettering their quality of life. The patient should have adequate follow-up care to assess for side effects of medication, medication adherence, clinical symptoms, accessibility to specialists, and comorbid conditions. Thus, an interdisciplinary team to monitor and communicate between the primary care physician, neurologist, psychiatrist, pharmacist, and social worker is mandatory.

The Program to Encourage Active Rewarding Lives for Seniors (PEARLS) enrolled older adults into a home-based program that integrated the patient with community outreach to detect and manage minor depression or dysthymia.
