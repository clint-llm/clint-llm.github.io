The diagnosis of PCFCL is made by histopathologic evaluation after a skin biopsy. The neoplastic cells stain positively for B-cell markers CD19, CD20, CD79a, and typically, the follicle center markers CD10 and BCL-6. CD21/23 can also help to highlight BCL-6 positive cells spreading beyond the regular meshwork. Commonly, PCFCL will be negative or weak for BCL-2. CD10 is variable and is ordinarily positive in follicular pattern and negative in a diffuse pattern. CD5, CD43, IRF4/MUM1, and FOXP1 are negative. Ki67 can show a lower proliferation rate than regular reactive follicles.

Laboratory and imaging workup should include a complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, lactate dehydrogenase, and computed tomography (CT) with contrast, with or without positron emission tomography (PET) to exclude systemic involvement.
