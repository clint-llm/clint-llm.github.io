Abstinence for several months up to a few years have shown both clinical examination and electroneurographic improvements, with most patients showing complete regain of function. Additional treatment includes replacing nutrients such as thiamine, vitamin-B12, and folic acid. Psychiatry referral, alcohol abstinence abuse programs, and support groups have shown favorable ways to help patients recover from alcohol use disorder. Physical therapy and occupational therapy can play a role in supporting the patient as they regain movement and perform everyday functions.
