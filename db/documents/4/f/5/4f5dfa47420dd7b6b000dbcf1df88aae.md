The impact of central line care is significant. When complications of central venous catheters occur they cause significant morbidity, increase length of hospital stay, and delay recovery.

The relative cost of central line care interventions (increases in nursing care hours, relatively cheap dispensable, and change to monitoring practices) compared to the morbidity of a CVC-associated infection and the cost of the care for these complications.Depending on how the costs are estimated, the cost of treatment for these complications is thought to be between $3,700 and $39,000 in the USA and China and roughly 8,810 € per complication in Europe.
