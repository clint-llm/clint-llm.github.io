Labor begins with regular uterine contractions in addition to cervical dilation and/or effacement. An important aspect of the history to obtain from the patient is at what time the contractions began and how far apart they have been.  An abdominal examination is a key component of an obstetric exam as it provides an estimated fetal weight of the fetus and informs the provider of the fetal presentation. The continuous monitoring of uterine activity discerns how frequent contractions are occurring. Only with internal pressure catheter monitoring can the actual strength of contractions be measured. Digital vaginal exams to evaluate the maternal pelvimetry, bony pelvis shape and capacity, and cervical dilation and effacement occur at various intervals throughout labor. The fetal station is also assessed with these digital exams, and this provides information regarding the descent of the fetal presenting part, an integral piece of information when determining if labor is progressing normally or abnormally.
