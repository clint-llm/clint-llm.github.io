Patients with spinal cord injury need to be evaluated in a timely fashion to minimize poor outcomes. Preferably, these patients should be evaluated at a level one trauma center due to the extent of injuries. Once the initial evaluation is completed, a complete spinal computed tomogram (CT) should be the initial imaging obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine is very helpful but should not be the initial imaging modality.

Spinal immobilization, airway, breathing, and hemodynamic stability evaluation should be established first. Utilize the basic airway, breathing, circulation approach to the trauma patient for the initial evaluation, ensuring that the spine does not sustain any extra movement. Maintain in-line cervical spine immobilization during the assessment.

After this initial assessment, further evaluation is necessary to determine the location of the injury, if possible. A complete neurological assessment should be carried out at this time using the American Spinal Injuries Association (ASIA) grading scale. This is a universal classification tool for spinal cord injuries, which helps determine the sensory and motor level of injury for each side of the body.
