Hyperhomocysteinemia refers to the condition where there is greater than 15 micromol/L of homocysteine in the blood. This condition is present in a wide range of diseases, and in many cases, it is an independent risk factor for more serious medical conditions. However, the evaluation and management of this condition remain controversial. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hyperhomocysteinemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications for obtaining a homocysteine level.
- Summarize who should receive treatment for hyperhomocysteinemia.
- Identify patients who would have elevated homocysteine levels.
- Explain the importance of the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients who have hyperhomocysteinemia.
