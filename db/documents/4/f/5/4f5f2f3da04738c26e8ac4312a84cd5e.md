Minoxidil is available in the United States as an over-the-counter topical agent. It is available as a foam and a solution formulation to use for men and women patients.

- The 5% aerosol formulation is applied one-half capful once a day in women and one-half capful twice a day in men on the top of the scalp.

- The dose of 1 mL of 2% solution formulation is applied twice a day in women on the top of the scalp.

- The dose of 1 mL of 2% or 5% solution formulation is applied twice a day in men on the top of the scalp.

No scalp massage is necessary after use. Minoxidil uptake is about 50% after an hour and 75% after 4 hours. Some practitioners associate micro-needling with topical minoxidil to enhance efficiency, but more studies are needed to assess the value of this potential relationship.

While oral minoxidil is not FDA-approved for hair loss, clinical trials have displayed effectiveness using oral minoxidil at various doses (0.25 to 2.5 mg daily).

Studies have shown that 5% minoxidil is more effective than 2% minoxidil in treating alopecia. Clinical response to minoxidil is more pronounced if the onset of alopecia is within five years (mainly in young adults), and the hair follicles are not deeply miniaturized.

**Patient with Renal Impairment:**There is no dose adjustment information available from manufacturers for patients with renal impairment.
