The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently approves KCl use in the following formulations: extended-release tablet, extended-release capsule, injectable, oral solution, and powder for oral solution. Each formulation is available only by prescription. For every 20 mEq of intravenous KCl administered, serum potassium increases by approximately 0.25 mEq/L. More information is available in the FDA’s database for current drug labels.

It is preferable to treat mild (3.0 to 3.4 mEq/L) hypokalemia with approximately 75 mEq of oral KCl per day. For moderate (2.5 to 2.9 mEq/L) hypokalemia, the total oral KCl per day is about 100 mEq. Intravenous KCl may be used as an alternative in these cases if the patient cannot tolerate oral KCl. Severe (less than 2.5 mEq/L) or symptomatic hypokalemia necessitates intravenous administration of KCl. If the necessary infusion rate for such cases is greater than 10 mEq/hour, the KCl should be administered through a central line with cardiac monitoring.
