Phthalates are a group of plasticizing agents used industrially to impart durability and flexibility to plastic products. Depending on their designated industrial use, they are divided into low and high molecular weight categories. The toxicity of phthalates has gained increasing attention as studies have begun to show deleterious endocrine and metabolic side effects associated with various subcategories of phthalates. This has led to regulatory action, banning different phthalates that have been shown to cause harm. This activity will highlight the current literature regarding the industrial uses of phthalates, current regulation regarding their production, issues of concern related to humans and the environment, and known clinical associations between pathology and phthalate toxicity.

**Objectives:**
- Review the industrial uses for various low and high-molecular-weight phthalates.
- Summarize the current regulatory statutes in place regarding the use of phthalates in products.
- Explain the exposure media leading to bioaccumulation of phthalates, leading to toxicity.
- Review the current literature regarding the clinical significance and manifestations of phthalate toxicity.
