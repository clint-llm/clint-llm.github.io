Survival rates in patients of a young age are much better in X-linked CGD. Although the disease is named fatal granulomatous of childhood when it was first described, the disease-related mortality and morbidity rates have been increased apparently with the use of prophylactic antimicrobial and immunomodulatory treatments.

Severe and opportunistic infections, liver/biliary tract diseases, and malignancies are considered to be the most prevalent cause of mortality in patients with X-linked hyper IgM syndrome. Survival rates have been increased with HCT and the life expectancy of 20 years has reached 90%.

In XLP, the mortality has been reported as 70% for 10 years of age prior to HCT while as 100% for 40 years of age. Rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin administration and HCT reversed the mortality rates in the patients with EBV naive. Long-term mortality rates have been reduced below 30%.

In WAS, life expectancy in the patients not received treatments of hematopoietic cell transplantation or gene therapy has decreased due to infections, bleeding, autoimmune diseases, and malignancies. Bleeding is the principal cause of mortality.

The average diagnosis age of XLA has been significantly reduced within the last 50 years.

In case the patients with IPEX are not treated, they generally experience death in the infancy period.
