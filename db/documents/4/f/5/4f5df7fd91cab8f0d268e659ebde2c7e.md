Acquired anomalies affecting the azygos vein include enlargement due to hemodynamic changes or the presence of lesions. These anomalies may induce pulmonary edema due to the physiological imbalance of fluid. On chest X-ray, the size and contour of the azygos vein can provide useful insight into any hemodynamic changes. Studies have shown that the main reason for enlargement of the azygos vein is the increased mean right atrium pressure, which is usually a result of constrictive pericarditis, cardiac tamponade, pulmonary hypertension, and portal hypertension.

**Fibrosing Mediastinitis**

****A rare, typically benign condition, fibrosing mediastinitis, is the result of the proliferation of acellular collagen and fibrous tissue inside the mediastinum. There are instances where the proliferation of tissue can extend to the soft tissues of the posterior mediastinum and pleural space. Evidence for this would be appreciated by chest X-rays, which may show signs of pulmonary venous obstruction manifesting as a localized pulmonary venous hypertension. A CT scans with contrast can demonstrate the involvement of the azygos vein with fibrosing mediastinitis. The scan would depict the level and extent of the stenosis. This condition would result in engorgement of the azygos pathway.

**Superior Vena Cava Syndrome**

SVC syndrome is the result of the absence of blood flow through the SVC. An intraluminal blockage or external compression can cause the obstruction. The azygos venous system is the most important pathway for decompression of SVC obstruction. SVC syndrome develops as a result of collateral blood vessels unable to compensate for the obstructed SVC. If the obstruction of the SVC is above the azygos vein, the venous flow of the azygos vein is retrograde. If the lesion of the SVC is below the azygos vein, the venous flow direction will be anterograde.

**Inferior Vena Cava Obstruction**

Several different factors can cause IVC obstruction, but the most important are membranous obstruction, Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), and neoplastic lesions. The presence of an IVC obstruction requires decompression of the liver.  Intrahepatic venous, portocaval, and spider web vessels develop as a result of the obstruction to decompress the liver parenchyma. Ascending lumbar veins, extrahepatic collateral vessels, are also influential in the decompression of the liver in IVC obstruction and will drain into the azygos system. Lung cancer adenopathy, sarcoidosis, and lymphoma are typical examples of nonvascular lesions found in the right inferior paratracheal region, often mimicking azygos vein enlargement.

**Insertion of devices into the Azygos Vein**

Central devices may get placed in the SVC between the azygos vein arch and the atriocaval junction. Examples of central devices include central venous catheters and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). Misplacement of the catheter tip can occur with it ending up in the azygos vein and can be confirmed using chest X-rays. The film would show the catheter loop in the right superior mediastinum. Fistulas and thrombosis are typical complications of implantable devices; fistulas between the azygos vein and airways may occur. Pacemaker implantation in the azygos vein can also induce SVC syndrome because of thrombosis of the tip.

**Demonstration of the Enlargement of Azygos Vein with Specific Etiologies: Congenital Azygos Continuation and Absence of IVC**

A marked enlarged IVC on the CT is diagnostic for this entity, as demonstrated in two patients. About 50% of such cases may be associated with the polysplenia syndrome and congenital heart anomalies such as dextrocardia, cor biloculare, and pulmonary atresia.

**Inferior Vena Cava Thrombosis**

During obstruction of the IVC by thrombosis, the azygos and hemizygous veins, as well as the vertebral veins, form important collateral circulation by which venous blood can return to the heart. Enlargement of the azygos vein can occur under such a condition.

**Right Atrial Mural Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism**

These two conditions can lead to elevation of the right atrial pressure that, in turn, impedes the venous return from both the SVC and IVC, leading to enlargement of the azygos vein. A combination of IVC thrombosis, right atrial mural thrombosis, and a pulmonary embolism are not uncommon.

**Congestive Heart Failure**

Congestive heart failure, particularly the right-side heart failure, impedes the venous return to the right atrium. It is the most common cause of azygos vein enlargement.

**Portal Vein Thrombosis**

In portal vein obstruction, anastomosis between the portal and systemic circulations offers effective collateral circulation. The portal blood can empty into the left gastric vein that connects with the esophageal tributaries of the azygos and accessory hemizygous veins. Azygos vein enlargement in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension is also quite common.
