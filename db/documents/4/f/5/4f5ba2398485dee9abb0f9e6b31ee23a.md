Like other protein kinase inhibitors, the mechanism of action of afatinib is to irreversibly inhibit the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and HER4.

Afatinib exerts antineoplastic effects in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) by suppressing mTORC1, which initiates apoptosis of the cancer cells.

Zhu X. et al. conducted a study on afatinib-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cell line (HCC827 AR). The baculovirus IAP repeat protein 5 (BIRC5) was overexpressed in this cell line and was detected on Western blot analysis. BIRC5 overexpression may confer resistance to afatinib by dysregulation of apoptosis. The BIRC5 inhibitor, YM155, restored afatinib activity against the lung adenocarcinoma cell line.
