**General Disorders**

The disorders of the newborn screening panel each have their own prevalence, and each respective screen has its own sensitivity, specificity, and rates of false positives or negatives. These evaluations are for screening purposes only; should a provider encounter an ill infant, the differential diagnosis may need to be expanded to include disorders that were initially reported as negative on the newborn screen.

**Hearing Loss**

The prevalence of hearing loss is about 0.1% in full-term births and 3% or greater in preterm births.

One common reason an infant fails a hearing screen is an obstruction of the external auditory canal by amniotic fluid.

**Congenital Heart Defects**

Congenital heart defects (CHD) occur in approximately 0.4% to 1% of live births, with up to one-quarter of those categorized as “critical” (CCHD), defined as ductal-dependent heart lesions that require invasive treatment within the first month of life.

Providers caring for infants and even children should bear in mind that a normal pulse oximetry screen in the newborn nursery does not definitively rule out critical cardiac heart defects.

**Summary**

In summary, newborn screening is a far-reaching public health initiative that has reduced infant mortality and morbidity. Through simple point-of-care procedures and a single-prick blood collection, the newborn screen can aid in the detection of hearing loss, critical cardiac heart defects, and numerous metabolic, hematologic, endocrine, and genetic disorders. A provider should never be deterred from pursuing a diagnostic evaluation simply because the screening was negative, as no screen is perfect, and symptoms may evolve over time. Likewise, providers should follow best-practice guidelines to reduce false-positives and the subsequent burden of diagnostic follow-up. Premature infants and those requiring stays in the NICU have unique considerations; providers should consult their team and healthcare organization to determine optimal screening. Communication remains a significant opportunity for improvement; healthcare teams should strive to effectively explain the goals and limitations of these screens to expecting and new caregivers. As research and technology continue to make enormous strides in diagnostic and management strategies, healthcare professionals should remain engaged in the ongoing conversation about the ethical considerations of mass screening.
