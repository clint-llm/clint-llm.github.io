Saccular aneurysms account for most cases of SAH.

Fusiform aneurysms are caused by dilation of the entire circumference of the vessel, often formed as a result of atherosclerosis.

**Traumatic SAH**

Traumatic SAH commonly occurs near the site of a skull fracture and intracerebral contusion. Radiologic clues of a traumatic origin include localized bleeding in a superficial sulcus, an adjacent skull fracture, and a cerebral contusion with external evidence of traumatic injury.
