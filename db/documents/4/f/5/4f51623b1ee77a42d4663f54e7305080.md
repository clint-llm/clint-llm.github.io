The celiac plexus block (CPB) is indicated in the setting of intractable abdominal pain that is nonresponsive to less aggressive analgesic interventions; often, these patients require high-dose opioid therapies.

The CPB targets visceral afferent pain fibers from the liver, gallbladder, omentum, pancreas, mesentery, and digestive tract from the stomach to the mid-transverse colon. Therefore, a CPB may treat pain in malignant and benign neoplastic disorders involving the pancreas, biliary tree, retroperitoneal organs, and other abdominal organs. One of the most common indications for a CPB is treating abdominal pain associated with pancreatic cancer. Using a CPB to alleviate pain secondary to chronic pancreatitis remains controversial. When choosing an injectate, local anesthetics and steroids are reserved for patients with benign pathology, whereas neurolytic celiac plexus blocks are typically reserved for cancer-related pain.
