Vision is often only associated with visual acuity, particularly outside of eye care providers. This can complicate management and patient education for individuals with convergence insufficiency. The clinical presentation of convergence insufficiency patients, as discussed above, often includes a complaint of print moving on a page and difficulty with reading and other near-related tasks, and often results in reduced academic performance. That is why it is important for school nurses and teachers to consider possible binocular vision issues rather than solely attributing a lack of focus at school entirely to attention deficits, such as ADHD. Incidence reports linked a three-fold increase in the incidence of CI in patients diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared to the population in general.

Another consideration for optimally treating patients is the prescribed treatment. There appears to be a lack of consensus regarding prescribed treatment modalities, as they vary by profession. Although the first-line treatment for CI is OBVT with home reinforcement, the most commonly prescribed treatment by both optometrists and ophthalmologists is simple pencil push-ups for varying amounts of time, followed by home-based vergence therapy.
