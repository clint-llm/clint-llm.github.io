Brainstem aura migraine is often more disabling than migraine without aura and migraine with typical aura, because of increased severity and longer duration of symptoms. The frequency of brainstem aura decreases with age, and they often evolve in more typical patterns with age.

Migraines with aura have a slightly higher risk of stroke than migraine without aura; however, there is no evidence that migraine with brainstem aura has a higher risk of stroke than migraine with typical aura.

Smoking and the use of estrogen contraceptives further increase the risk of stroke, and risk factor modification should be reinforced to all patients.
