The mechanisms of action of some of the medications discussed in this article appear below. Toxicity related to these drugs would involve having more than the recommended amount of the drug in a patient's system at a given time, leading to adverse outcomes.

Benzodiazepines (BZDs) and barbiturates are gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptor agonists. GABA-A receptors are major neurotransmitter inhibitors in the central nervous system. They are ligand-gated chloride ion channels causing an influx of chloride ions into the cell. BZDs and barb increase GABA's inhibitory effect increasing the frequency and time of channel openings.

Nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists have a different chemical structure compared to BZDs, however, and they selectively target one type of GABA-A receptor.

Melatonin agonists target melatonin receptors MT and MT (with slight affinity to MT)  in the suprachiasmatic nucleus within the hypothalamus.

Antihistamines target H1 receptors in the gastrointestinal, blood vessel, and respiratory tracts.

Opiates act on multiple receptors, both centrally and peripherally. They appear to release dopamine by enhancing GABA disinhibition of dopamine release.  However, the mu receptor (opioids affect mu, kappa, and sigma) is responsible for pain relief and euphoria, but also respiratory depression, so opioid overdose results in respiratory depression, coma, and death.

Antidepressants and antipsychotics cause sedation, usually through antihistamine H1 blockade. They can also cause toxicity with other sedatives by drug-drug pharmacokinetic interaction. Anticonvulsants usually enhance GABA neurotransmission and cause sedation via this mechanism and also can cause pharmacokinetic interactions.
