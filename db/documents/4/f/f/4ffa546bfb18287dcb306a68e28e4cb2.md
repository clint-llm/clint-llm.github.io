The majority of patients develop mucositis as a result of radiation, and many foods irritate the mucosa, resulting in pain and dysphagia. A dietitian consult is needed as these patients may require a soft, bland diet. All acidic and spicy foods should be avoided. In some patients, there may be a need for gastrostomy feeding tube to allow for hydration and adequate calorie intake.

Patients usually are not able to participate in any contact sports. Further, because of the chemotherapy, they remain unusuallyÂ susceptible to microbial agents.
