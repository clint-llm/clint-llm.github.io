# Continuing Education Activity

Salivary gland tumors are a rare group of complex, heterogenous histologies that are located in the parotid gland, submandibular gland, sublingual gland, and minor salivary glands of the upper aerodigestive tract. This diverse group of malignant tumors has a wide range of etiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and prognosis. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of malignant salivary gland tumors and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of malignant salivary gland tumors and associated conditions.
- Review the physical examination of patients with malignant salivary gland tumors.
- Explain the treatment options available for malignant salivary gland tumors.

# Introduction

Salivary gland tumors are a rare group of complex, heterogenous histologies that are located in the parotid glands, submandibular glands, sublingual glands, and minor salivary glands of the upper aerodigestive tract.  The wide variety of tumor etiology, microscopic histology, growth patterns, and tumor characteristics can make diagnosis and treatment challenging for clinicians. The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2005 recognized 24 different malignant salivary gland cancers; the most common histologies include mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), acinic cell carcinoma (ACC), adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC), carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma (CExPA), and adenocarcinoma.

# Etiology

The exact etiology of salivary gland cancer is unknown, but various mechanisms have been proposed, including radiation, viruses (EBV and HIV), immunosuppression, ultraviolet light exposure, occupational exposures in rubber or nickel industries, prior diagnosis of medulloblastoma, prior diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma, androgen receptor expression, and genetics.

Compared to other head and neck cancers, the risk of developing malignant salivary gland tumors from exposure to tobacco and alcohol has been controversial, with several studies noting both positive association and no appreciable association. Sawabe et al. found no significant association between cigarette smoking and mucoepidermoid carcinoma but did show a positive correlation between tobacco smoking and other malignant salivary histologies.

Although squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck has been linked to tobacco, alcohol, and UV exposure, the presence of primary SCC in the salivary glands is rare and does not retain the same risk factors.

The majority of melanoma cases of the major salivary glands are attributed to metastasis from cutaneous sources of the upper face and scalp.

The development of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of the salivary glands has been associated with a prior diagnosis of the autoimmune disease, Sjogren syndrome (SS). Studies have shown that 4.3% of patients with Sjogren syndrome develop NHL within 5-10 years.

# Epidemiology

Salivary gland malignancies make up 0.5 to 1.2% of all cancers and 5% of head and neck cancers.

Salivary gland tumors in children are more likely to be malignant. Malignant tumors in children under 10 years old tend to be of a higher grade with poorer prognosis.

The parotid gland harbors 60 to 75% of all salivary gland tumors.

The submandibular gland harbors 10-15% of all salivary gland tumors with an equal distribution of benign and malignant neoplasms.

In the minor salivary glands, as many as 50% of tumors are malignant, most often located in the palate.

Epidemiology of Specific Salivary Gland Malignancies

- Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is the most common salivary gland malignancy in adults and children.

- Adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) accounts for about 10% of all salivary gland neoplasms and 30% of all minor salivary gland tumors. It has a predilection for patients in the 5th to 6th decade with no difference in gender, although it tends to be more common in the submandibular gland in women.

- Acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) is located in the parotid gland in more than 80% of all cases, submandibular glands in 4%, and intraoral minor salivary glands in 17%. Bilateral parotid involvement is seen in 3-5% of cases.

- Carcinoma Ex-Pleomorphic Adenoma (CExPA) accounts for 5% to 15% of all salivary gland malignancies and can arise in up to 25% of untreated pleomorphic adenoma.

- Polymorphous Low-Grade Adenocarcinoma (PLGA) occurs almost exclusively in the minor salivary glands with rare reports in the major salivary glands.

- Salivary Duct Carcinoma (SDC) accounts for 7 to 10% of all salivary gland tumors and is often found in the parotid in older men in the 6th to 7th decades.

- Primary Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) has a predilection for men and is usually found in the parotid. They are thought to be rare due to the infrequent occurrence of squamous metaplasia of ductal epithelium that is thought to be responsible for the malignant transformation.

- Primary melanoma of the salivary gland is extremely rare and accounts for 0.68% of malignant parotid neoplasms.

- Primary Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) of the salivary gland accounts for less than 10% of malignant salivary gland tumors.

# Pathophysiology

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma arises from the epithelium of the interlobular and intralobular salivary ducts. The most common genetic finding is the chromosomal translocation t(11;19)(q21:p13), leading to the fusion of MECT1 and MAML2 genes, which is responsible for disrupting the NOTCH signaling pathway.

Over 50% of Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (AdCC) tumors contain the t(6;9)(q22-23;p23-24) translocation, which fuses the MYB protooncogene on chromosome 6q to the NFIB gene on chromosome 9p, resulting in an overexpression of MYB-NFIB fusion oncogene and worse prognosis.

Acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) develops from tumorigenesis of cells responsible for acinar development, namely the reserve cells of the intercalated ducts and terminal tubule. In mice studies, inactivation of PTEN and Apc led to an upregulation of mTOR and Wnt signaling, which increased the incidence of acinic cell carcinoma.mTOR compared to other salivary malignancies.

The presence of biological receptors in salivary gland malignancies has recently come under investigation. Tyrosine kinase receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are present in up to 71% of all salivary gland cancers.C-kit is expressed in malignancies derived from the intercalated ducts of salivary glands such as adenoid cystic carcinoma.erb-B2, which has been associated with a worse prognosis.

Epigenetic mutations involving DNA promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes can lead to transcriptional inactivation and increase both the risk of salivary duct carcinoma and the transformation of pleomorphic adenoma into carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.

The presence of SCC in the salivary glands is suspected to arise from several sources including 1) malignant squamous portion of MEC, 2) metastasis from a cutaneous or mucosal head and neck source, 3) metastasis from distant primary carcinoma or 4) primary squamous cell carcinoma.

Approximately 4.4% to 5.2% of malignant melanoma of the parotid cases do not have a primary source.

The development of lymphoma from Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is theorized to be due to prolonged B-cell activity and survival. Sjogren Syndrome is associated with excessive expression of cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory factors such as interferon (IFN) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF).

# Histopathology

**Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC)**is a non-encapsulated, poorly circumscribed mass with cystic components that can often be mistaken for mucoceles.

**Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (AdCC)**presents as a non-encapsulated, well-circumscribed mass with biphasic ductal and myoepithelial components and three distinct patterns: tubular, cribriform, and solid.

**Acinic Cell Carcinoma (ACC)**presents with several growth patterns, including solid (most common), papillary-cystic, follicular, and microcystic.

**Carcinoma ex-Pleomorphic Adenoma (CExPA)**arises from an existing pleomorphic adenoma and can histologically resemble salivary duct carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or undifferentiated carcinoma.

**Polymorphous Low-Grade Adenocarcinoma (PLGA)**presents as an unencapsulated mass and is predominantly seen on the palate where there is a high concentration of minor salivary glands. Histologically, it can resemble AdCC and has an infiltrative growth pattern with a mixture of solid, cribriform, tubular, and cystic patterns.

**Salivary Duct Carcinoma**is similar in histology to high-grade duct carcinoma of the breast.

**Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**presents with intracellular keratinization, intercellular bridging, and keratin-pearl formation without any intracellular mucin.

**Melanoma**of the parotid presents with large, rounded eosinophilic cells with a pleomorphic nucleus and prominent nuclei.

**Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)**of the major salivary gland presents with atypical lymphocytes with invasion into the adjacent ductal epithelium, lymphoepithelial lesions, and lymphoid follicles or germinal centers.

A high-grade transformation is a rare event that involves the transformation of a well-differentiated tumor into an aggressive, poorly differentiated, high-grade morphology that lacks any original histologic characteristics. It can be seen in AdCC, ACC, PLGA, and MEC.

# History and Physical

Patients often present with a history of a palpable mass that localizes to the region of the salivary glands. A detailed history including pain symptoms, onset and duration of the mass, growth rate, associated swallowing difficulties, and occurrence of facial weakness should be obtained. Past medical history, including a history of previous skin cancers of the head and neck, surgical history, family history of malignancies, and social risk factors such as smoking, past radiation exposure, and occupational exposures, should be elicited.

Physical exam should include a comprehensive head and neck exam with a focus directed to the salivary glands, cranial nerves, and cervical nodes. Malignant tumors can present as painless, fixed, or mobile masses, so it may be hard to distinguish from benign tumors. Advanced malignancies may present with pain, palatal fullness, parapharyngeal fullness, trismus, overlying skin ulceration, or fistulas. Minor salivary gland tumors can present as submucosal oral swelling with ulceration or with nasal obstruction and bleeding if they occur in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx. Minor salivary gland tumors in the pharynx or larynx can cause dysphagia, odynophagia, airway obstruction, vocal hoarseness, and dyspnea on exertion.

Parotid malignancies presenting as large, fixed preauricular masses can be associated with cervical lymph node metastasis. Facial nerve paralysis can be seen in up to 12 to 15% of cases and is often associated with AdCC, MEC, and salivary duct carcinoma.

Submandibular malignancies often present as painless neck masses in the submandibular triangle of the neck. Malignant lesions here are often firm, lobulated, may be fixed to skin or deeper tissues, and may exhibit associated paralysis of the lingual nerve, hypoglossal nerve, or marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve.

Sublingual gland malignancies can present as painless, non-ulcerated masses of the floor of the mouth, although about 50% of cases can present with pain and numbness.

Minor salivary gland malignant tumors, as previously mentioned, tend to present along the upper aerodigestive tract as asymptomatic submucosal masses, rare ulceration, and occasional upper airway narrowing.

Specific presentations peculiar to the salivary malignancies include:

- Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) often presents as an asymptomatic, firm mass with occasional pain and facial paralysis.

- Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (AdCC) presents as a slow-growing, solid mass with pain secondary to perineural and extra-parenchymal invasion. Cervical lymph node metastasis occurs at a rate of 20% at presentation and is more common with submandibular tumors.

- Acinic Cell Carcinoma (ACC) presents as a slow-growing, solitary mass with occasional pain.

- Polymorphous Low-Grade Adenocarcinoma (PLGA) presents as a well-circumscribed mass with pain; ulceration is present in 8% of cases.

- Carcinoma Ex-Pleomorphic Adenoma (CExPA) commonly presents in a patient with a history of a long-standing parotid mass characterized by a sudden increase in size. It can be associated with pain and nerve palsy in up to 30% of cases.

- Salivary duct carcinoma presents as a firm, poorly-defined mass with the invasion of the surrounding glandular and soft tissue resulting in associated pain and facial nerve palsy. More than 50% of patients display cervical metastasis at initial presentation.

- Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can present as a long-standing mass with sudden-onset of rapid growth, pain, facial nerve palsy, or overlying skin ulceration.

- Melanoma of the parotid gland can present as an indolent and firm preauricular mass with infiltrative growth resulting in pain, facial nerve palsy, and overlying dermal changes such as ulceration and erythema.

- Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) of the salivary gland can present with unilateral or bilateral swelling of the parotid gland, cervical lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, vasculitis, and palpable purpura.

# Evaluation

**Evaluation Options Include**

**Ultrasound**is the first non-invasive option for evaluating major salivary gland tumors, especially superficial parotid lesions. It can help localize tumors; distinguish solid masses from cystic collections, and help guide fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Heterogenous echogenicity, local invasion, poorly-defined margins, and lymphadenopathy are sonographic signs of malignancy.

**Computerized tomography (CT).**Conventional CT can evaluate tumor extent, bony infiltration, and lymphadenopathy. However, it is limited by the dental artifact and has a poor soft-tissue resolution, especially for MEC, AdCC, and acinic cell carcinoma, leading to underestimating the lesion.

**Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**. For lesions in the deep parotid lobe, sublingual glands, and minor salivary glands, MRI is recommended to assess tumor extent, soft tissue invasion, and nerve involvement. MRI can be performed to detect the facial nerve branches and their interface with surrounding soft tissue for surgical planning. MRI has a higher sensitivity and specificity than CT in detecting perineural spread, especially for AdCC.

**Positron emission tomography (PET).**The role of PET is to detect locoregional and distant metastasis. Compared with conventional CT, PET is more accurate in demonstrating tumor extension, nodal involvement, local recurrence, and distant metastasis due to the tissues’ higher levels of standardized uptake values (SUV).

**Biopsy.**Imaging is unable to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions completely. Therefore, obtaining histological samples is key to determining the next steps in management. An incisional biopsy can be used for minor salivary glands in the oral cavity but is not recommended for parotid lesions due to the risk of damage to the facial nerve and the possibility of tumor-seeding. Hence, ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is preferred.

An ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy can obtain larger tissue specimens with histologic architecture, which improves recognition of tumor grade to allow further subtyping. The diagnosis and classification of the specific type of lymphoma of the salivary glands require histological cellular architecture.

# Treatment / Management

Surgical excision with negative margins is the mainstay of treatment for all salivary gland malignancies. Despite preoperative attempts to obtain a diagnosis through a needle biopsy, sometimes histological diagnosis may sometimes not be available until at the time of surgery when frozen specimens can be obtained for analysis. The extent of surgery and the need for neck dissection or adjuvant radiotherapy will be dependent on the subtype, grade, and stage of the malignancy.

Adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) is recommended after surgical excision to improve locoregional control in cases with positive margins, cervical metastases, advanced cancer stage, aggressive histology or grade, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, or extra-glandular extension.

Primary RT is usually reserved for patients with unresectable disease, metastatic disease, or poor surgical candidacy.

# Differential Diagnosis

- Benign salivary lesions (pleomorphic adenoma, myoepithelioma, basal cell adenoma, Warthin tumor, oncocytoma, canalicular adenoma, sebaceous adenoma, lymphadenoma, inverted ductal papilloma, intraductal papilloma, cystadenoma)

- Benign salivary cysts

- Sialadenitis

- Sialoliths

- Lymphadenopathy (from infectious or inflammatory causes)

- Tuberculosis

- Mononucleosis

- Chronic Sclerosing Sialadenitis (Küttner tumor, which is more common in the submandibular gland)

- First Branchial cleft cysts

- Lymphoepithelial cysts (especially in immunocompromised patients such as HIV patients)

- Metastases from tumors of other body sites

# Surgical Oncology

Wide local excision is the first-line treatment for all malignant salivary gland tumors. Superficial parotidectomy is the standard treatment of choice for the removal of benign and malignant parotid tumors in the superficial lobe with preservation of the facial nerve.

The disadvantages of superficial parotidectomy include excessive resection of parotid tissue leading to loss of parotid function and risk of facial nerve paralysis due to complete facial nerve dissection. For low-grade or smaller lesions located in the lateral or latero-inferior part of the superficial lobe, the partial superficial parotidectomy, where the tumor is resected with a normal margin of parotid tissue with the facial nerve dissected only in the vicinity of the tumor, has been proposed.

Excision of the entire submandibular gland should be performed for any submandibular malignant lesions or if the final diagnosis cannot be confirmed.

Cervical (neck) metastases in salivary gland malignancies range from 10% to 40% depending on tumor grade, location, histologic subtype, and size.

Chisholm et al. analyzed the anatomical distributions of positive nodal metastasis in parotid cancers showing only ipsilateral involvement. They found up to 28% in level I, 59% in level II, 52% in level II, 38% in level IV, and 42% in level IV. About 33% of cases displayed skip metastasis to level V which led to the recommendation of a complete ipsilateral neck dissection from level I-V for parotid malignancies with positive neck disease.

For submandibular and minor salivary gland carcinomas, clinical cervical metastasis is present in 8 to 20% of cases and increases up to 41% after neck dissection with the most frequently involved nodes occurring in levels I-III for submandibular gland malignancies.

# Radiation Oncology

Radiation therapy (RT) to the primary site is recommended in the postoperative or adjuvant setting to improve locoregional control and survival, especially in high-grade histology, advanced stage of the disease, positive or close margins, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, cervical lymph node metastases, or extra-glandular extension.

Primary RT is advised only in selective scenarios, including unresectable disease, poor surgical candidacy, unacceptable functional and cosmetic comorbidities from surgery, and palliation.

# Medical Oncology

Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for lymphoma of the salivary gland. Patients with MALT lymphoma are commonly treated with rituximab, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, fludarabine, and chlorambucil-cyclophosphamide.

The benefit of chemotherapy is limited for other salivary gland malignancies. Combining chemotherapeutic agents (such as with carboplatin, paclitaxel, fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea) with adjuvant radiation has shown moderate benefit with 5-year locoregional control rates of 90% to 95% reported in some studies. However, there was no overall survival benefit compared with non-responding patients.

Targeted therapies against C-Kit (Imatinib), HER2 (Trastuzumab), EGFR (Cetuximab), and mTOR (Temsirolimus) have gained popularity due to the expression of biological receptors in several malignant salivary tumors. However, response rates have not been superior. This is thought to be likely due to a discrepancy between protein overexpression and gene mutation, as well as loss of tumor suppressor PTEN that interferes with target therapy responsiveness.

# Prognosis

Salivary gland malignancies have a wide spectrum of prognoses due to the heterogeneous array of histologies. In general, the prognosis of salivary malignancies is better for children and adolescents than that for adults due to lower frequencies of cervical metastasis, absence of local soft tissue invasion, and more differentiated histologies. The 5-year overall survival for children after surgical treatment is 85% compared with 60% for adults.

Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGRF) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) have been identified in several salivary gland malignancies, such as salivary duct carcinoma. They tend to predict a higher incidence of cervical metastasis and worse survival.c-kit expression in AdCC is correlated with poorer prognosis.

- Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC): Low-grade MEC, especially cases with the MECT1-MAML2 gene fusion, have a good prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of more than 90%. However, the high-grade squamous variant of MEC has a high tendency for recurrence, cervical metastasis, and distant metastasis with 5-year survival as low as 30% to 41.6%.

- Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (AdCC): Distant metastasis in AdCC takes a prolonged course and is often more common than cervical metastasis.

- Acinic cell carcinoma (ACC): Overall survival is influenced by male gender, age >45 years, tumor size larger than 3 cm, and presence of distant metastasis.

- Carcinoma Ex-Pleomorphic Adenoma (CExPA): CExPA can display a wide range of recurrence and survival rates depending on the extent of differentiation and invasion. Tumors with wide extracapsular invasion beyond 5 mm of the capsule present with a high risk of recurrence and distant metastasis.

- Polymorphous Low-Grade Adenocarcinoma (PLGA): Local recurrence is reported in 9-33% of cases with cervical lymph node metastasis present in 6% to 35% of cases and distant metastasis at 1%.

- Salivary duct carcinoma: Salivary duct carcinoma presents with perineural and lymphovascular invasion in 60% and 30% of cases, respectively.

- Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC): The overall 5-year survival of primary SCC of the salivary glands is influenced based on tumor staging and ranges from 50% to 80% for early-stage tumors and 15% for advanced staged tumors.

- Melanoma: The prognosis of melanoma of unknown primary is controversial, with some studies stating no difference compared with typical melanoma at the same stage.

- Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL): Patients with MALT have a 3-year overall survival of 80%.

# Complications

The incidence of temporary facial nerve palsy after parotidectomy ranges from 10% to 65%, with permanent paralysis seen in less than 5%.

Patients who undergo submandibular gland resection or neck dissection for cervical lymph node metastasis have a risk of neurological damage to the spinal accessory, phrenic, hypoglossal, lingual, vagus, sympathetic trunk, and the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve.

Complications from radiation include sensorineural hearing loss, chronic otitis media/externa, otalgia, skin erythema, mucositis, dysphagia, dysgeusia, xerostomia, soft tissue fibrosis, osteoradionecrosis, and radiation-induced malignancy.

# Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care

The goals of postoperative surveillance are to detect locoregional recurrence and manage any treatment complications that may arise. Surgery and radiation can result in long-term swallowing difficulties (xerostomia, mucositis, trismus) as well as cosmetic defects from facial nerve paralysis. Early intervention for facial nerve reconstruction and rehabilitation, as well as consultation with speech pathologists for swallowing difficulties, are vital for allowing the patient to re-integrate as much as possible into their pre-treatment functional status and improve quality of life.

Over 70% of recurrences occur within the first 3 years of treatment, except for low-grade malignancies and adenoid cystic carcinoma. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for post-treatment surveillance, patients should receive regular follow up every 1 to 3 months in the 1 year after treatment, every 2-6 months in the 2 years, every 4-8 months in the 3 to 5 years, and every 12 months after the 5 years.

# Consultations

Diagnosis and management of salivary malignancies would need to consist of an interprofessional team, including an otolaryngologist, general surgeon, plastic or reconstructive surgeon, radiation oncologist, medical oncologist, speech-language pathologist, psychologist, and primary care physician.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients should be educated on the risk factors for the development of salivary gland tumors and counseled to avoid exposure to these risks as much as possible. Patients and their families should be educated on the different treatment options and timeline, including surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Patients and parents should be counseled on the possible risks and complications of all treatment modalities and their comorbidities fully assessed by their primary care physicians to determine if they will be candidates for surgical resection. The importance of long-term follow up is crucial for salivary malignancies and must be emphasized to patients, given the indolent growth pattern of certain pathologies such as adenoid cystic carcinoma.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Patients with salivary malignancies should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of otolaryngologists, plastic surgeons, general surgeons, pathologists, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and primary care physicians. Salivary malignancies present with varying histologies and severities, often requiring multimodal therapy involving surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.

Close communication and collaboration between the surgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists can provide a tailored approach for each patient. Difficulties in swallowing can occur from acute radiation toxicity. Patients may need a consultation with general surgery for gastric tube placement to ensure optimal nutrition perioperatively and for the duration of any adjuvant therapy. The speech-language pathologist's early post-treatment intervention can help patients regain pre-treatment function to prevent malnutrition and dependence on enteral feeding. Recurrence of salivary malignancies can occur several years, even decades, after initial treatment. Thus, the otolaryngologist, medical and radiation oncologists, and primary care physician's routine close follow-up is strongly recommended. Finally, patients may develop visible surgical scarring and facial nerve paralysis associated with depression, social anxiety, and social avoidance. Formal peer support groups and consultation with a psychologist can aid patients in addressing these latter concerns.
