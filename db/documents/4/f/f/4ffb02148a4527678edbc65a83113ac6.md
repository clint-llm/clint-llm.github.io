Bumetanide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or components of the formulation. It is also contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to loop diuretics, hepatic disease, hepatic encephalopathy, severe electrolyte depletion, and anuria. Bumetanide is in the FDA pregnancy risk category C classification. The safety and efficacy of bumetanide use have not been established in neonates, infants, children, and adolescents under age 18 years.

Complete medication reconciliation should be performed on all patients when adding any drug therapy, and bumetanide is no exception. Loop diuretics might enhance the hypotensive effect (specifically postural hypotension) and increase nephrotoxicity of ACE inhibtors.
