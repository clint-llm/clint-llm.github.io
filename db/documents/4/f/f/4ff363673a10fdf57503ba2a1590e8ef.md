Gait disturbances are described as any deviations from normal walking or gait. Numerous etiologies cause these disturbances. Due to their different clinical presentations, a high index of suspicion is required. The etiology can be determined through the clinical presentation, laboratory work, and diagnostic testing.Â Gait problems can be subdivided into episodic and chronic disturbances.

Neurological causes are more common than non-neurological causes. Sensory ataxia caused by polyneuropathy, parkinsonism, subcortical vascular encephalopathy, and dementia is among the most common neurological causes. Hip and knee osteoarthritis causing pain and limit motion are common non-neurological causes of gait disorders.
