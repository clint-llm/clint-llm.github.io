Failure to address the colonic distension for intestinal pseudo-obstruction can result in the major complications of bowel ischemia or perforation, which may require urgent surgical intervention. As discussed previously, if a mechanical obstruction is not ruled out, the administration of neostigmine in a patient with a bowel obstruction can result in a catastrophic perforation.
