Factors that may affect the performance and negatively influence the clinical validity of a GES are:

- Incomplete meal consumption

- Slow meal consumption (taking longer than 10 minutes)

- Vomiting a portion of the meal

- Poor glycemic control

If these problems occur, they should be included in the exam report as well as a comment as to their potential impact on the accuracy of the results.
