Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) are a spectrum of diseases that range from self-limiting, localized conditions to aggressive lymphomas. The Epstein-Barr virus is a ubiquitous organism, achieving asymptomatic lifelong carrier status in a large proportion of the world's population. The pathophysiology of this latent infection is due to the interaction of EBV with the memory B cells of a healthy, immunocompetent individual. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of EBV positive mucocutaneous ulcer and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of a patient with EBV positive mucocutaneous ulcer.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with EBV positive mucocutaneous ulcer.
- Summarize the treatment of EBV positive mucocutaneous ulcer.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by EBV positive mucocutaneous ulcer.
