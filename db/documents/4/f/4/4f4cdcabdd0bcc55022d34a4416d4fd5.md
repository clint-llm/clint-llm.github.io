Coronary artery calcification in several large observational studies has been shown to predict future cardiovascular events. Furthermore, when added to commonly used risk prediction models, CAC significantly improves risk prediction and stratification compared to other biomarkers. It can correctly classify patients into low-risk and high-risk categories. Patients have an extremely low risk of cardiovascular disease and events if they have no coronary calcification detected (CAC score of 0). For example, in patients who are classified as low risk due to risk factors present or Framingham risk score, a CAC of 100 indicated an estimated 10-year all-CHD event rate of nearly 10%. However, in patients classified as high risk due to risk factors present, a CAC score of 0 is associated with a 10-year all-CHD event risk of only 3%. Asymptomatic patients who are in the intermediate-risk category most commonly undergo CAC scoring due to guideline recommendations. A CAC score of greaterÂ than 400 is associated with worse clinical outcomes. This illustrates the ability of coronary artery calcification scoring to help reclassify the risk of many patients and estimate future cardiovascular events.
