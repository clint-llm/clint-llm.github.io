Opioid analgesia is indicated for the management of pain in patients where an opioid analgesic is appropriate. What, exactly, the term appropriate constitutes has been a recently contentious issue. Center for Disease Control and Prevention's 2016 guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain state that "clinicians should consider opioid therapy only if expected benefits for both pain and function will outweigh risks to the patient. When using opioids, it should be in combination with nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy, as appropriate." In the same guidelines, the CDC defines the indication of opioid use for acute pain, stating that "when opioids are used for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dose of immediate-release opioids and should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. Three days or less will often be sufficient; more than seven days will rarely be needed."
