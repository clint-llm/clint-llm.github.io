The neurovascular mapping of the anterolateral wall is an intricate network of blood supply and nerves. The dermatomes of the anterolateral wall are a clear representation of the peripheral nerve distribution. The dermatomes begin posteriorly and travel anteriorly, wrapping around the sides of the abdomen and meeting in the midline along the linea alba. Each dermatome has a slightly inferior slope, almost following the slant of the rib cage. Important dermatomes to remember are the T10 and L1 dermatomes, including the umbilicus and the inguinal fold. These are important to remember if a nerve block is needed for an umbilical or an inguinal hernia before an operation to decrease the postoperative pain the patient may experience.

Major nerves to the anterolateral abdominal wall include the thoracoabdominal, lateral cutaneous, subcostal, iliohypogastric, and ilioinguinal nerves. The thoracoabdominal nerves are derived from T7-T11 and form the inferior intercostal nerves. These nerves run along the internal obliques and the transversalis muscles. They then enter subcutaneous tissue to become the anterior cutaneous branches of the skin in the anterior abdominal wall. The majority of these nerves innervate the muscles of the anterolateral wall, as well as the skin overlaying. The lateral cutaneous nerves innervate the skin overlying the hypogastric regions bilaterally. The subcostal nerve runs along the border of the 12th rib until it passes into the abdominal wall and runs through the second and third muscular layers. The subcostal nerve innervates the inferior portion of the external oblique, skin, superior region to the inguinal crest, and inferior to the umbilicus.  The iliohypogastric nerve is the continuation of the superior branch of the anterior ramus of L1. It emerges through the transversalis muscle and runs along the second and third muscular layers of the abdominal wall, then emerges once again through the external oblique aponeurosis. The iliohypogastric innervates the transversus abdominis, and internal oblique muscles then become responsible for the sensation of the skin overlying the iliac crest, superior inguinal canal, and hypogastric regions. The ilioinguinal nerve extends from the inferior branch of the anterior ramus of L1. This nerve courses through the second and third layers of the abdominal wall until it transverses through the inguinal canal. This nerve is commonly encountered during open inguinal hernia repairs as it overlays the inguinal canal and, if severed, could cause loss of sensation in the inguinal region, mons pubis, medial thigh, and the anterior scrotum or labium majora.
