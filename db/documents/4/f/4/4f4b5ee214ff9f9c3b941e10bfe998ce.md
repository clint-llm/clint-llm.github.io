The perfusion of tissues through vessels is dependent on the adequate pumping function of the heart. Arteries carry blood away from the heart, with veins transporting blood back to it. The microcirculation becomes progressively thinner in terms of wall thickness at the level of the capillaries to promote the necessary exchange of gases and metabolites, and removal of waste. Except for the capillaries (endothelial cells only), the wall of these vessel conduits consists of three layers, an inner intima, a middle media, and an outer adventitia. Of the intrinsic vessel wall components, endothelial cells form a thin non-fenestrated layer connected by tight junctions in most arteries, veins, and capillaries of the circulatory system to regulate homeostasis. Fenestrated endothelial cells are present in the circulatory beds of the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and endocrine/exocrine glands, where increased transport and filtration exists. Vascular SMCs (vSMCs) are a second component that is absent in capillaries but exists elsewhere to provide tension via its contractile properties.
