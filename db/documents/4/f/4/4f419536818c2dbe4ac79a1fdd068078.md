As well as checking vital signs and monitoring laboratory values commonly measured during chemotherapeutic treatment, such as liver enzymes, blood cell counts, plasma proteins, and electrolytes, recommendations are that physicians acquire periodic chest imaging of patients receiving bleomycin. This is due to the high risk of pulmonary toxicity associated with the drug and the ability to detect signs of resultant fibrosis on a number of imaging modalities. Such imaging modalities include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and plain film X-rays. However, it bears mentioning that according to some sources, imaging alone is considered a nonspecific test for detecting bleomycin pulmonary toxicity, and additional diagnostic tools may be required. In addition to imaging, baseline and post-treatment pulmonary function tests are often part of the patient treatment and monitoring plan.
