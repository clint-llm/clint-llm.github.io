Hunter syndrome is a genetically associated lysosomal storage disorder due to the deficiency of the iduronate 2-sulfatase enzyme (IDS). It is an X-linked recessive disorder and occurs predominantly in males. Iduronate 2-sulfatase (IDS) is responsible for the breakdown of large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans. Decreased activity of IDS results in intracellular and extracellular accumulation of heparan sulfate (HS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) in multiple organs of the body. Hunter syndrome presents during childhood.
