Patients with a cutaneous horn typically present with a hard, conical projection, usually seen over the sun-exposed areas like face, eyelids, forearms, etc. Aside from presenting as a cosmetic issue, cutaneous horns may also be associated with pain and rapid growth. More importantly, there is a considerable chance there could be a premalignant or malignant complication causing the cutaneous horn. Each underlying pathology may have complications, which is why it is crucial to identify the underlying cause of a patient's horn.
