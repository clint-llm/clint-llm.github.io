Pemphigus herpetiformis is a rare subtype of intraepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases that associate the clinical characteristics of dermatitis herpetiformis and the immunologic features of pemphigus. Although Jablonska and others proposed the name of this entity in 1975, similar clinical presentations were reported earlier and named dermatitis herpetiformis with acantholysis, mixed bullous disease, and pemphigus controlled by sulfapyridine.
