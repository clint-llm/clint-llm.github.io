Patients presenting with pudendal nerve damage can be identified based on their history and presenting symptoms. Typically, neuropathy is noted in the distribution of the pudendal nerve.

Injuries to the pudendal nerve can occur during childbirth. Due to the pathway of the pudendal nerve, it is vulnerable to stretch injuries during labor. Mothers delivering children with above average birth weight are particularly susceptible to these injuries. Patients may present with fecal and or urinary incontinence post-delivery.

Patients who have chronic irritation of the pudendal nerve, usually from prolonged sitting, may develop an uncommon syndrome known as pudendal nerve entrapement or pudendal neuralgia.

A pudendal nerve block is a procedure that involves injecting a local anesthetic in the proximity of the pudendal nerve. This procedureÂ can help in the diagnosis of pudendal nerve entrapment and can be used for pain relief during obstetric procedures, especially during childbirth in women who are unable to undergo spinal anesthesia. The block is performed by administering a single injection adjacent to the pudendal nerve to transiently prevent nerve conduction. In these procedures, the ischial spine is used as a landmark to aid in administering the anesthetic in the correct location.
