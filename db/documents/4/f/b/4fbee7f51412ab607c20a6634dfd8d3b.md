The overall complication rate of arterial catheterization in adult patients ranges from 10% to 13%. Among the various complications, catheter-related infection and inflammation were the most common (61.8%). Other complications include mechanical complications (14.1%), embolic or thrombotic events (7.5%), and amputation for ischemic injury (0.6%). In addition, femoral artery catheterization has been associated with a higher risk of thrombosis than the radial approach. Higher complication rates are associated with critically ill patients, cardiac surgery, bone marrow transplantation, and hemodialysis.

Arterial catheterization in a pediatric patient can be daunting. Operators are often challenged with a blood vessel diameter of only 2 or 3 mm. Studies of the complication rate in the pediatric population are few; the largest retrospective analysis of more than 10,000 pediatric patients reported a complication rate of 10.3%) in pediatric patients. A young age of 1 to 4 months, catheter placement late in the hospital course, and systemic infections are additional risk factors for complications in the pediatric population.
