The Berg Balance Scale is a test used to assess functional balance. It was created by Katherine Berg in 1989 to evaluate balance ability in the elderly, with the initial target population having an average age of 73.

The scale has been useful in predicting the risk of falls and outcomes and even assessing the length of stay at inpatient rehabilitation.
