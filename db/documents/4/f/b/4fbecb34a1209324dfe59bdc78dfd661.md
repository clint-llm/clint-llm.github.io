Ainhum, also called dactylolysis spontanea, is a rare disease of fibrotic constricting bands that most commonly occur over digits. These rings of fibrous tissue may result in significant morbidity and auto-amputation. Although historically a disease of South American and African individuals, it is recognized in more broad literature and White and rarely in India. The disease requires differentiation from other hereditary and secondary constricting band diseases. This activity outlines the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of ainhum.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of ainhum medical conditions and emergencies.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of ainhum.
- Review the management options available for ainhum.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes in patients with ainhum.
