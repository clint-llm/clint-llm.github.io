GABA is involved in several disease states:

- Pyridoxine deficiency is a rare disease in which the vitamin is not available for the synthesis of GABA. It usually presents as frequent seizures during infancy that are resistant to treatment with anticonvulsants but responds very well to vitamin supplementation.

- The clinical features of hepatic encephalopathy are thought to be due to elevated ammonia levels binding to the GABA-A/GABA complex and increasing chloride ion permeability.

- The symptoms of Huntington disease are partially caused by a lack of GABA in the striatal projections to the globus pallidus.

- Dystonia and spasticity are believed to be related to a deficiency in GABA signaling.
