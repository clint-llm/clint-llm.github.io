Patients with incomplete abortion normally have a good prognosis and can be managed expectantly with an 82% to 96% success rate with no future consequences on fertility.

Incomplete abortions after 12 weeks have a 3.4% increased risk of unfavorable outcomes, including maternal death, major surgery, or sterility. This is likely secondary to the increases in the fetus size, blood supply, and uterine size. After 14 weeks of gestation, there is an even further increased risk of maternal death and serious complications. Another risk factor for poor prognosis is delayed time to seeking treatment, which can be seen in rural and poor communities where healthcare is sparse.
