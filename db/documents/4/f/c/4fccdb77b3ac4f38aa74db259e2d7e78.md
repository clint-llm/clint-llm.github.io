There are many causes of diabetes insipidus, and the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the primary care provider, nurse practitioner/physician assistant, internist, and pharmacist. Patient education is crucial. The key is to hydrate, replace the electrolytes, and then manage the primary condition causing DI. The pharmacist should keep track of all medications that can cause DI and make the appropriate recommendations to the clinician. The nurse should educate the patient on traveling to hot destinations because dehydration can exacerbate the symptoms. If possible, travel should be avoided until the condition is treated. In post-operative patients, the specific gravity of the urine and osmolality should be monitored before administering desmopressin. Also, regular monitoring of electrolytes should be considered.

**Outcome**

The outlook for patients with diabetes insipidus depends on the cause. The prognosis for benign causes is good, but the prognosis is guarded if the cause is a malignancy.
