It is postulated that cancerous cells spread to leptomeninges via several different mechanisms, including direct seeding from brain parenchyma, dura mater (not protected by BBB), and bone, endoneurial/perineural invasion, and hematogenous seeding (especially via venous plexi). Some studies also indicate a correlation between neurosurgical interventions like cerebellar metastasis resection and the opening of ventricles with LC. Another possible entry point is through the fenestrated endothelium of the choroid plexus, which allows selective solute transport in contrast to the BBB. One study suggests the upregulation of complement component 3 by cancer cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which in turn causes interruption of BBB and leads to penetration of plasma growth factors into the CSF. One such plasma growth factor implicated in the process is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), promoting tumor angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation. It is also an important drug target. There are different patterns of involvement of the leptomeninges, but typically basal cisterns, posterior fossa, and cauda equina are affected.
