Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA) is useful in cases where surgery is not feasible for pulmonary metastasis.

**Colorectal Cancer**

About 20% of the patients with colorectal cancer will develop lung metastasis, with 7% developing isolated lung metastasis. Without treatment, median survival is eight months, and 1-year survival is 30%. Patients who undergo surgical resection have a median survival of 36 to 50 months with a 5-year survival of 36% to 67.8%. After surgery, the recurrence rate is 68%, with the lung being the most common site of recurrence. The median survival duration from colorectal cancer treated with radiofrequency ablation is  33 to 67 months; the one, three, and five-year survival rates are 83.9% to 95%, 46 to 76.1%, and 35% to 56%, respectively. The local recurrence rate is 13% to 38%. Therefore, ablation therapy can achieve similarly efficient results as surgical resection. Meanwhile, RFA and surgery both provide similar survival predictors, including the number of lung metastases, whether to perform R0 (clean margins) resection, preoperative ACE levels, and whether thoracic lymph node metastasis has developed.

Of note, pulmonary metastasis from colorectal carcinoma treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is not removable by surgery.

RFA  does less harm to the healthy lung tissue, does not cause changes in lung function, and RFA is repeatable on the same or different lung metastases. A trial of 17 patients with colorectal carcinoma with pulmonary metastasis treated with RFA combined with systemic chemotherapy (n = 10) compared with systemic chemotherapy alone (n= 7). The median survival duration of RFA combined with systemic chemotherapy versus systemic chemotherapy alone was 44.2 vs. 24.7, and the three-year survival rates were 87.5% vs. 33.3% (P = 0.0041). Ablation therapy combined with systemic chemotherapy was superior to chemotherapy alone for the treatment of pulmonary metastasis in colorectal carcinoma. It eliminates colorectal metastasis to the lung and prolongs patient survival.

Bone and soft tissue sarcoma: Around 10% to 15% of osteosarcoma and 20% of soft tissue sarcoma patients have developed distant metastases by the time of diagnosis, and lung metastases account for 85%. Despite recent chemotherapy regimens, there has not been any effective chemotherapy treatment recommended. Due to the conventional dosage of radiotherapy being too severe, stereotactic radiotherapy has been used to control the local disease with 1, 2, 3-year local control rate 94%, 86%, and 82% with a survival rate at 1 and 2 years 76% and 43%. Surgery resection three and 5-year survival rates range from 25 to 54% and 14 to 25%, but only 25 to 30% are operable with a recurrence rate of 40 to 80%. Higher perioperative mortality from surgery is reported in old patients.

Radiofrequency ablation has been minimally invasive, is a good alternative with favorable results proven in different studies. RFA in 29 patients with lung metastases from sarcoma with one and three-year survival rates were 92%  and  63%,  respectively. A report on 21 patients with lung metastases from sarcoma that underwent RFA showed that two and three-year survival rates were 94% and 85%, respectively.

**Renal Cancer**

Roughly 25% to 30% of patients have distant metastases at the time of diagnosis, and the lung is the most common site of metastasis. Lung metastases from renal cancer are not sensitive to traditional radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The median survival duration is only 8 to 12 months, and the 5-year survival rate is only 2 to 3%.

Treatment with IL-2 and IFN-alpha based immunotherapy is effective in less than 20% of patients with an overall median survival duration is only 13.3 months. With the emergence of molecular targeted therapy, sorafenib is one of the preferred treatments for advanced renal cell carcinoma. Overall survival in the sorafenib group was significantly higher than in the placebo group  (17.8  vs. 14.3 months, hazard ratio 0.78; P = 0.0287). Drug side effects and resistance usually result in the early termination of treatment.

Surgical resection is an effective method for treating lung metastasis from renal carcinoma, with the five-year survival rate ranging from 31 to 40%.  Surgical resection in 48 patients with lung metastases from renal cancer yielded 3, 5, and 10-year survival rates of 60%, 47%, and 18%, respectively.  Another study performed surgical resection in 224 patients with lung metastases from renal cancer with 5-year tumor-specific survival rates of the complete resection (n= 49), and palliative resection (n = 175) groups were 73.6% and 19%, respectively.

In recent years, ablation therapy has been attempted to treat lung metastasis from renal cancer. A study reported a five-year survival rate of 53.8% in 68 patients with lung metastases from renal cancer. Soget al. used RFA to treat 39 patients with lung metastases from renal cancer though significant differences in the overall survival rates between the curative and palliative groups at one (100% vs. 90%), three (100% vs. 52%), and five (100% vs. 52%) years (P < 0.05).

**Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)**

Being asymptomatic at the initial presentation results in late diagnosis, and cancer diagnosis occurs at an advanced stage. The incidence of lung metastases from primary liver cancer is as high as 20% or more and reaches 40 to 73% in the autopsy.

Sorafenib is the preferred treatment for lung metastases from primary liver cancer. Limitations for treatment include low response rate, severe adverse reactions, and high cost.

Surgical resection of lung metastases from liver cancer can significantly improve patient survival. In a study of 280 patients with lung metastases from liver cancer, the median survival duration was 40.36 with 1, 3, and 5-year survival rate of 86.7%, 53.9%, 31.8%, and 26.9%, respectively. In the unresectable groups, the median survival was 7.46 months, and the one, three, five, and 10-year survival rates were and 34.1%, 8.1%, 3.5%, and 2.1%. In most cases, due to liver cirrhosis, the patient’s liver function is so poor that they cannot tolerate surgical treatment for lung metastasis.

In a study of 83 lung metastases in 32 liver cancer cases, were treated with RFA, and the one, two, and three-year survival rates were 83%, 57%, and 57%, respectively. Another study involves performing  RFA for 68 lung metastases in 29 liver cancer patients, and the one, two, and three-year survival rates were 73.1%, 41.1%, and 30%, respectively. Hence  RFA is a good alternative for patients who are not surgical candidates.

Ablation therapy for lung metastasis from nasopharyngeal cancer: Microwave ablation of 29 lung metastases in 17 patients with nasopharyngeal cancer was performed with complete ablation achieved in 27 patients. New lung metastases only occurred in five patients in a one-year follow-up period.  A study indicated that the median survival duration of nasopharyngeal cancer patients with lung metastasis (10 pts) treated with RFA combined with chemotherapy was significantly longer than those who received chemotherapy alone (77.1  vs.  32.4 months, respectively( P= 0.009).

Stereotactic radiotherapy is another modality used if tumors are unresectable functionally. Using a dose of more than 100 Gy in 1-5 dose fractions. Even in cancers, e.g., metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, which are usually considered radioresistant, reports show 88% local control at 18 months.
