The rule of 3's for nerve injury:

- Sharp, clean nerve injuries should be explored and repaired within 3 hours

- Ragged, contusion injuries should have the ragged ends bound to a nearby anatomical structure immediately, then be repaired within three weeks

- Closed injuries should be repaired within three months.
