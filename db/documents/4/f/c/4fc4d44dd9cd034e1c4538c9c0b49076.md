Urinary incontinence is a salient issue in any primary care physician practice. It is imperative that a thorough history and workup be done to establish a differential diagnosis that is accurate before discussing treatment strategies. The physician should inform the patient all treatment options available before deciding on further management. Not all treatment is intended to cure the patient of all symptoms completely. Even if the incontinence is reduced in severity to a level where the patient is satisfied with the quality of life, this should still be considered a success. A clear understanding of patient expectations is paramount during collaboration. All possible reasons for failing to meet expectations should also be explained to the patient. It is the ethical responsibility of the physician to offer the least invasive treatment (behavioral modification or medications) options before proceeding to surgical plans. An interprofessional approach with excellent communication is essential when urogynecologists, urologists, or other health care providers become involved in management to improve outcomes. (Level III)
