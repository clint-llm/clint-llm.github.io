There are specific genetic mutations associated with hormonally active and inactive adrenal adenomas. However, the exact pathogenesis is not entirely clear.

Mutations of CTNNB1 genes which provide instructions for making beta-catenin (Wnt/beta-catenin pathway) is associated with the larger and non-secreting adrenocortical adenomas.

The mutations associated with cortisol-producing adrenal nodules include PRKACA (cortisol producing adenoma)

The mutations associated with aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas include KCNJ5
