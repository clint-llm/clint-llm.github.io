An ultrasound-guided ulnar nerve block can be used to provide surgical anesthesia or analgesia to the ulnar portion of the hand including the little finger and the ulnar half of the ring finger. It is primarily used for surgical procedures that involve the distribution of the ulnar nerve either as a standalone block, or combined with a radial nerve block for a complete hand block, or as a rescue method for inadequate brachial plexus blocks. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications and complications of ulnar nerve blocks and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures involved in an ulnar nerve block.
- Describe the indications for an ulnar nerve block.
- Describe the technique involved in performing an ulnar nerve block.
- Explain how careful planning and discussion amongst interprofessional team members involved in the management of patients undergoing ulnar nerve blocks will improve outcomes.
