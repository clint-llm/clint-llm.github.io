Patients on RTIs, and more importantly, HAART, should have close follow-up with the primary clinician taking care of them. Physicians should work closely with nurses to keep a proper follow-up on patients to ensure optimal therapy and look out for potential adverse effects. Physicians can also work closely with pharmacists to help optimize treatment and give the best medications to patients to achieve optimal therapy; the pharmacist can consult on the best combinations of agents and optimal dosing and administration. Nursing and pharmacy must both emphasize the importance of strict compliance to patients, as a lack of compliance can be devastating to therapy and, subsequently, their life. Concerns about compliance need to be brought to the prescribing clinician's attention immediately. All interprofessional healthcare team members are responsible for providing the best care to their patients and monitoring adverse effects. An interprofessional team will result in the best outcomes with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]
