Globally, in 2016, approximately 52.9 million children reportedly had identifiable developmental problems delay. Since 95% of the population resides in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), there is an increased risk for developmental delays and disorders.

The prevalence of delay in development involving respective domains among children (which is based on data reported in children getting services in 2007 by USPSTF on their respective website) is given below:

- Cognitive (1% to 1.5%)

- Learning disability (8%)

- Speech and language (2% to 19%)

- Any delay (15%)

According to Drakenstein Child Health Study (DCHS) conducted in Western Cape, South Africa, the risk of low developmental performance in the high-risk environment was high among boys. Likewise, several other studies have also reported a slightly increased incidence in males, possibly due to genetic variability on the X-chromosome.
