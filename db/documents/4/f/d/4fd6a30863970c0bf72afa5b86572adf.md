The patella is supplied by a vast vascular network that can be separated into extraosseous and intraosseous divisions. With contributions from the anterior tibial recurrent arteries, the supreme, medial superior and inferior, and lateral superior and inferior geniculate arteries form an extraosseous anastomotic ring around the patella. The intraosseous vascular supply consists of the mid patellar vessels, which enter vascular foramina on the anterior surface of the middle third of the patella, and the polar vessels, which enter between the attachment of the ligamentum patellae and the articular surface on the deep surface of the patella.
