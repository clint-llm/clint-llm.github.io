Physicians and patients should be aware that certain factors may cause a change in CD4 cell count. Any changes in the total white blood cells (WBCs) can lead to changes in the absolute value. Many factors, including circadian variation, influence the absolute count of lymphocytes. Studies have shown that CD4 count is usually lower in the morning and increases throughout the day. Acute infection, for example, influenza, pneumonia, hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, and chemotherapy, may lead to a decrease in CD4 cell count. Stress and fatigue can also interfere with results. Of interest, corticosteroids may either increase or decrease the levels of CD4 cells. Single doses of steroids may lead to a decline in the absolute value. On the other hand, chronic steroid use may lead to an elevated count. Other factors that should merit consideration are alcohol, nicotine, and pregnancy, as they also may alter the absolute CD4 count.

The factors interfering with CD4 T lymphocytes may cause the percentage and absolute CD4 cells count to vary. The CD4 cell percentage has less variation than the absolute number, and for this reason, it is sometimes preferable. If the results are significantly different, and the patient may require medical intervention, results require confirmation within 3 to 6 months.
