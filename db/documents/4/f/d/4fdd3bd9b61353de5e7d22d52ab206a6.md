Sialadenitis and sialadenosis are common causes of submandibular gland swelling. Submandibular sialadenitis is inflammation of the submandibular gland, which is caused by salivary stasis that leads to retrograde seeding of bacteria from the oral cavity. Sialadenosis is a benign,non-inflammatory swelling of salivary glands usually associated with metabolic conditions. This activity reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, histopathology, clinical features, treatment, and management of submandibular sialadenitis and sialadenosis. This activity also discusses complications, the prognosis of submandibular sialadenosis, and sialadenitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of submandibular sialadenitis and sialadenosis.
- Review the steps for the evaluation of submandibular sialadenitis and sialadenosis.
- Summarize the management options available for submandibular sialadenitis and sialadenosis.
- Outline the prognosis of submandibular sialadenitis and sialadenosis.
