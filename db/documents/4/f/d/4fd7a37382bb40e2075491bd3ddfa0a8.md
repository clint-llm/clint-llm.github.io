Histologically angiokeratoma circumscriptum lesions demonstrate dilated dermal papillary capillaries drained by dilated venules. The associated epidermis, which may encase the dilated vessels, is acanthotic and hyperkeratotic with elongated rete ridges.

Verrucous hemangiomas may look very similar clinically and histologically; however, angiokeratoma circumscriptum is limited to the papillary dermis, and verrucous hemangiomas characteristically involve the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Obtaining a deep biopsy of the lesion is essential to making a correct diagnosis.
