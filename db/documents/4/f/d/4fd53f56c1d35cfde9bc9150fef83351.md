Etoposide is a relatively well-tolerated chemotherapeutic agent.

Although the mechanism is unknown, acute hypersensitivity reactions can occur with the use of etoposide. During intravenous administration, patients can experience flushing, bronchospasm, cyanosis, hypertension, or hypotension.

Patients on warfarin require close monitoring when using etoposide because of the potential side effects of bleeding.

Different mechanisms have noted resistance to etoposide. Those cells with low levels of topoisomerase II are resistant to etoposide. The multiple drug resistance efflux pump also removes etoposide from cells. Some malignant cells have even deactivated etoposide.
