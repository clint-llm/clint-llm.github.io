Baricitinib is an oral selective and reversible inhibitor of Janus Kinases (JAKs). Janus Kinase is an intracellular enzyme that belongs to the tyrosine-protein kinase family and modulates signals from cytokines and growth factor receptors involved in immune cell function.

There are four JAK proteins (JAK 1, JAK 2, JAK 3 and TYK2). These proteins pair differently in different cell receptors and form homodimers or heterodimers. These JAK dimers phosphorylate the transcription proteins (STATs) and activate intracellular activity, including gene transcription, of inflammatory mediators leading to an autoimmune response.

Baricitinib has a higher affinity for JAK1 and JAK2. It inhibits the JAK proteins, prevents phosphorylation and activation of STATs, and modulates the signaling pathway of various interleukins, interferons, and growth factors. Baricitinib also decreases the proliferation of JAK1/JAK2 expression in mutated cells and induces cell apoptosis.
