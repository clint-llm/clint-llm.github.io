Coronary artery pressure measurement is fundamental in treating angiographically intermediate lesions. Inappropriate percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in non-flow limiting coronary stenosis can lead lead to complications of stent thrombosis and a potential increase in mortality. It is, thus, important to understand physiological interpretation to guide coronary revascularization. This activity reviews coronary arterial pressure measurement tools and highlights the role of the interventional cardiology team in improving the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing PCI.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of physiological assessment using FFR and iFR.
- Describe the technical aspects of performing a coronary pressure measurement with iFR.
- Outline appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of coronary arterial pressure measurement. 
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance coronary artery pressure measurements and improve outcomes.
