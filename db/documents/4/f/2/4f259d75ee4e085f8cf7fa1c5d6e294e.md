**Arterial Injury**

Most epidural hematomas result from arterial bleeding from a branch of the middle meningeal artery. The anterior meningeal artery or dural arteriovenous (AV) fistula at the vertex may be involved.

**Venous Injury**

Up to 10% of EDHs are due to venous bleeding following the laceration of a dural venous sinus.

In adults, up to 75% of EDHs occur in the temporal region. However, in children, they occur with similar frequency in the temporal, occipital, frontal, and posterior fossa regions.

A skull fracture is present in the majority of patients with EDH. These hematomas often present beneath a fracture of the squamous part of the temporal bone.

If this condition occurs within the spine, this entity is described as a spinal epidural hematoma.

Based on radiographic progression, it can be classified into one of the following

- Type I: Acute; occurs on day 1 and associated with a “swirl” of un-clotted blood

- Type II: Subacute occurring between days 2 to 4 and usually solid

- Type III: Chronic occurring between days 7 to 20; mixed or lucent appearance with contrast enhancement
