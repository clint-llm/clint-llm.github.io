For the residual and late-onset parasomnias, proper identification and management are vital. Efficient healthcare intervention includes appropriate referrals to specialists and clinics. Because parasomnias can arise as secondary manifestations of underlying conditions, differentials must be ruled out. Again, this is best accomplished by pharmacy consultations and referrals to the appropriate specialists.
