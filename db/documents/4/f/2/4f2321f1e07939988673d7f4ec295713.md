**Coronary Sinus Anatomy**

The optimal placement of a left ventricular lead in a tributary of the coronary sinus is one of the most challenging technical aspects of CRT device implantation. The coronary sinus is the main vein of the greater venous system that runs in the posterior aspect of the atrioventricular groove.

**Pathophysiology of Dyssynchrony**

Reduction in left ventricular systolic function is associated with neurohumoral activation, which leads to ventricular remodeling and dilatation.
