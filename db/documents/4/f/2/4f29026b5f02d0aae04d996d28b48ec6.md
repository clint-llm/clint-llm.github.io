Achondroplasia accounts for greater than 90% of cases of dwarfism. Although it follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with a 100% penetrant, over 80% of cases arise from a spontaneous mutation. Genetic counseling is recommended for patients. It is associated with increased mortality in early childhood, otolaryngology problems later in childhood, and increased risk of obesity into adulthood.

There are many medical complications associated with a diagnosis of achondroplasia. Increased vigilance is required in both the evaluation and surveillance of this condition. Affected individuals can also develop joint laxity, thoracolumbar kyphosis, and spinal stenosis that may progress and contribute to morbidity as an adult. FMS is usually the first spinal manifestation observed in infants with achondroplasia. Lumbar spinal stenosis occurs in approximately 25% of achondroplastic patients. Management of achondroplasia involves a multidisciplinary team approach and anticipatory care is essential. The mean lifespan of patients with achondroplasia is slightly shorter than the average population.
