Normally, factor V synthesis principally occurs in the liver. Thrombin activates factor V, and once activated, it will convert prothrombin to thrombin. Activated protein C, one of the principal physiologic inhibitors of coagulation, degrades factor V. In the presence of what is called thrombomodulin, thrombin acts to decrease clotting by activating protein C; therefore, the concentration and the action of protein C are important determinants in the negative feedback loop through which thrombin limits its activation.

Factor V Leiden is an autosomal dominant genetic condition that exhibits incomplete penetrance, meaning that not every person with the mutation will developÂ the disease.

Factor V Leiden, also known as factor VR506Q and factor V Arg506 Gln, results from a single-point mutation in the factor V gene (guanine to adenine at nucleotide 1691), which leads to a single amino acid change (replacement of arginine with glutamine at amino acid 506). This abolishes the Arg506 cleavage site for activated protein C in Factor V and Va.
