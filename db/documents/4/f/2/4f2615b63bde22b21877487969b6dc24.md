On physical exam, a good place to start is with an intraoral examination. Dr. Edward Angle, widely known as the father of orthodontics, created a classification system for the occlusion of teeth and how they relate to each other. It is based on the relationship between certain parts of the first molars and canines. Class 1 occlusion means there is an appropriate relationship between the maxillary teeth and mandibular teeth. Class 2 means that the mandibular teeth are posterior as in patients with retrognathia. Finally, class 3 indicates that the mandibular teeth are anterior to the where they should be (think of a bulldog with the lower jaw sticking out).

A class 2 occlusion can often be associated with retrognathia. However, it should be kept in mind that the teeth can hide this, as human bodies will often dentally compensate for skeletal discrepancies (more in-depth discussion on this point is the purview of dental specialists).

Often just looking at the patient extraorally can help you determine if they are retrognathic. When viewed from the lateral, you will notice an exaggerated convex facial profile. On grown adults, as part of a standard airway examination, examining the thyromental distance can be a predictor of a difficult airway. This implies retrognathia if the patient has a mandible that has not developed, the thyromental distance will be less than the standard three finger’s breadth, or approximately 7 mm.

Radiology plays a significant role in determining retrognathia. The standard lateral cephalometric radiograph and associated analysis are part of the determination. There are hundreds of different interpretations and, suffice it to say, that there are many points and combinations of angles that measure the relationship between the cranial vault and the facial skeleton to determine growth and are used in treatment planning for orthodontics and orthognathic surgery.

The most common diagnosis in the practice of orthodontics and oral and maxillofacial surgery associated with retrognathia is mandibular AP hypoplasia, a common diagnosis that supports a surgical correction of their deficiency, most commonly through a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy of the mandible.

Depending on the patient's age and especially with infants and children, an astute practitioner must keep in mind some associated syndromes and conditions that are often associated with a hypoplastic mandible. This includes Pierre-Robin sequence, hemifacial microsomia, DiGeorge syndrome, Nager syndrome, Treacher Collins, Goldenhar syndrome, and Mobius syndrome. These specific entities are discussed in more detail under treatment and management.

Prior surgery to the head and neck or history of trauma can also produce retrognathia. For example, this practitioner recently had a male in his twenties with a history of a fall off his bicycle in the second grade. This caused trauma to one of his condyles and a unilateral aplasia in that location, resulting in a crooked face and retrognathic appearance, warranting surgical correction. Because of the condylar portion of the growth of the mandible, temporomandibular trauma can restrict growth. Any blow to the chin or lower face, if severe enough, can cause this type of growth pattern and result in retrognathia and is worth asking about during a history.
