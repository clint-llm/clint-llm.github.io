Accommodative and vergence dysfunction can sometimes be indicative of a potentially debilitating disease.

The patient may requireÂ interprofessional management, which includes neurological, hematological, pathological, and infectious disease evaluation and testing. Important signs and symptoms to consider, especially during triage, include persistent or intermittent diplopia. Cover testing and extraocular muscle (EOM) function assessment can provide better insight into underlying causes. Acute onsets of abnormalities of accommodation and vergence should seek urgent neuro-ophthalmic evaluation. [Level 1]
