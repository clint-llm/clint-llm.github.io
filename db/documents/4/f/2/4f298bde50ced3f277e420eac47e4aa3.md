In light of the appropriate patient history and physical, x-rays are the initial study of choice. MRI is useful to characterize the nature of any lesions as well. Also, if a lesion is detected and there is a high index of suspicion in light of negative MRI, bone scintigraphy or single positron emission computed tomography are being used increasingly due to reported high specificity. CT scans are useful in their ability to further elucidate bony anatomy and aid in preoperative planning depending on the specific scenario.
