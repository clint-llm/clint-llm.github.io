Actinic purpura presents as patches and macules with irregular edges on the forearm and back of the hands. However, they can affect other areas, such as legs, neck, and face. The lesions may appear as dark purple macules and extensive ecchymosis, with average sizes ranging from 1cm to 4 cm in diameter. These macules are asymptomatic and are not associated with pruritus or tenderness. The surrounding skin is generally of an altered quality (thin, pigmented and inelastic).  Besides the typical presentation of actinic purpura, there may be evidence of other photo-aging lesions such as wrinkling, lentigines, sallow yellow skin hue, and actinic keratosis and stellate pseudo scars.

The purpuric lesions persist for about one to three weeks before resolving spontaneously. However, they do not undergo the phases of inflammation. It is possible that a residual deposit of hemosiderin in the dermis leaves a brown pigmentation. Actinic purpura, however, can continue to occur because of the already established cutaneous and vascular fragility. The ecchymotic lesions can cause a significant aesthetic problem and have a psychological impact, however, there is no risk of serious complications.
