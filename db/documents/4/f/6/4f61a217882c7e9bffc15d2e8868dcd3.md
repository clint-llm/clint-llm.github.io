Adult fibrosarcoma is most common in middle-aged and older adults, and rarely occur in children. There is a slight predominance in male patients, and most commonly involves the deep soft tissues of the extremities, trunk, head, and neck.

In a survey of adult fibrosarcomas, 80% were classified as "high-grade" (Grade 2 or 3), with 25% of the remaining low-grade lesions progressing to a high-grade sarcoma locally over time.
