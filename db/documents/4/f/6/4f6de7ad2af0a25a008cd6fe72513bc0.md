**Arterial Supply**

The spinal cord is a vital, fundamental part of the central nervous system and has adequate blood supply and anastomosis. Cervical and lumbar enlargements have additional blood flow. The anterior spinal artery and a pair of posterior spinal arteries supply the spinal cord.

The anterior spinal artery supplies the anterior two-thirds of the cord.

The posterior spinal arteriesÂ give vascular supply the posterior one-third of the cord. These arteries arise from the distal vertebral arteries though some variations may exist. The three vessels anastomose around the cord to form the pial plexus, also called the vasocorona, to provide a robust blood supply to the spinal cord.

The artery of Adamkiewicz, which is the largest radiculomedullary artery, supplies the lumbar cord.

**Venous Drainage**

The spinal venous system is a valveless venous system composed of three intercommunicating drainage system. They drain into the extra spinal veins, which ultimately reaches the heart. They are made up of three systems.

The collecting veins are called the intrinsic venous system. They divide into central and peripheral veins. The central veins drain the anterior horn medially, the white matter of the ventral commissure, the anterior funiculus, gray commissure, and white matter dorsally. The peripheral radial veins drain the remaining areas of the spinal cord.

The extrinsic venous system is composed of the pial venous network, radicular veins, anterior, and posterior spinal veins. The great anterior radiculomedullary vein, which is commonly mistaken for the artery of Adamkiewicz, drains the thoracolumbar cord.

The extradural venous system is made up of the Batson plexus, also called the vertebral venous plexus. They drain the spinal cord and the vertebral column.
