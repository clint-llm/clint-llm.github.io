Studies have suggested that within the USA, approximately 1.3 to 2.8 million people have serological evidence with Toxocara species, 4 million with soil-transmitted helminths, 41,400 to 169,000 with cysticercosis, and approximately 8000 with schistosomiasis. A recent study was done in Chicago shows that approximately 12% of subjects providing samples which were recent immigrants were found to have evidence of current or prior infection with a pathogenic parasite species where most common infections were Toxocara (6.4%), followed by S. stercoralis (4%).

The affected rate in females was 8% and males was 7%.
