A provider should think of testing women for decreased ovarian reserve beginning at the age of 35 in women attempting conception; this age parameter may be lowered for women with diminished ovarian reserve risk factors such as having only one ovary, those who have a history of ovarian surgery, anyone exposed to chemotherapy or radiation, as well as those patients who present with unexplained infertility. In any patient 40 years or older who seeks care regarding infertility, it is appropriate to be evaluated immediately. It is important to note that while the tests for ovarian reserve can provide information regarding the number of gametes a woman has left, the values provide no information regarding oocyte quality.

Additionally, testing for ovarian reserve can predict a patient’s potential response to gonadotropin stimulation. Patients with decreased ovarian reserve have been shown to have less likelihood of pregnancy success with artificial reproductive technology. The preferred biomarker to evaluate in patients is the level of the anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), which has been shown to correlate to the available oocyte number. There is an established pattern of predicted AMH value by age, which can guide a patient’s AMH value correlates to the general population’s and thus can guide a physician in diagnosing decreased ovarian reserve.
