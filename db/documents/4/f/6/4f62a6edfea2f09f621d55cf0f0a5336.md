Two plain radiographs in two orthogonal planes are required to assess the fracture site for any cortical breach and level of deformity. Typical X-ray findings would include buckling out of one or both cortexes in a long bone, with or without deformity. Also, there may be a plastic deformation of an associated bone – e.g., the ulna in distal radius fractures.  If there is a suspicion of plastic deformation, one might obtain an X-ray of the contralateral limb for comparison.

Additionally, depending on the mechanism of injury and symptoms, one may also require radiographs more proximally to assess for any associated injury. For example, an associated injury to a distal radius buckle fracture could be supracondylar fractures or radial head fractures/dislocations. Thus, as a rule of thumb, always assess for injuries in joints above and below the fracture site.
