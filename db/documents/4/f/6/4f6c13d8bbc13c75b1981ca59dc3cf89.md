Hormones that use the guanylyl cyclase signaling pathway include atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and nitric oxide (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, or EDRF). These hormones either bind to their receptors on the cell membrane or their soluble receptor in the cytoplasm. The receptor has intrinsic guanylate cyclase activity, and the guanylyl cyclase converts GTP to cGMP. The cGMP then activates protein kinase G. The activated protein kinase G then causes vasodilation of smooth muscle.
