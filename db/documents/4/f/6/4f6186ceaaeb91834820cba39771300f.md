Clinically, AKV can resemble flat warts, seborrheic keratosis, epidermodysplasia verruciform, and Darier disease. Biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. The immediate family members should be evaluated for the presence of similar lesions, which may indicate an autosomal dominant genodermatosis like acrokeratosis verruciformis of Hopf, though this is not always the case.
