Plantar fasciitis is the result of degenerative irritation of the plantar fascia origin at the medial calcaneal tuberosity of the heel as well as the surrounding perifascial structures. The plantar fascia plays an important role in the normal biomechanics of the foot and is composed of three segments, all of which arise from the calcaneus. The fascia itself is important in providing support for the arch and providing shock absorption. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of plantar fasciitis and outlines the role of the medical team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the underlying pathophysiologic cause of plantar fasciitis.
- Recall the normal biomechanics of the foot and the role of the plantar fascia.
- List the management options available for treating plantar fasciitis.
- Articulate interprofessional team strategies that can be employed to provide the best outcomes in the evaluation and treatment of plantar fasciitis.
