To perform a suboccipital release, start with positioning the patient. The patient will need to be supine and flat. A pillow can be placed under the patient's head for comfort until starting the procedure.

Once the patient is comfortable and correctly positioned, the provider will sit at the head of the bed and place both hands underneath the patient's head in the occipital region. The provider should then feel for the occipital ridge along the scalp and move the hands slightly caudad until the muscle is felt.

The provider then flexes the fingers upward against the suboccipital muscles and holds this position for three to five minutes or until significant muscle tension is released. After the treatment, it is important to re-assess the patient's symptoms.

It is not uncommon to have some transient fatigue and persistent symptoms. However, most patients see an improvement in symptoms after undergoing this procedure.
