The management of patients with DMD is best done with an interprofessional team that includes specialty trained nurses and therapists. Neuroscience and rehabilitation nurses participate in care, monitor patients, and report changes to the team. Primary care providers, physiatrists, and neurologists provide care. Orthopedists and thoracic surgeons may be consulted. Pharmacists review medication and check for drug-drug interactions. There is no cure for the disorder, and all the treatments are palliative. Palliative care physicians and nurses are eventually needed. The most important thing is to ensure that the patients lead a decent quality of life. Aggressive treatments may often do more harm than good.
