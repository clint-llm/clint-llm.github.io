The saphenous nerve block is indicated whenever the need exists for anesthesia of the lower leg or foot along its neural distribution. It is most commonly used in conjunction with a popliteal sciatic nerve block to provide complete anesthesia of the lower leg for various surgical and nonsurgical procedures. These include saphenous vein stripping or harvesting, wound repair or exploration, ankle fracture or dislocation reduction, abscess drainage, and foreign body removal.
