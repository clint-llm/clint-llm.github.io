Lens-induced uveitis has to be distinguished from several other causes of uveitis which may be infective or noninfective. In the elderly, endogenous endophthalmitis may occur due to systemic illness and lowered immunity. A history of hospitalization, intravenous drug use, or intravenous infusion should be asked. General examination and blood work for liver, kidney, and lung diseases may rule out this condition. Urinary tract infection should be ruled out.

In cases of trauma, bacterial endophthalmitis or fungal endophthalmitis may occur.

Propionibacterium acnes can cause chronic postoperative endophthalmitis months after cataract surgery. Granulomatous uveitis with hypopyon, plaques in the posterior capsule, and vitritis are the presenting features. Infectious postoperative uveitis can also be caused by Staphylococcus epidermis and candida.

Sympathetic ophthalmia may have an association with phacogenic uveitis. Choroidal thickening is more common in sympathetic ophthalmia. Both eyes are involved in sympathetic ophthalmia.

Uveitis due to collagen vascular disorders such as ankylosing spondylosis and sarcoidosis should be ruled out by investigations for these conditions and by history taking.
