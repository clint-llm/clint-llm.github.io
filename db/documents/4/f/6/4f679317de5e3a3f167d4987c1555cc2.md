Arthrocentesis is a procedure that is performed to obtain synovial fluid from within a joint capsule, both for diagnostic and for therapeutic purposes. It is used in multiple disease processes, including arthritis, gout, and infectious processes such as septic arthritis. This activity outlines the use of arthrocentesis in clinical settings and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications and contraindications of arthrocentesis.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique required for arthrocentesis.
- Review the clinical significance of synovial fluid analysis findings after arthrocentesis.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and efficiency to advance arthrocentesis and improve outcomes.
