Indications of radionuclide ventriculography include:

- Assessment of the left/right ventricular systolic function in a patient with coronary artery disease (CAD), valvular heart disease, atrial arrhythmia, congenital heart disease, myocardial disease, or before starting cardiotoxic chemotherapy.

- Assessment of left ventricular diastolic function in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) with preserved EF

- Serial monitoring of the left ventricular function while on cardiotoxic chemotherapy

- Regional wall motion assessment in a patient with the low-intermediate probability of CAD when myocardial stress perfusion imaging (MPI) is not available.

- Assessment of the ventricular synchronicity prior toÂ CRT placement
