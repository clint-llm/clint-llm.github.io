An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach to patients with trinucleotide repeat disorders can help achieve the best possible outcomes. Since complications of these disorders are not uncommon, the importance of an interdisciplinary approach of various disciplines cannot be undermined. Depending on the type of repeat disorder, the personnel involved in management would vary. Largely, the role of psychiatrists, neurologists, physiotherapists, nurse practitioners, occupational therapists, and pharmacists, is equally crucial amongst all trinucleotide repeat disorders. While neurologists and psychiatrists diagnose and prescribe the required treatment for these conditions, family education and counseling is a crucial role of the nurse practitioner as well. Chronic conditions require long term medication, making the pharmacist a crucial part of this team. Lastly, since most of these disorders are accompanied by physical symptoms that either cause spasms or limiting movement disorders, both occupational therapists and physiotherapists play an important role in improving the quality of life of the patient.

Collaborating shared decision making, and communication are key elements for a good outcome. The interprofessional care provided to the patient must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to planning and evaluation of all joint activities. The earlier signs and symptoms of a complication are identified, the better is the prognosis and outcome. (Level III)
