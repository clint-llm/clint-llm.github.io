The cornerstone of diagnosis of a breast abscess is the physical exam. A complete blood count may be obtained to evaluate for leukocytosis, but it is not necessary. If there is any frank drainage, cultures can be obtained to help guide antibiotic treatment. A breast ultrasound may be obtained if there is a question of cellulitis versus abscess, to evaluate for a drainable fluid collection. On ultrasound, abscesses may appear as ill-defined masses with internal septations.

In some cases, to confirm the presence of a  breast abscess, needle aspiration is done and the fluid analyzed.
