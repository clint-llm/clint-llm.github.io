Entropion is an inversion or inward turning of the eyelid margin. This can result in trichiasis, where the eyelashes are directed posteriorly toward the globe. It is one of the most common eyelid malpositions. This malposition can cause corneal and conjunctival damage leading to corneal abrasions, scarring, corneal thinning, or corneal neovascularization.Â  Entropion may be unilateral or bilateral. There are four types of entropion: congenital, involutional, acute spastic, and cicatricial. Lower eyelids are often involutional while the upper eyelid is cicatricial. Lower eyelid entropion is much more common than upper eyelid entropion.
