The cartilage is solely composed of cells known as chondrocytes. Chondrocytes maintain the extracellular matrix (ECM) and produce the cartilage matrix. Surrounded by collagenous fibers, chondrocytes release substances to make cartilage strong yet flexible. In general, chondrocytes are found within intervertebral discs and in any form of articular cartilage (AC). Chondrocytes play a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis within the AC joints that provide cushioning in joint movements. Like cells within other specialized tissues, chondrocytes distance themselves from each other by the cartilage matrix.
