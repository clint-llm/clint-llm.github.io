Tuberculosis is a reportable disease in almost all world countries. This facilitates more accurate disease tracking and epidemiological studies. The incidence of tuberculosis was slowly decreasing until the surge of HIV infection, which led to this trend reversal.

The WHO estimated that it infected 10 million individuals in the year 2017. Among world countries, India and China are leading in TB deaths.

Several other medical conditions and certain medications also increase the risk of developing TB infection. This includes diabetes, chronic corticosteroid use, and the use of anti-TNF biologics. A unique group at risk are patients who underwent gastrectomy, which appears to be due to certain nutritional deficiencies.

Tuberculosis transmits via aerosolized microdroplets. This is classically generated from a coughing patient with active tuberculosis. Other means of generating aerosolized droplets include singing, shouting, and sneezing.
