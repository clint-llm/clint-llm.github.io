Gastric volvulus is a rare, clinical event that occurs in both adults and pediatric patients. In 1886, Berti was the first to describe a gastric volvulus after performing an autopsy on a female patient. A gastric volvulus occurs when the stomach rotates on itself at least 180 degrees along its transverse or longitudinal axis. Gastric strangulation is a complication that can occur after the development of acute gastric volvulus. Timely diagnosis and treatment of acute gastric volvulus can potentially decrease morbidity and mortality. Patients can simply present with mild abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting, without emesis. Other patients can present with sepsis from necrosis of their volvulus and similar chief complaints. This activity reviews the evaluation gastric volvulus and the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.
