Patients, parents, and caregivers should be appropriately counseled regarding the diagnosis, prognosis, and anticipated complications in SSADH deficiency. Families should be counseled regarding the progression of neuropsychiatric symptoms into adulthood.Â Appropriate genetic counseling should be offered to those who are carriers and at risk of being carriers. In the Mendelian mode of inheritance, autosomal recessive disorders result when one copy of the abnormal gene for the same trait is inherited from each parent.

Thus, parents of an affected child with SSADH deficiency are obligate heterozygote carriers. Thus, two carriers (father and mother) have a 25% chance that their offspring shows the SSADH deficiency and 25% chance that their offspring is healthy, while half of their offspring (50%) may be carriers exactly like the parents. Heterozygotes or carriers are usually asymptomatic.
