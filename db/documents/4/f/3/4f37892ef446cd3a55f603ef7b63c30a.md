Four joints make up the shoulder girdle. These include the sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular, scapulothoracic, and glenohumeral joints. The glenohumeral joint is a partial ball-and-socket joint with an articulation of the humeral head with the glenoid cavity.

The acromioclavicular (AC) joint serves as the articulation between the lateral end of the clavicle and the acromion of the scapula. Etiologies for acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis include degenerative and post-traumatic causes and, to a lesser frequency, septic and inflammatory etiologies.
