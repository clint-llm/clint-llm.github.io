Carbapenemase enzymes categorize into three groups: Ambler Class A, B, and D.

The most common Class A carbapenemases include KPC (Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase) and IMI (Imipenem-hydrolysing beta-lactamase). KPC is the most prevalent carbapenemase gene amongst all cpCRE.

Class B is defined by a metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) structures. These enzymes include NDM (New Delhi metallo-lactamase), IMP (Imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas), and VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-lactamase). These carbapenemases are usually found on plasmid vectors and other transposable elements, allowing them to spread between bacteria. Due to a high sequence variability of 15%Â to 70%, these enzymes are difficult to detect with molecular testing, slowing investigations to more fully understand their prevalence.

OXA (Oxacillin-hydrolysing carbapenemase) enzymes make up class D carbapenemases. These genes are genetically similar to ESBL genes, thus making them difficult to differentiate on molecular testing from other ESBL producers.Klebsiella pneumoniae.
