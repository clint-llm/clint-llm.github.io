The diagnosis and management of PACNS is complex and best done with an interprofessional team that includes a rheumatologist, internist, endocrinologist, neurologist, radiologist, and pathologist. The cause in many cases is not known and empirical treatment with corticosteroids is the norm. When patients fail to respond, other potent immunosuppressive agents are added. The pharmacist and nurse should educate the patient on the potential adverse effects of drugs used to treat PACNS. Pharmacists should consult with the prescriber regarding any potential interactions, and verify dosing. Nursing can monitor treatment progress, and inform the team/chart any concerns. Even when patients respond, recovery is prolonged and may take months or a few years. These patients need continuous monitoring for several years until symptoms subside. Without long term studies, little is known about the long term outcome of these patients but relapses are common.
