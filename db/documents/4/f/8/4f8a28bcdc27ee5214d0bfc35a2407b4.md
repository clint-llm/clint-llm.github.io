The treatment of koilonychia generally includes treatment of the underlying disease. Although the aetiologies of koilonychia are numerous, the underlying diagnosis can be narrowed down based on the age, personal, family and occupational history, review of systems and a thorough physical examination. Koilonychia can be an important clue for either the dermatologic or systemic condition.

Appropriate workup is important not only to exclude an underlying cutaneous or systemic disorder but also to distinguish between the different aetiologies to provide appropriate management of koilonychia. Most of the cases with acquired causes are reversible.

The nails in newborns are usually thin and soft and present frequently with physiological alteration (koilonychia), which are better left untreated and in addition need a wait-and-watch policy and reassurance of the parents. However, it is important to follow up these patients to verify that this physiological condition does not turn into a pathological one.
