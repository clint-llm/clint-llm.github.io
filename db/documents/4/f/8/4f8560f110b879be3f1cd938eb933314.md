Abdominal aortic aneurysms tend toÂ occur when there is a failure of the structural proteins of the aorta. What causes these proteins to fail is unknown, but it results in the gradual weakening of the aortic wall. The decrease in structural proteins of the aortic wall, such as elastin and collagen, has been identified.

Other factors that may play a role in the development of these aneurysms include genetics, marked inflammation, and proteolytic degradation of the connective tissue in the aortic wall.
