The people working in close association with animals should be watchful about any ocular symptoms. They should consult ophthalmologists at the earliest if ocular symptoms arise. The development of ocular symptoms following an encounter with a fly should not be taken lightly.

Prevention has always been better than cure. Good personal hygiene can avert significant complications caused by ophthalmomyiasis. Previously efforts were made to let sterilized flies mate with fertile male flies in an attempt to control the ophthalmomyiasis outbreaks caused by flies. Ivermectin controlled-release capsules can also be used to prevent an animal infestation with bot fly and thus subsequent ophthalmomyiasis.
