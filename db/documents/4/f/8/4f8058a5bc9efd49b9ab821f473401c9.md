Pulmonary eosinophilia (PE) is defined as the infiltration of eosinophils into the lung compartments constituting airways, interstitium, and alveoli. Various infections, drugs, parasites, autoimmune processes, malignancies, and obstructive lung diseases have been associated with increased eosinophils in the lungs. This activity reviews the cause and pathophysiology of pulmonary eosinophilia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pulmonary eosinophilia.
- Review the workup of a patient with pulmonary eosinophilia.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for pulmonary eosinophilia.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by pulmonary eosinophilia.
