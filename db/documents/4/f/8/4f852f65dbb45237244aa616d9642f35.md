All healthcare team members should be aware of the symptoms of acute angle-closure, as acute episodes may precede chronic angle closure.Â These symptoms include hazy or blurry vision, particularly if accompanied by nausea, eye pain, or headache. Eye care providers should screen patients for angle-closure risk during routine eye exams to identify patients at higher risk and refer them to a subspecialist if necessary. General practitioners should refer patients with suspected symptoms of angle-closure to an eye care provider for evaluation. Pharmacists should be aware of medications that could precipitate angle closure and educate patients or refer them to an eye care provider if necessary. (Level 5)
