Mesenteric artery thrombosis (MAT) is a condition involving occlusion of the arterial vascular supply of the intestinal system. It is a severe and potentially fatal illness typically of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), which provides the primary arterial supply to the small intestine and ascending colon. The occlusion may occur due to in-situ thrombosis of the vessel, most commonly due to underlying atherosclerotic disease, or embolic occlusion from a distant source, as may occur in patients with atrial fibrillation. This activity describes the cause, presentation and pathophysiology of mesenteric artery thrombosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of mesenteric artery thrombosis.
- Review the history and physical exam of a patient with mesenteric artery thrombosis.
- Summarize the treatment options for mesenteric artery thrombosis.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by mesenteric artery thrombosis.
