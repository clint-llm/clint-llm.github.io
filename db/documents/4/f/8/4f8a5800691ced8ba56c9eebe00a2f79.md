**Laboratory Tests**

- Basic labs, such as a complete metabolic panel (CMP) and complete blood count (CBC), are recommended to assess for various electrolyte arrangements and anemia.

- Hypocalcemia may be noted in the case of ethylene glycol toxicity. 
- Also, note that the onset of renal failure with diethylene glycol (DEG) poisoning is delayed.

- Metabolite Testing

- Metabolite testing (i.e., organic acid) is of little utility, especially in the acute setting, due to the time it takes for the test to result. Many hospitals also do not routinely test for metabolites. Please refer to your institution for further information regarding metabolite testing.
- Serum Osmolarity

- 

- It is essential to recognize the limitations of utilizing the osmol gap when evaluating for toxic alcohol poisoning. 

- Clinicians should be vigilant of overtly elevated osmol gaps (i.e.,>30 mOsl/L) in the presence of altered mental status or other signs to suggest toxic ingestion.
- Patients who present early may have a normal anion gap and elevated osmol gap, as the parent compound has not metabolized to its respective organic acid.
- On the other hand, patients who present late will have had the time to metabolize the glycol ether into its organic acid and will have a high anion gap. In addition, since the parent compound is metabolized, it will be lower in quantity with late presentation and, therefore, may have a normal osmolarity gap.

- Additional Tests

- Lactate 
- Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) 
- Acetaminophen, ethanol, ethylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, methanol, and salicylates to evaluate for co-ingestions 
- Urinalysis

**Imaging**

- A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head may help rule out other causes of altered mental status. Still, it may be of low value to asses for radiographic signs of neurological damage, particularly in the acute setting.

- The utility of obtaining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is unclear, as evidence of neurologic injury may not have manifested. A case series by Yahi et al. reports that initial head CT scans in patients with GE toxicity were without abnormality; two patients initially had unrevealing MRIs, but a third demonstrated edema and herniation. These initial MRI findings may hold a poor prognosis.

- However, other reports showed regular MRIs in patients with fatal outcomes. Yahi et al. also mention brain atrophy in two of their surviving cases, but with typical MRS, questioning the true etiology of these findings. Using. Brain imaging to evaluate GE toxicity requires further investigation.

- Chest imaging may also be considered to evaluate for pneumonitis from exposure to GE vapor or aspiration in the setting of altered mental status.

- An abdominal ultrasound may help identify changes in size, texture, and even necrosis in the kidney and liver.

**Electrocardiography (EKG)**

- An EKG is also essential for detecting conduction abnormalities which can be a byproduct of various electrolyte arrangements and acidosis.

**Electroencephalogram (EEG)/Electromyography (EMG)**

- Nerve conduction studies may also be beneficial to evaluate for neuropathy. From a neurological perspective, a case study reported that most patients with elevated CSF protein, without pleocytosis, developed a neurological injury.

- An EEG may be helpful in patients with repeated seizures, although there are limited reports of this initial presentation.
