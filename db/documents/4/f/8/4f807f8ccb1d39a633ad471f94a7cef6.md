Mass spectrometryÂ produces results for the mass-to-charge ratio of ions in a compound.

It is important to analyze the graph to deduce the structural quality of the compound based on the mass spectrometer. The graph has three main components and an additional component depending on the isotopes present in the sample, which are relevant in figuring out the structure:

- Molecular Ion Peak (or Parent Peak): This is the second-highest peak that corresponds directly to the compound in question. The m/z ratio directly correlates to the molecular weight. For example, if hexane is the compound, then the m/z ratio is 86 since that is the molecular weight.

- Base Peak: This is the ion with the highest relative abundance in the compound out of all the ions in the given sample. The relative intensity of this ion is set to 100%, and all other ion peaks are set relative to this value.

- M+1 Peak: This is a smaller peak that directly corresponds to an isotope in the sample. If the molecular weight of the specimen is 96 g/mol, the m/z ratio is 96. Thus, the m+1 peak is at an m/z of 97. It might be confusing how it is possible for an ion to have a mass greater than the compound in question, but this is because there are many isotopes of elements, such as carbon and hydrogen, which can result in an m+1 peak.

- M+2 Peak: This is another small peak similar to the m+1 peak. Certain elements, such as chlorine and oxygen, have multiple isotopes, which is why these elements in a given compound can result in an m+2 peak.
