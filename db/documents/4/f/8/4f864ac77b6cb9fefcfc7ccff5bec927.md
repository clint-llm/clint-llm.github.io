The study of arrhythmogenesis comprises disorders of impulse initiation and disorders of impulse conduction. Impulse initiation disturbances include automaticity and triggered activity with early and late depolarizations (EAD and DAD). Automaticity is the spontaneous depolarization of tissue which is physiologic in the sinus and atrioventricular node and the His bundle. This is in contrast to triggered activity, which is abnormal impulse generation in response to a previous stimulus.

Arrhythmias caused by early depolarizations include Torsade de Pointes and delayed depolarizations are exemplified by ventricular arrhythmia due to digitalis toxicity. Reentry is a mechanism of pathologic impulse conduction. Reentry is connected to structural heart disease whereas automaticity and triggered activity may be found in structurally normal hearts.

Computer simulations play an essential role in electrophysiology research. Liu et al. used computer simulation to show that delayed after-depolarizations, which are spontaneous depolarization occurring late during an action potential, can trigger premature ventricular complexes (PVC) and in vulnerable tissue with properties of unidirectional block can cause reentry. This is called triggered activity with reentry.

Mines described three criteria to define reentry. For reentry to occur unidirectional block, return to point of origin and the possibility to interruption are required.

The wavelength of the reentry circuit is defined by the impulse conduction velocity times the refractory period.

Mechanic and electric properties of the cell are interdependent, which is called the mechanoelectrical feedback (MEF) or electrochemical coupling (ECC). Acute stretch induces cell currents causing depolarization (stretch-activated currents, SAC).

Gilmour et al. studied the electrophysiological mechanisms giving rise to reentry in a ring-like Purkinje muscle junction model. They imitated conditions that are present in the ischemic heart by chemically creating a unidirectional block, shortening the action potential duration, which finally initiated reentry. Furthermore, they described the relation between Purkinje fibers and muscle cells as source and sink, respectively. Asymmetrical impulse transmission, which can be found in the heart due to anisotropy, contributes to arrhythmia. Dispersion of refractoriness due to different membrane properties and cell coupling also plays a role in reentry mechanism.

There are many concepts of functional reentry such as the leading circle reentry,

Comtois introduced the idea of spiral wave reentry. The spiral wave reentry is a continuously rotating electric potential around a point of phase singularity where wavetail and wavefront meet. It can be evaluated by dominant frequency analysis and complex fractionated electrogram (CFE).

Antzelevitch et al. observed differences in action potentials at different epicardial sites giving rise to reentry. The transmural voltage gradient is visible on electrocardiogram (ECG) as j-wave or st-segment elevation. Since these changes are related to the second phase of the action potential, this is called phase 2 reentry.

The multiple wavelet theory was first proposed by Moe in 1959 researching the pathophysiologic basis of atrial fibrillation. This theory states that many wavefronts will not die out spontaneously. This idea found reinforcement with Allessie's finding that four to six simultaneous reentrant wavelets are needed to maintain atrial fibrillation.

Different mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis may be responsible for initiating and sustaining atrial fibrillation. Accepting the multiple wavelet theory as the sustaining force, Haissaguerre described ectopic foci at the point where the pulmonary veins insert into the left atrium for initiation of atrial fibrillation. This allowed for targeted radiofrequency ablation.
