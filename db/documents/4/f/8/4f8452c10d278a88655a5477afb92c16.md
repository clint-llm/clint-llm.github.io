Cefotaxime administration and dosing require adjusting in geriatric populations, patients with decreased renal function, and hepatic dysfunction. Renal function and liver enzymes require routine monitoring. The half-life of cefotaxime is generally one hour, and severe kidney dysfunction may prolong the half-life of cefotaxime and its metabolite desacetylcefotaxime.

Cefotaxime is an FDA Pregnancy Category B drug. Cefotaxime use in pregnancy has not been studied clearly and should be used cautiously. Cefotaxime is reported to cross the placenta during pregnancy. It is also present in low concentrations in breast milk during lactation.
