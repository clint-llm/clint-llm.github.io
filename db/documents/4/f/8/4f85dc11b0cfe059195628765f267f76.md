The main muscle occupying the temporal fossa is the temporalis muscle. It is a triangular muscle that broadly originates on the parietal and frontal bone of the temporal fossa and the deep surface of the deep temporal fascia. It attaches to the coronoid process and anterior ramus of the mandible. The trigeminal nerve innervates it via the deep temporal nerves. The action of this muscle is upon the mandible and results in elevation for jaw closure and also causes retraction of the jaw.
