The American Academy of Ophthalmology's current recommendation states that people with diabetes mellitus type 1 should have yearly screening for diabetic retinopathy starting five years after the onset of diabetes. Patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 should have fundus evaluation at the time of diagnosis and annually****thereafter.

The patient should be counseled properly regarding the prognosis of diabetic retinopathy. Early diagnosis, management, and follow-up visits at timely intervals depending on the stage of presentation of diabetic retinopathy are mandatory. Systemic dysregulation of diabetes can lead to an exponential worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Lifestyle modification should be done along with proper systemic and topical medications to halt the progression of diabetic retinopathy.
