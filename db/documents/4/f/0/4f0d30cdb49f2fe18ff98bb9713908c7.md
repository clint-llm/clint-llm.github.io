Evaluation of ischemic heart disease can frequently present a diagnostic dilemma. Such patients can present non-specific symptoms like chest pain or shortness of breath. The cause of chest pain or shortness of breath could be due to a myriad of diseases including gastrointestinal, cardiac, musculoskeletal, psychological, and pulmonary causes. While a cardiologist is often involved as a central player, it is important to take other team members on board as indicated including a gastroenterologist, pulmonologist, and psychiatrist. Radiologists also are an important resource in the whole process. Nurses are a very important part of the diagnostic and therapeutic workup as well as they provide key bedside information not witnessed by the physicians in their short encounters.
