Cleft hand deformities are rare and therefore require the intervention of a pediatric orthopedic specialist who can adequately address the deformity to maximize function and aesthetics as well as to assess the patient for additional developmental abnormalities properly. To have an optimal outcome, the surgical and nursing staff must work together to execute the plan of management appropriately. Finally, members of the interdisciplinary team, which may include pediatric counselors for age-appropriate patients, must communicate clearly with the patient and family to help them understand and overcome the challenges that present with cleft hand deformities.
