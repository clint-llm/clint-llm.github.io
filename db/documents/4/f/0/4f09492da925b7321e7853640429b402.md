Sickle cell anemia is a severe genetic disorder with high morbidity and mortality. The disease usually manifests early in life and can present with several types of occlusive crises.

Screening for sickle cell anemia is mandatory at birth in the United States, allowing for early diagnosis and treatment. Because the disorder affects almost every organ system in the body, an interprofessional approach is necessary to ensure adequate treatment and prevent complications. However, as the population ages, chronic complications like pulmonary hypertension are emerging with very high morbidity and mortality. The consensus among experts is that sickle cell should be managed by an interprofessional group of healthcare professionals, including physical therapists, psychiatrists, social workers, nurses, pharmacists, substance abuse counselors, pain counselors, and rehabilitation specialists.

An orthopedic surgeon should be consulted for hip pain or difficulty with gait. A radiologist is essential for obtaining samples from bone if osteomyelitis is suspected. These patients need thorough eye exams by an ophthalmologist, and a urologist is needed to manage priapism.

Most of these patients are on many medications. The pharmacist plays a critical role in ensuring the patient remains compliant with medications and free from adverse drug effects.

The nurse should educate the patient on the importance of remaining hydrated, getting the right vaccinations, and ensuring follow-up with the respective healthcare providers.

**Outcomes**

The outcome for most sickle cell patients is mixed. The goal is to achieve an average lifespan with minimal morbidity and mortality. However, many of these individuals die prematurely despite improvements in treatment. The morbidity is very high, and nearly all individuals experience a vaso-occlusive crisis at some point in their lives. These patients often are not able to work due to their disability and live a poor quality of life with chronic pain. The leading causes of death are acute chest syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and infection. Outside of North America, the life expectancy of sickle cell patients is in the 30s and 40s. Many guidelines have been developed to manage sickle cell disease. They include penicillin prophylaxis for children, blood transfusions, and pneumococcal vaccination. The drug hydroxyurea has made it possible for patients to live longer than ever.
