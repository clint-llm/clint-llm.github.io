The cerebellum, meaning "little brain" in Latin, is primarily responsible for the coordination of movement,Â maintaining posture and balance, muscle tone, and motor learning. Recent research has shown that the cerebellum may also have cognitive functions, but the exact mechanism and pathways are still unclear. In this chapter, we present the gross and functional anatomy of the cerebellum and then focus on the structures that are involved in clinical presentations and syndromes.
