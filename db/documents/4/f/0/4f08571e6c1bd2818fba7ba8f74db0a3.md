Overdosage of cholestyramine (150% of the maximum recommended daily dosage) has been reported in patients taking it for several weeks. No adverse effects were reported. Excessive doses of colesevelam hydrochloride might cause more severe local gastrointestinal effects (e.g., constipation). If overdosage occurs, the primary potential problem would be obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. At this time, the degree of possible obstruction, the location of such obstruction,  and the absence or presence of normal gut motility would determine its treatment.
