Tonsillitis, or inflammation of the tonsils, is a common disease and makes up approximately 1.3% of outpatient visits. It is predominantly the result of a viral or bacterial infection and, when uncomplicated, presents as a sore throat. Acute tonsillitis is a clinical diagnosis. Differentiation between bacterial and viral causes can be difficult; however, this is crucial to prevent the overuse of antibiotics. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of tonsillitis, and examines the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and pathophysiology of tonsillitis.
- Review the history, physical, and evaluation of tonsillitis as well as the need for a thorough differential.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for tonsillitis as well as the potential complications and prevention strategies.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance tonsillitis outcomes.
