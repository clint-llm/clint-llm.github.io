The exact etiology of salivary gland cancer is unknown, but various mechanisms have been proposed, including radiation, viruses (EBV and HIV), immunosuppression, ultraviolet light exposure, occupational exposures in rubber or nickel industries, prior diagnosis of medulloblastoma, prior diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma, androgen receptor expression, and genetics.

Compared to other head and neck cancers, the risk of developing malignant salivary gland tumors from exposure to tobacco and alcohol has been controversial, with several studies noting both positive association and no appreciable association. Sawabe et al. found no significant association between cigarette smoking and mucoepidermoid carcinoma but did show a positive correlation between tobacco smoking and other malignant salivary histologies.

Although squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck has been linked to tobacco, alcohol, and UV exposure, the presence of primary SCC in the salivary glands is rare and does not retain the same risk factors.

The majority of melanoma cases of the major salivary glands are attributed to metastasis from cutaneous sources of the upper face and scalp.

The development of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of the salivary glands has been associated with a prior diagnosis of the autoimmune disease, Sjogren syndrome (SS). Studies have shown that 4.3% of patients with Sjogren syndrome develop NHL within 5-10 years.
