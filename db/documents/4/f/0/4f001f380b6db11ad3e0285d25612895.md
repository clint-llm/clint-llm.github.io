In early PVE, the microorganism can directly invade the prosthetic vale intraoperatively due to contamination, or it can spread hematogenous in the initial days to weeks after the procedure. The organisms during the first days after the valve implementation have direct access to the prothesis-annulus interface and the tissue along the suture in the paravalvular area. The organism can adhere to the fibrinogen and fibronectin in the paravalvular area, which causes the formation of abscesses in both mechanical and bioprosthetic valves.

In late PVE, the prostheses do not allow the organism to adhere to leaflets as long as there is no evidence of thrombotic material. The sewing ring and sutures become endothelialized after few months of the valve implementation. Alterations in the valve and the paravalvular surface can lead to the formation of microthrombus, to which the bacterial organisms can adhere and cause an infection.
