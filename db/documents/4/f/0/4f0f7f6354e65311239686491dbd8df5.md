Prognosis is generally good and may be dependent on the severity and etiology of eventration. Most patients are asymptomatic and may not need any intervention. Those with extensive eventration may develop severe respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation. Diaphragm plication has shown to significantly improve symptoms and quality of life in patients with extensive eventration. The procedure has also shown to improve the FEV1 and FVC by up to 25% and 30% respectively on follow-up pulmonary function tests.
