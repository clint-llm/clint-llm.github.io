Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is the cause of rapid loss of renal function. It is a rare syndrome but has a high rate of renal failure and morbidity associated with it. Timely intervention is a key point in preserving renal function. This activity explains the epidemiology, etiology, and pathology, along with the treatment options. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.
- Describe the histopathology of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. 
- Review when to start immunosuppressive treatment for rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of patients with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and improve outcomes.
