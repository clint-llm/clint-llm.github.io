With the patient in the prone position, the knee being tested is flexed to 90 degrees while the other leg is fully extended, resting on the exam table. The examiner should apply a downward axial loading force to compress the knee; this occurs by compressing down on the sole while using the other hand to stabilize the posterior thigh. Internal and external rotation should be applied along with compression.

The Apley compression test is considered positive if there is pain or restriction with compression and internal or external rotation. If the patient experiences pain over the medial aspect of the knee, this indicates a medial meniscus injury. Alternatively, if the patient experiences pain over the lateral aspect of the knee, this indicates a lateral meniscus injury.

The Apley compression test is commonly performed with the Apley distraction test, which tests for ligamentous injury rather than meniscal injury. To perform the distraction test with the patient in the same prone position, the examiner will pull up on the affected leg instead of providing a downward loading force. This force places a strain on the ligaments of the knee. A positive result is when the patient experiences pain. Pain with the distraction of the knee significantly decreases the likelihood of meniscal pathology. By the nature of the distraction force, the force applied to the meniscus becomes reduced considerably.
