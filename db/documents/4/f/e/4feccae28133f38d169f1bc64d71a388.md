If left untreated or inadequately treated, patients with hyponatremia can develop rhabdomyolysis, altered mental status, seizures, and even coma.

Rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia (greater than 10 mEq/L to 12 mEq/L of sodium in 24 hrs) can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome.

Osmotic demyelination syndrome, formerlyÂ known as central pontine myelinolysis is a complication of rapid correction sodium in patients with chronic hyponatremia.
