Neurological sequelae in endocarditis lead to further morbidities. Ischemic embolic infarction might lead to permanent neurological deficits and dysfunction. A mycotic aneurysm in infectious endocarditis may contribute to cerebral hemorrhagic stroke without adequate infection control. The seizure is secondary to brain abscess, embolic infarction, or intracranial hemorrhage, etc. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to immobilization after stroke and neurological deficits such as aphasia, dysphagia, urinary tract infection, urinary incontinence, and sexual dysfunction may also present.
