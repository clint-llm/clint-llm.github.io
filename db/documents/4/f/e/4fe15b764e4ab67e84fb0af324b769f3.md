The neonatal presentation may be seen emergently after birth or develop within a few days of delivery, as collateral circulations diminish. Emergent presentations after delivery should consider sepsis, infantile respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), independent aortic and pulmonary disorders, and transposition of the great arteries.

Less severe cases may present after a few months or years when growth rates are affected; infection, failure to thrive, and malnutrition etiologies should be considered.
