Anterior cerebral artery strokes occur in the territory of the anterior cerebral artery which involves the superior and medial part of the parietal lobe along with the midline of the frontal lobe. These are uncommon causes of ischemic infarctions, making up about 0.3%-4.4% of stroke cases in series reports. The clinical presentation of this stoke is variable as it depends on whether the anterior cerebral artery or one of its branches is involved. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of anterior cerebral artery stroke and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of anterior cerebral artery strokes.
- Explain the role of the non-contrast computed tomography (CT) as the imaging modality of choice in diagnosing anterior cerebral artery strokes.
- Review the common complications of anterior cerebral artery stroke as well as the risks of intravenous (IV) alteplase administration used in its treatment.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to provide stroke education to the patients, family members, and caregivers to improve outcomes for those affected by anterior cerebral artery stroke.
