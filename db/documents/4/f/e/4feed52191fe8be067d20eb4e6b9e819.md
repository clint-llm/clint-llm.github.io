Metallothionein is protective, and the free cadmium cation is the damaging entity in this toxicity.  The cadmium ion causes mitochondrial damage via enzyme degradation and protein destruction.  This destructive effect makes the cell more susceptible to oxidative stress.  Also, cadmium affects cell adhesion and calcium transport that can lead to cell dysfunction and cell death.
