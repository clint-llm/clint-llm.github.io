Following the initial diagnosis, both infantile-onset and late-onset Tay Sach's disease patients require consultations with multiple professionals. Evaluation by a neurologist is essential to assess and manage the neurologic symptoms. This includes brain MRI and  EEG and assessing the need for antiepileptic drug treatment and monitoring. Ophthalmology evaluation is required to assess visual impairment and its progression. A speech therapy referral is required to assess the swallowing dysfunction and risk of aspiration. In case of risk of aspiration referral for gastrostomy and involvement by feeding, the team is required. Respiratory team involvement is essential to assess the airway. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy referrals are required to manage neuromuscular impairment. Referral to clinical genetics services is required for genetic counseling, screening of at-risk family members, and prenatal or preimplantation genetic diagnosis.  Patients with late-onset Tay Sach disease might require referral to a psychiatrist or psychological medicine team for the assessment of psychiatric symptoms and the need for treatment. It is also important to provide appropriate social support to the family through the social work team's involvement.
