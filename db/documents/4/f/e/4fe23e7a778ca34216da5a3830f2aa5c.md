Complications of status epilepticus can be separated into medical and neurological complications and also immediate and delayed complications.

Medical complications include cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac damage because of catecholamine surge, respiratory failure, hypoventilation, hypoxia, aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary edema, fever, and leukocytosis are some of the common and serious complications seen in patients with status epilepticus

Neurological complications include progression to chronic epilepsy and recurrent status epilepticus. In cases of prolonged refractory status epilepticus, there can be permanent neurological damage induced by the hyper-metabolic activity in regions of the brain undergoing prolonged and abnormal electrical activity.
