Management of an ibuprofen toxicity patient is primarily supportive. Most patients have no symptoms or mild GI symptoms that respond to symptomatic management. Asymptomatic patients with normal vital signs and no acetaminophen poisoning may be observed for 4 to 6 hours to develop symptoms.

Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal may be used if there is a history of recent (within 2 hours) clinically significant ibuprofen overdose in adults and children with ingestion of more than 400 mg/kg.
