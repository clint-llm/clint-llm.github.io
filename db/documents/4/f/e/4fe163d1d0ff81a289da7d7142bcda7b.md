Neuromas can divide into true neoplasms, traumatic neuromas, and neuromas as part of a syndrome.

True neoplasms include neural fibrolipoma, acoustic neuroma, ganglioneuroma, neurothekeoma, nerve sheath myxoma. Neural fibrolipoma is a sausage-shaped localized expansion of epineurial adipose and fibrous tissue of a segment of a major nerve.  Acoustic neuroma or vestibular schwannoma is an intracranial tumor presenting with tinnitus hearing loss and vertigo. Ganglionneuroma is a sympathetic autonomic nervous tumor commonly arising in the abdomen, which can produce hormones. Neurothekeoma and nerve sheath myxoma are both perineural tumors.

Traumatic neuromas can develop after blunt or sharp trauma or traction injury. Mortons neuroma(localized interdigital neuroma) is a traumatic neuroma of the third metatarsal interspace. A Pacinian neuroma is a unique tumor consists entirely or partly of Pacinian corpuscles, which are dermal tactile receptors. Elective surgery is also a significant cause of traumatic neuromas. It is common to see neuroma formation following elective hand surgery, especially the superficial radial nerve is susceptible, or after knee arthroplasty, the saphenous nerve is vulnerable.

Neuromas can develop after amputation called stump neuroma. The symptoms they produce should not be confused with phantom limb pain.

Neuromas can be part of a syndrome such as neurofibromatosis or MEN2B. Neurofibroma (or neurofibromatosis) is a genetic condition in which multiple neuromas form in various places of the central and peripheral nervous system. They can present as skin lesions, can cause hearing and balance issues or pain. There is no known cure; surgery has a role in symptom control. Multiple endocrine neoplasia 2B (MEN2B) is a genetic syndrome consisting of medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and mucosal neuromas.
