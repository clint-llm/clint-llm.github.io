- Non-surgical: risk of recurrence, increase in size, and accelerated growth. Some meningiomas can get calcified or progress to grade 2 or 3 with a tendency of malignancy, brain invasion, and rarely metastasis.

- Surgical and medical: hematoma, infection, venous thrombosis, CSF leak, risk of injury to surrounding anatomical structures, and worsening of neurological deficits.

- Post radiosurgery: risk of cranial nerve deficits, such as optic nerve injury in intracranial meningioma. There is an increasing risk of toxicity due to radiotherapy.
