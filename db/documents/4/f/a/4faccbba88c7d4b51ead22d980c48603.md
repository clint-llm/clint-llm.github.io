Amblyopia is a visual disorder due to the failure of cortical visual development in one or both eyes due to ocular pathology early in life. Consequences of amblyopia include poor stereovision, visual acuity, pattern recognition, and low sensitivity to motion and contrast. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of amblyopia and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of amblyopia.
- Summarize the epidemiology of amblyopia.
- Identify the ocular examination used in the evaluation of amblyopia.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by amblyopia.
