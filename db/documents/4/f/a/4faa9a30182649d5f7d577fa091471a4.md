Unfortunately, most patients with gastric carcinoma are diagnosed at advanced stages. Symptoms may include weight loss, cachexia, anorexia, early satiety, dyspepsia, gastric outlet obstruction, or malnutrition. Work up for gastric cancer involves a variety of diagnostic tests that stratify which patients are candidates for gastric resection. Routine laboratory tests should be obtained, including baseline hemoglobin, platelet count, and complete metabolic profile. Albumin and prealbumin are serum markers that can be used to assess nutritional status.

Diagnostic evaluation begins with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) if the gastric neoplasm is suspected. EGD provides a histopathologic diagnosis, as well as the location and the extent of the tumor.

An interprofessional approach should be taken to determine surgical resectability, preoperative planning, and the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation. A careful review of the patient’s comorbidities is required for medical optimization as well as an assessment of the patient’s performance status and ability to tolerate surgery. Additionally, any modifiable risk factors must be addressed prior to surgical intervention, such as preoperative smoking cessation, which has been reported to improve outcomes after gastrectomy for malignancy.
