Trauma, such as basilar skull fractures, projectile or slash injuries, or iatrogenic injuries, account for 70% to 75% of all CCFs. These commonly present in young males and tend toÂ be high flow, direct fistulas.

Spontaneous CCFs represent 30% of all CCFs and result from aneurysm rupture or genetic conditions that predispose the patients to vascular injuries such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or fibromuscular dysplasia. They are most commonly seen in older females and result in low flow, type D indirect fistulas.
