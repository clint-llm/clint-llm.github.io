The history should include questions about risk factors for corneal ulcers such as contact lens use (the type of lens, storage habits, hygiene, history of prolonged use, swimming or showering in lenses), prior ocular surgery, recent ocular trauma, personal history or exposure to herpes, work exposures, and use of immunosuppressant medications. Other important points in the history include the quality and severity of pain, the rapidity of onset, and the presence or absence of any photophobia or blurry vision. Patientâ€™s past medical history should be explored as diseases such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, and other collagen vascular diseases can predispose patients to develop corneal ulcers.

The physical exam should include testing of visual acuity, intraocular pressures (if no concern for globe rupture or perforated ulcer), and pupillary response. The eyelids and conjunctiva should be examined for any injection, swelling, or discharge as well as for the presence of ciliary flush. A thorough slit lamp examination should be performed to determine the size, location, and shape of the lesion or lesions. Seidel's test can is useful if there is any concern for rupture.
