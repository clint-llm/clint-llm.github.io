When given at therapeutic doses, bosentan levels reach steady-state after 3 to 5 days of therapy. The hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system metabolizes bosentan into two active metabolites. Only one of the metabolites (Ro 48-5033) can exert effects similar to bosentan, however, with only less than 20% of the effect.

Due to bosentanâ€™s embryo-fetal toxicity, female patients must be on more than one form of contraception before starting therapy and for one month following termination of treatment.
