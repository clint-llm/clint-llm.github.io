If an intraocular foreign body (FB) is suspected, then an immediate ophthalmologic evaluation is mandatory. History of intraocular foreign body trauma frequently includes metal to metal hammering, chiseling or drilling, or recent proximity to an explosive event. These circumstances suggest a high-speed impact, which is associated with a greater incidence of intraocular FB. With careful slit-lamp evaluation, signs of intraocular involvement may include a shallow anterior chamber, hyphema, iris or pupillary irregularity, a break in the Descemet membrane, or a traumatic cataract. Additionally, a positive Seidel sign (leakage of intraocular fluid visualized on the ocular surface after fluorescein dye has been introduced into the tear film) indicates a corneal or scleral perforation. Imaging is of benefit when locating foreign bodies in the posterior segment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is strictly contraindicated in any case involving metallic FB. Regardless of superficial corneal foreign bodies, if an intraocular foreign body (FB) is suspected, then an immediate ophthalmologic evaluation is mandatory.

If a metallic or organic FB is located very deep in the cornea, the risk of penetrating or significant scarring warrants a specialist referral.
