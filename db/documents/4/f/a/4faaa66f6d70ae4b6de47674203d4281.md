Thrombolytics or fibrinolytic are a group of medications used to manage and treat dissolving intravascular clots. They are in the plasminogen activator class of drugs. This class of medicine is used in acute myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, acute ischemic stroke, acute peripheral arterial occlusion, occlusion of indwelling catheters, and intracardiac thrombus formation. This activity describes the indications, action, and contraindications for thrombolytics. This activity will also highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, monitoring, and toxicity pertinent for interprofessional team members in treating patients with intravascular clots such as acute myocardial infarction, acute ischemic stroke, and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of thrombolytics.
- Describe the potential adverse effects associated with various thrombolytic agents.
- Review the monitoring for patients on thrombolytic therapy. 
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance thrombolytics and improve outcomes.
