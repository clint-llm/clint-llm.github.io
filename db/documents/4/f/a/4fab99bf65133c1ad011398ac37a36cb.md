Vasculogenesis is the process of de novo blood vessel formation early in embryonic development. Angiogenesis is a similar process but is not gene dependent and has the primary purpose of repairing damaged vessels. Both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis depend on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Similar to other blood vessels, the vasculogenesis process of the MCA begins when extraembryonic mesodermal cells differentiate into angioblasts. Angioblasts form angiogenic cell clusters, which later differentiate into the endothelium of blood vessels. The development of the adult arterial pattern depends on the aortic arches. There are 6 embryonic aortic arches, enumerated in a rostral to caudal order from 1 to 6 for their study and development. The fifth aortic arch never develops in humans. The third aortic arch is the origin of the right and left common carotid arteries, and the right and left internal carotid arteries, which further give rise to the middle cerebral arteries bilaterally. As previously mentioned, vasculogenesis is a genetically driven process that allows for physiologic and anatomic variants.
