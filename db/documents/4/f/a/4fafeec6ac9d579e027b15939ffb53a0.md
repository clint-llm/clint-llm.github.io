During a physical exam, patients will often have a decreased glenohumeral range of motion and associated pain with testing. Pain will often limit a complete and thorough physical exam. Typically, there is a significant reduction in the active and passive range of motion in 2 or more planes of motion compared to the unaffected side. Usually, the range of motion is lost in the following order: external rotation, abduction, internal rotation, and forward flexion. When using special tests of the shoulder, the Neer and Hawkins tests for impingement and the Speed’s test for biceps tendinopathy are positive. Diagnosis is clinical and based on history and physical exam findings described above.

There is no laboratory testing indicated for diagnosis. If there is a concern for underlying systemic disease, test as needed.

Imaging is not indicated. The diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis is primarily clinical. If there is a concern about an alternative diagnosis, such as evaluating for a fracture, imaging, such as a shoulder X-ray, may be useful.

The injection test can be performed if a clinician is uncertain of the etiology of shoulder pain based on history and exam. The subacromial space is injected with an anesthetic, typically 5 ml of 1% lidocaine. In patients with adhesive capsulitis, the ROM limitations and pain will persist after the injection. Patients with subacromial pathology (rotator cuff tendinopathy or subacromial bursitis) will show an improvement in pain and improved range of motion.
