In the United States, trauma centers are identified through a designation process and a verification process. The criteria for the designation of a trauma center varies from state to state, and the designation process itself is the responsibility of state or regional authorities and not healthcare organizations.

Trauma centers are evaluated and verified by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) to improve trauma care. The ACS provides verification of trauma centers, not a designation. It verifies that the facility has the resources available for the trauma patient. The ACS will evaluate a facility's preparedness, resources, policies, and quality improvement process. Verification by the ACS is valid for three years.
