Practices for preventing the spread of responsible pathogens, including HIV, HSV, CMV, TB, etc., are essential for the patient as well as the primary caretaker of the patient. The most significant risk of spread is by contact with the mucosal surface or body secretions. Optimal hygiene practices are effective in prevention. Good compliance with HAART and routine checkup for CD4 cell count has prognostic importance in HIV-positive patients.

In patients with a CD4 count of fewer than 100 cells/microliter or CMV viremia or previous history of CMV infection, asymptomatic fundoscopic screening is recommended.
