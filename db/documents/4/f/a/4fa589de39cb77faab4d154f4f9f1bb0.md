Albuterol acts on beta-2 adrenergic receptors to relax the bronchial smooth muscle. It also inhibits the release of immediate hypersensitivity mediators from cells, especially mast cells. Although albuterol also affects beta-1 adrenergic receptors, this is minimal and has little effect on the heart rate.
