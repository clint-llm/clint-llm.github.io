A single parathyroid adenoma is responsible for 80 to 85% of hyperparathyroidism, with double adenomas the culprit in 4 to 5%, and parathyroid hyperplasia in 10 to 12%. Parathyroid carcinomas are very rare causes of hyperparathyroidism and account for less than 1% of disease. Adenomas are most common in patients 50 to 70 years old; however, they can occur at any age. Women are affected 3-times as often as men.
