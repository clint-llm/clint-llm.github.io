Pharmacokinetics is the study of a drug moiety or a compound as it moves through the body after its administration. It involves the processes of drug absorption, bioavailability, clearance, and distribution.

Drug distribution is the disbursement of an unmetabolized drug as it moves through the bodyâ€™s blood and tissues. The efficacy or toxicity of a drug depends on the distribution in specific tissues and in part explains the lack of correlation between plasma levels and the effects that are seen. Based on the molecular structure, drugs have variable distribution in different types of tissues such as fat, muscle, and brain. Unlike other tissues, the brain and testes are unique, as they contain membrane barriers making a drug significantly less susceptible to distribution.

**Lipophiliic (Fat Soluble)**

- Nonpolar compounds

- Easily diffuse across lipid bilayers of cell membranes

- Rx can be administered topically

- Free diffusion across the blood-brain barrier

- Biotransformed in the liver

- Excreted through the bile duct

**Hydrophilic (Water Soluble)**

- Polar compounds

- Cross lipid bilayers via facilitated transport (passive chemical diffusion across a cell membrane by ion channels or carriers)

- Eliminated by kidneys
