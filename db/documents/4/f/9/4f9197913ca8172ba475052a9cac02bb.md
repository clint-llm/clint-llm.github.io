Once a mutation occurs or a mistake is not found, the cell will bypass the regulatory elements of the cell cycle leading to the progression of the mutation in all daughter cells, therefore showing the importance of halt mutated DNA before other cells form. Many chemotherapy drugs work to break strands of DNA to stop the replication of the cells once suppression has been bypassed; however, the drugs cannot distinguish between healthy DNA and harmful DNA, leading to the loss of many other cells, often associated with hair loss.
