Erythrokeratodermia variabilis demonstrates heterozygous dominant inheritance. EKV-associated mutations are usually located in genes encoding either Cx31 (GJB3) or Cx30.3 (GJB4) and occasionally Cx43 (GJA1).

There are reports of rare forms inherited with autosomal recessive modality caused by homozygous mutations in GJB3 that were also described in patients with EKV, although EKV is admittedly a consequence of connexin mutations.

In a study by Common et al., molecular investigations of GJB3 and GJB4 were performed in five pedigrees and three sporadic cases of EKV. The detection of connexin 31(Cx31) or connexin 30.3 (Cx30.3) mutations was in only three probands, of which two were novel mutations, and one was a recurrent mutation. Also, no mutations in these patients were detected in other epidermal disease-associated Cx genes. The authors conclude that EKV is a heterogeneous condition, and individuals clinically diagnosed with this disease harbor different Cx31 or Cx30.3 mutations.
