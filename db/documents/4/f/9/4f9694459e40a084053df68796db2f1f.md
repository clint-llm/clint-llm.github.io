The needle is placed perpendicular to the bone with special attention in the pediatric population to avoid the epiphyseal plate. In pediatric placement, placement should be in the medial proximal tibia similar to the adult but 1 cm distal to the tibial tuberosity.

Confirm placement of the IO needle by checking for the stability of needle in bone, aspiration of marrow, ability to flush with saline, and good IV flow rates. The inability to aspirate does not always indicate poor placement. If this occurs, continue with a saline flush and attempt aspiration again.

After needle insertion, flush with 5 to 10 cc normal saline for adults and 2 to 5 ml for infants and children. Patients may have severe pain when flushing with saline. The Injection of 2% intravenous lidocaine 20 to 40 mg or 0.5 mg/kg pediatric dose into the IO needle for relief of injection pain has been advocated, but with mixed results on pain resolution.

Stabilization of the needle differs with each device used but is mandatory to avoid inadvertently dislodging or bending the IO needle.

The team should document the date and time of placement of the IO to ensure it will be in use for less than 24 hours. Following the obtaining of adequate IV access, the IO device should be removed and bandaged.
