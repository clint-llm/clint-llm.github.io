Weibel-Palade bodies are small storage granules located in endothelial cells comprising the intima of the heart and blood vessels. They are found in arteries, capillaries, veins, and the endocardium, but notably not in the lymphatic vessels. These bodies function to store two principal molecules, P-selectin and Von Willebrand factor. These two agents play a role in inflammation and hemostasis. Von Willebrand factor is essential for blood coagulation

There are many other protein molecules stored in Weibel-Palade bodies which include interleukin 8, endothelin 1, eotaxin-3, osteoprotegerin, angiopoietin-2, and alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase VI. These are mediators of inflammation, immune response, angiogenesis, and vessel caliber/response to stressors.

Weibel-Palade bodies manufacture all these proteins molecules and assemble them in the Golgi complex. Immature Weibel-Palade bodies are often located near the cell nucleus where they acquire most membrane proteins. As they mature the Weibel-Palade bodies, disperse along microtubules. With time, Weibel-Palade bodies may also diffuse with their bodies to form large congregations.
