Skin testing is the preferred testing method in those patients with a history compatible with food allergies. A skin-prick test is performed by applying a drop of a peanut extract to the skin, commonly on the arm or back. A wheal/flare response is measured approximately 20 minutes after pricking the skin where the drop of peanut extract was placed. Positive testing indicates sensitization to peanuts and can predict the probability of a future reaction. Measurement of peanut-specific IgE antibodies in serum is another useful method to estimate sensitization and the probability of future reaction. It is important to note that this type of testing does not predict the severity of the reaction and is limited by poor sensitivity; results are reassuring when negative. Ultimately a clinician-supervised oral food challenge is the best and most reliable method for diagnosing peanut allergy. Serum-specific IgE and skin-prick testing can aid in determining which patients should have an oral food challenge.
