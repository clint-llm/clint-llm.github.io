In the cases of significant hypoventilation induced by opioid anesthesia, or excessive levels at the end of a case, frequent stimulation may be initially necessary to maintain and encourage adequate ventilation. If the stimulation is insufficient, positive pressure ventilation or titration of IV naloxone can support the patient until recovery is sufficient for adequate spontaneous ventilation. Careful titration of naloxone is necessary to allow for adequate analgesia and the prevention of a sympathetic surge. This is why patients receiving intraoperative opioid anesthesia require constant vital sign monitoring, as outlined above, to help prevent potential toxicity.
