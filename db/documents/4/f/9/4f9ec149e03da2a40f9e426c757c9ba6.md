Therapeutic drug monitoring of 5-FU can be performed using high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, or immunoassay to measure plasma drug levels to reduce toxicity and improve efficacy. Therapeutic drug monitoring is especially important for patients with DPD deficiency, in which 5-FU treatment is the mainstay of treatment for their condition with no clinically efficacious alternatives.
