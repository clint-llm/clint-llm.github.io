Ocrelizumab is contraindicated in the following patients:

- Those with a history of life-threatening infusion reactions to ocrelizumab

- Patients with active hepatitis-B infection

Before initiating ocrelizumab:

- Hepatitis B virus screening is necessary. There have been reports of ocrelizumab leading to reactivation of latent HBV in a previously resolved patient.

- All necessary immunizations should be given at least six weeks before initiating ocrelizumab, given the expected B-cell depletion.

- Consider previous immunosuppressive therapy for potential increased immunosuppressive effects.

Before every ocrelizumab infusion:

- Determine if there is an active infection; if yes, delay infusion until resolution

- Premedicate with 100 mg of methylprednisolone and an antihistamine 30 minutes before infusion

- Consider premedication with an antipyretic

- A regiment of cetirizine (10 mg), ranitidine (75 mg), increased hydration, IV diphenhydramine (50 mg), IV methylprednisolone (125 mg), and oral acetaminophen (650 mg) has been shown to reduce infusion reactions by 60% in one study.
