In the patient presenting with a knee dislocation that has not spontaneously reduced, prompt reduction of the knee joint should be achieved using adequate analgesia and sedation. Procedural sedation with two providers is generally needed. The reduction itself will often require one provider to stabilize the femur while another performs traction and manipulation of the tibia. The direction of needed tibial movement will depend on the type and direction of the dislocation. Posterolateral dislocation may be difficult or impossible to reduce and will require orthopedic consultation. The providers performing the reduction should avoid excessive pressure on the popliteal fossa in case of a popliteal arterial injury.

Once reduced, the clinician should reevaluate distal pulses and vascular perfusion. Imaging should be obtained as described above. Admission for serial vascular examinations is an option only in patients with clearly strong distal pulses, normal ABI, and normal duplex ultrasound.  Otherwise, emergent vascular surgery consultation in concert with computed tomography angiogram should be pursued to rule out popliteal artery injury.

Orthopedic consultation may be necessary as an inpatient for discussion on reconstructive surgery. In cases of vascular injury, operative repair by vascular surgery may be required.
