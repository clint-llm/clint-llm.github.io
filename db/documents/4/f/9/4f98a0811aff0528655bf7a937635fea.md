Renal vein thrombosis (RVT), the presence of thrombus in the major renal veins or its tributaries, is a rare clinical entity. It can present acutely or go unnoticed and can result in acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease. Rayer, a French nephrologist, was the first to describe RVT and its association with proteinuria in the 1840s. This activity describes the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of renal vein thrombosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.
