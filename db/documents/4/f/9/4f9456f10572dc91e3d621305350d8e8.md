**Safety**

The standardized patient program director has two primary roles and responsibilities, including ensuring the safety of the SPs as well as providing human resource oversight.  The standardized patient program director must ensure that the SP Standards of Best Practice (SOBP) are followed to ensure the integrity, growth, and safe employment of these individuals when they interact with learners. The Association of Standardized Patient Educators (ASPE) is a global organization that works to set the SP Standards of Best Practice (SOBP).

As mentioned above, a primary responsibility of the standardized patient director is to ensure safety among SPs, including providing a safe physical and psychological environment; this can be accomplished by following ASPE’s SOBP first domain, a safe work environment. Creating a safe work environment involves three distinct principles: confidentiality, safe work practice, and respect.

A safe work environment is only achievable if the activity is designed correctly (e.g., number of breaks, rotations, cognitive, physical, and psychological challenges in portraying the patient role). Recognizing and anticipating any potential occupational hazards such as live defibrillators, sharps containers, and allergenic substances are critical to maintaining a safe environment for those participating in simulation activities.

The screening of an SP during the hiring process and specific role assignment can help eliminate some of these risks. Some considerations while hiring standardized patients include but are not limited to identifying if the individual can adapt to change based on feedback and coaching, can sustain the portrayal of the case effectively, have great listening skills and, have the ability to deliver the scenario based on their training accurately.

Some characteristics for role assignments are based on age, gender, language, physical build, race/ethnicity, level of literacy and education, experience with presenting illness, availability to train and partake in the event, and ensuring the SP is dependable.

SP training and development is essential to ensuring the maintenance of SP physical and psychological safety. Each SP should have the option to withdraw from the activity and practice how to terminate an activity if they feel uncomfortable or deem it harmful. There should also be a method for an SP or learner to report an adverse event that they may have experienced during an encounter. The SP program director should also work with the educator(s) for each activity to define what is expected from the SP. The program director must then communicate these expectations and ensure each SP can perform all portions of the role. An SP must understand role boundaries and have the ability to make informed decisions on whether or not to agree to perform each role assignment.

**Human Resources**

While not directly related to simulation-based education, leadership, and human resource experience are vital to the roles and responsibilities of a program director.  Specifically, program directors must have the ability to appropriately hire, train, and review the performance of the SP staff.  While educators focus on the specific education to be provided, and healthcare simulation technology specialists focus on the technical tools and their implementation into simulation activities, those in the SP program director role have the responsibility to manage and support the human resources and staffing to maintain programmatic operations.

Although age, gender, and underlying medical conditions may be part of the interview process and case selection, sexual orientation cannot be asked during the hiring process. This aspect is probably the most demanding and critical part of the role of a standardized patient program director.

Daily human resource functions within the role of the standardized patient program director include decisions about hiring practices, support and/or enforcement of professional development activities and training, and determination of the number of hours and amount of work available as well as the qualifications of those who will be offered each role.

ASPE’s SOBP describes that it may be appropriate for standardized patients to be independent contractors, employees, or volunteers.
