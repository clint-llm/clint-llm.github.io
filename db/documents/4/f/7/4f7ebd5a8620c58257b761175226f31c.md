Mediastinal cancers are usually rare. Typically, they are diagnosed in patients aged 30 to 50 years but can develop at any age from any tissue that is located or passes through the mediastinum. Children usually present with cancers in the posterior mediastinum, while adults typically present with cancers in the anterior mediastinum. There is a similar incidence in men and women, but it can vary with the type of cancer present.
