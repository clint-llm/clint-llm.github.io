When diagnosing acute pyelonephritis, keeping the differential broad is a wise idea. Physicians should consider other disorders as well when patients present with fever, flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness. Because symptoms can be variable (unilateral, bilateral, radiating, sharp, dull) and because pyelonephritis can progress to sepsis and shock, the differential diagnoses associated with pyelonephritis can be extensive. Common mimics of acute pyelonephritis can include but are not limited to:

- Appendicitis

- Abdominal abscess

- Nephrolithiasis

- Cholecystitis

- Urinary tract obstruction

- Pelvic inflammatory disease

- Pancreatitis

- Ectopic pregnancy
