The end product of female gametogenesis is a healthy and mature oocyte, which is released from the follicle during ovulation to join with a male gamete through a process called fertilization. The function of the mature oocyte is to provide half of the genetic material to the zygote formed through fertilization, as well as the intracellular components and organelles needed for maturation and future division.
