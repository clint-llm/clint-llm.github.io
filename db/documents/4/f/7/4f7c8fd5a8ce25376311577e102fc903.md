Umbilical hernias are common in clinical practice. The majority of patients are first seen by the primary care provider or the emergency department physician. Because these hernias have a high risk of incarceration, surgery is recommended in all patients. an interprofessional team approach is necessary to avoid the morbidity of an umbilical hernia. In patients with associated comorbidity, a preoperative workup is necessary to reduce post-surgery complications. The nurse anesthetist must make sure that the patient is fit for surgery. Patients with cirrhosis and or ascites need to be thoroughly assessed prior to surgery, as complications are common

Once the surgery completed, the nurse should educate the patient on the importance of losing weight, quiet smoking and avoiding heavy lifting. Patient must be educated on healthy diet. Once the healing completed, the patient should be encouraged to increase physical activities and lose weight. This is vital in preventing a recurrence.

Nurse practitioners who see children should educate the parent that small hernias will spontaneously close but if they still remain open by age 5, surgery is required.

Most patients with an umbilical hernia have a good outcome, but despite advances in treatment with a mesh, recurrences do occur in about 1-3% of cases.
