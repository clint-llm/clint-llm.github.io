Incisional hernias can occur after any abdominal surgical procedure where the abdominal wall is incised. Incisional hernia has also been reported after traumatic abdominal wall injuries

Patient-related factors that impair proper wound healing and affect the strength of the new tissue to support the abdominal wall increase the incidence of incisional hernia. Systemic chronic diseases like DM, renal failure, obesity, smoking, and malnutrition conditions; or systemic long term medications like steroids and immunosuppressants increase the likelihood of developing an incisional hernia. Morbid obesity is a common associated risk factor

Disease-related factors including incision site, timing, and urgency of procedure, complications, and the underlying disease play an important role in the occurrence of incisional hernia. Emergency surgeries

Technical factors related to the surgical technique or suture materials used for closure. Poor surgical technique may result in acute wound dehiscence or delayed healing failure in the form of incisional hernia
