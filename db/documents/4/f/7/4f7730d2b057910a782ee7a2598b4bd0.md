Prolonged hospitalization or antibiotic therapy predisposes to Acinetobacter colonization, and because colonization is the rule and infection is the exception, colonized patients have no physical findings.

Most patients are in the hospital when infected with Acinetobacter. The one organ most commonly involved is the lung, primarily because of colonization of the airways and respiratory equipment used for mechanical ventilation.

Pneumonia, wound infection, catheter-associated bacteremia, or nosocomial meningitis have all been described by Acinetobacter.

There are no pathognomic findings in Acinetobacter infections, and they need to be differentiated from other gram-negative infections like Enterobacter, Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, and Serratia. Since Acinetobacter is chiefly a colonizing organism, the physician has the onus to prove that it is causing the pathology in any given clinical scenario.
