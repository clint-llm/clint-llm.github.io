The goals of this activity are to review some subsets of patients that are at the highest risk for difficult or failed intubation. Discuss techniques, strategies, and algorithms to aid successful airway management when encountering unanticipated difficult intubation. This article will help equip clinicians to anticipate when encountering the unanticipated difficult intubation.

**Objectives:**
- Identify some subsets of patients most at risk for difficult or failed intubation.
- Summarize predictors of difficult video laryngoscopy, supraglottic airway placement, and cricothyrotomy.

- Explain the use of a supraglottic airway as a conduit to intubation.
- Explain the incorporation of algorithms into practice to guide airway management by the interprofessional healthcare team.
