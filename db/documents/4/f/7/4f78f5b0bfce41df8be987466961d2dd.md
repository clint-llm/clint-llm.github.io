The Bekhterev-Jacobsohn reflex is also known as the “Jacobsohn finger flexion sign.” Dr. Vladimir Bekhterev (a Russian neurologist) and Dr. Louis Jacobsohn-Lask (a German neurologist) described the reflex in the early 1900s. The reflex is a clinical sign that can be easily elicited without the use of any equipment. The Bekhterev-Jacobsohn reflex describes abduction of the hand and flexion of the fingers when the distal radius is stroked. The reflex is very simple to complete and can be useful when trying to determine the localization of a lesion. The reflex is indicative of a lesion in the pyramidal tract of the upper limb.
