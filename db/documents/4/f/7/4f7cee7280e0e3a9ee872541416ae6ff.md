The overall prognosis of bedbug bites is excellent. There is no substantial evidence to suggest that either C. lectularius or C. hemipterus is a vector of any pathogen and only rarely has bed bug bites been implicated as causes of anemia or severe allergic reactions. The most common sequelae from the bedbug bites are secondary bacterial infections from scratching, sleep disturbances from the "itch-scratch cycle," and insomnia due to the anxiety of living in an infested household.
