Adenoid hypertrophy is an obstructive condition due to enlarged adenoids. This can occur with or without an acute or chronic infection of the adenoids. This condition is more common in children than in adults; the adenoids naturally atrophy and regress during adolescence. In children, the prevalence has been estimated at 34.5%. Although this condition is generally self-resolving due to age-related adenoid atrophy, it can lead to significant complications. This activity will review the presentation and management of patients with adenoid hypertrophy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team on improving outcomes for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain how a patient with adenoid hypertrophy can present. 
- Identify treatment options for infectious and obstructive adenoid hypertrophy.
- Identify when an adenoidectomy should be considered. 
- Explain how well-coordinated interprofessional teams can improve outcomes for patients with adenoid hypertrophy.
