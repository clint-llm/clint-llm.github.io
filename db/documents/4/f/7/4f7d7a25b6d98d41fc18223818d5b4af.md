PSVT is often due to different reentry circuits in the heart, where less frequent causes include enhanced or abnormal automaticity and triggered activity. Reentry circuits include a pathway within and around the sinus node, within the atrial myocardium, within the atrioventricular node, or an accessory pathway involving the atrioventricular node.

- Sinus node: Sinoatrial node reentrant tachycardia

- Atrial myocardium: Atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and multifocal atrial tachycardia

- Atrioventricular node: Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia
