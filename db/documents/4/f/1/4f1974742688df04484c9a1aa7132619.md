Visual prognosis is poor in patients with Lowe syndrome due to the high likelihood of amblyopia and glaucoma severity. Dysphagia resulting from hypotonia may be severe enough to require tube feeding. It also increases patient susceptibility to respiratory infections.

Renal disease severity varies among patients and worsens with age. Patients typically live until the 2nd to 4th decade of life. Reduced life expectancy is most often a consequence of renal failure. Other frequent causes of death include respiratory illness, seizures, and infections.
