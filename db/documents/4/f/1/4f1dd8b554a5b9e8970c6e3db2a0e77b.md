Improvement in the quality of life and life expectancy remains the main goal in patients with hemophilia. Designated hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs) have been established in many parts of the world. These centers should include a multidisciplinary team of doctors (pain specialists, geneticists, hematologists, immunologists, etc.), nurses, musculoskeletal experts, laboratory specialists, pharmacists, and psychology experts. Education should be provided to the patients to monitor their symptoms and seek treatment as soon as possible. Pharmacists should examine the patient's medication profile frequently and to avoid any drugs that could precipitate any bleeding events.

Home therapies should be established promptly after diagnoses and as soon as families have the required education and training. The patient and family should be comfortable with hemophilia management since it provides the most immediate access to early treatment and decreases overall pain, dysfunction, disability, and hospital admission.
