The pathophysiology of pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) revealed the alveolar hyperdistention and bronchial duct gland ectasia formation resulting in tissue rupture. Some causes of air leaks and alveolar rupture are from insufflation (mechanical ventilation or positive pressure ventilation), uneven ventilation, and reduce lung compliance, especially since the lungs are underdeveloped and very sensitive to stretch.

The increased transpulmonary pressure being higher than the tensile strength of the alveolar and airways will injure the respiratory epithelium. The injury to the epithelium is where the air will enter the interstitium from and the air leak into the perivascular tissue of the lung due to the high intra-alveolar pressure.

Two common types of air leaks are intrapulmonary pneumatosis and intrapleural pneumatosis. Intrapulmonary pneumatosis is much more common. The air trapped inside the lung is underneath the pleura in the interlobular septa. Intrapleural pneumatosis occurs more commonly in mature infants with normal lungs.

The complications of PIE vary from an isolated interstitial bubble to lesions of unilateral lung or lesions bilaterally. It damages the functional tissue and vascular structure with fibrotic and inflammatory changes. The pathology also results in fibroblast foci with organizing and interstitial pneumonia, granulomatous disease, and sometimes lymphangiectasia.
