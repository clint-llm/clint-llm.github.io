A markedly growing epidemic of obesity exists in many parts of the world. Most notably, obesity is rapidly rising in the Western world where substantial weight gain seems to be the norm. When compared to previous decades, young children today seem to be especially affected by this obesity epidemic, with 41 million children from birth to age 5 years classified as overweight or obese. About 80% of children continue to be adolescents with excess weight and are predicted to be adults with obesity. The cycle of increasing obesity continues, with parents with obesity having a strong influence on their children’s inclination toward obesity; when both parents are obese, the children have around an 80% chance of becoming obese as well. While genes certainly play a role in every person’s metabolism and appetite, the environment is one of the main contributors to the obesity epidemic. Like their parents who choose foods that are loaded in calories but deficient in nutrients and do not participate in enough physical activity, children learn to live in the same manner. Thus the cycle continues, and the obesogenic environments remain.
