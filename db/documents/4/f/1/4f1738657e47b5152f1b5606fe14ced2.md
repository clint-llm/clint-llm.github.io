Evaluation of juvenile open-angle glaucoma should include the measurement of IOP and assessment of visual acuity, the optic disc, and the anterior chamber angle.

- Intraocular pressure: Goldmann Applanation Tonometry is the gold-standard method used to obtain an accurate IOP.

- Optic disc: optic discs of juvenile open-angle glaucoma tend to be more extensive than adult-onsetÂ primary open-angle glaucoma discs.

- Pachymetry: This is used to measure the thickness of the eye's cornea and is recommended as a part of the pre-operative evaluation of juvenile open-angle glaucoma. Thinner corneas are a risk factor for JOAG.

- Anterior chamber angle: Will typically appear normal on gonioscopy in patients with juvenile open-angle glaucoma. However, dysgenesis of the angle may be present with severe elevation of intraocular pressure.
