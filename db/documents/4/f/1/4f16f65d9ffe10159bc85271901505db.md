Tumors of the vertebrae are quite frequently metastatic with primary bone or cartilaginous tumors much less common. Metastatic lesions are typically from the lung, breast, prostate, or kidney. Tumors within the conus medullaris may arise from the astrocytes of the spinal cord (astrocytoma) or the ependymal lining of the central canal of the spinal cord (ependymoma). Metastatic lesions are much less common. Tumors of the cauda equina typically arise from the Schwann cells lining the nerve roots (schwannoma).

**Etiologies of CES**

- Compressive

- Massive herniated lumbar disc
- Tumor: (metastatic disease to the spine with epidural extension, schwannoma, neurofibroma, meningioma)
- Trauma: (fractured bone fragments)
- Spinal epidural hematoma (spontaneous, iatrogenic, traumatic)

- Infection: Typically from spinal epidural abscess complicating discitis or vertebral osteomyelitis. Although there is a compressive effect from the mass, there is vascular compromise resulting from local septic thrombophlebitis.

- Ischemic

- Inflammatory

- Degenerative: Spinal stenosis

- Postoperative lumbar spinal surgery complications

**Etiologies of CMS**

- Compressive

- Tumor: ependymoma (frequently with a hemorrhagic intratumoral component), glioma, and least likely metastases. Ependymoma in this area is commonly known as myxopapillary ependymoma. Myxopapillary ependymomas are usually positive for several immunophenotype markers: GFAP, S100, vimentin, CD99, AE1/AE3, and NCAM1
- Trauma: fractured bone fragments

- Infection: spinal epidural abscess complicating discitis or vertebral osteomyelitis

- Ischemic: from poor arterial supply to the area

- Inflammatory
