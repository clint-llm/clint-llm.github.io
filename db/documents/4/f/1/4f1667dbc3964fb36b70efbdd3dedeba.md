Intracardiac shunts are abnormal pathways for blood flow in the heart that form either in addition to or in place of normal pathways for blood flow. They are the most common congenital heart defects. Approximately 0.8% to 1.2% of live births worldwide have some type of congenital heart anomaly. Management of a shunt depends on the disease type and ranges from simple clinical observation, medical therapy, lifestyle modification to surgical intervention. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of intracardiac shunts and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of intracardiac shunts.
- Explain the evaluation process for finding intracardiac shunts. 
- Review the management options available for intracardiac shunts
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team members to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for surgical intervention
