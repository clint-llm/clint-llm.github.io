Hepatic hemangiomas are benign, hypervascular, venous malformations that occur in the liver. They are the most common benign mesenchymal tumors of the liver. Hemangiomas are lined by endothelial cells with a thin fibrous stroma. They are also known as cavernous or capillary hepatic hemangiomas. They are generally asymptomatic and incidentally found on imaging. Often found as solitary lesions, but multiple lesions may also be present. They are categorized by size. Small hemangiomas are 1 cm to 2 cm, typical hemangiomas are 2 cm to 10 cm, and giant hemangiomas are greater than 10 cm.

Hemangiomas may occur in various other regions of the body, such as the spinal cord, orbits, or vertebral bodies, but this article will focus on hepatic hemangiomas.
