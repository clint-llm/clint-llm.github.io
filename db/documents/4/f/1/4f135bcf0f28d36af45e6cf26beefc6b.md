Esotropia, commonly referred to as an inward deviation of eyes, is a common clinical entity seen in the outpatient department. Esotropia may be congenital/acquired, constant/intermittent, unilateral/alternating. Clinical examination, pathophysiology, and predisposing factors are essential to understand and diagnose esotropia subtype and plan appropriate management. Congenital esotropia is the most common type of esodeviation seen in early childhood and commonly presents within the first six months of life with a large angle of esodeviation. Common associations include inferior oblique overaction, dissociated vertical deviations, or latent nystagmus. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation of refractive error and its management to help maintain a binocular single vision for the patient.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology and types of esotropia.
- Summarize the evaluation of patients with esotropia.
- Outline the management of esotropia.
- Review the differential diagnosis and complications associated with esotropia and surgical management by the interprofessional team.
