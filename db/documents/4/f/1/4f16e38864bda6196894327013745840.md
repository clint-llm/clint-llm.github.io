The role of the nurse is essential after the procedure. Because there is always a risk for a hemothorax or pneumothorax, the nurse should assess the pulmonary status in the recovery room. In addition, if there is a Heimlich valve or a drainage tube, the nurse should ensure that it is patent and functioning. Any drainage should be recorded. The nurse should examine the chest x-ray report to determine if a pneumothorax is present.
