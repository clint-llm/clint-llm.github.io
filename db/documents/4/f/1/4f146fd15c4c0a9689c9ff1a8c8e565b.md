The cardio-selective beta-blockers include atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, esmolol, acebutolol, metoprolol, and nebivolol.

The mortality benefits for metoprolol succinate in heart failure patients are attributed to their ability to block the toxic effects of chronic adrenergic stimulation of the heart. Initiation of metoprolol succinate in a heart failure patient is followed by clinical improvement, improved ejection fraction, and increased exercise tolerance. The benefits of left ventricular function improvement may take 2 to 3 months to observe after initiating medication.

Slow calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers are medications that affect AV nodal function. The PR interval on the EKG defines the time needed for an impulse to travel through the atrium and AV nodal system to the ventricles. AV node conduction is the slowest, and PR interval variations reflect changes in AV nodal activation time. Beta-blockers have a negative dromotropic effect on the AV node by prolonging the AV nodal refractory periods, which could prolong the PR interval. The prolonged PR interval rarely results in more than first-degree AV block in patients receiving maintenance therapy. In a few patients, combining a calcium channel blocker and a beta-blocker may cause a second-degree AV block.
