Fibrocystic changes are sometimes characterized by an increase in breast tenderness and/or pain just prior to menstruation, referred to as cyclic mastalgia. Breast cysts are usually discovered incidentally, with only 20% of cysts being found in women with cyclical mastalgia. The vast majority of symptomatic fibrocystic changes present not as pain but as as a palpable breast lump. Proper diagnosis of cystic disease in breast tissue is made by following the triple assessment approach: clinical evaluation, imaging, and histopathology from fine-needle aspiration or core needle biopsy.

Proper clinical evaluation should include a detailed history of the presenting complaint, a description of the pain and its relation to the menstrual cycle, any recent trauma to the area, nipple and skin changes, and/or nipple discharge. It also should include a full history of past medical and surgical problems, family and pertinent social history, current medications, and medication allergies. More specifically, the age of menarche, menopause, and any family or personal history of breast cancer should be explored. This history is then followed by a thorough physical examination, which should include the evaluation of both breasts as well as axilla, neck, and chest for palpable lymph nodes.
