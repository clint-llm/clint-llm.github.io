The myoclonus in MERRF may be clinically indistinguishable from other progressive myoclonus epilepsies, e.g., Unverricht-Lundborg, Lafora body disease, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, or sialidoses. Increased lactic acid, muscle biopsy features of red-ragged fibers, and genetic testing usually confirm the diagnosis.

Sometimes, MERRF may also be difficult to diagnose from other mitochondrial disorders, especially with the overlapping features of multiple strokes (MERRF/MELAS overlap) or progressive external ophthalmoplegia and retinopathy (MERRF/Kearns-Sayre syndrome overlap).
