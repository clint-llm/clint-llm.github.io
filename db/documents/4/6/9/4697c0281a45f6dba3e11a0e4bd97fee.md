The prognosis of Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome varies according to the severity of illness. Approximately 15 % of patients with significant acute bilateral adrenal bleeding have a fatal outcome. The case fatality rate is almost 50 % in cases of delay in diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Although the mortality is high with bilateral adrenal hemorrhage, patients do recover with appropriate management on time. Those who recover need treatment with mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid depending on their electrolyte status and response to the treatment. Although the recovery is unpredictable, research has also shown that those with AH can regain some degree of adrenal function after the acute presentation.
