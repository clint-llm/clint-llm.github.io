# Continuing Education Activity

Tracheoesophageal fistulas (TEFs) represent one of the most common congenital anomalies seen in major pediatric surgical centers. Infants with tracheoesophageal fistulas classically present with respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, choking, and risk of aspiration. Tracheoesophageal fistulas most commonly occur alongside other congenital anomalies, particularly cardiac defects. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of tracheoesophageal fistulas and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the typical presentation of an infant with a tracheoesophaageal fistula. 
- Explain the evaluation of an infant with a suspected treacheoesophageal fistula. 
- Summarize the management of tracheoesophageal fistulas. 
- Review the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by tracheoesophageal fistulas.

# Introduction

Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) represents one of the most common congenital anomalies seen in major pediatric surgical centers. Infants with TEF classically present with respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, choking, and risk for aspiration. TEF is most commonly associated with other congenital anomalies, particularly cardiac defects. Esophageal atresia (EA) is a related congenital malformation with a similar presentation to TEF and can occur with or without the presence of a fistula.

# Etiology

Although the events leading to separation of the primitive trachea and esophagus are not completely understood, the most commonly accepted hypothesis is that a defect in the lateral septation of the foregut into the trachea and esophagus causes TEF and EA. The trachea and esophagus develop from a common primitive foregut, and at approximately 4 weeks of gestation, the developing respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are separated by epithelial ridges. The foregut divides into a ventral respiratory tract and a dorsal esophageal tract; the fistula tract is thought to derive from an embryonic lung bud that fails to undergo branching. These defects of mesenchymal proliferation are thought to lead to TEF formation.

The VACTERL complex refers to anomalies of the vertebrae (V), anal or gastrointestinal tract atresia (A), congenital cardiac defects (C), tracheoesophageal defects (TE), renal and distal urinary tract anomalies (R), and limb lesions (L). In esophageal atresia, the sonic hedgehog (SHH) gene, which encodes for an intracellular signaling molecule,  appears to be implicated. Investigators have shown that mice deficient in the regulation of the SHH gene exhibit VACTERL type anomalies.SHH, was investigated in animals with TEF and in controls. Gli-2 messenger RNA was reduced in the fistula tract when compared to the adjacent esophagus.

# Epidemiology

There does not seem to be a significant role for genetic factors in the pathogenesis of TEF. The concordance rate for twins is at 2.5%.

Feingold syndrome, associated with microcephaly, micrognathia and digital anomalies, can be associated with TEF/EA. In 1962, Waterston et al., stratified risk criteria for these patients based on birth weight, pneumonia, and associated anomalies.

# Pathophysiology

TEF occurs due to abnormal septation of the caudal foregut during the fourth and fifth weeks of embryonic development. Under normal conditions, the trachea forms as a diverticulum of the foregut and develop a complete septum that separates it from the esophagus. Fistula formation in conjunction with EA occurs during an abnormal posterior positioning of the tracheoesophageal septum, resulting in a retained connection between trachea and esophagus. Isolated EA without TEF commonly occurs when the esophagus fails to recanalize during week 8 of embryonic development.

# History and Physical

Keckler et al.,

The clinical presentation of TEF depends on the presence or absence of EA. Polyhydramnios occurs in two-thirds of pregnancies, although many cases are not detected prenatally.

# Evaluation

Prenatal diagnosis of TEF may be suspected from maternal polyhydramnios and the absence of the fetal stomach bubble. In a study by Stringer et al., prenatal scans diagnosing EA had a sensitivity of 42% with a positive predictive value of 56%.

The diagnosis of EA can be made when an orogastric or nasogastric catheter cannot be passed further than approximately 10 to 15 cm into the stomach. This finding can be confirmed with an anterior-posterior chest radiograph that demonstrates the catheter curled in the upper esophageal pouch. A distal TEF can be seen on a lateral chest radiograph; both views will reveal a gas-filled gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Water-soluble contrast can be instilled into the esophageal pouch under fluoroscopic guidance to evaluate for TEF. Barium contrast should be avoided as it causes pneumonitis if aspirated. Contrast material must be immediately removed to avoid regurgitation and aspiration. Diagnosis of isolated TEF should be attempted with an upper gastrointestinal series using thickened water-soluble contrast material. The distal esophagus is filled first, and then the catheter is pulled in a cephalad direction. Contrast swallow radiography,

# Treatment / Management

The first successful primary repair of TEF was performed by an American surgeon, Cameron Haight, in 1941.

Immediate surgical management involves the creation of gastrostomy for feeding and continuous suctioning of the blind esophageal pouch to protect the patient from aspiration. Options for reconstruction include primary repair using the native esophagus or replacement procedures with parts of the stomach or large intestine. Preservation of the native esophagus is ideal as replacement procedures increase the risk of recurrent aspiration and chronic respiratory complications. A staged procedure can be performed as the infant ages, and the esophagus elongates if primary repair is not feasible.

Meier et al.

All infants should have laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy before an open surgical repair of TEF/EA. Laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy are used to identify the level of the fistula as well as tracheomalacia and tracheobronchitis, before primary repair. Bronchoscopy can also elucidate laryngeal abnormalities, including a posterior laryngeal cleft, laryngomalacia, and vocal cord dysfunction, the position of the aortic arch, and other fistulas.

Because gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common following repair, an expert panel has recommended that infants with repaired TEF be routinely treated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for at least one year after repair, and longer for those with evidence of ongoing GERD.

# Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of TEF/EA includes an esophageal stricture or diverticulum, pharyngeal pseudodiverticulum,  severe GERD, vascular ring, iatrogenic esophageal perforation, laryngo-tracheo-esophageal cleft, esophageal webs, esophageal duplication, congenital shortened esophagus, and tracheal agenesis or atresia.

# Prognosis

The prognosis for isolated TEF is generally good.

Children with EA/TEF tend to have considerable deficiencies in their growth. Primarily, poor in utero development has been noted, with almost one third having birth weights less than the 5th percentile.

Respiratory complications are also common in children with TEF/EA.  Severe tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia occur in 10% to 20% of infants. Airway reactivity and instability can lead to life-threatening airway obstruction.

Once children reach late adolescence, respiratory morbidity decreases in frequency and severity.

# Complications

Common complications after EA and TEF repair in a series of 227 cases included anastomotic leak (16%), esophageal stricture (35%), and recurrent fistulae (3%).

Esophageal dysmotility is an expected finding and can be visualized on manometry in 75% to 100% of children after primary repair.

Motility disorders and respiratory function abnormalities are common after EA and TEF repair and warrant monitoring. A systematic review of long-term outcomes in adulthood after EA repair during infancy reported the following pooled estimated prevalences

- Dysphagia: 50.3%

- GERD with esophagitis: 40.2%

- GERD without esophagitis: 56.5%

- Respiratory tract infections: 24.1%

- Asthma: 22.3%

- Wheeze: 34.7%

- Persistent cough: 14.6%

- Barrett esophagus: 6.4%

- Squamous cell esophageal cancer: 1.4%

The prevalence of Barrett's esophagus in adulthood was four times that of the general population and is a recognized risk factor for esophageal cancer.

# Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care

Postoperative laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy are used to determine the severity of tracheomalacia and to identify missed and recurrent fistulae.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Persistent respiratory and gastrointestinal complications are common in patients with TEF repair. Long-term management focuses on early detection and aggressive management of these common complications, led by an interprofessional team of pediatric surgeons, pediatric pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, otolaryngologists, and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses.

- All children and adults should be routinely monitored for symptoms of GERD, dysphagia, and aspiration.

- All patients should undergo at least 3 surveillance endoscopies during childhood to detect early esophagitis. Routine endoscopic surveillance should be continued in adulthood, every 5 to 10 years.

- Patients with symptoms of GERD or dysphagia should be evaluated with an esophageal contrast study and endoscopy. Esophagitis should be managed aggressively with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Esophageal strictures should be treated with dilation and PPIs. Asymptomatic patients do not require routine require screening or dilation for strictures.

- Patients with respiratory symptoms should be carefully evaluated for anastomotic stricture, laryngeal cleft, vocal cord paralysis, congenital esophageal stenosis, recurrent fistula, or congenital vascular malformations. Acid suppression alone probably does not improve respiratory symptoms and may predispose to respiratory infection.

- Fundoplication has a limited role in patients with TEF because their underlying esophageal dysmotility predisposes to post-fundoplication complications, including esophageal stasis and aspiration. However, fundoplication may be considered in patients with poorly controlled GERD despite maximal PPI therapy, long-term dependency on transpyloric feeding, or cyanotic spells due to GERD. Eosinophilic esophagitis should be excluded before proceeding to fundoplication.
