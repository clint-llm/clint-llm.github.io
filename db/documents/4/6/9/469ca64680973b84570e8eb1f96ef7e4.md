Medication overuse headache has a true prevalence that is unknown, partly resulting from various changes in diagnostic criteria, but estimates are in the range of 0.5 to 2.6% in the general population. Higher rates have been reported in Russia (7.6%) and Iran (4.6%), places where it is felt that medication overuse is more prevalent.

- Opioids, butalbital-containing combination analgesics, and acetaminophen-aspirin-caffeineÂ combinations

- Triptans
