Generally, a significant decline of type II, but not type I muscle fibers are observed in sarcopenic patients.

- Age-related declines in anabolic hormone serum concentrations: Normal physiological serum levels of anabolic hormones such as testosterone, human growth hormone (HGH), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) have been demonstrated to function in the development, maintenance, or rejuvenation of muscle tissue.

- Insulin resistance with “sarcopenic obesity”: Aging patients often experience changes in body composition represented by increased adipose tissue alongside decreased muscle mass, coined as “sarcopenic obesity.”

- Age-related neurodegeneration: Progressive neurodegeneration is a commonly observed phenomenon in aging populations.

- Age-related increase in inflammatory markers**:**Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1 are observed in elderly populations.
