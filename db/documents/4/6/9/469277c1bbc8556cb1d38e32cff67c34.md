Body lice infestations can involve thousands of mites, each biting an average of 5 times per day. During feeding, body lice pierce the skin, inject a salivary anticoagulant, and then suck the blood meal into their digestive tract. Bites of the body louse can produce a variety of skin lesions, and severe pruritus thought to be due to an allergic and/or inflammatory reaction to the louse saliva.

The greatest medical impact of body lice is their ability to transmit bacterial diseases, most notably trench fever caused by Bartonella quintana, relapsing fever caused by Borrelia recurrentis, and epidemic (louse-borne) typhus caused by Rickettsia prowazekii. Rickettsia prowazekii can also occur through inhalation of aerosolized fecal dust, which has been documented as a potential source of infection for clinicians. Unlike trench fever and epidemic typhus, the transmission of relapsing fever, caused by Borrelia recurrentis, does not occur through contaminated feces. Infection occurs when a person crushes an infected louse, and the bacteria then invade the bite site or the skin of the fingers or hand that crushed the louse.

Additional pathogenic bacteria found in body lice include Salmonella typhi, Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter baumannii. The DNA of Yersinia pestis, which causes bubonic plague, has been identified in body lice, and it is believed they may serve as supplementary vectors for the organism.
