Cardiac muscle tissue is only found in the heart. Each myocyte contains a single nucleus and many mitochondria for high energy output. Cardiac muscle is involuntary, striated, and possesses an extensive capillary network. Cardiomyocytes are the individual muscle cells that are organized into sarcomeres and interconnected via intercalated discs. The interconnections allow synchronized contraction of the cardiac myofibrils. Each contraction is initiated by the release of calcium into the cytosol. T-tubules facilitate the conversion of electrical impulses from Purkinje fibers into mechanical contraction, called excitation-contraction coupling, by activating L-type calcium channels to allow calcium into the cytosol. This calcium binds to ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum which induces ventricular contraction.
