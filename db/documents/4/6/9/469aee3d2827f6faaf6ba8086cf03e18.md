Conn syndrome was named after J. W. Conn who first described it in 1955, in a patient who had hypertension with an aldosterone-producing adenoma. The adenoma is characterized by increased aldosterone secretion from the adrenal glands, suppressed plasma renin, hypertension, and hypokalemia. Later, many other cases of adrenal hyperplasia with inappropriately elevated aldosterone secretion were described, and now the term primary hyperaldosteronism is used to describe Conn syndrome irrespective of whether the patient has an adenoma or not.

The diagnosis of Conn syndrome is not always easy but recognition is important as this condition can help cure hypertension with surgical or medical management. However, it is important to distinguish aldosteronoma from idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia. Aldosteronomas are removed surgically, whereas idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia is managed with medications.  At the same time, one as to be aware that there are conditions that cause elevated aldosterone levels including familial disease, aldosterone-producing renin-responsive adenomas. ectopic secretion (from kidneys and ovary) and adrenocortical carcinomas.
