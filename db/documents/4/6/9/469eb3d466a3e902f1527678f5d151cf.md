Appropriate patient history focusses on identifying risk factors for developing abuse as well as identifying patterns that may be concerning for active abuse. A single screening question like “do you feel safe at home” is much less likely to identify abuse than more extensive questioning or screening tools.

Red flags for possible abuse include unexplained or frequent injuries, delay of care following the onset of illness or injury, noncompliance with the medical regimen, and missing follow-up appointments. When an area of concern is identified, it is essential to ask focused questions based on the type of abuse suspected.

The caregiver should leave the room to obtain a history related to abuse.

In the case of an acute visit, it is critical to get a detailed history of the mechanism of injury or events leading up to their visit as the history requires a comparison to exam findings for congruency. Family members and caregivers should not be used as translators in cases when abuse is suspected.

When there is a concern regarding potential abuse, a comprehensive head-to-toe physical exam is necessary.

Exam findings concerning for physical abuse are patterned bruising, bite marks, bruising in different stages of healing, subconjunctival hemorrhages, intraoral injuries, and bruising in suspicious regions like the wrists, the ulnar aspect of the forearms, face, neck, ears, back, abdomen and other nonbony prominences.

Physical signs of neglect include patients who appear malnourished or dehydrated, are wearing dirty clothing, have long toenails or fingernails, and the presence of pressure ulcers.
