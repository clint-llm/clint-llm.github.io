Transient loss of vision is an ophthalmological symptom that instills apprehension in both the minds of the patient and the ophthalmologist. The patient is usually worried about a permanent loss of vision and the physician about a serious underlying condition. The causes are diverse and can include life-threatening conditions like carotid artery disease or cardiac emboli or a relatively benign condition like a migraine.
