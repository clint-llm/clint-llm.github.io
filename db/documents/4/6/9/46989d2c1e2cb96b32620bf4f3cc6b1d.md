The root cause of anterior cord syndrome is ischemia of the anterior spinal artery. Thus, the etiology of anterior cord syndrome is very wide, in that it includes any procedure or disease process that can limit blood flow to this region of the vasculature. The most common cause of anterior cord syndrome is iatrogenic, namely thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Several factors during surgery can contribute to ischemia of the cord, including hypotension, cross-clamping of the aorta, increased spinal canal pressure, and occlusion of arteries feeding the cord.

Other causes include hypotension secondary to other disease processes such as cardiac arrest, atherothrombotic disease, emboli, vasculitis, and other disorders affecting blood vessels, sickle cell and other hypercoagulable diseases, AV malformation, intervertebral disc herniation, and cocaine use.
