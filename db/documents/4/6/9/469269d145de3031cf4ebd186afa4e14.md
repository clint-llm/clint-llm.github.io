- Renal transplant rejections are either acute or chronic, and depending on the immunohistopathology, they are either antibody-mediated rejections or T-cell-mediated rejections.

- Acute rejections usually present as an abrupt onset of allograft dysfunction, while chronic rejections present as a slow allograft dysfunction over time.

- Tissue biopsy is still the key for diagnosis, although donor-derived free DNA detection test is emerging as a noninvasive tool for diagnosing rejections but has not been validated to date.

- Treatment of rejection depends on the type of rejection and is managed with more immunosuppression and optimizing baseline immunosuppressive regimen post-rejection.

- Although many factors are playing a role, patient awareness and education regarding compliance with the anti-rejection medication are still very important for the prevention of rejection.
