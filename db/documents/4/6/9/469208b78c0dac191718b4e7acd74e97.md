Cerebellar examinations are mandatory to diagnose exact etiologies.**An important part of cerebellar examinations:**

- Gaze-evoked nystagmus and hypo- or hypermetric saccadic eye movements: on looking to either side, the fast-phase of nystagmus will be in the direction of gaze, and on the generation of saccadic eye movements, the patient may under- or overshoot, with resultant small corrective saccades.

- Cerebellar ‘staccato’ speech (in music, staccato refers to unconnected or detached notes)

- Upper limb signs of

- intention tremor (tremor that increases in amplitude as a finger approaches the target)
- past-pointing,
- dysmetria and
- dysdiadochokinesis (difficulties with making rapid alternating movements, such as pronation-supination (an early sign may be that the patient moves their hand as if they are turning the pages of a book).

- The finger–nose test should be undertaken slowly and carefully as carrying out the test in a rapid fashion tends to miss early cerebellar signs.

- Rebound phenomenon: the patient is asked to maintain his arms in the outstretched position with eyes closed. Downward pressure is applied to the arms and is released suddenly. In a cerebellar syndrome, the arms will shoot upward when pressure is released and will oscillate before returning to the original position. The cerebellum functions as a calibrator of forces, and dysfunction results in the generation of inappropriate muscle forces to fix the limb in a particular position

- Hypotonia of arms and legs (reduced tone of limbs)

- Look for evidence of a sensory rather than cerebellar ataxia: positive Romberg’s test or pseudoathetosis (apparent writhing of fingers of outstretched hands when eyes are closed, due to proprioceptive impairment). If sensory ataxia is suspected, look for sensory impairment (especially joint position sense) and distal weakness associated with a peripheral sensory or sensorimotor neuropathy.

- Ataxic gait (examination of gait is needed to exclude other gait disorders too )

- Heel–shin ataxia (ask the patient to make a circular movement, with the heel raised off the shin once it has reached the ankle, before placing it on the knee again. Simply gliding one heel up and down the opposite shin will miss early ataxia)

- Truncal ataxia (demonstrable in sitting position or while standing)

- Pendular reflexes: the movement elicited by percussion is not dampened, resulting in swinging back and forth of the limb. Once again, this is due to a failure of calibration of muscle forces, resulting in abnormal ‘dampening.’

A simple mnemonic to remember some of the cerebellar signs is DANISH:

- **D**ysdiadochokinesia/ dysmetria

- **A**taxia

- **N**ystagmus

- **I**ntention tremor

- **S**peech - slurred or scanning

- **H**ypotonia

**Following Examinations are required to find out and correlate the etiology:**

- **Demyelination**: look for evidence of an RAPD (relative afferent pupillary defect), internuclear ophthalmoplegia, or upper motor neuron signs, especially in a young woman.

- **Vascular**: infarction or hemorrhage.

- **Space-occupying lesion**(especially if unilateral or markedly asymmetrical signs, do cranial nerve examination to exclude CP angle tumor).

- **Alcoholic degeneration**(History of alcohol intake with CAGE questionnaire)

- **Drugs:**e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin (gum examination), and barbiturates.

- **Metabolic**: B12, copper, or vitamin E deficiency (may also cause sensory ataxia)

- **Hypothyroidism**(Weight gain, mood, sleep, bowel habit, an association of other autoimmune diseases)

- **Nutritional**: Celiac disease (bowel history and association of other autoimmune diseases)

- **Paraneoplastic**: associated with small cell lung, breast, gynecological and testicular tumors, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Following examinations are relevant: clubbing, lymph nodes on palpation, tar staining, Features of HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) and CLD (chronic liver diseases)

- **Genetic**:
- **Spinocerebellar ataxias:**may have a variety of additional signs, including UMN and extrapyramidal signs, peripheral neuropathy, and ophthalmoplegia of autosomal dominant inheritance.
- **Friedreich ataxia:**ataxia with peripheral neuropathy, spasticity, optic atrophy (fundoscopy), diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and deafness. Typical onset is between 8 to 15 years of age; autosomal recessive inheritance. Patients are frequently wheelchair-bound.
- **Ataxia-telangiectasia**: skin and eye telangiectasia, dystonia and chorea; autosomal recessive inheritance.
- **Von Hippel–Lindau syndrom**e with cerebellar haemangioblastomas (associated with renal cell carcinoma)
- **Multiple system atrophy**with predominant cerebellar features (often referred to as MSA-C)
- Unilateral or bilateral pontocerebellar atrophy and hypoplasia
