The classical physical finding of erythroderma is bright red patches that coalesce to cover almost the entire skin surface, followed by the appearance of a white or yellow scale. The skin may appear glossy and thin, and the patient may complain of tight skin due to progressive lichenification and edema.

Some patients may also present withÂ hair loss and nail findings, including subungual hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, ridging, dry or brittle nails, or nail shedding. Additionally, patients may have evidence of the underlying causal dermatoses, such as psoriasiform plaques in psoriasis or palmoplantar keratoderma in patients with pityriasis rubra pilaris.
