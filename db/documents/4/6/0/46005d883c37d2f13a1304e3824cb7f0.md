The management in patients with holoprosencephaly is symptomatic and requires a multidisciplinary approach. It targets each organ system, and the related complications, individually.

- Epilepsy is a common complication in patients with HPE. A single seizure occurs in around 50% of all HPE children, some of whom may require multidrug antiepileptic therapy.

- Although, ideally, holoprosencephaly presents with microcephaly, when associated with macrocephaly, it would indicate coexisting hydrocephalus. This would have to be immediately treated with shunt surgery while preventing over drainage of CSF.

- Motor anomalies, when present, warrant treatment. Spasticity and dystonia would require pharmacological interventions, including intrathecal baclofen pumps, and oral trihexyphenidyl, along with physical and occupational therapy.

- Orofacial motor dysfunction is compounded by structural anomalies like cleft palate/lip causes aspiration, which further progresses to pneumonia, hence posing a serious challenge for feeding. This can require structural surgical correction.

- The hormone dysregulation caused by the absence of a well-formed hypothalamus can manifest as pituitary hormone deficiencies, most commonly diabetes insipidus. The manifestation of other hormonal deficits is rare. However, prednisone, thyroxine, and growth hormone supplements may be required in people with overt symptoms of deficiency.

- Poor nerve migration to the gastrointestinal tract causes poor gastric and colonic motility and gastroesophageal reflux. This can be managed by placement of a gastrostomy tube in very severe facial defects, sometimes indicating medications and anti-reflux procedures in isolated severe GERD.
