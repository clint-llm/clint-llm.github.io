When correcting aphakia during critical phases of visual development, the top priority is the prevention of amblyopia. Providers must remain mindful of patients in these vulnerable stages to ensure that refractive choices and amblyopia therapies are aggressive enough to improve or maintain vision. If there is an incomplete correction of aphakia, patients might experience a permanent loss of depth perception; this could increase the likelihood of accidents.

**Eyeglasses**

- High-powered lenses create magnification of eyes and face, possibly impacting self-image

- Reduced peripheral vision

- Prismatic effect off-axis

**Contact Lenses**

- Lost or broken lenses

- Hyperemia

- Superficial punctate keratitis

- Contact lens-induced red eyes

- Microbial keratitis

- Contact lens dropout due to challenges applying or removing lenses, cost, or adherence to the schedule

**IOL Implantation (lists are not exhaustive)**

- **Pediatric**
- More surgeries
- Lens reproliferation
- Pupillary membranes
- Corectopia

- **Adult/Pediatric**
- IOL decentration, tilt, or dislocation
- Pupillary optic capture
- Suture or haptic erosion 
- Corneal edema
- Chronic uveitis
- Cystoid macular edema
- Endophthalmitis

- **No Correction or Poor Visual Outcomes**
- Amblyopia
- Suppression 
- Sensory tropia 
- Worse quality of life
