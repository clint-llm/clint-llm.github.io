The mean arterial pressure (MAP) calculates as the product of cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Of these three parameters, CO and SV change dynamically with blood pressure being the regulated variable. This is because there must be enough blood pressure to force blood around the circulatory system and perfuse the tissues.

- MAP = CO x SVR

When cardiac output decreases, for example, during an acute myocardial infarction, systemic vascular resistance must increase to maintain a relatively normal mean arterial pressure. As the cardiac output is the product of heart rate and stroke volume, both these parameters may be manipulated to maintain adequate perfusion and match the body's global metabolic needs.

There are three variables affecting stroke volume, which include contractility, preload, and afterload.
