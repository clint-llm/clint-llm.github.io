Tremors are the most common movement disorder, and essential tremor is the most common neurologic cause of postural or action tremor. It usually presents as a bilateral postural 6 to 12 Hz tremor of the hands. Although essential tremor is benign, it often causes embarrassment and, in a small percentage of patients, serious disability. Symptoms are typically progressive and potentially disabling, often forcing patients to change jobs or seek early retirement. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of essential tremors. It highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of essential tremor.
- Describe how essential tremor can impact a patient's livelihood. 
- Summarize the management strategies for essential tremor. 
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by essential tremor.
