Conventional hearing aid devices have historically been used as the main auditory rehabilitation tool in a patient with hearing loss. However, most patients have trouble adjusting to a medical device in or behind the ear. An osseointegrated bone prosthesis is a surgically implanted hearing aid in the skull that eliminates nonideal features of conventional hearing aids. This activity outlines the indications and contraindications for an osseointegrated bone conductive prosthesis in a patient with hearing loss and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in managing patients with osseointegrated bone prostheses.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomy of the outer, middle, and inner ear. 
- Outline surgical steps for implantation of osseointegrated bone conduction prosthesis at the temporal bone.
- Identify clinical and audiometric criteria required to undergo an osseointegrated bone conduction prosthesis implant.
