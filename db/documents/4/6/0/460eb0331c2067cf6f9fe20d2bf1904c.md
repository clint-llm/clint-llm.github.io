Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin used by the body for normal bone development and maintenance by increasing the absorption of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. A circulating level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D greater than 30 ng/mL is required to maintain a healthy level of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to an array of problems, most notably rickets in children and osteoporosis in adults. The fortification of milk with vitamin D in the 1930s was effective in eradicating rickets in the world. However, vitamin D deficiency is now more prevalent than ever and should be screened in high-risk populations. Many conflicting studies are now showing an association between vitamin D deficiency and cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and depression. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of vitamin D deficiency and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of vitamin D deficiency.
- Discuss the pathophysiology and epidemiology of vitamin D deficiency.
- Review evaluation and management of vitamin D deficiency.
- Outline the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients with vitamin D deficiency.
