Contraindications to procaine include hypersensitivity to procaine or other ester group local anesthetics, PABA, metabolic derivatives of PABA, or to other components of the pharmaceutical suspension. Spinal anesthesia with procaine is contraindicated in cases of septicemia and cerebrospinal diseases such as syphilis and meningitis. Currently, no evidence suggests that procaine is carcinogenic, mutagenic, or gonadotoxic.
