In addition to the proceduralist performing the biopsy, several other healthcare practitioners perform critical functions during the procedure. These include:

- A nurse trained in conscious sedation, nurse anesthetist, and/or anesthesiologist to administer conscious sedation and monitor vital signs.

- A technologist to assist with the equipment.

- A cytotechnologist or pathologist to assess the adequacy of specimens (rapid on site evaluation (ROSE)) and to ensure that specimens are deposited in the most appropriate preservatives for the laboratory tests that best address the clinical scenario.
