The mesoderm develops during the third week following the gastrulation process. In the third week, the paraxial mesodermal layer begins to organize into segments called somitomeres. These consist of concentric layers of mesodermal cells formed with cranial to caudal progression. Subsequently, they organize in somites. The somites appear with a frequency of about three pairs a day so that at the fifth week are recognizable 42 to 44 pairs of somites, of which there are four occipital pairs, seven cervical, twelve thoracic, five lumbar, five sacral, and between eight and ten coccyx pairs.

The triceps brachii begins to develop during the fifth week of embryogenesis. The muscle originates from the dorsal muscle mass of the upper limb bud and is derived from the paraxial mesodermal leaflet.
