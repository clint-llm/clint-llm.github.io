Lumbosacral discogenic syndrome is a common cause of axial low back pain (ALBP) which can arise from structures such as facet joints, spinal muscles, and ligaments. Low back pain (ALBP) is a major clinical and socioeconomic burden in the global health sector. To help reduce the socioeconomic burden associated with this condition, it must be appropriately diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of lumbosacral discogenic syndrome and highlights the role of the inter-professional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of lumbosacral discogenic syndrome.
- Explain the pathophysiology of lumbosacral discogenic syndrome.
- Review management options available for lumbosacral discogenic syndrome.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination and the delivery of care for patients affected by lumbosacral discogenic syndrome.
