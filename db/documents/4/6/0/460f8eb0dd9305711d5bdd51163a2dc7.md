Approximately 90 percent of the population will present with low back pain at some point in their lifetime. Spinal stenosis is a condition that is caused by the narrowing of the central canal, the lateral recess, or neural foramen. It can cause significant discomfort, interfere with activities of daily living, and in some cases, may result in progressive disability. This activity reviews the evaluation and effective management of symptomatic lumbar canal stenosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in utilizing clinical and radiological markers to formulate appropriate therapeutic protocols.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of lumbar stenosis.
- Identify the region of the lumbar spine most commonly affected by lumbar stenosis. 
- Summarize the differential diagnosis for lumbar stenosis. 
- Explain the need for a well-integrated, interprofessional team approach to improve care for patients with lumbar stenosis.
