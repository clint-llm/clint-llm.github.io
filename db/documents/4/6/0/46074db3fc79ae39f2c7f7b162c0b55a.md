**Angiography**

After preparing the access site for approach, usually the groin for the femoral artery approach, an introducer needle is inserted in the artery. A guidewire is passed, and the needle is withdrawn. Once the access is gained, a "sheath introducer" is inserted over the guidewire, which helps to keep the artery open. A sheath is then inserted through the sheath introducer. The sheaths are flexible hollow tubes used to introduce different catheters. Different types of sheaths are used to access different locations like right and left coronary arteries and left ventricle. With X-ray fluoroscopy, contrast material is introduced in the coronary artery to delineate its anatomy. Stenosis or occlusion of the coronary artery is then visualized, and severity is estimated through pictures at different angles. If stenosis or occlusion is located, the cardiologist then introduces a guidewire through the catheter and positions the tip of the wire distal to the stenosis in the artery. This guidewire is then used to introduce the balloon or stent catheter over it for angioplasty or stent placement, respectively. For stent placement, the catheter has the stent positioned over the balloon, and once in the right location, the balloon can be expanded, which stretches the stent open over the balloon. The catheter can then be withdrawn. Images are taken to confirm the proper location of the stent and resolution of stenosis.

Percutaneous coronary intervention

- **Balloon Angioplasty**
- A form of PCI involving the inflation of a balloon inside a coronary artery to open the narrowing. It leads to the disruption of plaque. This procedure is not the primary intervention anymore because, over time, the ballooned artery returns to the stenotic state. It is, however, performed when stent placement is either not possible or will be harmful. It can also be performed as a bridge to CABG or future PCI.

- **Stent Implantation**
- If a coronary stent is required, the catheter containing a stent (over the balloon) is advanced over the guidewire and appropriately positioned in the stenotic segment of the coronary artery; the balloon is then expanded. The stent, which is located over the balloon, expands and deploys in position, relieving the stenosis.
- Stent placement can be done mainly by 2 methods: direct stenting or pre-dilation and stenting. **Pre-dilation**involves dilation of the balloon in the stenosed segment, followed by stent placement. Direct**stenting**involves a low-profile stent delivery system, which can be introduced directly to the lesion, and the stent is deployed without pre-dilation. The efficacy of this approach was best evaluated in a randomized trial of 206 patients with an acute STEMI who underwent primary stenting with or without pre-dilation. Although the incidence of TIMI flow grade 3 and the corrected TIMI frame count was the same with both approaches, the incidence of the composite angiographic endpoint (slow and no-reflow or distal embolization) was significantly lower with direct stenting (12 versus 27 percent with pre-dilation before stenting), and ST-segment resolution was more frequent (80 versus 62 percent).

- **Atherectomy**
- Coronary atherectomy is an invasive procedure to physically remove blockage (atheroma, calcium, or cellular debris) from coronary arteries. It works by cutting the lesions with a cutter, usually a burr or crown. Directional coronary atherectomy and laser atherectomy are two major types of atherectomy. Atherectomy is typically followed by balloon and stent placement. 
- If a calcified segment prevents the delivery of a stent in a blood vessel, atherectomy is useful; however, routine use of atherectomy before stenting has not been shown to improve the outcomes and should be avoided when not required.
- Rotational atherectomy may be infrequently required for internal mammary artery graft stenosis, although common practice is angioplasty.
- Atherectomy is a less favored procedure for saphenous vein graft lesions.
- In patients with diabetes, Angiographic restenosis at 6 months post atherectomy was found to be higher, and this atherectomy should be avoided if not necessary.
- The complications of atherectomy include:

- arterial dissection
- coronary artery perforation
- coronary spasm
- particle embolization

- **Brachytherapy**
- Involves intracoronary irradiation to prevent restenosis of stents. It showed a reduction in-stent restenosis in BMS, but after DESs were introduced, in-stent restenosis has decreased, so did the use of brachytherapy.

- 
**IVUS**
            Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) enables visualization up the coronary artery wall using a mini ager ultrasound transducer at the end of the flexible catheter; it helps in delineating the plaque morphology and distribution and helps in rationalizing the PCI. The benefit of IVUS is in the utility of intra-lumen measurements, which is not possible with coronary angiography as the view taken is usually two-dimensional and does not represent the true lumen diameter accurately because of limitations of contrast enhancement, angle of view, especially in asymmetric narrowing and complex luminal shapes.
            
              
- The routine use of this technology to identify nonobstructive lesions at increased risk was evaluated in a study of 1563 patients with suspected coronary artery disease who underwent cardiac catheterization with possible ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention. The rate of adverse events attributable to the procedure was low. The two-year incidence of non-culprit major adverse cardiovascular events was 9 percent, and NIRS IVUS identified patients and non-culprit segments at high risk for future events.
              
              
- In the ADAPT–DES study in which 813 STEMI patients were enrolled, IVUS use was associated with improved outcomes in STEMI patients.

- **Shockwave Lithotripsy/Lithoplasty**
- This system delivers circumferential, pulsatile mechanical energy to disrupt the calcium deposits within the atherosclerotic lesion. This facilitates stent deployment later.

**PCI in Non-Coronary Vessels**

- **PCI in saphenous vein graft:**Saphenous vein graft is still used in patients undergoing CABG. It usually connects the ascending aorta to the target blood vessel. The rate of complication in saphenous vein graft is historically higher than left internal mammary graft. Multiple studies have shown poor outcomes with saphenous vein grafts in long-term follow-up compared with arterial graft. These grafts would usually require PCI if atherosclerosis is worse. DES is preferred compared to other stents, if possible, based on antiplatelet therapy requirements.

- **PCI in the Left Internal Mammary Vessel:**Left internal mammary artery, which is now preferred as a conduit for CABG, has a better survival rate compared with a saphenous vein graft.  However, when compared after PCI, LIMA had 50% residual stenosis and repeat CABG requirements in the hospital, compared with saphenous vein graft PCI.
