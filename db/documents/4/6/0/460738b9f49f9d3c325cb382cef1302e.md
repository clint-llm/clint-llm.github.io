Patients should seek medical care if they are experiencing pain in the hip, thighs, and/or buttocks. Also, certain patient populations should be advised of the risk factors and screened as needed; since early avascular necrosis of the femoral head can be asymptomatic. Examples of higher-risk patients include those on long-term steroid treatment, long-term bisphosphonates, excessive alcohol use, hemoglobinopathies, chemotherapy or radiation patients, and those who suffer trauma to the hip and surrounding area.
