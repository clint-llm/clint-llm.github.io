The differential diagnosis for hepatic lesions remains broad. Imaging and history will help delineate and focus on more common etiologies; however, some differential disease processes may be primary hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, adenoma, hemangioma, hematoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, abscess, or secondary masses from metastatic disease (carcinoma, lymphoma, sarcoma).
