The incidence and prevalence of NVG vary in different populations and according to various etiological diseases causing NVG. In a tertiary eye hospital in China, the number of NVG cases was found to be 483 (5.8 %) out of the 8306 glaucoma patients seen over a period of 11 years.

The reported proportion of NVG among patients with secondary glaucoma has ranged from 9 to 17.4% in hospital-based studies. Among the eyes with ischemic CRVO, 40 to 45% will develop NVG.

In eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 65% of the eyes develop NVI. In eyes with PDR and NVG in one eye, the risk of development of NVG in the other eye is 33%.

In the Diabetes Control Complications Trial (DCCT), there was an incidence of 24% of NVG over nine years amongst the patients in the standard treatment group compared to 8% of the patients in the intensive treatment group.
