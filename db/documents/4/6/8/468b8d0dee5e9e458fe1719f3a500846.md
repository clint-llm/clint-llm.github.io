**Ring Block**

-  Insert the 1.5-inch needle subcutaneously below the earlobe in line with the external auditory meatus

-  Aspirate before injecting to ensure that vascular injection (specifically the posterior auricular and superficial temporal arteries) does not occur

-  Inject 1 mL of the anesthetic agent into the spot of needle entry

-  Direct the needle behind the ear towards and over the mastoid process 2 to 4 mm deep and advance it parallel to the skin nearly the full length of the needle, and inject approximately 2 mL of anesthetic  as the needle is withdrawn

-  Stop short of taking the needle out of the skin when back to the first position

-  Direct the needle anterior to the external ear towards the area just in front of the tragus, aspirate, then inject another 2 mL as the needle is withdrawn completely

-  Insert the needle subcutaneously directly above the ear again in line with the external auditory canal

-  Repeat steps 2 through 6 but with the needle facing caudally towards and over the mastoid process and immediately anterior to the tragus

At completion, typically, the total amount of local anesthetic is approximately 10 to 12 mL, and the trajectory of the injections will look like a V (for the inferior ear block) and an upside-down V (for a superior ear block) encircling the ear. This technique will often only incompletely anesthetize the external auditory meatus.

**Ultrasound-guided Great Auricular and Lesser Occipital Nerve Block**

- With the linear ultrasound probe in the transverse orientation, place it at the middle of the sternocleidomastoid and track slowly upward towards the earlobe along the posterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid until you see two hypoechoic nerve structures approximately 4 to 5 cm inferior to the ear lobule

- Insert the needle in-plane so that you can visualize the tip of the needle on the screen

- Advance the needle slowly until it is almost at the nerve - do**not**inject it into the nerve

- Aspirate and then inject 1 to 2 mL into the space between the needle tip and the nerve

**NOTE:**To quickly access the great auricular nerve as it courses across the sternocleidomastoid muscle using external topographic landmarks, the great auricular nerve is located at the junction of the upper one-third and lower two-thirds of the muscle between the mastoid process and clavicle.

**NOTE:**To obtain complete anesthesia of the external ear, particularly the superior-medial helix minus the external canal, the clinician will have to perform steps 7 and 8 of the ring block (to include the auriculotemporal nerve distribution) with the great and lesser occipital nerve block.

**NOTE:**The ring block provides analgesia for the external ear, with the exception of the external auditory canal.
