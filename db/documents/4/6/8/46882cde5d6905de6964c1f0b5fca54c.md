By 9 weeks gestational age, the MCL begins to develop as a condensation of the joint capsule. A week earlier, in week 8, the fibular collateral ligament, or lateral collateral ligament (LCL), begins to develop independently of the knee capsule. The entire knee joint is fully developed by 14 weeks gestational age.
