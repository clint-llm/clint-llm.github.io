Most recent studies estimate that approximately 20,000 children suffer a cardiac arrest in the United States alone, with around 7,000 occurring outside of the hospital setting in 2015. The majority of out-of-hospital arrests tend to be respiratory in nature while in-hospital arrests have a higher proportion of cardiogenic causes due to the concentration of these rarer pathologies in a centralized location. However, nearly 40% of in-hospital arrests survived to be discharged, around 11% of out-of-hospital arrests achieved the same outcome. This correlates with adult data where prolonged time without spontaneous circulation results in poor outcomes and emphasizes all medical personnel being familiar with the best evidence-based practices for this population.
