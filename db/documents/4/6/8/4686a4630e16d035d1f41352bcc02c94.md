**Sarcoma:**Prognosis is heavily dependent on the tumor's location, size, and resectability based on surrounding structures, with average five-year survival rates of approximately 80% if the lesions are resectable.

**Adenocarcinoma**: Prognosis is dependent on staging. Overall, small bowel adenocarcinoma has been found to have higher mortality rates than equivalent staged colon cancers.

Patients with small bowel adenocarcinoma are often complicated with local tumoral effects, including duodenal obstruction and crampy abdominal pain in duodenal and Jujeno-ileal adenocarcinoma, respectively. Another complication in small bowel adenocarcinoma, which occurs in up to one-third of patients, is occult gastrointestinal bleeding.

**Neuroendocrine tumors:**Prognosis of neuroendocrine tumors is often more complex than other gastrointestinal malignant lesions as it is also dependent on the tumor burden, type of product secreted, evidence of carcinoid syndrome vs. no carcinoid syndrome, and extent of nodal involvement/distal metastasis. Generally, tumors without evidence of carcinoid syndrome carry high survival rates, at times up to 90%.

**Lymphoma:**Prognosis and evaluation of follow-up and surveillance are generally under the guidance of the Ann Arbor staging scale. Resectable lesions carry high survival rates. However, the overall prognosis is affected and noted to be variable due to high rates of recurrence.
