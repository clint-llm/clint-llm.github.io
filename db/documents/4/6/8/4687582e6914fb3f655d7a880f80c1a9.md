The function of the pectoralis major is 3-fold and dependent on which heads of muscles are involved.

- Flexion, adduction and medial rotation of the arm at the glenohumeral joint

- Clavicular head causes flexion of the extended arm

- Sternoclavicular head causes extension of the flexed arm

The pectoralis major shows variation in muscle fiber length, differing from the majority of muscle fibers in the human body, which usually show uniform length. This configuration of the muscle fibers potentially allows for more power production through differing muscle shortening velocities.
