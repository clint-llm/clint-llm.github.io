Patients who are pregnant or allergic to the Tc-99m radioactive tracer should not undergo a liver/spleen test. The risks - particularly of exposure to ionizing radiation - benefits, and alternatives to the liver/spleen scan, should be explained in layman’s terms to the patient. Informed and written consent should then be obtained from the patient or the patient’s surrogate decision-maker.

There is no specific prep for the test. A time-out including the patient’s name, date-of-birth, description of the procedure being performed, medications, and allergies should be completed before the start of the procedure. The patient should be informed before the study of the need to inject radioactive tracer and to lay still during the study. The minimum possible amount of radioactive tracer should be injected into the patient’s veins to limit the patient’s exposure to radiation.
