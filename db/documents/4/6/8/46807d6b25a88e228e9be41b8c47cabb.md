Electrolyte imbalance from refeedingÂ syndrome can result in several complications. As outlined in Table 1 for the main electrolyte imbalances, Potassium imbalances can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, QT prolongation weakness, fatigue, paralysis, respiratory distress. Phosphorus can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, decreased 2,3 DPG production, decreased respiratory muscle function. Magnesium can lead to ataxia, vertigo, paresthesia, convulsions, depression, QT prolongation. Thiamine deficiency can lead to cardiac dysfunction, Wernicke, and Korsakoff syndrome.
