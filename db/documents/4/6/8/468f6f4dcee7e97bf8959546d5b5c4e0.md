**Sodium Hyaluronate**

It is a salt derivative of hyaluronic acid and is present in the connective tissue of bacteria and humans. In homo sapiens, it is found in skin, synovial fluid, and vitreous humor. Sodium hyaluronate was first extracted from the vitreous humor of cows, and Mayer and Palmer named it because it is derived from hyaloids and contains uronic acid. The commercially available formulation is extracted from rooster coombs or streptococcal bacterial culture. Sodium hyaluronate is a long-chain mucopolysaccharide chain with a molecular weight of 2.5 to 4 million Daltons. The viscosity ranges from 100000 to 30000 centipoise with a half-life of 1 day in aqueous and three days in vitreous. The characteristic properties of sodium hyaluronate are sterile, noninflammatory, non-toxic, nonantigenic, and nonpyrogenic.

**Chondroitin Sulphate**

The physical and chemical characteristics of chondroitin sulfate are similar to sodium hyaluronate. The structure of chondroitin sulfate differs by a sulfated group and double negative charge for every subunit. Commercially available choroid tin sulfate is derived from shark cartilage. It is found in the cornea as one of the three major mucopolysaccharides.

**Various Preparations of Chondroitin Sulphate**

**Isolated Chondroitin Sulphate (20%)**

It is a low viscosity preparation and not a space maintainer; instead helps in surface protection. The viscosity can be increased as 50% solution, but this formulation can cause damage to the corneal endothelium.

**Chondroitin Sulphate and Sodium Hyaluronate**

It is more viscous and has a better coating ability.

**Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC)**

HPMC is cellulose-derived and extracted from plant fibers like cotton and wood. It is not found in animal tissues. The viscosity of HPMC is 3000 to 4000 centipoise. It is less viscous and lacks the properties of a complete viscoelastic. The molecular weight is 86000; pH is 7.2, and osmolarity of 285 milliosmoles. It is sterilized by autoclaving and has a shelf life of 2 years at room temperature.
