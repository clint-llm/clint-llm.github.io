While bilomas mostly occur following iatrogenic or traumatic disruption of the biliary tree, and patients should be counseled regarding the symptoms and signs that may indicate biloma formation following possible traumatic or iatrogenic damage to the biliary tree. Both patients and physicians should be aware of the possibility of biloma formation in any patients presenting with non-specific abdominal symptoms following trauma or procedures involving the biliary tree. This should include any delay to the expected recovery following procedures such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Prompt investigation and management of bilomas improve patient morbidity and mortality.
