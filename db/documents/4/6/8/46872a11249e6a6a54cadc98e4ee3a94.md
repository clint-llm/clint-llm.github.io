The pneumococcal vaccine is safe and effective and can help reduce the risk of infection with certain types of pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. The CDC suggests shared clinical decision-making between patients and clinicians as it has been shown to increase vaccination rates among adults.

Pediatricians and primary care physicians should prescribe the age-appropriate vaccine according to the latest recommendations of the CDC and ACIP. In the event of anaphylaxis, emergency medicine physicians should rapidly stabilize the patients. All healthcare team members must also ensure the patient's medical record is updated to reflect the most recent vaccine administration, especially since clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists can all administer the vaccine in most states. This integrated teamwork and information sharing will help drive improved patient outcomes related to pneumococcal vaccination. Over the years, the vaccine has proven to be safe and effective.
