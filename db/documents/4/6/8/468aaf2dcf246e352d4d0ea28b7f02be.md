- In diving, descending injuries include squeezes; ascending injuries include POPS or AGE.

- On resurfacing and immediate symptoms: AGE

- Delayed symptoms 1 to 6 hours: DCS

- Lower tidal volumes and plateau pressures can largely prevent pulmonary barotrauma during mechanical ventilation.

- Due to the major change in density between air and water, the largest increase (delta) in pressure occurs as the diver enters the water and begins descent. Most squeeze symptoms occur close to the surface on the descent.

- In diving, descending injuries include the squeezes whereas ascending injuries are more likely to include POPS which can lead to AGE.

- On resurfacing and immediate symptoms: AGE

- Delayed symptoms of 1 to 6 hours: Usually not barotrauma and more likely DCS

- Flying too soon after diving can precipitate DCS.

- Absolute contraindications to diving include spontaneous pneumothorax, acute asthma with abnormal PFTs, cystic or cavitary lung disease, obstructive or restrictive lung disease, seizures, atrial septal defect (ASD), symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic perforated TM, inability to equalize sinus or middle ear pressure, or intraorbital gas.
