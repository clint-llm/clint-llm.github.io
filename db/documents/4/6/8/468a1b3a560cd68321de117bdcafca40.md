With postpartum endometritis, the rupture of the amniotic membranes allows the translocation of normal bacterial flora from the cervix and vagina to the usually aseptic uterus. This bacteria is more likely to colonize uterine tissue that has been devitalized, bleeding, or otherwise damaged (such as during a cesarean delivery). This bacteria can then invade the endometrium, myometrium, and perimetrium, causing inflammation and infection.

Acute endometritis associated with PID is due to ascending infection of the cervix, most often by Chlamydia trachomatis. Endocervical infections disrupt the barrier functions of the endocervical canal, allowing the infection to ascend.

Chronic endometritis is characterized by endometrial infection leading to an immune response and chronic inflammation, with significant infiltrates of endometrial stromal plasmacytes (ESPCs) and the development of micropolyposis.
