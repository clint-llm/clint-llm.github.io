Urine or serum toxicology screening may be helpful for patients unwilling or unable to provide a cogent history regarding their substance use. Full electrolyte panel, serum lactate, BUN/creatinine, creatine phosphokinase, coagulation factors, thyroid function tests, and hepatic enzymes should all be checked. An electrocardiogram is helpful in tachycardic patients for rhythm identification and associated ischemia. X-ray imaging helps rule out associated trauma, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or pneumonia. CT imaging may be considered for potential strokes, vascular dissections, and intra-abdominal or intra-thoracic pathology.
