The initial step, after a clinician has identified the clinical features of infantile spasms as above, is to perform electroencephalography (EEG). The EEG should get a full sleep-wake cycle and a full ictal event, best obtained with an overnight inpatient 24-hour video EEG. If the diagnosis is not clear on the initial EEG, repeat or prolonged monitoring can be performed 1 to 2 weeks after the initial study.

After an EEG shows findings suggestive of IS, neuroimaging is the next diagnostic test that should be pursued. The etiology of IS is established in 70% of cases with neuroimaging. The imaging of choice, with the highest sensitivity, is MRI and should be the initial scanning method.

After clinical evaluation, EEG and MRI are obtained, and if there is no obvious cause of IS, then further metabolic and genetic testing should be obtained.

To further evaluate the metabolic etiologies of IS one should obtain studies such as pyridoxine challenge, urine for organic acids, serum lactate and amino acids, biotinidase determination, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis of neurotransmitters, lactic acid, amino acids, folate metabolites, glucose and glycine, and lastly, chromosomal studies.

The initial genetic testing of choice would include an epilepsy gene panel. If after thorough metabolic evaluation as well as the epilepsy gene panel no apparent cause of IS is identified then whole-exome sequencing should be considered.
