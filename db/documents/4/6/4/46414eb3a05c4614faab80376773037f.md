In 1985, the United States Congress passed the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act (COBRA), which encompasses many health insurance program regulations. This act encompasses mandates on private pension plans, disability insurance, group health plans, and emergency medical treatment. The focus of this article is on the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA).

Congress passed the EMTALA in 1986, and it guarantees non-discriminatory access to emergency medical care.

EMC is listed as: “a condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in placing the individual’s health [or the health of an unborn child] in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of bodily organs.”
