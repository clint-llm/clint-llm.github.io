SGH lesions can be isolated or multiple, present mainly on the face or less frequently on other parts of the body as soft yellow papules. On physical examination, the papules show a central umbilication and branching vessels, especially if examined using a dermatoscope. A biopsy may be necessary to rule out basal cell carcinoma.

Rare variants of SGH include a linear form, zosteriform arrangement, a diffuse form, a giant form, a nevoid form, and a familial form.
