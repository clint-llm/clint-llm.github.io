Important dermatomes include the xiphoid process at T6, the umbilicus at T10, and the umbilical fold at L1.

The skin and muscles of the abdominal wall receive their innervation by the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of the thoracoabdominal nerves (T7-T11), the subcostal nerve (T12), the iliohypogastric nerve (L1, sensation to the suprapubic region), and the ilioinguinal nerve (L1, sensation to the ipsilateral medial thigh and scrotum).

Viscerally, the vagus nerve serves to parasympathetically innervate the vast majority of the gastrointestinal tract to include the foregut and midgut. The hindgutÂ receives parasympathetic input from the sacral roots S2, S3, and S4.

- The foregut receives sympathetic innervation from the greater thoracic splanchnic nerve.

- The midgut receives sympathetic innervation from the lesser thoracic splanchnic nerve.

- The hindgut receives sympathetic innervation from the lumbar splanchnic nerves.

It is important to note that the visceral peritoneum and the underlying organs are insensitive to touch, temperature, or laceration, but rather perceive pain through stretch and chemical receptors. Due to the innervation of the organs, pain is poorly localized and refers to the dermatomes of the spinal ganglia that provide the sensory fibers. Consequently, foregut pain is usually referred to the epigastrium, midgut to the umbilicus, and hindgut to the pubic region.
