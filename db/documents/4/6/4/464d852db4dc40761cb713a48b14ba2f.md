The mean length of a cartilaginous lesion may hint at its classification and diagnosis. The length of the typical enchondroma is classically less than 5 centimeters, while the mean length of a chondrosarcoma is greater than 5 centimeters. This measurement should not serve as the only diagnostic feature, however. Larger lesions should not be considered suspicious solely based on length if no other concerning features are present. These lesions may be labeled as enchondromas without the necessitation of further workup. Notably, chondrosarcoma lesions may present with a smaller mean diameter in the fibula.
