Food allergy classifies as a type I IgE mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Initial sensitization to peanuts stimulates the production of peanut-specific IgE antibodies. The major peanut antigens identified by the specific antibodies response include AraH1, H2, H3. In a sensitized individual, peanut ingestion can trigger specific IgE antibody cross-linking to IgE receptors on effector cells such as basophils and mast cells, which triggers mediator release such as histamine and a variety of cytokines and chemokines. Inflammatory cell recruitment ensues to propagate the allergic response.

The allergy to peanuts is due to low molecular weight proteins that are resistant to heat, proteases, and denaturants. Eleven peanut allergens have been described (Ara h 1-11).
