After the acute phase of the illness, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) patients tend to do well. More than 80% achieve independent ambulation after 6 months.

Studies to assess whether plasma exchange followed by IVIG would have an additional benefit were not significant.

Other clinical features have been shown to predict the need for ventilation during the illness. These include fulminant course (onset to admission less than 7 days), bulbar weakness, and neck flexion weakness. These predictive factors would suggest triage to an intensive care unit rather than a step-down unit.

Following recovery, patients may continue to contend with residual fatigue, pain, and paresthesias for up to several years. [Evidence level 3]
