Complete neuro-ophthalmological history should be obtained emphasizing the onset of visual loss (typically sudden in NAION and semi-acute in optic neuritis) and any other associated symptoms (about 10-15% of patients with NAION experience pain in and around the eye but not with eye movements as is typical in optic neuritis).

Typically there usually aren't any other accompanying neurological symptoms.

**Medications**history with specific attention to the use of PD-5 inhibitors and anti-hypertensive medications, especially the use of these medications at night, as well as the use of amiodarone, which can be associated with the anterior optic neuropathy whose presentation can be similar to NAION.

A complete examination should be performed.

- **Visual acuity**can vary from 20/15 to no light perception, although very poor vision (hand motions or worse) is not common in NAION.

- **The relative afferent pupillary defect**should be present in all patients at presentation. All patients must have optic nerve head edema at the time of presentation, which can persist for 4-6 weeks after onset, and while it is present visual acuity can continue to decline due to the compartment syndrome effect.

- **Formal visual fields**should be performed in each eye: field abnormalities are typically nerve fiber bundle defects with altitudinal defects being particularly common, possibly because of the proposed semicircle organization of short posterior ciliary arteries supplying the optic nerve head.

- **PeripapillaryÂ optical coherence tomography**would invariably demonstrate thickening of the retinal nerve fiber layer. The presence of the so-called "disc at risk," cup to disc ratio of 0.2 or less in the fellow eye, is seen in over 95% of patients with NAION, and if it is not present, the diagnosis should be questioned.
