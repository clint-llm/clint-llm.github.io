Evaluation should include a good history taking. Lab work should consist of serum electrolytes, serum osmolality, 24-hour urine volume, urine electrolytes, and urine osmolality. Imaging studies to be considered are CT or MRI of the brain if need be, to rule out pathological causes. Inquiry into lifestyle also should be made to elicit a history of alcohol intake and total fluid intake.
