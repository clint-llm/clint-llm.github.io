Lateral humeral condyle fractures are a common injury in the pediatric population. Due to its traumatic etiology, thorough assessment and imaging are crucial to deciding on management. The Weiss classification and Song classification schemes are two of the various systems used to categorize these fractures and help in treatment planning and decision-making. In summary, a cutoff of 2 mm displacement can be an option when determining conservative or surgical management. Closed reduction and internal pinning with two Kirschner wires is the recommendation when performing surgery, and closed reduction is possible. Weiss type 3 and Song stage 5 fractures require open reduction and internal fixation. Non-union, avascular necrosis, and several other complications can occur. Immobilization will generally be for a period of 4 to 6 weeks. Recovery of the elbow arc of motion will occur up to a year post-injury.
