Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is the most commonly transmitted tick-borne infection in the United States and among the most frequently diagnosed tick-borne infections worldwide. Lyme disease is divided into three stages: early localized, early disseminated, and late. The early localized disease is distinguished by the red ring-like expanding rash of Erythema migrans at the site of a recent tick bite. Other symptoms experienced at this stage may be flu-like symptoms, malaise, headache, fever, myalgia, and arthralgia. Most patients only experience the symptoms of early, localized disease. About 20% of patients develop the early disseminated disease, with the most common symptoms being multiple erythema migrans lesions. Other symptoms of the disseminated stage are flu-like symptoms, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, myalgia, palsies of the cranial nerves (especially CN-VII), ophthalmic conditions, and lymphocytic meningitis. Additionally, cardiac manifestations such as conduction abnormalities, myocarditis, or pericarditis may occur. The most common manifestation of the late disease is arthritis which is usually pauciarticular and affects large joints, especially the knees.

The diagnosis is not always easy, as many patients are not able to recall a tick bite. However, in endemic areas, patients who have the typical rash can be started on treatment without waiting for serology.
