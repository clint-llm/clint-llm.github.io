Recent evidence suggests that many men diagnosed with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome may actually have interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome as the symptoms are very similar, and each is a diagnosis of exclusion. Men diagnosed with CP/CPPS who fail to respond to the standard therapy for prostatitis and continue to have symptoms, including frequency, painful bladder filling, suprapubic discomfort, dysuria, urgency, or pelvic discomfort, should be considered for treatment of IC/BPS.

Pudendal neuralgia and nerve compression should also be considered when dealing with patients with IC/BPS symptoms, especially for those who are unresponsive to conservative, oral, and intravesical therapies.

While there is no standard intravesical cocktail, several noted experts have published their own personal recipes.
