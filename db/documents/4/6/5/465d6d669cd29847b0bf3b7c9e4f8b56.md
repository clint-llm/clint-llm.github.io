Pemphigus herpetiformis accounts for 6% to 7.3% among patients with pemphigus. Since the first description in 1975 by Jablonska and others, approximatively 100 cases have been reported in the literature. It equally affects men and women. The age of onset ranges from 5 to 92 years. Only four pediatric patients have been reported. Pemphigus herpetiformis does not appear to have a specific ethnic predominance since it has been reported from different continents including America, Europe, Asia, and Africa.
