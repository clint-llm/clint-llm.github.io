While trauma is often a matter of chance, preventative and cautionary methods can reduce both the incidence and severity of traumatic injuries that do occur. In all children, this includes strict vigilance and screening for risk of child abuse or unsafe living environments. In older children and adolescents, this expands to include screening for risks of self-harm, intimate partner violence, and involvement in hazardous activities. Similarly, patients of all ages benefit in terms of reduced mortality and morbidity when appropriate vehicle safety restraints are utilized.
