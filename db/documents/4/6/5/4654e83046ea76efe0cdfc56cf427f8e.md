Trihexyphenidyl works as an anticholinergic used for the treatment of tremors, spasms, stiffness, and weak muscle control seen in patients with Parkinson disease.

In 2008, there were reports that Iraqi police and soldiers were using trihexyphenidyl for recreational purposes and other prescription drugs. Reportedly the drugs were taken as they seemed to relieve combat stress. Although this could have been the primary cause for use in some, some were also seen as a substitute or a more potent version of LSD by some users. Trihexyphenidyl is used off-label to manage dystonia in patients with cerebral palsy.
