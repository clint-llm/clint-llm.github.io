A retrograde cardioplegia catheter is needed to provide retrograde cardioplegia.  These catheters come in a variety of forms.  They can be placed percutaneously (typically through a right internal jugular sheath) or via a right atriotomy by the surgeon. The catheter has an infusion port for the cardioplegia solution, a manometer to transduce pressures in the coronary sinus, and a balloon to occlude the coronary sinus to ensure that the cardioplegia runs retrograde.
