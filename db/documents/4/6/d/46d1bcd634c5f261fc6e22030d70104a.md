Hypersensitivity is a contraindication for any substance, including B2 agonists and beta-blockers. B2 agonists require caution for patients with arrhythmias and cardiac problems. Hypokalemia is a contraindication for B2 agonists because it may lead to increased severity of the condition. Beta-blockers are not recommended for patients with bronchoconstrictive diseases such as asthma and COPD. They should be given with care to diabetic patients as it may increase the risk of hypoglycemic comas.
