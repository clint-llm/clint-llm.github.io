An interprofessional team of specialists includes a pediatric neurosurgeon, plastic surgeon, craniofacial surgeon, pediatric anesthesiologist, and a pediatric intensivist that must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to evaluate and manage patients with metopic craniosynostosis can improve outcomes. Nursing staff round out the interprofessional team. Patients with suspected premature closure of the metopic suture should be closely followed to make an early diagnosis and avoid delays that may cause neurodevelopmental delay and later psychosocial impact on the child. Pediatricians should refer to these patients early for evaluation and possible therapy.

Referrals do not need to include radiographic studies, as these should be ordered by the specialist if necessary. Nurses can assist in assessment, perform patient counseling, and help coordinate activities of the various clinical specialties. Open communication lines between all care team members are crucial to a properly functioning interprofessional management approach, leading to improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]
