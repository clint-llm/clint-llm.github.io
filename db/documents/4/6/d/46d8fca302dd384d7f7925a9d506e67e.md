Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). It selectively binds to estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, ovary, endometrium, cervix and produces estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects. It also acts as a partial estrogen agonist in the hypothalamus resulting in an estrogenic negative feedback inhibition, thus increasing gonadotropins.
