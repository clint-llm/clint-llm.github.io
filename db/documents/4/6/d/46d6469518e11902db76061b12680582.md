Clear cell acanthomas are considered to be benign lesions. The lesions slowly enlarge over several years and do persist. There has been only one case report, by Garcia-Gavin et al.,Â where spontaneous regression of lesions occurred. This scenario took place in a patient with multiple eruptive lesions, several of which spontaneously regressed leaving behind residual post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
