Osteoblastoma is ideally managed by an interprofessional team that consists of orthopedists, radiologists, and pathologists. Multidisciplinary conferences which allow for correlation between gross, radiographic, and microscopic features of the lesion are crucial to establishing the definitive diagnosis of osteoblastoma, ensuring timely and appropriate treatment. Postoperatively, patients may require physical therapy depending on the location of the lesion and the extent of surgical treatment, as well as long-term follow-up due to the possibility of tumor recurrence. Initially, follow-up is performed by the orthopedic oncology team; however, since recurrence is rare beyond two years, patients can be followed by primary care after two years with an orthopedic referral for any new symptoms. This interpr4ofessional approach will result in improved patient outcomes with appropriate vigilance for recurrence. [Level 5]
