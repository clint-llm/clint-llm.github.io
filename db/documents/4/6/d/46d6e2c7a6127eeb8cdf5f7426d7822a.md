If the presentation is with an incidentally detected adnexal mass, the differential diagnosis should consider pelvic masses from gastrointestinal or genitourinary organs or retroperitoneal masses or cysts. Differential diagnosis of patients with adnexal mass and abnormal uterine bleeding include benign pathologies like uterine fibroid/polyp and malignant causes like uterine cancer with ovarian metastases or epithelial ovarian cancer with metastases to endometrium or a synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer. When patients present with a pelvic mass and endocrine abnormalities a polycystic ovary syndrome and adrenal tumors have to be excluded.
