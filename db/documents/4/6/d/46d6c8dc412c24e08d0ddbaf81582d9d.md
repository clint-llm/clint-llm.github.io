In myocardial infarction, the presence of a left bundle branch block alters the conduction system in such a way that makes the ST segments of the electrocardiogram difficult to interpret. The presence of a right bundle branch block does not affect the ST segments in the same way that a left bundle branch block does, and thus does not interfere with the diagnosis of myocardial infarction.

In patients with a left bundle branch block, special care needs to be taken when undergoing a right heart catheterization as there is an increased risk of complete heart block due to the increased risk of iatrogenically induced RBBB.
