The meaning of plagiocephaly is an oblique head.

The International Classification of Diseases defines isolated synostotic plagiocephaly as a form of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis characterized by premature fusion of one coronal or lambdoid suture leading to skull deformity and facial asymmetry. Unilateral coronal synostosis produces anterior plagiocephaly.
