Hernias are abnormal bulges or openings in the fascia of the abdominal wall. These defects can be present in any area of the abdominal wall fascia where there is an anatomic weakening present. Hernias are commonly located on the anterior abdominal wall (umbilical) and groin regions (inguinal, femoral). Hernias are classified as reducible when the hernia contents can be placed intra-abdominally through the layers of the abdominal wall. If the contents of the hernia are not able to be reduced, the hernia is considered incarcerated. A strangulated hernia occurs when the hernia contents are ischemic due to a compromised blood supply. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of strangulated hernias and highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology among the different types of hernias that may become strangulated.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of hernias including strangulated hernias.
- Summarize treatment options available for strangulated hernias.
- Review some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of strangulated hernias.
