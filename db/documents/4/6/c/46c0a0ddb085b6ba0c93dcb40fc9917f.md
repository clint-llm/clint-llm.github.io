The differential diagnosis of nevus sebaceus depends on the stage of development. In early infancy, the differential diagnosis may include aplasia cutis congenita or mastocytoma. Other differential diagnoses in later stages of development include congenital nevus, epidermal nevus, seborrheic keratosis, verruca, and juvenile xanthogranuloma.
