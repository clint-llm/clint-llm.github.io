Managing the airway of the critically ill or injured patient is a core skill in emergency medical care. In addition to difficulties arising from physical or anatomical abnormalities, airway management can be made "situationally difficult" in the prehospital environment in ways that are not seen in the hospital setting due to factors like patient positioning, minimal backup, or poor ambient light. This activity illustrates some special techniques and considerations for airway management in some specific adverse conditions that are particular to the prehospital environment and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in securing good outcomes for patients who require emergency out-of-hospital airway interventions in uncommon circumstances.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomical structures of the airway.
- Review airway management techniques in poor ambient light, atypical patient position, obesity, and minimal backup or suboptimal equipment.
- Identify human factors that act as enablers or barriers for successful airway management.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes in airway management under adverse conditions.
