With a single ventricle, mixed oxygenated blood circulates throughout the body. Depending on the structural anomaly, a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), or communication in the great arteries may be required to maintain pulmonary and systemic circulations. More information about anatomical requirements can be found under each disease's respective chapters.
