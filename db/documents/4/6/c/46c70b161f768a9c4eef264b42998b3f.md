The blood supply for the long flexors of the hand derives from the ulnar artery, the radial artery, and the interosseous arteries. The ulnar artery will provide blood to the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle, the palmaris longus muscle, the flexor carpal radialis muscle, and the flexor carpal ulnaris muscle. The anterior interosseus artery will perfuse the flexor pollicis longus muscle and the flexor digitorum profundus muscle. The ulnar artery will form the superficial palmar arch. The radial artery will form the deep palmar arch. These arterial arches will form anastomoses in the hand. These anastomoses provide collateral perfuse to the long flexors tendons.

The lymphatic drainage of the long flexor of the hands will drain proximally to the cubital fossa. Once the lymph fluid is at the cubital fossa, it will drain back to the axillary lymph nodes. The lymph from the hand will eventually return to circulation via the right lymphatic duct or the thoracic duct. The right hand will drain into the right lymphatic duct, and the left hand will drain into the thoracic duct.
