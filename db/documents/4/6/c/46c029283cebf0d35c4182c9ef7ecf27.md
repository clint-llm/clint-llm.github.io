Clinicians frequently encounter patients with a complaint of "all my joints hurt." Although many physicians get excited about diagnosing a rare or unusual disease entity in such patients; in reality, many of these patients have either transient self-limiting or non-significant problems. The art of history taking and physical examination should narrow the broad differential diagnosis of polyarticular arthritis to a manageable few, and then confirmatory tests should prove or rule out the exact etiology. Although blood work, different imaging modalities, tissue biopsy, advanced diagnostic techniques are all available; the one thing that truly helps with diagnosis is precise and detailed questioning and physical examination, which also prevents wasting health care dollars for extensive and expensive workups.

The first order of evaluation is to see if the inflammation is from the joint or from an area next to it. Non-articular and peri-articular pain are common and confusing, and they radiate to the joint frequently. If the inflammation and pain are indeed from inside the joint, it can either be inflammatory or non-inflammatory. Non-inflammatory etiologies such as osteoarthritis (OA) are usually chronic and mild and don't have the prominent inflammatory changes such as redness, warmth, swelling, and generalized body disturbances. If the picture is inflammatory, then the clinician will confirm it with tests and make a differential diagnosis based on the number, pattern, chronicity, and symmetry of joints involved.
