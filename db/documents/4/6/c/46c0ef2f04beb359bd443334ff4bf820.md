The varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a human alphaherpesvirus with worldwide distribution and is highly contagious.

The incubation period for varicella is typically between 10 to 21 days. Individuals with primary infection may also experience a prodrome of fever, malaise, abdominal pain, and headaches. Patients with chickenpox are considered contagious from 1 to 2 days before developing the rash until all skin lesions have crusted over. Varicella infection in pregnant women can spread via the placenta and infect the fetus.

After chickenpox, the virus becomes latent in the dorsal root ganglia.  It can later reactivate as herpes zoster (or shingles). The clinical manifestation of herpes zoster includes a painful vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution, followed by postherpetic neuralgia.  Direct contact with the vesicles may be contagious, especially in non-immune or immunocompromised hosts. Herpes zoster does not pose a risk to a developing fetus due to circulating protective maternal antibodies transmitted through placental transfer.
