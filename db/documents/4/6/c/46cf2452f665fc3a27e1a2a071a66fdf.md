The beneficial effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy are sustained effects because of the robust angiogenesis that takes place in the tissue with the improved blood supply and the improved granulation of the wounded tissue. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is most beneficial when used in combination with a good surgical technique which has been demonstrated by the extensive work done by Dr. Marx on osteoradionecrosis of the mandible and the development of the Marx protocol. He demonstrated the benefit of treating the patient with initial 20 to 30 hyperbaric oxygen treatments before reconstructive surgery or bone debridement of the jaw, with additional ten treatments to help the post-surgical tissue and grafts to heal with robust angiogenesis. In his 1993 study, he had a reduction of wound dehiscence from 48% of controls to 11% in the treated group, reduction of infection from 24% to 6% and delayed healing from 55% to 11%. About 80% of the patients with hemorrhagic cystitis from soft tissue radionecrosis will have a positive response, and their hemorrhage problems will be reduced or cease. It is recommended that if the hemorrhage problems don't improve, then repeat cystoscopy should be considered with biopsy to look for cancer recurrence.
