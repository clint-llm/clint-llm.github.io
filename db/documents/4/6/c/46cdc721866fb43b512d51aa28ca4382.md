Simple allergic conjunctivitis (acute, seasonal, and perennial) is an immunoglobulinÂ E (IgE) mediated hypersensitivity reaction (type I) and resultant mast cell degranulation secondary to direct contact with an allergen to the ocular surface. As such, there is an immediate and delayed phase of the reaction mediated by different inflammatory modulators. The exact mechanism involved in vernal keratoconjunctivitis is not well understood. Still, there is likely an IgE mediated hypersensitivity and T cell involvement in the reaction. Atopic keratoconjunctivitis appears to be a combination of delayed-type (type IV) and immediate (type I) hypersensitivity to an ocular allergen exposure. Giant papillary conjunctivitis occurs secondary to direct mechanical irritation/injury and subsequent immune response (type I and type IV). The foreign object may become coated with different allergens or injury epithelial tissue and allow deeper exposure to allergens and provoke an immunological response.
