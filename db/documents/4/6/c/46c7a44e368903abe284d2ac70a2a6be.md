The treatment of RM involves the discontinuation of the topical decongestant. Patients must receive counsel that the nasal congestion may temporarily worsen upon discontinuation of the topical decongestant so that they do not perceive it as treatment failure. The use of intranasal corticosteroids has been reported to minimize the symptoms of rebound congestionÂ in both animal studies and several small human trials.
