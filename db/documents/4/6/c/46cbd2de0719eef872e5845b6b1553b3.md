Iodine intake should be limited prior to an I-123 RAIU or RAIU uptake and scan. If the patient is exposed to too much iodine prior to scanning, the thyroid gland uptakes less iodine, decreasing the sensitivity of the RAIU and scan. Potential sources of iodine include iodine contrast agents, iodine-containing medications, including amiodarone, and an iodine-rich diet, including kelp and seaweed.
