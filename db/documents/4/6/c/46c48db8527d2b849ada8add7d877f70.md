Ubiquitin is an evolutionarily conserved protein found in nearly all eukaryotic organisms. It is highly conserved and virtually identical across all life forms, whether human, yeast, or plant. Ubiquitin is a 76 amino acid protein. The main features of ubiquitin are its seven lysine (Lys) residues and the N-terminus. Ubiquitin can be ubiquitinated on any of the seven Lys residues or on the N-terminus. Lys48- and Lys63-linked chains are the most common polyubiquitination sites, which could lead to protein degradation and endocytosis, respectively.
