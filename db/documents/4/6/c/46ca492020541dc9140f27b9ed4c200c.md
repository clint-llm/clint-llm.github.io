Most children treated for retentive encopresis are eventually cured, although the time required for treatment varies, and relapses are frequent. A systematic review found that only half of all children with constipation followed for 6 to 12 months after therapy did well without laxatives. Treatment needs to resume if constipation or fecal incontinence recurs. Early age of onset of constipation and family history were predictive of the persistence of symptoms.

On the other hand, there is little evidence about the long-term outcome in children with non-retentive encopresis. In one study where children with non-retentive encopresis were followed for ten years, only 29% of children were having less than one episode of fecal incontinence in two weeks after two years of medical and behavioral therapy. At the age of 18 years, 15% of children progressed to adulthood with fecal incontinence. No prognostic factors for success were found in this study.
