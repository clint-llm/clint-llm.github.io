Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic fungal infection caused by a dimorphic fungus endemic to the Americas, found from Mexico to Argentina, with the highest incidence in Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia.Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis. This disease is caused by a thermally dimorphic fungus from the genus Paracoccidioides. PCM can also be caused by other species of this genus, including P. americana, P. restrepiensis, P. venezuelensis, and P. lutzii.Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Paracoccidioides lutzii are considered the primary pathogens given the high rate of isolation of these strains.
