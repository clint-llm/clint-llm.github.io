Prevention is the key to limiting chigger bite-associated illnesses.Â Avoiding areas of chigger infestation is the easiest way to prevent trombiculiasis. If exposure is unavoidable, patients can be advised to use elastic bands to close the hems of sleeves and pant legs tightly against the skin, to cover the skin completely, or to tuck the hems of their pants into socks or boots. DEET repellent and permethrin are also effective deterrents to chigger bites.

**DEET**

DEET (N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide or N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) repellent is highly effective against these larvae and is considered the "gold standard" treatment for prevention.

**Permethrin**

Permethrin is a synthetic compound that is neurotoxic to insects but does not cause any systemic toxicity in humans.
