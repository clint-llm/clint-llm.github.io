Skin biopsy with direct immunofluorescence is the cornerstone for the diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Workup for an underlying disease should be undertaken based on clinical suspicion.  Complete blood counts, liver function test and renal function tests along with urinalysis are recommended at least once at baseline. A more extensive workup shall be pursued if systemic involvement is a concern including a viral hepatitis panel, HIV testing, ASO titer (if a streptococcal infection is the suspected trigger), antinuclear antibody and more specific antibodies for systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren syndrome, rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP antibody, serum complements, serum protein electrophoresis and cryoglobulins.
