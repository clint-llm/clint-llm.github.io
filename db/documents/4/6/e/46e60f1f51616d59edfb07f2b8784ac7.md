Multiple muscles are attached to different surfaces of the xiphoid process. The anterior surface of the process is primarily occupied by the insertion of the flat longitudinal muscles of the anterior abdominal wall, including the rectus abdominis muscle which serves as a strong trunk flexor and stabilizer. In addition, the aponeurosis of the internal and external oblique muscles also attaches to the anterior portion of the xiphoid process. These abdominal muscles, together with other core muscles, function to stabilize the trunk and assist in increasing intra-abdominal pressure.

The posterior surface of the xiphoid process serves as an attachment point for several structures; the most important is the attachment of the diaphragmatic muscular slips providing the diaphragm with its fundamental contractile function in respiration.
