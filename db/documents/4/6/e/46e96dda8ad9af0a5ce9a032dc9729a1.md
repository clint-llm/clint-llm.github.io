Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), also called multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block (MMNCB), is a rare, acquired, motor neuropathy characterized by progressive asymmetric weakness without sensory problems. It typically involves upper limbs more than the lower limbs. Electrodiagnostic studies often reveal an asymmetric motor neuropathy with characteristic conduction block. Serum IgM anti-ganglioside antibodies (anti-GM1) are present in the majority of the patients. These patients often have a favorable response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). This activity reviews the diagnosis and management of multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction blocks and highlights the role of the healthcare team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with multifocal motor neuropathy.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with multifocal motor neuropathy.
- Describe the typical electrodiagnostic study findings associated with multifocal motor neuropathy.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interdisciplinary team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by multifocal motor neuropathy.
