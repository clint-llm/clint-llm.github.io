The average lifespan in patients with infantile Krabbe disease is 13 months. Most patients with late infantileÂ disease die within two years of disease onset. The progression of disease and lifespan reduction vary in both juvenile-onset and adult-onset Krabbe disease. HSCT markedly improves short-term survival for individuals who are treated while asymptomatic during the early neonatal period.
