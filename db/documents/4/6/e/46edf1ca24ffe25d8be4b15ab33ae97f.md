The commonest complication is critical limb ischemia and limb-threatening stenosis, often leading to amputation and increased mortality.

The surgical approach leads to postoperative complications, including infections, bleeding, cardiac, renal, pseudoaneurysm formation, graft rejection, and thromboembolic complications.

There is also an increased probability of 30-day readmission and in-hospital complications and mortality.

Restenosis is the most common late-onset complication.
