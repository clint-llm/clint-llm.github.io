Insulin resistance etiology can be divided into acquired, hereditary, and mixed. The great majority of people with insulin resistance fall into the acquired categories.

**Acquired**

- Excess dysfunctional adipose tissue

- Aging

- Physical inactivity

- Nutritional imbalance

- Medications (glucocorticoids, anti-adrenergic, protease inhibitors, atypical antipsychotics, and some exogenous insulin)

- Increased sodium diets

- Glucose toxicity

- Lipotoxicity from excess circulating free fatty acids

In addition to the heritable components of the above etiologies of insulin resistance, there are a number of unrelated genetic syndromes with associated insulin resistance.

**Genetic**

- Myotonic Dystrophy

- Ataxia-telangiectasia

- Alstom syndrome

- Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome

- Werner syndrome

- Lipodystrophy

- PCOS

- Type-A insulin resistance: Characterized by severe insulin resistance (abnormal glucose homeostasis, ovarian virialization, and acanthosis nigricans) in the absence of anti-insulin antibodies; typically occurs before middle age

- Type-B insulin resistance: Characterized by the development of anti-insulin antibodies (typically in middle age) with resultant abnormal glucose homeostasis, ovarian hyperandrogenism, and acanthosis nigricans

Of note, an alternative classification of insulin resistance is the division for the site of dysfunction concerning the insulin receptor itself as opposed to etiology. The categories include the following:

- Pre-receptor

- Receptor

- Post-receptor
