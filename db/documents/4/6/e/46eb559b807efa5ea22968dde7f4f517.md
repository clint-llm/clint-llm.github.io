Thymic NETs present as a mass located in the anterior mediastinum.

In most cases, thymic NETs go unrecognized until advanced stages as patients commonly remain asymptomatic or symptoms at presentation are ambiguous.

These tumors display aggressive behavior with a tendency for local invasion. Hence 50%Â of patients present with invasion to local organs at the time of diagnosis, and 20%-30% have distant metastatic disease, which occurs via lymphatic or hematogenous spread.

The majority of patients present with symptoms of mass compression to local structures, while only a third of cases are asymptomatic. Symptoms can vary depending on the extent of invasion. Common complaints include cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and hoarseness from recurrent laryngeal nerve invasion.
