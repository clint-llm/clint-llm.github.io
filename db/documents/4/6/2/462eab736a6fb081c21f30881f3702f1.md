Prevention of flea bites involves avoiding exposure. Insecticidal sprays can be used in living conditions to eliminate fleas. Vacuuming and cleaning are also paramount because flea eggs drop onto floors after being laid in animal fur. Removing flea eggs from the environment halts the continuation of the flea's lifecycle.

Household pets, mostly cats and dogs, are common flea carriers. Flea preventatives are obtainable from a veterinarian. These agents can either topical or oral. Veterinary consultation is tantamount if household pets are suspected to be the source of the infestation.

If in an environment where flea eradication is difficult or unfeasible, repellants are an option. Both DEET and thymol containing essential oils have demonstrated effectiveness against both human (Pulex irritans) and cat (Ctenocephalides felis) fleas.
