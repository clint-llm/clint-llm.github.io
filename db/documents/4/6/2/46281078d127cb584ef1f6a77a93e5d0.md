Angioplasty procedures are a minimally invasive alternative to an open surgical approach for arterial stenosis. As a result, these procedures carry significantly lower morbidity and mortality with a shorter duration of hospital stay and recovery with an acceptable risk of restenosis. Percutaneous coronary angioplasty has revolutionized the treatment of MI and unstable angina and now is the standard of care. Stenting and angioplasty are an acceptable alternative for peripheral vascular disease for suitable indications and have better recovery rates at the cost of lower revascularization rates. Carotid angioplasty procedures, however, have more risk than benefit in comparison to carotid endarterectomy procedures and are advisable only in a select group of patients.

The overall success of the interventions is also enhanced by patient compliance with diet, exercise, medications, smoking cessation, and medical optimization of comorbidities.
