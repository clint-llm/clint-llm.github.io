Spontaneous intestinal perforation has a high mortality rate, and prompt management is of utmost importance.

**Medical Management**

All enteral feeds and medications must be discontinued, and a nasogastric tube or orogastric tube must be inserted at low intermittent or continuous suctioning to decompress the abdomen. Total parenteral nutrition must be started for nutrition.

**Surgical Management**

Surgical management of spontaneous intestinal perforation includes bedside primary peritoneal drainage and laparotomy.

A multicenter retrospective study comparing the short-term outcomes of infants with spontaneous intestinal perforation treated with primary peritoneal drainage versus laparotomy found that the time to full feeds and length of stay were similar.

In a large prospective multicenter randomized trial of 310 extremely low birth weight infants (birth weights of less than 1000 g) with necrotizing enterocolitis or spontaneous intestinal perforation, there was no significant difference in the rates of mortality or neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 to 22 months corrected age between infants randomized to initial laparotomy versus initial peritoneal drainage.

However, due to the rarity of the occurrence of spontaneous intestinal perforation, as well as the emergent nature of the intervention required, the studies have been limited in terms of evaluating the difference in outcomes for different management based on the severity of disease, intraoperative diagnosis as well as role of disease progression on the outcomes.
