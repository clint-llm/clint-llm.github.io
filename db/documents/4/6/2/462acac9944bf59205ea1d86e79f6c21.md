At first, Cogan syndrome was believed to be a result of Chlamydia psittaci infection because of remarkably elevated titers of antibodies to chlamydia trachomatis and the previous infection reported in a few patients.Chlamydia was not established by Vollertsen et al.

Further literature on an infectious agent causing it has continued to stay negative, and antibiotic therapy has been unsuccessful.

Presently it is thought that Cogan syndrome is an autoimmune disease. However, no particular biomarker is present in the standard workup of Cogan syndrome.
