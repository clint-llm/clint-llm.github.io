Glomus jugulare is a slow-growing paraganglioma of the head and neck that arises within the jugular foramen and localized to the jugular fossa. Paragangliomas are benign and are originated from neural crest derivatives, known as the paraganglia. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and management of glomus jugulare, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of glomus jugulare.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of glomus jugulare patients.
- Outline the management options available for patients with glomus jugulare.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve the care of patients with glomus jugulare and improve outcomes.
