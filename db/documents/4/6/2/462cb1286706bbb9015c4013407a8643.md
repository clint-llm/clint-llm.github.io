CAH is an autosomal recessive disorder. The activity of 21-hydroxylase is mediated by cytochrome p450c21, found in the endoplasmic reticulum.

The 21-hydroxylase genes (CYP21) lie within the class III region of the human major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6. The CYP21 gene structure contains both CYP21 and a pseudogene (CYP21P). CYP21 is the active gene. More than 90% of mutations causing 21-hydroxylase deficiency are recombination between CYP21 and CYP21P.

Multiple gene defects have been found. Several mutations entirely prevent the synthesis of a functional protein; whereas, others are missense mutations that yield enzymes with 1% to 50% of normal activity. Disease severity correlates well with the mutations carried by an affected individual; for example, patients with a salt-wasting disease usually carry mutations on both alleles that destroy enzymatic activity.

Patients are frequently compound heterozygotes for different types of mutations (i.e., one allele is less-severely affected than the other), in which case the severity of disease expression is largely determined by the activity of the less-severely affected of the 2 alleles.

Molecular genetic testing of the CYP21 gene is available and can detect common mutations and deletions in the various forms in up to 95% of affected individuals.
