If glaucoma remains untreated, visual impairment and blindness may develop. It is not uncommon for the diagnosis of glaucoma to be delayed since it may be asymptomatic until an advanced stage.

Other complications depend on the type of surgery performed. They include:

- Eye redness or pain

- Irritation of the cornea

- Persistent high intraocular pressure

- Hypotony

- Choroidal effusions

- Suprachoroidal hemorrhages

- Infection

- Cataract development or progression
