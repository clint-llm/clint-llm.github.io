The management of serotonin syndrome mainly depends on decreasing the dose of the offending serotonergic agonist(s) taken by the patient. The maintenance of the patient's vital signs, continuous cardiac monitoring, and sedation by benzodiazepines are required; moreover, controlling the patient's hyperthermia by intravenous (IV) cold fluid and antipyretics is essential to prevent further autonomic and neuromuscular disruption.

The drugs that elevate or deplete 5-HT concentration peripherally or centrally need to be dosed appropriately and in a patient-oriented manner, as dose titration following initiation of therapy and monitoring patient symptoms is of therapeutic benefit.

The usual route patientsÂ take serotonergic drugs is oral as a pill preparation; while alternative methods are available, including dermal patches, nasal spray, intramuscular (IM), and IV solutions, it is important to note that each route has a different half-life, efficacy, and potency of the type of drug administered. Furthermore, in IV administration, one must be careful and monitor blood pressure alongside other vital signs and cardiac activity to prevent sudden deterioration.
