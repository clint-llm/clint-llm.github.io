Treatment is symptomatic for patients with cutaneous mastocytosis.Â  Topical medications include calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids. Systemic therapies such as oral antihistamines (the mainstay of treatment), oral cromolyn sodium (used specifically for GI symptoms), oral corticosteroids, omalizumab, oral PUVA, narrowband ultraviolet B, and UVA1 can be used. A pre-measured epinephrine pen with auto-injector should be given to all UP patients. Patients should be educated to avoid possible triggers.
