Clinical data alone is often not enough to precisely diagnose and localize focal seizures. Scalp and intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) may be needed to diagnose accurately. EEG done after the suspected seizure episode may be normal or nonspecific. MRI head is required to identify the underlying etiology.

Seizure characteristics that favor an epileptic diagnosis include younger age at onset, stereotyped patterns of movements, shorter duration of seizures, nocturnal occurrence and presence of MRI, and EEG abnormalities.
