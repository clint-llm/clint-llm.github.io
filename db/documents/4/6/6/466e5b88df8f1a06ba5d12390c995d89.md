The diagnosis of trismus is mainly clinical. Imaging adjuncts may be useful to determine its etiology and the TMJ's articular involvement. Computed tomography can help to identify traumatic etiologies, including hematomas or facial and mandibular fractures. Magnetic resonance imaging may identify space-occupying lesions or abnormalities in the pharyngeal or oral structures.
