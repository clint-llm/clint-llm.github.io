To prevent the UGH syndrome, the single-piece foldable acrylic PCIOL or other PCIOLs should be implanted within the capsular bag.Â When this is impossible due to posterior capsular rent or extension of anterior capsulorhexis, multipiece PCIOL should be implanted in the sulcus in the correct orientation (as it has a vault) and preferably with reverse optic capture (haptics in sulcus and optic behind the anterior capsulorrhexis margin).

When capsular support is inadequate, available surgical options include scleral-fixated IOL (glued or without glue, sutured or without suture), iris-fixated IOL (retropupillary iris-claw lens or iris-claw lens in the anterior chamber), iris-sutured PCIOL, and ACIOL. ACIOL should be appropriately sized, and the total ACIOL diameter should be close to horizontal white to white diameter (in mm) plus 1 mm.

The ACIOLs have a vault, and incorrect orientation causes upside-down lens syndrome associated with complications including corneal decompensation, pupillary capture, chronic anterior uveitis, iris adhesions, and CME.
