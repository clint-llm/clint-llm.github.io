ASC-US is a cytopathology term that implies cervical epithelial cell abnormalities described by the Bethesda system for reporting cervical cytology. It refers to abnormal cytologic changes that are suggestive of SIL but are qualitatively and quantitatively less than those of a definitive SIL diagnosis.
