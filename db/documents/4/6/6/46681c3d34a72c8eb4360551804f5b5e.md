The patient’s medical history, including any medical conditions, medications, and allergies, should be reviewed as this can affect the choice of the anesthetic agent. The patient’s weight should be known to avoid exceeding the safe dose of anesthetic solution. The dental syringe is assembled by the operator or dental assistant, confirming the anesthetic agent to be utilized and its expiry date. Under good lighting, local anesthesia is administered with the patient in the dental chair in a supine or semi-supine position. Anatomical landmarks are observed before administering the local anesthesia. Furthermore, the application of topical anesthesia or freezing can be considered before injection to reduce discomfort.
