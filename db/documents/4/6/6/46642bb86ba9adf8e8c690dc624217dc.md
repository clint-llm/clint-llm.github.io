# Continuing Education Activity

Desmoid tumors , also known as aggressive fibromatosis, are mesenchymal neoplasms that are considered to be locally invasive but do not metastasize. Despite their lack of metastasizing, they are quite destructive locally and often require resection. This activity reviews the evaluation, and treatment of desmoid tumors, and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the clinical presentation of a patient with desmoid tumor.
- Review the pathological findings and imaging characteristics of desmoid tumors
- Review the treatment approaches for desmoid tumors.
- Describe how an optimally functioning interprofessional team would coordinate care to enhance outcomes for patients with desmoid tumors.

# Introduction

Desmoid tumors (DT) are mesenchymal neoplasms that are considered locally invasive but non-metastasizing.

# Etiology

The etiology of DT is unknown. Most DT occurs sporadically, and 85% have a mutation in the CTNNB1 encoding beta-catenin pathway. The three distinct mutations identified are 41A, 45F, and 45. Mutation 45F is associated with a high risk of recurrence.

# Epidemiology

DT is a rare tumor, with a reported incidence of 2–4 per million population and accounts for 0.03% of all neoplasms.

# Histopathology

The diagnosis of DT must be reviewed by an expert soft-tissue pathologist. Histologically, DT is characterized by the proliferation of uniform spindle cells resembling myofibroblasts, in the background of abundant collagenous stroma and vascular network.

On immunohistochemistry, DT stains positive for nuclear beta-catenin, vimentin, cyclooxygenase-2, tyrosine kinase PDGFRb, androgen receptor, and estrogen receptor beta. DT stains negative for desmin, S-100, h-caldesmon, CD34, and c-KIT.

# History and Physical

DT has a varied pattern of clinical presentation, characterized by a slow-growing tumor, that can stabilize and can even undergo spontaneous remission. DT commonly occurs in the rectus abdomins muscle, head and neck region, pelvis, and in the extremities. DT is also known to occur in association with pregnancy and with the use of oral contraceptive pills; and it is known to regress with menopause, indicating a potential influence of the female sex hormonal environment. Breast desmoid can be associated with surgery or implants. One in four cases has a history of trauma or surgery at the site of desmoid. DT also has a propensity to recur in the same area causing a lot of local destruction; however, it has no capacity to metastasize. Patients with FAP are at a much higher risk of developing DT (Up to 25% higher than the general population). In patients with DT, FAP can be diagnosed in up to 5% of patients. The peak incidence is in the late second decade of life, although, it can occur at any age.

The physical exam is usually benign unless the tumor causes pressure symptoms. They can certainly mimic cancer of the respective organ (for example; a DT occurring in the breast can mimic breast cancer), hence a biopsy is mandatory to accurately diagnose a DT.

# Evaluation

Imaging studies like CT scan and MRI can be done during diagnosis and follow up. Imaging can determine the extent of the tumor, which organs are infiltrated, and a surgical resection plan.

- Histological evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis. An incisional biopsy is preferred, but a careful biopsy may be sufficient. Histological features are as previously described in histopathology.

- Immunostaining with vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, muscle actin, and desmin are helpful in distinguishing the tumors.

- The use of NGS is recommended by most guidelines.

# Treatment / Management

DTs are primarily treated through surgery, however, RT and medical therapy have a role to play as well.

Surgical Treatment: The approach to DT is primarily surgical. The goal of surgery is to preserve the limb function and critical structures. Unlike other soft-tissue sarcomas where the goal of surgical resection is to achieve a microscopic negative margins (R0 resection), an R0 resection is only deemed 'desirable', but not a necessity in the surgery of a DT. The significance of a positive margin (R1 or R2 resection) is highly debated. Positive margins after surgery have been reported as an independent prognostic factor in determining the risk of recurrence, however, guidelines clearly prohibit a morbid surgery in an attempt to achieve an R0 resection. In combination with RT and medical therapy, the surgical treatment of DT has become more and more conservative.

Radiation therapy: RT is primarily used in the adjuvant setting when surgery leaves behind a positive margin, or when surgical resection is not possible. A dose of more than 56 Gy is associated with many complications and hence avoided. Non-randomized and retrospective data have shown a lower local recurrence rate with the addition of adjuvant RT in patients with a positive margin. The role of neoadjuvant RT is not established and currently not recommended.

Systemic Therapy: Systemic therapy is usually reserved for patients who experience rapid growth of DT or for those patients in whom the tumor is threatening a critical structure or the surgery would be extremely mutilating.

- Chemotherapy: DT is not a very chemosensitive tumor, however, few regimens may benefit patients.

- Doxorubicin based regimens have had the best success rates. The combination of doxorubicin and dacarbazine has been shown to induce a partial response. Typically the response in the tumor is slow and may occur for months after chemotherapy has been stopped. In patients with DT associated with FAP, the addition of NSAID (like meloxicam) has been found to be beneficial. Liposomal doxorubicin is also an effective drug inducing long-lasting responses in many patients. 
- Vinca alkaloids with methotrexate (MTX): In the pediatric population, the combination of vinblastine and MTX has been found beneficial; however, this combination is very toxic for adults. Hence, in adults, vinblastine is substituted for vinorelbine and is given along with MTX.

- Targeted therapy:

- Imatinib (800mg PO daily) has been successfully used in patients with DT. However, no definite mechanism or pathway of action is known. Even those patients without any mutation in the KIT, PDGRA, or PDGFRB regions showed a response. 
- Sorafenib is the other drug that has shown some benefit.

- Hormonal therapy: Considering the fact that DT can occur around the time of pregnancy, hormonal therapy like Tamoxifen has been explored and found to be useful. A higher dose of tamoxifen (120-200 mg/day, the conventional dose is 40mg/day) is advocated, however, no controlled studies exist.

- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: Since COX-2 pathways are involved in the growth of DT, COX-2 inhibitors like indomethacin, sulindac, and meloxicam have been proven to induce remission in patients with Dt.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Desmoids may occasionally be encountered by the nurse practitioner, primary care provider or the internist. Because the diagnosis and treatment is complex, it is important to consult with an oncologist, pathologist, and a radiologist. The treatment of desmoid can be divided broadly into asymptomatic resectable, symptomatic resectable, unresectable, and recurrent desmoids. These lesions do not normally respond well to chemotherapy and radiation and surgery is the only treatment. However, recurrences are common. The prognosis for most patients is guarded.
