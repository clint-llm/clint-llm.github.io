**Initial Work-Up**

- Complete blood count: Hemoglobin, HCT, MCV, reticulocyte count index

- Comprehensive metabolic panel: Renal and liver function tests

- Iron studies which include serum iron, TIBC (total iron binding capacity) and ferritin

- Serum vitamin B12, folic acid, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)

- Stool for occult blood

**Differentiation of Microcytic Anemias Based on Iron Studies**

- Iron deficiency anemia: Low serum iron, high TIBC, and low ferritin.

- Anemia of chronic disease: Low serum iron, low TIBC, and high ferritin.

- Sideroblastic anemia: High serum iron, normal TIBC, and high ferritin.

- Thalassemia: Normal serum iron, normal TIBC and normal ferritin.

Peripheral smear, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and bone marrow examination if needed. Further testing would include esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy if gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is suspected and imaging studies if malignancy suspected.
