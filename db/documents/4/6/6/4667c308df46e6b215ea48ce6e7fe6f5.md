Physiological pulmonary regurgitation can occur and is considered an incidental findingÂ on echocardiogram. Surgical valvulotomy and balloon valvuloplasty are the most common causes of iatrogenic pulmonary valve regurgitation and pathological pulmonary regurgitation overall. These occur in patients who have received surgical treatment for right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (RVOT) such as tetralogy of Fallot.
