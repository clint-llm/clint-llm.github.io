Subacromial bursitis is a relatively benign condition that is easy to diagnose and treat. It is a frequent presentation in the orthopedist’s office, but patients may initially present to a primary care clinic, sports clinic or the emergency department. Treatment can be rendered in this setting efficiently and effectively. The primary care providers including the orthopedic nurse should educate the patient on methods to prevent this pathology. However, it is important not to miss other pathologies that can coexist such as tendon tears, since leaving these untreated will have a greater impact on the patient’s arm function, activities of daily living and thus, quality of life. Therefore, in cases where the bursitis is unable to be treated, or other pathologies are suspected, the patient should obtain a referral to an orthopedic surgeon for further care.

Subacromial bursitis is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes physicians, specialists, therapists, specialty-trained nursing, and pharmacists, engaged in a collaborative team effort to bring about the optimal care and the best possible patient outcomes.
