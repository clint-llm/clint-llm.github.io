Once chloracne is diagnosed, the primary action is to prevent further exposure to the chemical source, which in many cases will result in improvement of the lesions. If lesions persist for a long time despite the elimination of further toxin exposure, treatments used for acne vulgaris such as topical retinoids, oral antibiotics or isotretinoin may be considered. Comedones may be expressed and cysts may be excised. Recently, a small cohort of Japanese patients with dioxin-related sequelae for 30-40 years was treated orally with a cinnamaldehyde-containing antioxidant called Keishibukuryogan. Treatment with this herbal medicine, which exhibits AHR–CYP1A1 inhibition and NRF2 activation, resulted in improvement in the patients' chloracne and associated systemic symptoms.

Patients with chloracnegen exposure history must be followed longitudinally because the toxic exposure may also impact other organs than the skin and may be linked to various malignancies.
