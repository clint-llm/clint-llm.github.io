Epilepsy, defined as the tendency for unprovoked seizures, is a common neurologic disease affecting up to 1 in 26 individuals.

Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is defined as “death in a patient with epilepsy that is not due to trauma, drowning, status epilepticus, or other known causes but for which there is often evidence of an associated seizure” and represents a leading cause of death in patients with epilepsy.

- Definite,

- Probable,

- Possible,

- Unlikely SUDEP

These categorizations have allowed for more precise investigation regarding the risks, mechanisms, and preventative strategies. Increasing awareness of SUDEP amongst health professionals and the general public can allow for improved patient counseling and potential modification of risk factors.
