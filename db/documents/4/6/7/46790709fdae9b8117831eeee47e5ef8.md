Cost is the most commonly cited issue of concern regarding simulation teaching.

Also, learners are provided in a never-ending stream from academic year to year. Unfortunately, inanimate objects do not heal like live tissue, and models have to be reconstructed, and some parts reused. From time to time, a replacement can become more costly. The main cost incurred is usually from purchasing commercially developed training models. The field of simulation has given rise to a significant number of educators that have developed their own "home brews" and recipes that are cost-effective given the disposable and renewable nature of some teaching models. For example, peripheral IV placement is a common procedure, and due to the frequency of the procedure coupled with the volume of learners who require proficiency in the procedure, peripheral IV task trainers are not expressly reusable and require regular replacement. These models do not need to have significant costs associated with their construction and can effectively achieve the goal of the task objectives.

More germane to medical specialties and specifically Emergency Medicine is learning how to think abstractly in preparation for oral board examinations. Oral board examinations are nothing more than simulated cases that require cognitive thought processes, and continued training and preparation for oral board exams have been shown to lead to higher pass rates.
