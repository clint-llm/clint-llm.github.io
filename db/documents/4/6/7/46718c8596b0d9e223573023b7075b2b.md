Drug-induced gingival overgrowth (DIGO), also referred to as drug-induced gingival enlargement, and previously known as drug-induced gingival hyperplasia, is a side-effect of certain drugs where the gingival tissue is not the intended target organ. The key offending drug classes are anticonvulsants, immunosuppressants, and calcium channel blockers.

A non-surgical approach is the first line of treatment, including appropriate plaque control and discontinuing or changing the inducing drug. In the recent years azythromicin has gained a lot of attention due to its capacity to improve gingival overgrowths in patients taking cyclosporin A, avoiding the need of changing the drug to another agent. Surgical management comes in play only when medical treatment is unsuccessful, however, recurrences are common and the results last for usually twelve months.
