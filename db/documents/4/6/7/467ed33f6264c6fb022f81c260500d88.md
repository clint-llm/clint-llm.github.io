Suprapubic catheterization refers to the placement of a drainage tube into the urinary bladder just above the pubic symphysis. This is typically performed for individuals who are unable to drain their bladder via the urethra. Suprapubic catheterization offers an alternative means to drain the urinary bladder when other methods are not clinically feasible, undesirable or impossible. 
This activity reviews the technique of suprapubic bladder catheterization, its indications, contraindications and role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients who are not able to void urine.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures involved in a suprapubic bladder catheterization.
- Describe the indications for suprapubic bladder catheterization.
- Review the contraindications to suprapubic bladder catheterization.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients needing suprapubic bladder catheterization.
