The evaluation of patients with a suspected or established nonunion should begin with a thorough review of the medical history so risk factors can be identified. Collect information about the type of fracture, fixation method, and previous treatments. When interviewing patients, they might manifest the persistence of pain at the fracture site and/or functional limitations. One indication that a nonunion is not present is the patient will not have pain with ambulation or when using the extremity.Â The physical exam should be done in a standard fashion, with an evaluation of the neurovascular status and range of motion. Special attention should be drawn to any signs of infection (skin or soft tissue changes) and mobility at the fracture site, which might indicate the absence of adequate callus formation.
