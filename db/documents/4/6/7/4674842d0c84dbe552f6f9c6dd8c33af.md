As previously discussed, certain common clinical conditions can present in an uncommon manner that can be confused with primary cognitive impairment or functional change. An infection, whether urinary, respiratory, or from a wound, can cause functional change, altered mental status, or worsening falls.

Similarly, hypothyroidism, depression, vitamin B12, frailty, and electrolyte abnormalities combined with existing comorbidities can complicate the presentation of a new problem. Thus, a careful clinical assessment, close management of existing medical problems, and identification of reversible causes are important.
