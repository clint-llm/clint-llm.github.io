Blood pressure measurements, both systolic and diastolic, and serum creatinine levels are staples of monitoring patients with preeclampsia and may be predictive of changes in dilated fundus examinations.

Ophthalmic evaluation, like most interventions in pregnancy, balances the unknown fetal risks of diagnostic maneuvers with the risks of maternal visual and systemic disease. Retinal angiography most commonly involves the intravenous administration of fluorescein dye and is indispensable in diagnosing retinal vascular disease. Although fluorescein can cross the placenta and can be found in breast milk after administration, the authors have found no studies identifying a known risk for its use during pregnancy, and it is currently categorized as an FDA pregnancy category C drug (risk unknown but cannot be ruled out).

However, other valuable diagnostic tools in ophthalmology offer no risk to fetal development, including fundus autofluorescence, B-scan ultrasonography, and optical coherence tomography. These non-invasive tools are essential in the evaluation of retinal, optic nerve, and choroidal pathology.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain also poses no known risk to the mother or fetus and can demonstrate posterior cerebral edema as seen in PRES; it can also reveal the presence of ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes.
