Most cases of primary congenital glaucoma are sporadic in origin, with no family history. The significant risk factors are consanguineous marriage, genetic predisposition, and first-degree relatives, including siblings. Approximately 90 percent of cases belong to this category. Another 10 percent cases are familial, which show an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance with incomplete penetrance ranging from 40-100 percent. Five gene loci have been linked to primary congenital glaucoma. These include GLC3A, GLC3B, GLC3C, GLC3D, and GLC3E. Locus GLC3A has been linked to the CYP1B1 gene.

Mutations in this gene are most commonly responsible for autosomal recessively inherited cases.
