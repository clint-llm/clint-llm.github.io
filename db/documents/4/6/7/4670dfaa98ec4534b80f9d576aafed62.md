Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) is the failure of the Eustachian tube in maintaining pressure equalization or mucociliary transport. This is categorized as either acute (less than 3 months presentation) or chronic ETD (more than 3 months). ETD affects 1% of the population, with symptoms including aural fullness or ‘popping sounds,’ reduced hearing, tinnitus, autophony, otalgia, and imbalance. It can be broadly categorized into baro-challenged induced, patulous, and dilatory ETD. This activity outlines the types of Eustachian tube dysfunction, the associated risk factors, and the appropriate evaluation and management of the condition by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical patient history associated with dysfunction of the Eustachian tubes. 
- Review the pathophysiology of Eustachian tube dysfunction. 
- Identify the treatment considerations for patients with Eustachian tube dysfunction.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for pediatric patients affected by Eustachian tube dysfunction, who are at risk of speech and language delay.
