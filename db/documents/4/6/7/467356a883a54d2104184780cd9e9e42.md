Patients may present suddenly or in the background of ongoing infection with symptoms and signs suggestive of adrenal insufficiency. The principal manifestation of WFS is shock. Patients often have nonspecific symptoms like rapid onset headache, fever, weakness, fatigue, abdominal or flank pain, anorexia, nausea or vomiting, confusion, or disorientation.

On abdominal examination, rigidity or rebound tenderness may be present. WFS associated with meningococcemia characteristically demonstrates petechial rash, DIC, purpura fulminans along with neurological manifestations seen in meningitis. TheÂ petechial rash usually develops on the trunk and lower portions of the body but can develop over mucous membranes, as well. The rash can coalesce to form larger purpura and ecchymoses. The petechiae usually relate to the degree of thrombocytopenia. Thus the clinician must be vigilant about these rashes as they can be of value in anticipating bleeding complications due to DIC.

It is challenging to diagnose WFS, especially in the setting of ongoing sepsis, which may masquerade as septic shock. Surprisingly hypotension precedes shock only in approximately half of all patients.
