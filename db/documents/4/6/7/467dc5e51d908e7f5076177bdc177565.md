The common peroneal nerve is a major nerve that innervates the lower extremity. There are numerous traumatic and non-traumatic causes of peroneal nerve injuries, including knee dislocation, direct impact or cut on the fibular neck, fracture of the proximal fibula, compression by use of a tight plaster cast, or compression wrapping, prolonged bed rest, and regular crossing of the legs. Peroneal nerve injury is typically managed conservatively with orthotics and/or physical therapy. However, there are also surgical options for more severe cases. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of peroneal nerve injuries and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in evaluating, treating, and managing patients with this injury.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of peroneal nerve Injuries.
- Review the appropriate steps for evaluation of peroneal nerve Injuries.
- Describe the management options available for peroneal nerve injuries.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance peroneal nerve Injuries and improve outcomes.
