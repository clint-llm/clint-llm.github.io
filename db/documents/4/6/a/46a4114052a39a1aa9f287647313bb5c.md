Any patient presenting with choroidal folds should not receive treatment by an ophthalmologist in isolation. It requires an interprofessional team evaluation by various specialists, including endocrinologists, neurologists, and otolaryngologists. Interprofessional communication can lead to better patient management. The patient will most often present to the primary provider, and these professionals should be aware of the condition as it is treatable. Prompt referral to an ophthalmologist is necessary. These patients can then be followed by their primary clinicians and should ensure compliance with treatment. Pharmacists can ensure correct dosing on the medication management aspect of the condition. Nursing will be the first to come in contact with patients on follow-up and can assess treatment progress as well as evaluate compliance with both medication and lifestyle measures, and report any issues to the primary care provider. This collaborative, interprofessional approach to care can ensure optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
