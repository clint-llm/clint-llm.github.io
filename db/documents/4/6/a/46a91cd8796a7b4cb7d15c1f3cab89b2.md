Patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis with an MDF greater than 32 have 30-day mortality of 30% to 50%. FortyÂ percent of the patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis die within 6 months after the onset of the clinical syndrome. Jaundice and hepatic encephalopathy at the time of presentation indicate a poorer outcome.

Mild alcoholic hepatitis generally runs a benign course and is completely reversible with the cessation of alcohol consumption.

To determine prognosis the following factors need to be considered:

- Histologically proven alcohol hepatitis

- Serum bilirubin greater than 2.5 mg/dl

- Serum albumin less than 2.5 g/dl

- Prothrombin time more than 5 seconds
