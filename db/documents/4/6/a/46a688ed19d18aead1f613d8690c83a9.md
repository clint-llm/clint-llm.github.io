Blood is supplied to the hand via the ulnar and radial arteries which anastomose in the superficial palmar and deep palmar arches. These arches have numerous branches, many of which supply the MCP joints including princeps pollicis artery, the radial artery of the index finger, common palmar digital arteries, and the dorsal and palmar metacarpal arteries.

Lymphatic drainage for the hand occurs via superficial channels that run alongside the cephalic and basilic veins as well as deep channels that course with the arteries. These lymphatics drain to lymph nodes within the elbow, including the cubital and epitrochlear lymph nodes, before ultimately draining into the axillary or infraclavicular lymph nodes.
