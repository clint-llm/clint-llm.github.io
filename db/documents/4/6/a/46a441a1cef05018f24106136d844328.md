Like in almost all surgical diseases, signs and symptoms will involve the cause of the disease, the disease, and its complications. Occasionally fistula is the presenting finding of the underlying disease.

**Signs and Symptoms of the Cause of the Disease**

- Diverticular disease: Pain and other signs and symptoms of the infectious GI malignancy; general signs and symptoms of weight loss, weakness, cachexia, poor appetite; and local signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction, GI bleeding, change of bowel habit, and abdominal pain with possible tenderness

- Inflammatory process: Lower abdominal pain/tenderness, fever, GI bleed, and alteration of bowel habit

History of known diseases causing enterovesical fistula should raise suspicion of the problem.

**Signs and Symptoms of the Disease (Fistula)**

Pneumaturia is a highly diagnostic symptom of enterovesical fistula.

**Signs and Symptoms of the Complication**

Recurrent or persistent urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common complication of enterovesical fistula.
