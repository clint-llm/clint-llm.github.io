Tanner staging is a classification system used to assess stages of puberty. A breakdown of each stage can be seen in Tables 1 and 2.

**Female Development During Puberty**

- 
**Thelarche**

- 
              
- Thelarche refers to breast growth, typically the first sign of puberty in girls, occurring around 9 or 10. An increase in estrogen causes the lactiferous duct system to develop, while an increase in progesterone causes the lobular alveoli at the ends of lactiferous ducts to increase in number.

- 
**Pubarche**

- 
              
- Approximately six months after thelarche begins, pubarche, or growth of pubic hair, will typically occur. Pubic hair initially appears light, sparse and straight but will become coarse, thick, and dark throughout the course of puberty. Approximately two years after pubarche, axillary hair will begin to grow, a secondary sexual characteristic mediated by testosterone.

- 
**Menarche**

- 
              
- Menarche is the female's first menstrual period, caused by an increase in FSH and LH. Menarche typically occurs 1.5 to 3 years after thelarche at approximately 12.8 years of age in White race girls and 3-8 months later in African-American girls. During puberty, the uterine endometrium undergoes cycles of proliferation and regression due to fluctuating plasma estradiol levels. This occurs until a point is reached when substantial growth occurs so that withdrawal of estrogen results in the first menstruation (menarche). Plasma progesterone levels remain low until a rise occurs after menarche, indicating that ovulation has occurred. The first ovulation takes place approximately 6 to 9 months after menarche due to an immature positive feedback mechanism of estrogen.

- 
**Ovarian Development**

- 
              
- The rise in gonadotropins during puberty stimulates the ovary to produce estradiol, which is responsible for developing secondary sexual characteristics such as thelarche, growth of reproductive organs, fat redistribution to the hips and breasts, and bone maturation. Ovarian size increases from prepubertal volume (approximately 0.5 cm^3) to a postpubertal volume (approximately 4.0 cm^3).

- 
**Uterus Size**

- 
              
- The uterus of a prepubertal female is tear-drop shaped, with the neck and isthmus accounting for up to two-thirds of the uterine volume. An increase in estrogen production causes the uterus to become pear-shaped, with the uterine body increasing in length and thickness.

- 
**Vaginal Changes**

- 
              
- Puberty brings about an enlargement of the labia major and labia minora. Clear to white vaginal discharge may also be seen prior to the onset of menarche.

**Male development during puberty**

- 
**Testicular Size**

- 
              
- An increase in testicular size is typically the first sign of puberty in boys. Testes increase in size during puberty due to the development of the seminiferous tubules. Increased LH stimulates the synthesis of testosterone by Leydig cells, while increased FSH stimulates the production of sperm by Sertoli cells. Testicular size increases throughout puberty up to Tanner stage 4, at which time the adult longitudinal diameter and volume are reached. An increase in testicular size causes the scrotal skin to become thinner and darker in color. Boys typically experience their first ejaculation approximately one year after the testicles begin to grow. The first ejaculation, however, does not automatically signal an ability to procreate. On average, fertility is achieved one year after the first ejaculation.

- 
**Pubarche**

- 
              
- The growth of pubic hair at the penile base typically occurs alongside testicular development. Pubic hairs initially appear light, straight and thin; then become darker, curlier, and thicker as puberty progresses. Approximately two years after the onset of pubarche, axillary, chest, and facial hair begin to grow.

- 
**Penis Size**

- 
              
- The growth of the penis occurs after testicular enlargement. The penis grows in length, then width, and the glans penis and corpus cavernosum also enlarge.

**Growth Spurt**

The growth spurt results from interactions between sex steroids (estradiol/testosterone), growth hormone, and IGF-1. The rise in sex steroids leads to an increase in growth hormone levels, which causes an increase in IGF-1. IGF-1 causes somatic growth via its metabolic actions (e.g., increases trabecular bone growth). Following the growth spurt in males, the larynx and vocal cords enlarge, and the boy's voice may 'crack' as it deepens in pitch.

**Adrenarche**

Adrenarche refers to the increased secretion of adrenal androgen precursors dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and androstenedione from the adrenal zona reticularis, which typically occurs prior to puberty in children around the ages of 6-8 years. The eventual phenotypical result of adrenarche is pubarche, as well as apocrine odor, increased oiliness of hair and skin, and acne.
