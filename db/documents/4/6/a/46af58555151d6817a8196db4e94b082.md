The most common complication of a perineal laceration is bleeding. Most bleeding can be quickly controlled with pressure and surgical repair.

Beyond bleeding, immediate complications also include pain and suturing time leading to delayed mother-child bonding.

Long term complications include pain, urinary or anal incontinence, and delayed return to sexual intercourse due to dyspareunia.

Approximately 25% of women who suffer from an OASIS injury will experience wound dehiscence in the first six weeks post-partum and 20% will suffer from a wound infection. Rectovaginal and/or rectoperineal fistulas may develop in women who had an unidentified or poorly healed OASIS injuries.

The time it takes a woman to return to normal sexual function after perineal trauma varies but has been correlated to the severity of the laceration. The more severe the laceration, the longer the return to normal sexual function.
