Clinicians should aim to recognize the signs of cerebral palsy and make the diagnosis of cerebral palsy or "high risk of cerebral palsy" as early as possible. Historically the diagnosis of cerebral palsy was made between the ages of 12 to 24 months. There is now good evidence to support that the diagnosis can be made or accurately predicted before age six months corrected age.
