Care for patients with spinal cord ischemia and infarction requires comprehensive, interprofessional healthcare provider engagement. Neurology and Emergency Medicine providers must recognize the often atypical symptoms of cord ischemia and initiate appropriate triage and workup. Neuroradiologists must optimize spinal cord MRI imaging protocols and ensure symptomatic patients receive an expedited radiologic evaluation. When indicated, neurosurgical treatment of reversible causes of cord ischemia should occur promptly following diagnosis. Given the significant overlap of aortic pathology and spinal cord ischemia, many cases of spinal cord ischemia may first present to vascular surgeons or cardiologists; thus interprofessional communication and effective consultation services are essential.

Physiatrists and non-physicians including specialty-trained rehabilitation nurses also play a critical role in the recovery phase following spinal cord infarction. Patients should be counseled on prognosis and appropriately referred for occupational and physical rehabilitation services. Licensed social workers are needed to assist patients during the road to recovery by helping navigate the post-hospitalization rehabilitation process including insurance claim processing and obtaining support devices. The cumulative efforts of the entire care team can optimize the patient’s chance for functional recovery.
