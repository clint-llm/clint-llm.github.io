Cerebellar hemorrhage or hematoma is a type of intracranial hemorrhage in which the bleeding is located in the posterior fossa or cerebellum. This condition is most frequently seen in middle-aged and older adults. Cerebellar hematomas can block the normal flow of cerebral spinal fluid leading to hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, and the onset of symptoms. Cerebellar hemorrhage can be spontaneous or secondary to stroke or trauma. Cerebellar hemorrhages are associated with high morbidity and mortality. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of a cerebellar hematoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify clinical examination findings suggestive of a cerebellar hematoma.
- Describe diagnostic and imaging strategies for patients presenting with features concerning for cerebellar hematoma.
- Outline the treatment and management options for cerebellar hemorrhage.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of cerebellar hemorrhage and improve patient outcomes.
