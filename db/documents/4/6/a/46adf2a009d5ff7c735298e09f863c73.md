Tarantula-related injury is a rare occurrence, with only 44 reports to the American Association of Poison Control Centers in 2018 and only 17 of those requiring evaluation at a healthcare facility. These were largely in adults and resulted in only minor injuries. These exposuresÂ are most commonly related to their popularity as pets.
