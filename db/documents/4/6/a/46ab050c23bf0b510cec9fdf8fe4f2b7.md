Pemphigus vulgaris is a blistering disease that initially presents on the oral mucosa in 80% of cases. These intraoral blisters often rupture, leaving painful erosions. Cutaneous lesions may appear in about 75% of patients with PV after the first oral blisters have presented. Vesicles, erosions, or bullae may appear on erythematous or normal-appearing skin. A Nikolsky sign is described as a blister formation with minor pressure or trauma and is seen in PV.

Due to the painful nature of oral lesions, PV can result in an impaired nutritional status. Mucosal PV can be found in the conjunctiva, nasal mucosa, larynx, pharynx, esophagus, penis, vagina, and anus.
