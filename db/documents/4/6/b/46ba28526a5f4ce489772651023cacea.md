Chromium deficiency may be identified in patients with chronic total parenteral nutrition with comorbid conditions. This, in turn, could worsen the quality of life of an already vulnerable population. Evaluation of this condition must be considered in individuals showing clinical features of this diagnosis.

TheÂ interprofessional healthcare team is essential in the evaluation and treatment of chromium deficiency. Primary and critical care physicians are integral in identifying and diagnosing this condition. The laboratory team allows for the analysis of human samples to help reach the postulated levels of chromium available in circulation. Registered dieticians and pharmacists play an essential role in formulating appropriate supplementation for use in total parenteral nutrition solutions. Communication between all team members regarding progress or lack thereof in the patient's condition provides enhanced patient-centered care while caring for patients with this complex ailment.
