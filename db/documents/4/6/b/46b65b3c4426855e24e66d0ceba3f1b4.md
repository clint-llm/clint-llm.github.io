CT is a reliable method for evaluating the lumbar spine and provides great bony detail for assessing trauma, non displaced fractures, complex fractures, scoliosis, pre, and post-operative patients. CT is beneficial following surgery to evaluate the surgical hardware and bone graft material, which are not well assessed on MRI. CT myelograms are useful in patients with various spinal equipment and in patients who have a contraindication for MRI.Â These take place after instilling a radiopaque dye into the subarachnoid space by lumbar puncture under fluoroscopy or CT guidance.
