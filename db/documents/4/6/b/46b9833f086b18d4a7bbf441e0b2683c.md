Marchiafava-Bignami disease (MBD) is a very rare disorder of demyelination/necrosis of the corpus callosum and the near subcortical white matter that is especially predominant in ill-fed alcoholics

The disease can be acute, subacute, or chronic. The clinical picture is marked by dementia, dysarthria, spasticity, and walking inability. Also, patients may enter into a coma or a demented condition for many years, and spontaneously recover or die

Lesions can appear as hypodense regions of the corpus callosum on tomography, and as areas of diminished T1 signal and increased T2 signal on magnetic resonance. Also, an interhemispheric disconnection syndrome has been found in survivors.Â Alcoholic patients without hepatic disease, amnesia, or cognitive dysfunction present thinning of the corpus callosum on autopsy and neuroimaging (magnetic resonance) suggesting that alcohol or malnutrition can commonly damage the corpus callosum without the necrotic lesions of MBD. These findings can conclude in the possibility of aggressive nutritional supplementation with a reduction in drinking to prevent the development of MBD in alcoholic patients
