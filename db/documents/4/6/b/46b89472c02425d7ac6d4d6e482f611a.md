A minor procedure tray is typically all that is necessary for the reconstruction of the facial defect after MMS; this may include:

- Prep: marking pen, local anesthetic, povidone-iodine, sterile towels, eye protection (e.g., corneal shields)

- Small straight scissors

- Small curved scissors

- Suture scissors

- Non-toothed forceps

- Tissue forceps (e.g., Adson)

- NeedleÂ driver

- Number 15 and/or 11 blade

- Penetrating towel clips (may be useful for mechanical creep)

- Sutures (per surgeon preference) usually consist of absorbable sutures (e.g., Vicryl, PDS, or Monocryl) for deeper layer approximation and small non-absorbable sutures (5-0 or 6-0 nylon or Prolene)

- Cautery (needle-tip is useful for precise application)

**Postoperatively**

- Antibiotic ointment or vaseline

- Dressing (e.g., non-adherent gauze and paper tape)
