Considering the numerous underlying etiologies, it is difficult to estimate the incidence of koilonychia and currently, there is no information stating the prevalence of koilonychia within different age groups and gender.  In addition, not everyone with an underlying disease may present with the clinical manifestation of koilonychia. Similarly, the epidemiological data about the incidence and prevalence of other associated conditions like the Plummer-Vinson syndrome are not widely available. Iron deficiency is by far the commonest nutritional cause of anemia and thus koilonychia and is considerably more prevalent in the developing rather than in the developed countries (36% or 1.4 billion out of 3.8 billion estimated population in developing countries, versus 8% or just under 100 million out of 1.2 billion estimated population in developed countries). Given its impact on psychological and physical development, behavior and work performance, iron deficiency anemia remains a serious problem of public health significance to be tackled.
