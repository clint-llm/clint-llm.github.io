Babies born with Pierre- Robin sequence commonly present with respiratory distress and feeding difficulties due to mandibular hypoplasia and posteriorly placed tongue. The associated cleft palate leads to recurrent upper respiratory tract and ear infections. These patients will require various surgical interventions to correct the anatomical abnormalities and other related defects. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of the Pierre- Robin sequence and highlights the role of the inter-professional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the anesthetic management considerations for patients with Pierre- Robin sequence.
-  Summarize the anticipated complications during the intraoperative and postoperative period among patients with Pierre-Robin sequence.
- Describe the common intubation methods before administering general anesthesia among patients with Pierre- Robin sequence.
- Explain the importance of monitoring patients with Pierre- Robin Sequence after extubation in the post-anesthesia care unit.
