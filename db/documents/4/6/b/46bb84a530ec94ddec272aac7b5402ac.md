The primary and accessory muscles of mastication work in a coordinated fashion to produce mandibular movement for chewing food.  The accessory muscles of mastication are the buccinator, suprahyoid muscles (digastric muscle, mylohyoid muscle, and geniohyoid muscle), and infrahyoid muscles (the sternohyoid, sternothyroid, thyrohyoid and omohyoid muscle).

The origin, insertion, and action of the main muscles of mastication, as well as a brief description of the accessory muscles of mastication, are as follows.

**Temporalis Muscle**

The temporalis muscle is a fan-shaped muscle with anterior fibers that have a vertical orientation, mid fibers have an oblique orientation, and posterior fibers have a more of a horizontal orientation.  The origin of the temporalis muscle spans from the temporal fossa to the inferior temporal line of the lateral skull.  The temporalis muscle fibers converge inferiorly, forming a tendon that exits the temporal fossa, passing underneath the zygomatic arch and inserting on the coronoid process of the mandible.  The function of the anterior and mid fibers of the temporalis muscle is to elevate the mandible.  The posterior fibers of the temporalis muscle function to retract the mandible.

**Medial Pterygoid**

The medial pterygoid muscle is a thick rectangular muscle with a superficial head and a deep head.  The superficial head of the medial pterygoid has as its origin the maxillary tuberosity of the inferior maxilla.  The deep head of the medial pterygoid is larger than the superficial head.  The deep head originates from the medial surface of the lateral pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone.   The medial pterygoid muscle fibers converge inferiorly, forming a tendon that inserts on the medial ramus of the mandible posterior and inferior to the mylohyoid groove of the mandible. Medial pterygoid tendon fibers insert on the angle of the mandible. The medial pterygoid muscle functions to assist with elevation and protrusion of the mandible. It also assists the lateral pterygoid muscle with side to side mandibular motion to help with the grinding of food.

**Lateral Pterygoid**

The lateral pterygoid muscle is the primary muscle of the inferior temporal fossa.  The lateral pterygoid has two parts: an upper head and a lower head.  The origin of the upper head of the lateral pterygoid muscle is the inferior temporal surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. The lower head originates from the lateral aspect of the lateral pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone.  The lateral pterygoid muscle fibers converge inferiorly, forming a tendon that inserts on the pterygoid fovea of the neck of the condylar process of the mandible, along with the articular disc and capsule of the temporal-mandibular joint.  The lateral pterygoid muscle functions as the sole muscle of mastication to causes depression of the mandible. That being the case, depression of the mandible is largely the result of gravity. It also assists with protrusion and side to side movement of the mandible.

**Masseter**

The masseter muscle is a rectangularly shaped muscle with three layers (superficial, deep, and intermediate).  The origin of the masseter muscle is the inferior zygomatic arch and the anterior two-thirds of the zygomatic arch, with a connection to the posterior aspect of the zygomatic bone.  The masseter muscle fibers converge inferiorly, forming a tendon that inserts the outer surface of the mandibular ramus and coronoid process of the mandible.  The function of the masseter muscle is to elevate the mandible and approximate the teeth—additionally, the intermediate and deep muscle fibers of the masseter function to retract the mandible.  And the superficial fibers function to protrude the mandible.

**Accessory Muscles of Mastication**

The strap muscles are composed of the suprahyoid, and infrahyoid muscles are located on the side of the neck bilaterally.  The strap muscles primarily function to raise and depress the hyoid bone and larynx.  The strap muscles also assist with depression of the mandible when opening the mouth against an opposing force.  The buccinator is a facial expression muscle that helps in mastication by keeping food pushed back within the oral cavity.
