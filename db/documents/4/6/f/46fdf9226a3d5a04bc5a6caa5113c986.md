Intussusception is a condition in which part of the intestine folds into the section next to it. Intussusception usually involves the small bowel and rarely the large bowel. Symptoms include abdominal pain, which may wax and wane, vomiting, bloating, and bloody stool. It may result in small bowel obstruction. Other complications may consist of peritonitis or bowel perforation. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of intussusception and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the causes of intussusception.
- Describe the pathophysiology of intussusception.
- Summarize the treatment options for intussusception.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by intussusception.
