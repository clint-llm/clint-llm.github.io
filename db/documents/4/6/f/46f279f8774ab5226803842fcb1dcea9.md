Radiographs are the initial imaging of choice used to evaluate for these injuries. AP, lateral, and oblique images of the foot are essential to making the diagnosis. In zone 1 injuries, the medial fracture line lies proximal to the fourth to the fifth intermetatarsal joint. In zone 2 injuries, the medial fracture line extends towards or even into the fourth and/or fifth intermetatarsal joint. In zone 3 injuries, the medial fracture line will typically exit distal to the fourth and/or fifth intermetatarsal joint, but some may be more proximal.

The radiographic appearance of fifth metatarsal base stress fractures classifies into three types based on the Torg classification system.

- Type I fractures: 

- Early
- No intramedullary sclerosis
- Sharp fracture line with no widening
- Minimal cortical hypertrophy
- Minimal periosteal reaction

- Type II: 

- Delayed
- Evidence of intramedullary sclerosis
- Widened fracture line with the involvement of both cortices
- Periosteal reaction present

- Type III: 

- Nonunion
- Complete obliteration of the medullary canal by sclerotic bone
- Wide fracture line with new periosteal bone

Other imaging modalities such as CT and MRI may be considerations in the setting of delayed healing, nonunion, or high index of suspicion for a stress fracture with a normal radiograph, but these are not routine studies.
