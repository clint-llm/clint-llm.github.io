Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides an accurate assessment of pelvic prolapse. MRI provides a better anatomic detail compared to the translabial ultrasound and is also useful as a preoperative tool. Furthermore, the MRI examination does not require bowel preparation and does not involve sensitive pelvic exposure. Despite its benefits, the MRI is not widely available, expensive, and contraindicated in patients with MRI incompatible devices or hardware.

The patient lies supine in the MRI scanner. This examination utilizes a 1.5 or 3.0 Tesla magnet. Despite the fact pelvic prolapse is most prominent in the upright position, obtaining the images supine does not significantly compromise the diagnostic accuracy.

The interpretation of the images involves drawing the following lines: pubococcygeal line, M-Line, H-Line, and the anorectal angle.
