There are about 60 reported cases in the literature, making CHILD syndrome a very rare condition. This disorder is lethal to males, who die in utero; however, almost all patients presenting with this condition are females. Nevertheless, there have been 2 reported cases involving living, male patients. One of them had a normal 46 XY karyotype, and Happle et al. explained this finding as a possible early somatic mutation.
