Peters anomaly is a rare congenital disorder of the anterior segment of the eye.

This iridocorneal adhesion can present as thin filaments, thick bands, or arcuate sheets. In 1974, Townsend et al. classified the Peters anomaly into three types.****Type I involves the cornea alone and presents as a central corneal opacity. Type II presents with corneo-lenticular touch and corneal opacity. Type III has central corneal opacity with Rieger mesodermal dysgenesis.

Type I has iridocorneal adhesion with corneal opacity. Type I predominantly involves one eye. Corneal opacity density varies from mild to severe with a clear peripheral cornea.

Type II most commonly presents bilaterally. In type II, the lens is directly adherent to the posterior corneal opacity. The lens is cataractous in type II, but it is in the center. The systemic association is more in type II patients. The term Peters-Plus syndrome was first proposed by VanSchooneveld et al. in 1984.

If the Peters anomaly presents with systemic manifestations like cleft lip/palate, short stature, abnormal ears, and intellectual disability, it is called a Peters plus syndrome.
