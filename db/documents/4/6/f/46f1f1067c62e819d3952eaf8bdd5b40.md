**Scapholunate Dissociation**

DISI

Dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI) is one complication of chronic scapholunate dissociation.

SLAC Wrist

Scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC) is a complication of chronic scapholunate dissociation and resulting DISI deformity.

- Stage I: arthritis between the scaphoid and radial styloid

- Stage II: arthritis between the scaphoid, radial styloid, and entire scaphoid fossa of the radius

- Stage III: arthritis between the scaphoid, radial styloid, scaphoid fossa, and capitolunate joint

- Stage IV: the whole of the carpus gets arthritic

**Lun****otriquetral Dissociation**

VISI

Volar intercalated segment instability (VISI) malignment is a complication of chronic lunotriquetral dissociation.

In the setting of lunotriquetral dissociation, the VISI malalignment is dissociative as there is dysfunction between bones of the same carpal row. VISI can also occur in a carpal instability non-dissociative pattern in which the dysfunction occurs between either the proximal and distal row or proximal row and radius. On physical examination, the mid-carpal shift test will induce a clunk in patients with CIND-VISI, as this is a test of dynamic instability. The wrist is pronated and flexed and moved passively into ulnar deviation. The clunk will occur near the terminal ulnar deviation as the abnormally flexed proximal row suddenly extends.
