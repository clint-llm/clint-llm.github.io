The palmaris longus belongs to the anterior forearm flexor group in the human upper extremity. The muscle attaches proximally to the medial humeral epicondyle and distally to the palmar aponeurosis and flexor retinaculum. The muscle is long and slender with variable morphology but commonly arises and inserts as a narrow tendinous structure with a widened muscular belly in the middle third. The muscle belly is spindle-shaped.Â Anatomically, the muscle crosses the elbow and wrist joints and consequently contributes to flexion at these joints; however, the muscle is small, and the actual contribution is likely minimal as an accessory flexor at these joints. The palmaris longus commonly sends a slip of distal tendon that inserts into the abductor pollicis brevis muscle of the thenar muscle group and may contribute to thumb abduction.
