Due to the significant differences between individuals in the location of auditory-sensitive neurons and the various anatomical conformations of the primary auditory cortex, extensive pre-operative planning is necessary to reduce the possibility of damaging critical language and sound-sensitive areas. Functional mapping of the auditory cortex almost always needs to take place before surgical operations that could involve regions of the primary auditory cortex and is the gold standard pre-operative procedure. Functional MRI visualization of brain areas sensitive to auditory stimuli are not specific enough and cannot delineate clear margins necessary to determine which brain tissue is critical for sound and language functions and should only serve as an adjunctive method to visualize auditory-associated areas.
