La Crosse encephalitis is a mosquito-borne arboviral disease that is most commonly seen in the mid-Atlantic and midwestern areas of the United States. The disease gets its name from La Crosse County in Wisconsin, where the illness was first observed by physicians in the 1960s.

The illness results from the La Crosse virus, which is part of the Bunyaviridae family of the California serogroup 18,19,20,45, and is spread via transmission from the eastern treehole mosquito, also known as Aedes triseriatus. This mosquito is recognized as the primary host and vector for the La Crosse virus.

Two other species of mosquitos, the Aedes albopictus as well as the Aedes japonicus, have also been identified as vectors in the transmission of the La Crosse virus and likely play an emerging role in the maintenance of the virus in endemic areas.
