A patient with vitreous hemorrhage may present with complaints of floaters, haziness, perception of shadows, or cobwebs. It is usually painless. Visual acuity may be affected variably depending upon the amount of blood in the visual axis. Only a 12.5 microliters of diffuse blood in 5 ml aphakic eye and 10 microliters in 4 ml phakic eye can lead to a drop in visual acuity to hand motions.

The best-corrected visual acuity should be recorded. A relative afferent pupillary defect should be ruled out, the presence of which may be noted in cases with retinal detachment, macular disorder or optic nerve disease. On slit-lamp examination, the anterior segment may show neovascularization of iris and angle. Any keratic precipitates, flare, cells may suggest an inflammatory etiology. RBCs may be seen in the anterior vitreous face. Intraocular pressure must be recorded.

Vitreous hemorrhage is seen as blood floating in vitreous, occluding the view of retina variably. The typical boat shape of subhyaloid hemorrhage may be noted. In cases where retinal tear or detachment is suspected, thorough retinal evaluation with scleral depression is necessary. A thorough examination of the fellow eye is recommended as it may show diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachment, vasculitis, retinoschisis, or other features. Meticulous search should be done for the source of blood from abnormal blood vessels (retinal or optic disc neovascularization, or breakthrough hemorrhages from large choroidal neovascular membrane) or normal blood vessels (avulsion of the vessel due to vitreous traction, trauma, and other reasons).

History of systemic diseases like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, family history of any blood dyscrasias should be elicited. History of ocular trauma, violent cough, heavy weight lifting, previous ocular surgery should be asked.
