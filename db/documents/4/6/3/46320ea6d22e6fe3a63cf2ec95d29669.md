Somnambulism is a common arousal disorder that is mostly benign and does not require treatment. No clinical studies have been carried out to assess the efficacy of somnambulism treatments to date. However, it has been observed that scheduled waking or hypnosis exhibits the greatest benefit with the least adverse effects in cases where sleepwalking is causing distress to the patient or family.

Scheduled waking refers to waking the patient 15-30 minutes before their usual sleepwalking time. Hypnosis providing the hypnotic suggestion that the patient will wake up if they touch the ground with their feet is based on a similar concept of interrupting the sleepwalking phenomenon. Both interventions have to be practiced every day for the duration of two to three weeks.

Safety precautions like locking windows and external doors and removing breakable objects are recommended to decrease the risk of injuries.

No medication has been approved for the treatment of sleepwalking, but clinical experience indicates some benefit of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) enhancing agents like clonazepam or gabapentin if taken one hour before sleep.
