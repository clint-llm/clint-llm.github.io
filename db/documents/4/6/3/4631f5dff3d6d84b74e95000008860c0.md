A registered nurse usually provides monitoring of the patient's general condition with particular attention to the consequences of the procedure. Nursing also includesÂ administering medications and monitoring the patient in the immediate period after the procedure. Close monitoring in a dedicated holding area in the vicinity of the interventional suite is essential. Direct intervention can then take place; this is not commonly needed, but it should be available.
