Saxitoxin and the related paralytic shellfish toxins are selective sodium channel blockers that reversibly bind the voltage-gated sodium channels of neurons. The toxin binds to the channel of the protein and blocks the flow of sodium ions. Saxitoxin is water soluble and both heat-stable and acid-stable. Thus standard cooking methods do not eliminate the toxin. Domoic acid damages the hippocampus and the amygdala by activating the AMPA and kainate receptors of neurons, starting an uncontrolled influx of calcium that causes the cells to degenerate. Domoic acid has also been shown to cause renal damage at doses much lower than those required to cause neurologic symptoms. Okadaic acid is a powerful protein phosphatase inhibitor; this inhibition results in loss of control over sodium secretion and solute permeability in the cell. Brevetoxins bind to voltage-sensitive sodium channels of neurons and muscle cells, lowering the activation potential of neurons and causing them to fire repetitively.
