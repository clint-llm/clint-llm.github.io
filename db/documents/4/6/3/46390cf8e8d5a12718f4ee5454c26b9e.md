Cystic hygromas are benign lesions, and if asymptomatic, they do not necessitate treatment. Indications for treatment include infection, hemorrhage, respiratory distress, dysphagia, or disfigurement. The mainstay of management is surgical; however, other options include sclerotherapy, drainage, radio-frequency ablation, or cauterization.

Cystic hygromas that develop into abscesses will require antibiotics, antipyretics, and analgesia, with or without subsequent surgical management. Surgical treatment, if needed, is usually withheld till the next three months after the antibiotic course.
