In any patient presenting with abdominal symptoms, vasculitis should merit consideration if the history, examination, investigation, or imaging data lead to suspicion of the same.Â Most of the symptoms are due to ischemia of the intestines, leading to infarction. Ischemic colitis due to mesenteric vasculitis presents similar to ischemic colitis from atherosclerotic disease. Abdominal pain, tenderness, and rectal bleeding are the most common symptoms, while nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can also be present.
