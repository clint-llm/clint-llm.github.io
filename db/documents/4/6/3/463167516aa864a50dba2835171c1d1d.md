Baseline and periodic serum bicarbonate levels are required monitoring protocols for individuals on topiramate due to concern for metabolic acidosis. Renal function tests should be monitored. According to the American Epilepsy Society, antiepileptic drug-level testing(including topiramate) should not be routinely obtained when the seizures are controlled with no adverse effects. However, monitoring topiramate levels is advised in special cases requiring weight-based dose adjustments in young children, patient adherence, polypharmacy, and suspected toxicity. Since there is variability in topiramate plasma concentration with concomitant AED use, monitoring plasma concentration may be beneficial for optimizing drug dosage.

Monitor for a reduction in the frequency of the most debilitating seizures (drop attacks and tonic-clonic seizures) when topiramate is used for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS)

Monitor for a reduction in the frequency and severity of headaches. A decrease in the frequency of migraine days is a key measure of the efficacy of migraine prevention.
