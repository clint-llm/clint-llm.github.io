Although most patients with diarrhea will not require any laboratory evaluations, tests are a recommended step after several days have passed with no resolution of symptoms or if the initial treatments were unsuccessful. If the disease is severe, refractory, or affecting high-risk patients, testing may merit more urgent consideration.

Stool studies should preferably take place using a fresh diarrheal stool. The presence of white blood cells (fecal leukocytes) might be a sign of inflammation, although the sensitivity is 70 percent and specificity only 50 percent.

Multi-pathogen molecular panels that identify the genetic material of the organisms can be helpful and may identify the source of infection within hours rather than days for standard culture techniques.

For C. difficile diagnosis, nucleic acid amplification is a process for diagnosis confirmation. Initial screening usually involves stool tests for C. difficile toxin and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) antigen. The presence of pseudomembranous colitis either in imaging or endoscopy is also beneficial.
