A peripheral blood smear is a standard way to evaluate the red blood cells. Often, it is ordered to confirm the findings on a complete blood count (CBC), evaluate the white blood cells and platelets, and finally analyze the erythrocyte shape, size, color, arrangements and inclusion bodies.  Blood samples are obtained from peripheral veins and stored in a bottle with an anticoagulant solution, usually ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and should undergo testing within 2 hours. A sample of blood is deposited on a glass side with a pipette or capillary tube, and a spreader is used to smear the blood. The slide is then dried, labeled and stained with any additional stains deemed necessary.
