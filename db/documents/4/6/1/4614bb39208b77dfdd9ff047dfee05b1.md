Phenoxybenzamine is a medication used in the management and treatment of paroxysmal hypertension and sweating resulting from pheochromocytoma. It is in the nonselective, irreversible antagonist of the alpha-adrenergic receptors class of drugs. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for phenoxybenzamine as a valuable agent in the treatment of paroxysmal hypertension and sweating resulting from pheochromocytoma and benign prostate hyperplasia. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with pheochromocytoma and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of phenoxybenzamine.
- Describe the adverse effects of phenoxybenzamine.
- Review the appropriate monitoring of phenoxybenzamine.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance phenoxybenzamine and improve outcomes.
