- NPS is a rare multisystemic genetic condition with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern involving mutations of the LMX1B protein leading to various yet characteristic clinical manifestations.

- The classic clinical tetrad of NPS consists of the involvement of the nails, knees, elbows, and the presence of iliac horns, each of which is readily apparent on physical exam and/or imaging. Iliac horns are pathognomonic for the condition.

- Renal failure is an uncommon but serious complication and the primary influencer of patient mortality.

- Prognosis is good with screening precautions and early intervention of symptoms under the care of an interprofessional healthcare team.
