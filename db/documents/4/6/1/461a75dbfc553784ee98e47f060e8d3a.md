Performing CRRT requires a collaborative team effort not only during the procedure but also prior to and after the procedure. The participation of experts in each domain, a specialist with expertise in critical nephrology, and a well-trained team of CRRT nurses may assist in priority establishment, implementation of quality control processes, and implementation of standardized policies.

The involvement of specialists external to conventional intensive care staff with expertise in critically ill patients is not a new practice. The following is a list of external groups involved in the interprofessional management of patients on CRRT:

- Respiratory care practitioners

- Nutritional support team

- Clinical pharmacology

- Diagnostic and interventional radiology

- Cardiology

- Rehabilitation and physiotherapy
