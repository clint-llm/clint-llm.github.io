It is important to perform a thorough evaluation of isolated fibular shaft fractures to ensure they are, in fact, isolated. As in most orthopedic injury evaluations, it is good practice to check one joint above and below the injury. The knee should be checked for any ligamentous instability, and the ankle should be evaluated for any injury. Dedicated films of the knee and ankle are especially important to rule out other fractures in addition to lower-leg x rays. A fracture at the fibular neck without any other fractures in the rest of the fibula or tibia is pathognomonic for a syndesmotic injury and is termed a Maisonneuve fracture. This, by definition, cannot be an isolated fibula shaft fracture due to ligamentous involvement and will require different treatment. Likewise, a fracture of the fibula within 15 cm of the ankle joint is likely to have either bony involvement of the tibia, ligamentous injury, or both.
