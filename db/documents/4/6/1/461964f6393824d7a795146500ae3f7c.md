Mycobacterium avium complex is ubiquitous and has been reported from the Americas, Asia, and Europe. There are pockets of high prevalence throughout the world. In the United States, the prevalence varies from 1.4 to 6.6 per 100,000 population, but no endemic area has been recognized. Recently a trend towards increasing Mycobacterium avium complex infections has been identified. A seasonal trend in mycobacterial infections around the incidence cycle of 12 months, with peaks in late winter/spring and troughs in autumn, was noted. Women had a higher prevalence, up to 1.6 fold relative to men. A study done in Australia has shown a higher male prevalence (OR 2.1). The differences may be due to the nature of pulmonary involvement. Women have increased predilection for the nodular/bronchiectatic disease also known as Lady Windermere syndrome. Mycobacterium avium complex has been isolated from the environment from the soil, aerosolized water, bathrooms, house dust, birds, farm animals, hot water systems, cigarette components, and house dust. The ecological niche of this organism has not been identified.
