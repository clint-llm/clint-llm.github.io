There are many muscles involved in shoulder girdle movement and stability. The function of the coracoclavicular ligament is to allow complex shoulder movement without separation of the scapula from the clavicle. Major muscles that cause movement around these structures include the serratus anterior, trapezius, teres major, rhomboid major, rhomboid minor, and triceps brachii (long head). Although other muscles may be included in this list, each muscle listed attaches directly to the scapula and obtains additional mechanical stability, restriction in movement, from the coracoclavicular ligament.

The tendon of the pectoralis minor crosses the fascial arch created by the MCCL at the level of the coracoid process.
