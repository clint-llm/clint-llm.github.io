As stated above, most of the evidence for EMS treatment of pediatric asthma is extrapolated from studies in the ED setting. Future directions for EMS treatment must come from research originating in the heterogeneous and mobile EMS environment. Medical directors and providers would be well-served by keeping abreast of developments in the literature to ensure protocols contain the most up-to-date evidence. Continuing provider education on the assessment and management of the most common chronic disease of childhood is essential for the proper care of pediatric asthma patients.
