The World Health Organization (WHO) defines child maltreatment as "all forms of physical and emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, and exploitation that results in actual or potential harm to the childâ€™s health, development or dignity." There are four main types of abuse: neglect (physical or emotional), physical abuse, psychological abuse, and sexual abuse. Abuse or maltreatment is defined as an act of commission, and neglect is defined as an act of omission in the care of a child leading to potential or actual harm. This activity reviews the epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, and reporting requirements for child abuse in New York State. It highlights the role of the inter-professional team in its management and prevention.
