Like all psychiatric disorders, the prevention of postpartum blues would involve mediation of the major risk factors. Unlike most other psychiatric disorders, however, most of the risk factors for postpartum blues – such as parity, delivery status, history of depression or bipolar disorder, or history of menstrual-related mood changes – are nonmodifiable. However, the most important factor in managing postpartum blues is the early identification of symptoms, prompt intervention, facilitation of open discussions with patients and their families, and access to mental health resources and professionals. It is also important that patients are screened for suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation towards the infant, paranoia, or psychotic features. It is also essential if symptoms were to develop and be identified that resources are in place to ensure that new mothers feel adequately supported.
