The history and physical of enthesopathies depends on the location of the affected entheses. The patient may complain of decreased range of motion of the affected area as well as localized pain. Inspection may reveal localized swelling or erythema. Pain may be elicited by palpating the affected area as well as ranging the affected joint. Range of motion should be assessed both actively and passively for mechanical deficits and pain limitations.

If a diffuse inflammatory disease is suspected, a more thorough physical exam should include the evaluation of commonly affected areas such as the sacroiliac joints, Achilles tendon, and distal interphalangeal joints. Moreover, asking a broad review of systems may reveal the underlying cause of enthesitis, such as weight loss, night sweats, chills, or any other constitutional symptoms.
