An interprofessional approach in evaluation, treatment, and care of patients with bullous systemic lupus erythematosus cannot be over-emphasized.

Primary care physicians, rheumatologists, and dermatologists play a key role in early diagnosis. The histopathology mimics of BSLE can be a source of a wrong diagnosis and delay of treatment, thus the need for an experienced pathologist.

Skincare by trained and dedicated nurses of the skin lesions, especially when ruptured leaving behind crusts and erosions, is also important.

Clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists also need to educate their patients on the disease condition, medications, and their potential side effects.

In cases with concomitant lupus nephritis, neuropsychiatric lupus, and hematologic complications, other subspecialties such as nephrology, neurology, and hematology may be needed.

Most importantly, the patient and family need to be involved in the treatment strategies, especially on decisions to escalate treatment to immunosuppressants. [Level 5]
