Despite hormonal and biomechanical advantages compared to females, approximately one-third of men still may experience one or more osteoporotic fractures in their life. Osteoporosis in men can be classified into two categories, primary and secondary. Secondary causes represent about 50% of cases in males.

Primary osteoporosis can be further divided into (1) involutional osteoporosis, i.e patients older than 70 years old when no other risk factor is present, and (2) idiopathic osteoporosis, i.e patients younger than 70 years old with no apparent risk factor.

Idiopathic osteoporosis occurs in men younger than 70 years old. In these individuals, osteoporosis is considered idiopathic since there is no obvious reason for premature low bone mass, however that could be multifactorial, related to inadequate peak in bone mass, undiagnosed genetic problems, sedentary lifestyle, or other undiagnosed comorbidities. These patients also might have a mild defect in aromatization.

The major causes of secondary osteoporosis are hypogonadism (including men on androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer), alcohol abuse, glucocorticoid excess (endogenous or exogenous), malabsorption (including inflammatory bowel disease, primary biliary cirrhosis and post gastric bypass), chronic kidney disease (associated secondary hyperparathyroidism), primary hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, systemic illnesses (malignancy, multiple myeloma, mastocytosis), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV infection, inflammatory rheumatic diseases, anticonvulsants, and chemotherapeutics. More recently type 1 and type 2 diabetes have also been recognized as a risk factor for osteoporosis, despite patients usually presenting with normal or above normal BMD on the DEXA scan.

The mechanisms behind increased bone fragility in diabetes mellitus are multifactorial and include microvascular disease, oxidative stress, advanced glycation endproducts that compromise the quality of collagen type I, and increased inflammatory factors and adipokines. Additional factors include certain diabetes medications such as thiazolidinediones and canagliflozin and an increased propensity for falls, likely due to hypoglycemia.

Other than the conditions mentioned above that are causes of secondary osteoporosis in male, non-modifiable risk factors are age equal or more than 70 years old, white ethnicity, and delayed puberty. Modifiable risk factors are alcohol abuse, smoking, low BMI, and a sedentary lifestyle.
