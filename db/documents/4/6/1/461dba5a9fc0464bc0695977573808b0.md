- Simulation was borne out of the field of aviation and has expanded across all medical specialties and professional fields in healthcare. There are new and innovative ways of teaching medicine via simulation. Internal medicine training programs are using simulation in their educational curriculum.

- There are limitations to medical simulation. However, creative solutions can bridge problems with cost, resource requirements, and personnel. The simulation will take time to be universally accepted by the medical community.

- Internal medicine residency programs use the simulation for training and to assess clinical competency, specifically the ACGME milestones.

- Simulation improves procedural skills, medical decision making, leadership, and communication, which may lead to downstream benefits in patient care and outcomes.

- Simulation has further potential to transform CME and the board certification process. Simulation realistically captures the interplay of medical knowledge, decision making, and communication that affect patient outcomes.

- It is essential to realize that simulation is not a replacement for clinical learning. Simulation is geared to address educational gaps in training and prevent patient harm.
