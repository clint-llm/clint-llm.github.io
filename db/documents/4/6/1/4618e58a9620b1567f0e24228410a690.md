Lymphomatoid papulosis is a non-aggressive T-cell lymphoma characterized by recurrent, spontaneously regressive papulonodular and sometimes, necrotic lesions, often disseminated with histologic features suggestive of a CD30-positive lymphoma. It accounts for about 12% of cutaneous lymphomas. It is classified, alongside primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, in the group of T-cell proliferations expressing CD30.
