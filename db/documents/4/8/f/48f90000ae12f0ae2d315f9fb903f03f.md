Patients must undergo exercise capacity testing to determine the severity of disease and assess their response to treatment. Therefore, before beginning therapy, all patients should have a baseline exercise assessment done. Objective measurement is the 6-minute walk test, which is an independent predictor of mortality and can assess response to therapy. From exercise capacity, a patientâ€™s functional class can be determined as per WHO Functional Classification for Pulmonary Hypertension.
