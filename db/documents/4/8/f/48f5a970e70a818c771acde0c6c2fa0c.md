Patient education is necessary to understand the etiology, acute and chronic clinical progression of the condition, and its strong association with underlying malignancy. They should be educated about the variable course of the disease, which may lead to a delay in diagnosis. Furthermore, patients should be encouraged to follow up after hospital discharge with their respective neurologist /oncologist due to concerns of relapse and screening for malignancy.

These patients should undergo imaging every six months for at least four years to look for any growth of tumor or metastasis, which might not be evident early and can lead to neurological manifestations. Families should be involved in the process of healthcare decision-making whenever possible as they may notice unusual changes in the patient's behavior or possible seizures. Moreover, patients should be educated about the side effects of chronic therapy with steroids and the role of immunosuppressive treatment, which may put them at risk of infection or systemic side effects.
