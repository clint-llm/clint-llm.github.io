When any tissue is irradiated, the cells comprising the tissue are damaged primarily by the generation of free radicals, predominantly by the hydroxyl radical. In addition to inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, free radicals react with DNA to cause strand disruption, preventing proper replication and protein synthesis. Cardiomyocytes are stable cells and are therefore relatively resistant to radiation. However, modern therapeutic doses of radiation are sufficient to cause damage to the microvasculature of the myocardium.

The pericardium may become acutely inflamed, leading to pericarditis or pericardial effusion. The pericardium can also develop chronic fibrosis, resulting in constrictive pericarditis. In the myocardium, the diffuse development of infiltrative fibrosis impairs the ability of the ventricles to relax, resulting in diastolic failure. These fibrotic changes can also affect the conduction system in the heart and result in the development of arrhythmias later in life. In the years following radiation therapy, the valvular endothelium can break down or become fibrotic, leading to regurgitation or stenosis.
