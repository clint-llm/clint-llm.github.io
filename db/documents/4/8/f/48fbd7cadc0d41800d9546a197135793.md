Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene must have mutations for the manifestation of the disease. NPD types A and B are caused by missense mutations in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1) gene. Over 180 mutations in SMPD1 have been identified. NPD type C is caused by mutations in NPC1 (located on chromosome 18) and NPC2 (located on chromosome 14) genes. The mutations in these genes lead to abnormal or defective formation of proteins, which impair the movement of lipids out of the cells, leading to their accumulation within the cells.
