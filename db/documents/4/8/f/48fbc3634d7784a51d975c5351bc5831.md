Scleritis is a severe ocular inflammatory condition affecting the sclera, the outer covering of the eye. It can be categorized as anterior with diffuse, nodular, or necrotizing subtypes and posterior with diffuse or nodular subtypes. Scleritis can be visually significant, depending on the severity and presentation and any associated systemic conditions.
