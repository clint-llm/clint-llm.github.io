An absolute contraindication would be a patient who could not medically tolerate the anesthesia or possible sequelae of the surgery. An active, untreated urinary tract infection would be another absolute contraindication.

Relative contraindications would be post-radiation therapy for prostate cancer, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's, as these patient groups have a high likelihood of postoperative incontinence due to a dysfunctional external sphincter.Â Active anticoagulation is another relative contraindication to a traditional TURP, but a laser TURP can be performed on anticoagulated patients, or blood thinners can be appropriately withheld briefly to allow for the procedure. If a prostate is extremely large, greater than 100 grams, this is usually an indication to consider performing a simple prostatectomy or HoLEP, as most urologists do not possess the necessary skill or experience to perform a TURP of that size safely. A severely hyperactive bladder that is not easily controllable is also a relative contraindication.
