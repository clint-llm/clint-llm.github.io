Before undergoing percutaneous or open mitral valve repair for mitral stenosis, the patient will need a complete workup with labs, imaging, and full history with a physical exam. The patient will need a 2-D cardiac transthoracic echo to evaluate the entire heart to rule out other possible surgical interventions while in the operating room. A transesophageal echo is mandatory prior to scheduling a percutaneous mitral valve balloon valvuloplasty to rule out any left atrial thrombus, the severity of any mitral regurgitation, or any other valve abnormality.

A cardiac structural specialist may be necessary to view the echo. You must review all echo studies and discuss the best approach for your patient not only based on the valve pathology but also on their lung function, pulmonary pressures, body surface area, and cardiac/non-cardiac functional disability. All surgical procedures, whether performed in the hybrid room or operating room, should be performed within a sterile field with all precautions taken to maintain sterility.
