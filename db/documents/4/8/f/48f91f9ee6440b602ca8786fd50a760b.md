The toxicity of CCl4 is dangerous because of hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity that may develop with even small amounts such as cleaning a carpet in an apartment. Clinical presentation of CCl4 toxicity classifies into three phases.

- **Phase 1:**Presenting symptoms in this phase include headaches and gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and colicky abdominal pain.

- **Phase 2:**This phase is a free interval where the patient has increasing liver tests without causing symptoms and is the most common.

- **Phase 3:**This phase is rare; the patient develops overt liver disease, liver failure, respiratory insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and renal insufficiency.

In the respiratory system, pronounced pulmonary edema develops that causes lungs to be voluminous and very heavy. The bronchus may also become filled with edematous fluid.
