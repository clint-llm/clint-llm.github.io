Spinal hemangiomas are the most common primary tumor of the spine. These lesions are of vascular origin and usually involve a proliferation of normal capillary and venous structures. These are usually an incidental finding found on radiological imaging of the body and spine. A minority of these lesions can be associated with symptoms, primarily involving back pain and neurologic complaints with some estimates of 0.9% to 1.2% becoming symptomatic. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of spinal hemangiomas and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and histopathology of spinal hemangiomas.
- Describe a complete evaluation and workup for patients presenting with suspected spinal hemangioma.
- Summarize the appropriate treatment options and case management for spinal hemangioma.
- Review the importance of coordination of the interprofessional team to provide optimal care to patients with spinal hemangiomas and monitor for potential complications.
