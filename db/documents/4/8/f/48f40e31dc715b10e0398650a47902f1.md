Thromboxane A2 (TxA2) is in the family of lipids known as eicosanoids, which are metabolites of arachidonic acid generated by the sequential action of three enzymes – phospholipase A2, COX-1/COX-2 and TxA2 Synthase (TXAS). TxA2 was originally described as being released from platelets and is now known to be released by a variety of other cells including macrophages, neutrophils, and endothelial cells. Named after its role in thrombosis, TxA2 has prothrombotic properties, as it stimulates the activation of platelets and platelet aggregation. TxA2 is also a known vasoconstrictor and gets activated during times of tissue injury and inflammation. While the prostaglandin counterbalances its thrombotic and vasoconstrictor properties prostacyclin (PGI2), there are various physiological and pathological situations where this balanced becomes dysregulated.
