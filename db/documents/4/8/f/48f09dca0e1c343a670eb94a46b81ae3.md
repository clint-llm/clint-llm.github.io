The kinase protein family that includes MAP, RAS, RAF, MEK, and ERK play an important role in regulating intracellular and extracellular signaling pathways which control cellular growth, differentiation, transformation, and programmed death (apoptosis).  In a normal cell line, these kinases work accordingly in a cascade of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation when stimulated by growth factors and eventually leading to regulation of cellular growth and proliferation in an organized manner. However, if the genes coding for these kinases has mutations, this can lead to uninhibited continuous growth of the cell, which is manifested clinically by cancer formation.

Rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) family was first described in 1983 and was named as such due to its role in inducing fibrosarcoma in certain mice models.

The most common activating mutation in BRAF is the substitution of glutamic acid for valine at amino acid codon 600 (V600E mutation), and less commonly is the V600K which is the substitution of lysine for valine. In clinical practice, several medications which inhibit BRAF have been approved for the treatment of malignant melanoma with positive BRAF mutations. These medications did not show similar efficacy in other cancers harboring the BRAF mutation other than malignant melanoma. The first BRAF inhibitor that came into clinical use was Vemurafenib.

**Indications**

Vemurafenib has been approved through BRIM trials (phase I, II, III) after showing increased overall survival and progression-free survival in studied patients with malignant melanoma with BRAF V600E positive mutation. The phase I BRIM established the optimal dose of the medication, which was found to be 960 mg twice a day taken orally.

**FDA-labeled Indications**

- Metastatic and unresectable melanoma with V600 mutation

- Erdheim- Chester disease (Non-Langerhans histiocytic disorder)

**Non-FDA-labeled Indications**

- Metastatic and unresectable melanoma with BRAF V600K

- Refractory non-small cell lung carcinoma BRAF V600 mutation
