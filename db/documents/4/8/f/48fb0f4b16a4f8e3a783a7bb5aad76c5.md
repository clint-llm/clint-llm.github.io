Overall goals of preparticipation evaluation are to identify medical problems and treat them before initiating the activity. This includes the identification and treatment of conditions that might interfere with performance and cause damage or injury. In doing so, the evaluation hopes to maximize the participation of the athlete but minimize the potential dangers and complications. Many leagues and clubs ask for preparticipation evaluation 6 to 8 weeks before the start day to have enough time to do additional testing, if required. Many of them also ask for a yearly re-evaluation if there is a change in the level of participation.

Chances of sudden cardiac death are minimal in the overall population, but 1 in 100,000 young athletes per year is considered at risk.
