The origin of the facial artery is near the deep superior cervical lymph nodes.  The submandibular lymph nodes lie adjacent to the facial artery as it courses toward the face superficially.  As the artery crests over the body of the mandible, the submandibular and facial lymph nodes remain deep to this vessel.
