DSM–5 criteria for diagnosing depression in the pediatric population:

- The presence of at least 5 of the following items in the same 2-week period with having a change in the level of function. At least 1 of the items is either a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. It is important to note that other medical conditions can not explain symptoms.

- Depressed or irritable mood most of the day, almost every day, as demonstrated by either subjective report, for example, the patient feels sad, empty, or hopeless, or observation made by others, for example, the patient appears sad. 
- A significant decrease in interest or pleasure in activities most of the day, nearly every day as indicated by self-reporting or observation
- Failure to make expected weight gain or remarkable weight loss when not dieting or a remarkable weight gain, or decrease or increase in daily appetite
- Lack of sleep or excessive sleeping almost every day
- Psychomotor unrest or retardation almost every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness).
- Lack of energy nearly every day
- Feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt (possibly delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reported or guilt for being sick)
- Decrease capacity to think or concentrate or indecisiveness, almost every day (either by self-report or as observed by others)
- Repeated thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without specific plans; suicide attempt; or a definite plan to commit suicide

- The illness causes clinically remarkable distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

- The episode is not due to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition

- The occurrence of the major depressive episode cannot be explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders
