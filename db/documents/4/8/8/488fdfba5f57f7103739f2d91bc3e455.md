Although benign mesothelioma is generally non-problematic long-term, complications are possible following surgery, even though it is a relatively harmless disease. The most common complication encountered is fluid buildup in the pleural spaces, which can potentially lead to pressure in the lungs and heart. In these instances, treatment is to surgically remove the excess fluid and install a fitted chest drain to remove excess fluid and prevent effusion.
