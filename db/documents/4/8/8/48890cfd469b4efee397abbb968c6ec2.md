During normal pregnancy, the female body undergoes physiologic changes in almost every organ system to harbor the growing fetoplacental unit. The hematologic system is no exception to this convention as the maternal blood undergoes changes both in quantity as well as its constitution. The constituents of maternal blood are testable to screen and diagnose a wide variety of conditions relating to both healthy pregnancies as well as diseases associated with pregnancy.

A little before reaching full term, the volume of maternal blood is about 30% above baseline. The excess is likely due to increased levels of estrogenÂ and aldosterone, which cause the kidneys to retain higher amounts of fluid. A higher number of erythrocytes accompanies this excess fluid with a slightly increased mean corpuscular volume in a healthy pregnancy.

The prominent hematologic changes are physiologic anemia, expanded plasma volume, mild thrombocytopenia, a mild prothrombotic state, and in some individuals, mild neutrophilia. Other than the above changes, maternal blood also contains a wide number of other antigens, proteins, and hormones of clinical significance.
