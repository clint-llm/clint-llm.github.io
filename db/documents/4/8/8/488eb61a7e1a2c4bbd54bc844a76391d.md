Piloleiomyomas characteristically present as either a solitary dermal nodule or multiple dermal nodules in a clustered, linear, dermatomal, or scattered distribution. When multiple piloleiomyomas are present, it is not unusual to have two separate collections in different anatomical locations. The nodules range in size from 2 mm to 20 mm and may be skin-tone, pink, red, or red-brown in color. Solitary piloleiomyomas tend to present on the lower extremity, while multiple piloleiomyomas frequently present on the extensor surface of extremities and trunk.Â  The most common presenting complaint amongst patients with multiple piloleiomyomas is a pain, which may occur spontaneously or with provocation by pressure, cold temperatures, strong emotion, or light touch. The pain is typically described as a sharp, shooting, or aching in quality. Most patients begin to develop these lesions between 20 to 40 years of age.

Genital leiomyomas, as their name implies typically develop on the genitals, including the scrotum, penis, and vulva, but they may also be found on the nipple-areolar complex. The lesions are generally an asymptomatic, solitary nodule. On occasion, they may present as a pedunculated lesion which may lead to their dismissal as an acrochordon or a genital wart.

Angioleiomyomas usually present in females in their 40s to 60s as a firm, often painful, subcutaneous nodule on the lower extremity.
