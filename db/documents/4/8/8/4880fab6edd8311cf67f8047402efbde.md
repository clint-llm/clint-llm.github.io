Contraindications to intracoronary stent placement tend to be due to systemic conditions that place patients at prohibitive risk to receive the necessary medications that are needed to be given during the procedure or after a stent has been deployed. Contraindications to the procedure are an inability to consume anti-platelet medications, significant anemia, and significant thrombocytopenia. Another contraindication, or relative contraindication, to the procedure is sepsis with active bacteremia and significant renal dysfunction and any significant comorbid condition where the possible harm of the procedure outweighs the possible benefit.
