Cellular integrity of RBCs is maintained by membrane-bound ATPases. ATPases exchange sodium for potassium. This maintains transcellular electrochemical neutrality, cellular fluid balance, and deformability.

Neonatal RBCs consume more ATP than in adults.

Dilutional anemia occurs in the second trimester of pregnancy in these patients. Plasma volume increases more than RBC mass.****Episodic hemolysis may require RBC transfusion replacement.
