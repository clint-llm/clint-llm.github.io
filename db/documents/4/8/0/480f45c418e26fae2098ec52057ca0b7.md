Patients affected with pemphigus herpetiformis typically have a subacute onset of disease. The diagnosis of pemphigus herpetiformis is rarely established at the first consultation, as the clinical presentation is usually atypical, and other diseases can be hypothesized such as dermatitis herpetiformis, bullous pemphigoid, and linear IgA bullous dermatosis. Patients affected with pemphigus herpetiformis usually show erythematous, vesicular, bullous, pustular or papular lesions, often in a "herpetiform" pattern and with severe pruritus. Skin lesions tend to present with annular-shaped distribution, probably due to the centrifugal spread of inflammatory processes. In some cases, the main lesions can be urticarial itching papules and plaques. These features are not frequently seen in pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceous. The affected sites for pemphigus herpetiformis are mostly the trunk and proximal extremities. Although pemphigus herpetiformis usually manifests a widespread distribution, some cases of atypical and localized lesions have been reported. However, mucous membrane involvement is not a frequent issue. During the clinical course of the disease, pemphigus herpetiformis may evolve into pemphigus vulgaris or pemphigus foliaceous. The opposite has also been reported.
