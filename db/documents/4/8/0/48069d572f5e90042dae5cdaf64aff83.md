Management of sitosterolemia requires an interprofessional approach to achieve optimal outcomes. Primary care clinicians would be the initial point of contact for patients. Identifying this disorder by a primary care provider is likely to lead to timely diagnosis and treatment, potentially improving the end outcome. Further management would generally require a lipidologist, dietician, and genetics counselor. Nursing can provide patient counseling, and the pharmacist can perform medication reconciliation and answer drug therapy questions. If the patient is in the pediatric age group, family members will also be a critical component of the team to help ensure dietary and medication compliance. The interprofessional team approach can help ensure the most optimal end outcome. [Level 5]
