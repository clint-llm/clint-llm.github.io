Essential thrombocytosis is also known as essential thrombocythemia (ET) and was formerly known as hemorrhagic thrombocythemia and is one of the myeloproliferative neoplasms. Myeloproliferative neoplasms include polycythemia vera, primary myelofibrosis, and essential polycythemia; these neoplasms are similar and share the same mutations. Essential thrombocytosis is characterized by thrombocytosis and megakaryocytic hyperplasia of the bone marrow. According to the World Health Organization, essential thrombocytosis can be diagnosed when the platelet count is over 45,0000 and there is either a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), Calreticulin (CALR) or myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) mutation, lacking clonal or reactive causes. This activity describes the presentation, cause, management, and potential complications of essential thrombocytosis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the typical presentation of essential thrombocytosis.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with
essential thrombocytosis.
- Summarize the treatment options for essential thrombocytosis.
- Explain the role of the interprofessional interprofessional team in coordinating the evaluation and management of this condition.
