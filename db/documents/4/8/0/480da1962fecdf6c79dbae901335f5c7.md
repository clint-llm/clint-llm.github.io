There is progressively dwindling of ovarian follicles as a woman ages. The ovarian estrogen and inhibin production decreases because of the loss of granulosa cells. The FSH and LH level remains high because of the lack of negative feedback from the ovary. Androgen production from the ovary continues beyond the menopausal transition because of the sparing of the stromal compartment. Menopausal women continue to have low levels of circulating estrogens, principally from peripheral aromatization of ovarian and adrenal androgens. Adipose tissue is a major site of aromatization, so obesity affects many of the sequelae of menopause. The hot flash is thought to be due to the resetting and narrowing of the thermoregulatory system in response to the variability of estrogen and FSH levels.
