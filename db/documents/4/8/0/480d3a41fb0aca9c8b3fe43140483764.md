A female worm can produce up to 200,000 eggs a day. This makes retrieval from a stool exam easier. The best diagnostic test is still the stool exam for ova and parasites, searching for large oval brown trilayered eggs with a mamillated coat. It is important to note that stool can beÂ negative while the worm migrates and matures (approximately one month). Only when worms are mature do they start secreting eggs. Sometimes an adult worm can be seen in the stool or coming out of the rectum but can also be coughed up or passed in the urine. A complete blood count can show eosinophilia during the active migration phase from the intestine to the lungs, and larvae can be found in the sputum. Abdominal x-rays can be sensitive but not specific when a whirlpool sign is present. Ultrasound and CT scans can be used to identify worms in the biliary duct and gallbladder. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can be used for diagnosis and treatment.
