Burns are injuries of the skin involving the two main layers - the thin, outer epidermis and the thicker, deeper dermis. There are various types of burns. Chemical burns are divided into acid or alkali burns. Alkali burns tend to be more severe causing more penetration deeper into the skin by liquefying the skin (liquefaction necrosis). Acid burnsÂ penetrate less because they cause a coagulation injury (coagulation necrosis). Electrical burns can be deceiving with small entry and exit wounds, however, there may be extensive internal organ injury or associated traumatic injuries. Thermal burns are the most common type of burn. Most burns are small and superficial causing only local injuries. However, burns can be larger and deeper, and patients can also have a systemic response to severe burns.
