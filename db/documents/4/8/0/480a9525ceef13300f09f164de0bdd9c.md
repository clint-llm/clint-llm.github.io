**IMAGING GUIDANCE**

Selecting the proper imaging modality depends on the clinical presentation and the suspected underlying cause. Generally, routine neuroimaging studies for patients with chronic myokymia to rule out changes affecting the pons are unnecessary because of its low yield findings. According to an American study, 13 of 15 patients who underwent computed tomographic scans (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had no mass or other abnormalities disturbing the course of the facial nerve or the brainstem.

When necessary, an MRI scan with intravenous gadolinium contrast is the optimal imaging modality because it images the whole facial nerve pathway**.**

**The sequences of facial nerve imaging:**

-  MRI of the brain to show the central pathways of the nerve.

-  MRI of the skull base and the parotid glands to detect masses associated with the extra-temporal facial nerve.

-  MRI of the temporal bones to evaluate inflammatory lesions, meningeal abnormality, and perineural extent of disease along the nerve inside the temporal bones.

-  CT scan in combination with MRI or as an alternative if there were contraindications or intolerance to MRI.

-  Ultrasound can evaluate abnormalities within the parotid gland.
