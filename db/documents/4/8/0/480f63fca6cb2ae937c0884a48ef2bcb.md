The clinical significance of protein synthesis lies not only in human translation but in differences between human and bacterial translation. The bacterial ribosome (70S) has the same core components and many structurally similar sites compared to the eukaryotic ribosome (80S). However, translational differences between humans and bacteria create targets for antimicrobial drugs. These differences allow certain antibiotics to bind selectively to bacterial ribosomes at low concentrations, targeting bacteria selectively and either inhibiting growth or killing the microbe. Several commonly prescribed antibiotics target specific components of the bacterial ribosome and mRNA. Aminoglycosides target the 30S small ribosomal subunit; specifically, this class binds to the rRNA segment active in the A site. The tetracyclines operate similarly by competing for the A site with charged aminoacyl tRNA. The macrolide antibiotics act on the 50S large ribosomal subunit. When they bind to the rRNA of the large subunit, it prevents the formation of the peptide bond and promotes the early expulsion of the tRNA in the P site.

The clinical manifestations of differences in protein synthesis can also be useful in diagnosis. Native protein electrophoresis can help identify hemoglobinopathies in newborn screenings. Similarly, serum protein electrophoresis can identify characteristic M protein spikes of monoclonal protein expression in multiple myeloma.
