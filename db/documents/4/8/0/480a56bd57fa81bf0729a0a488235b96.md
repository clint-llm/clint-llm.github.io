The falciform ligament contains no skeletal or smooth muscle fibers. However, it does share associations with surrounding skeletal musculature.Â  The ligament is connected to the inferior surface of the thoracic diaphragm and runs along the posterior sheath of the right rectus abdominis muscle where it can reach as far caudally as the umbilicus.
