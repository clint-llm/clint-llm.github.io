CG is a rare disorder with a difficult diagnosis, characterized by recurrent or persistent idiopathic swelling of one or both lips due to granulomatous inflammation. When isolated, it defines Miescher syndrome. However, other clinical signs may be associated, such as facial nerve paralysis and fissured tongue, which complete the triadÂ of MRS. The etiopathogenesis and the etiology of CG are still obscure, and the treatment, therefore, remains uncertain. In addition to the unsightly nature of this condition and the significant psychological impact, there may be local complications like excessive lacrimation, dry eyes, disorders of salivary secretion, and dysgeusia. Possible familial cases should be searched. Further studies are needed to explain the pathophysiology and find other, more effective therapeutic alternatives.
