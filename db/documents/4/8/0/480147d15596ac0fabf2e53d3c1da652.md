Benzathine penicillin is in a class of beta-lactam antimicrobials. Beta-lactams are bactericidal antimicrobials. This type of antimicrobial inhibits the biosynthesis of the cell wall peptidoglycan during the stage of active multiplication. It inhibits bacterial peptidoglycan transpeptidase. This results in an osmotically unstable cell wall, leading to cell wall lysis, subsequent destruction of the bacterial cell, and bacterial cellular death.
