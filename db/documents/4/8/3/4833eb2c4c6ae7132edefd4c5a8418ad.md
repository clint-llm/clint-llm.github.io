Contraindications to utilizing GLP-1 agonists include hypersensitivity and pregnancy as prohibitions to prescribing this class of medications. Some form of contraception is the recommendation with GLP-1 agonists in women of childbearing age. Additionally, patients with severe gastrointestinal diseases such as gastroparesis and inflammatory bowel disease should avoid GLP-1 analogs. Concern for long-term consequences on the thyroid gland using GLP-1 agonists has been a topic of investigation. In rodent models, liraglutide stimulated calcitonin release and led to hyperplasia of thyroid gland C-cells and tumors. The effects on humans remain unclear, with further investigations being necessary. Consequently, GLP-1 agonists are not recommended in patient populations with a personal or family history significant for multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A, multiple endocrine neoplasia 2B, or medullary thyroid cancer.

While the mechanism remains largely unknown, acute pancreatitis, including potentially fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing types, has been noted in users of GLP-1 analogs. Whether a causal relationship exists between GLP-1 analogs and pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer is unknown at this time. Nonetheless, GLP-1 agonists should not be prescribed in patients with a history of pancreatitis and should be discontinued in those who develop pancreatitis while taking this medication.
