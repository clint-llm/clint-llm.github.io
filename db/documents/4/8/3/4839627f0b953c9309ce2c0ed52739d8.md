Complications of TTCP include pain, failure to obtain capture, loss of capture, and rarely cutaneous burns. Complications of TTVP are more numerous, and many are related to central venous access, including infection, bleeding, damage to nearby structures, vein thrombosis, air embolism, pneumothorax, and others. Additionally, TTVP can sometimes induce ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.
