While there are no absolute contraindications to splinting, there needs to be appropriate clinical decision-making before splinting, especially in the acute setting. Situations in which caution must be exercised include the presence of thermal or electrical burns, open fractures, grossly contaminated wounds, and significant soft tissue swelling. In general, splinting may be performed so long as any concomitant injury is addressed before splinting. In the setting of open fractures and/or grossly contaminated wounds, quick irrigation and gross debridement followed by a wet-to-dry dressing should be placed over the open wound before application of the splint. Furthermore, splinting is preferred over casting in the setting of significant soft tissue swelling, as the splint is not circumferential or constricting and may be easily loosened or removed. The stability conferred by the splint prevents continued trauma in the setting of ankle fracture or dislocation which also helps reduce swelling.

Ankle splinting is not indicated in the setting of ankle sprains; rather, a simple elastic wrap is sufficient as the goal should be to minimize swelling. Early mobilization results in better recovery in ankle sprains.
