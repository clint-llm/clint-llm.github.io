Assessment of all the extraocular muscles is usually done clinically by having the patient follow the clinician’s finger in the shape of an “H” in the air. Isolated testing of the superior oblique muscle is by having the patient look down and in. Although the specific function of the superior oblique is the movement of the eye in the down and out direction, it is challenging to isolate the function of the superior oblique by having the patient look in this direction due to the contributions of the lateral rectus and inferior rectus. Instead, as mentioned above, the superior oblique is tested by having the patient look down and in. By canceling the action of the inferior rectus muscle via contraction of the medial rectus, one can isolate the action of the superior oblique.

Strabismus is a condition that can present in childhood as acquired paralytic strabismus and is usually due to malfunction of one or more of CN III, IV, and VI, resulting in ocular misalignment. Specific malfunction of CN IV results in paralysis of the superior oblique muscle, which leads to hypertropia, an upward deviation of the eye due to unopposed action of the superior rectus muscle, usually during contralateral gaze.

Superior oblique palsy is another condition that may be caused by damage to CN IV. Damage to CN IV may occur due to vasculopathy, tumor, or trauma. This palsy commonly presents as difficulty looking downwards. Therefore, a presenting patient may complain of problems when descending stairs or reading a book.
