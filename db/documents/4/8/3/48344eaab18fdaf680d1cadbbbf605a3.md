Brain death is both a legal and clinical term. The term has been present in medical literature and texts for many years, but as part of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1980, the Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA) was drafted. These criteria were later adopted by the American Medical Association and the American Bar Association. The act was drafted in response to medical advances in life support in the late 1970s that allowed for complete respiratory and circulatory support despite the complete cessation of brain function. This act reads as follows regarding “Determination of Death: An individual who has sustained either (1) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions or (2) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem, is dead. A determination of death must be made in accordance with accepted medical standards.”

Unfortunately, the UDDA did not go on to establish what “accepted medical standards’ were, only that they existed. The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) published the most current standards in 1995 and then updated them in 2010.

Based on the published standards, three findings must be present to establish brain death. The AAN defines them as “coma (with a known cause), the absence of brainstem reflexes, and apnea.”
