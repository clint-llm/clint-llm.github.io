Initially, secretin begins as an amino acid precursor known as prosecretin until activation via gastric acid. Prosecretin contains an N-terminal peptide, spacer, secretin, and C-terminal peptide; while the N-terminal is a single peptide, secretin itself makes up residues 28 to 54, and the C-terminal peptide is 72-amino acids.

Secretin is produced in the duodenal mucosa and acts on the pancreas where it stimulates the release of bicarbonate and water. While this role in digestive physiology has been known, studies recently identified the mediating receptor function of secretin.

The mechanisms of secretin receptors signal termination involve phosphorylation
