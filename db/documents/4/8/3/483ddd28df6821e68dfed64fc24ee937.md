The renal plexus is composed of fibers from the lumbar splanchnic, celiac plexus, and intermestenteric plexus. These fibers, particularly the celiac ganglion, can vary significantly in diameter and size and number of ganglia.

The lumbar splanchnic nerves typically develop from nerve roots T4-T9; however, the roots can descend to T11 or even skip spinal segment levels.

The position of the kidneys in the retroperitoneum may also vary. An ectopic kidney may be found in the pelvis when it fails to ascend. In rare instances, kidney fusion anomalies may occur, with both kidneys located on the same side. Fused kidneys are associated with ureteropelvic junction obstruction and hydronephrosis.
