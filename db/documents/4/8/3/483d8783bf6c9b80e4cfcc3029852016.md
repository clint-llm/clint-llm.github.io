The muscles crossing the elbow joint are subdivided into the flexors and extensors.

The primary elbow flexors include the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles. The biceps brachii is the largest of the flexors, and its primary function is as a primary and powerful forearm supinator.

The extensors include the triceps brachii and anconeus. The triceps brachii is the largestÂ extensor of the elbow and stabilizes the joint when the hand undergoes fine motor movements.
