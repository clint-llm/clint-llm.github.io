The vast majority of gastric polyps are found incidentally on endoscopic investigation or autopsy, and as such, the cause of their formation is poorly understood. The development of GHPs is thought to be related to chronic inflammation commonly associated with H. pylori infection and atrophic gastritis. The association with H. Pylori stems from the finding that in many cases (70%), GHPs will regress within a year after eradication of H. Pylori infection, assuming no reinfection occurs. Less is known about the cause of FGPs. However, several studies have indicated an association with chronic PPI usage, which suggests that a mechanism involving gastric acid suppression may lie in the background of their development.

The most commonly associated risks for the development of adenoma include age and chronic inflammation/irritation of the tissue involved, which results in intestinal metaplasia and subsequent risk for malignant transformation typically attributed to acquired mutations involving the expression of p53 and Ki-67 genes. It is worth mentioning here that the finding of gastric adenoma in a young patient can be indicative of the presence of a more concerning underlying genetic condition, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which merits further investigation.
