Brain imaging like MRI head, MRA head, or CT angiography is usually indicated to rule out other pathologies like stroke, AV malformations, and tumors. EEG is indicated to rule out seizures especially when there is confusion and decreased the level of consciousness. Rarely, 24-hour Holter monitoring is required to rule out arrhythmias.
