Torsades de pointes is the result of QTc prolongation which can either be congenital or acquired. Acquired QTc prolongation is most often drug-related. There is an extensive list of medications that can predispose a person to torsades. The list includes but is not limited to: antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, antiemetics, antifungals, and antimicrobials. Substances that slow the hepatic metabolism of these medications can potentiate QTc prolongation leading to an increased likelihood of torsades de pointes. Congenital prolonged QT has two genetic variants: Jervell and Lange-Nielsen and Romano-Ward syndrome. The former is associated with congenital deafness. Prolonged QTc and Torsades are also associated with certain risk factors that include: older age (older than 65), female gender, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, bradycardia, heart disease, and diuretic use.

Two rare congenital long QT syndromes include Romano-Ward syndrome and Jervell and Lange Nielsen syndrome.
