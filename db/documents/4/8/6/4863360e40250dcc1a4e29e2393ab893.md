Damage to the motor cortex results in a clinical condition called upper motor neuron syndrome. It can also arise as a result of damage to the axons arising from the motor cortex, i.e., the corticospinal tract. Clinically there is the presence of weakness without significant muscle wasting, spasticity (increased muscle tone with clasp-knife rigidity), hyperreflexia,Â and positive Babinski sign. Babinski sign is a normal reflex in infants, but abnormal in adults. It occurs when the big toe moves upward after the sole stroked firmly.
