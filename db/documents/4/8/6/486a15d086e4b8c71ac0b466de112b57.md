- Cow's milk allergy is a common diagnosis in infants and children.

- It is difficult to detect the exact prevalence of cow's milk allergy due to a lack of a precise criterion to diagnose.

- It can be classified into two major categories: IgE-mediated, non-IgE-mediated.

- Typically the presence of cow's milk allergy appears within the first few months of life and usually before six months.

- The clinician must recognize the difference between milk allergy and milk intolerance.

- The basis of diagnosis is primarily on the history of symptoms and physical exam.

- The definitive treatment for all food allergies is the strict elimination of the food from the diet.
