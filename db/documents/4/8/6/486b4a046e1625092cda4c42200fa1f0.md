The thoracic wall forms part of the axial skeleton and is composed of segmental bone, muscle, and connective tissue. These elements are derived from paraxial mesoderm, which forms somites from which the sclerotome, myotome, and dermatome separate. The sclerotome is the origin of the vertebrae and transverse elements which begin elongating into ribs during the fifth week of gestation. Ossification begins during the fetal period but will not be complete until adulthood.
