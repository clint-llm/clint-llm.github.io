Guanosine 3’,5’-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP or cGMP) is a second messenger molecule that modulates various downstream effects, including vasodilation, retinal phototransduction, calcium homeostasis, and neurotransmission. cGMP mediates these effects via activation and alteration of specific ion channels, association with cGMP-dependent protein kinases, and interaction with phosphodiesterases (PDEs). In this review, we will discuss the activation and regulation of cGMP, its downstream effects, and potential clinical significance.
