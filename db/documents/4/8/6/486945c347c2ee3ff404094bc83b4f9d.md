The primary clinical goals of ABR are to diagnose hearing loss in newborns, vestibular schwannomas, and brainstem lesions.

ABR is critical to diagnose hearing loss in newborns and young children who are unable to undergo traditional behavioral auditory testing. Early diagnosis can establish prompt auditory rehabilitation such as hearing aids, cochlear implants, or hearing/speech therapy programs. Early intervention has been shown to promote improved speech and language development in children.

Vestibular schwannomas compress the auditory nerve, resulting in delayed ABR waveforms and non-synchronous activity along the auditory pathway. The interaural difference in the latencies of wave V and interweave form latencies are analyzed. The ABR is abnormal and suggestive of vestibular schwannoma when the interaural latency difference is longer than 0.3 milliseconds and the I-V interwave latency is longer than 4.4 milliseconds.Â ABR can also be utilized intraoperatively during intracranial cerebral pontine angle (CPA) tumor resections to help preserve auditory function.
