Treacher Collins syndrome (also called mandibulofacial dysostosis) is a rare congenital disorder of craniofacial development that has variable phenotypic expression.

The most common clinical manifestations include downward-slanting palpebral fissures, mandibular hypoplasia, and malar hypoplasia (and can manifest as Tessier clefts 6, 7, 8), coloboma of the lower eyelids, malformation of the auricular pinna (microtia), and middle ear deformities and associated conductive hearing loss.

The syndrome was described by Berry (1889), Treacher Collins (1900), and Franceschetti and Klein (1949) ergo the names Berry’s syndrome and Franceschetti-Zwahlen-Klein syndrome are also used in older literature.

The craniofacial anomalies in these patients can lead to airway obstruction, speech impairment, hearing loss, and feeding difficulties. These patients are best treated via an interprofessional team to coordinate the many facets of their care.
