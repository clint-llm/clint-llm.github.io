Pressure support ventilation is relatively contraindicated in patients who have a depressed respiratory drive, very high oxygen consumption, or elevated airway resistance. Because no mandatory breaths are given in PSV mode, minimum minute ventilation is not ensured. Patients with neurologic injury, encephalopathy from critical illness, or those receiving sedation may hypoventilate. Work of breathing and thus oxygen consumption is higher in PSV than in control modes of ventilation. Patients with shock or low cardiac output may need more respiratory support. High airway resistance in patients with obstructive lung disease limits peak flow and can result in small tidal volumes.
