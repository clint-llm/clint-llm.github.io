The primary indications for a lung transplant are:

**Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).**Timing of listing (presence of one criterion is sufficient):

- BODE index ≥7

- FEV <15% to 20% predicted.

- Three or more severe exacerbations during the preceding year.

- One severe exacerbation with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure

**Cystic Fibrosis.**Timing of listing:

- Chronic respiratory failure.

- With hypoxia alone (partial pressure of oxygen [PaO] <8 kPa or <60 mm Hg).

- With hypercapnia (partial pressure of carbon dioxide [PaCO2] >6.6 kPa or >50 mm Hg).

- Long-term non-invasive ventilation therapy.

- Pulmonary hypertension.

- Frequent hospitalization.

- Rapid lung function decline.

- World Health Organization Functional Class IV

**Interstitial Lung Disease.**Timing of listing:

- Decline in FVC ≥10% during 6 months of follow-up (note: a 5% decline is associated with a poorer prognosis and may warrant listing).

- A decline in DLCO ≥15% during 6 months of follow-up.

- Desaturation to <88% or distance <250 m on 6-minute-walk test or >50 m decline in 6-minute-walk distance over a 6-month period.

- Pulmonary hypertension on right heart catheterization or 2-dimensional echocardiography.

- 
**Hospitalization because of respiratory decline, pneumothorax, or acute exacerbation**

- 
**Alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha-1) deficiency**

**Pulmonary Vascular disease/Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH).**Timing of transplant listing:

- NYHA Functional Class III or IV despite a trial of at least 3 months of combination therapy including prostanoids

- Cardiac index of <2 liters/min/m2

- Mean right atrial pressure of >15 mm Hg

- 6-minute walk test of <350 m

- Development of significant hemoptysis, pericardial effusion, or signs of progressive right heart failure (renal insufficiency, increasing bilirubin, brain natriuretic peptide, or recurrent ascites)

**Bronchiectasis, and Sarcoidosis.**

- Other indications include constrictive bronchiolitis, connective tissue diseases, pulmonary hypertension secondary to congenital cardiac conditions, and others.
