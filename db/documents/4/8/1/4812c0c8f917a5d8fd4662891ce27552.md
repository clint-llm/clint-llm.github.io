Treatment for poroma is optional but curative as it is a benign adnexal neoplasm. Deeper lesions may be cured with simple excision, but electrosurgical destruc­tion may be the cure for superficial lesions.

Treatment modalities for porocarcinoma have included Mohs micrographic surgery, standard surgical excision with broad tumor margins, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The Mohs micrographic surgery affords, for some authors, the greatest likelihood of cure in the absence of regional and distant metastases and clear margins.
