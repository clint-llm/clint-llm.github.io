Milk-alkali syndrome (MAS) is a frequent cause of hypercalcemia in the United States. A study on patients hospitalized for hypercalcemia showed that 12% of the cases were due to milk-alkali syndrome, making it the third most common cause after hyperparathyroidism and malignancy. Internationally, the frequency of the condition depends on the amount of calcium carbonate intake. Increased incidence of MAS has been reported in places where betel nut chewing is common, such as India and Southeast Asia.

Previously, when the etiology of the syndrome was the consumption of milk and absorbable alkali to treat peptic ulcer disease, more cases were reported in males. Currently, most of the cases are post-menopausal women due to their increased consumption of calcium carbonate products.
