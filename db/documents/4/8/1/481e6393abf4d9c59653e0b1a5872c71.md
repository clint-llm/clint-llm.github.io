Millipedes are arthropods from the class Diplopoda that consists of more than 12,000 species. Millipedes are unable to inject venom instead employ defensive mechanisms by curling up in a ball and secreting irritating chemicals from micropores along their sides to deter predators. This activity reviews millipede envenomation and the identification and evaluation of exposure by an interprofessional team. It discusses the management of millipede exposure and highlights the role of ophthalmologists in managing patients with eye exposure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of millipede envenomation.
- Review the evaluation of millipede envenomation.
- Outline the management options available for millipede envenomation.
- Summarize when the interprofessional team should include ophthalmology consultation with millipede envenomation to improve outcomes.
