Spinal cord injury is very stressful and overwhelming for the patient and the families. Patient education must be an important part of the clinical management of patients with this condition. Counseling is necessary regarding prognosis, complications, and outcomes. Support groups can help with the management of issues like anxiety, frustration, loneliness, and depression. The patient should receive counsel about the diagnosis and the prognosis. Prevention centers can help with mitigating factors leading to traumatic injuries like improvement in motor vehicle safety, gun control, and social programs aimed at the prevention of violence.
