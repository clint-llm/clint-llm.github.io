Phthirus pubis measured about 2 mm on macroscopic examination, having a broad and flat body. The adult louse has six legs (3 pairs) which abut the abdomen. The anterior pair of legs are thinner, having narrow claws and a jagged surface. The posterior pair of legs are thicker to hold the shaft of the hairs and egg attachment better. The eggs are tiny, translucent 0.5 mm in size, stuck to the shaft of the hair, and can be misdiagnosed as blepharitis. The average survival rate of P. pubis is four weeks, and in the absence of the host, it dies within two days.
