Low-grade OG (WHO Grade II), which by definition have 1p/19q deletion and IDHmt, have a better prognosis than other astrocytomas without these genetic markers. OGs have a median survival time of 10-12 years and 5-year progression-free and overall survival rates of 51-83%. Younger patients, patients without other comorbidities, and those with a greater extent of tumor resection also tend to do better.
