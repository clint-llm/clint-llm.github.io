The most commonly affected fingers are as follows: long finger greater than ring finger greater than index finger greater than little finger, thumb. The most common cause of mallet finger is a violent flexion or laceration to the dorsum of the finger at the distal interphalangeal joint  (DIPJ).  The most common mechanism is the finger being struck at the tip or “end on” resulting in tearing of the extensor tendon where it joins at the distal phalanx, distal to the DIPJ, with or without a small fragment of bone from the insertion point.  Extensor tendon disruption causes the distal phalanx to droop or remain in a flexed position without the ability to actively extend the DIPJ, resulting in the deformity. Doyle classified mallet finger into four categories:

- I: Closed with or without small avulsion fracture

- II: Open laceration with tendon discontinuity

- III: Deep abrasion with skin loss and loss of tendon continuity.

- IV: Mallet finger includes 3 subtypes:

- A: Transepiphyseal plate fracture in children

- B: Fracture of articular surface between 20-50%

- C: Fracture of articular surface >50%
