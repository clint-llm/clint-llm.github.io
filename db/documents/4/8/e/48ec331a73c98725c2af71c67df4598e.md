The function of endorphins can be stated in general terms as well as broken down specifically and observed per each endorphin type. In general, the release of endorphins is understood to be associated with the body’s response to pain. The pain relief experienced as a result of the release of endorphins has been determined to be greater than that of morphine. β-endorphin (an endogenous opioid) is one of the neurochemicals involved with exercise-induced euphoria (runner's high). Additionally, endorphins have been found to be associated with states of pleasure, including such emotions brought upon by laughter, love, sex, and even appetizing food. Of the three endorphin types, beta-endorphins have been the most studied and prevalent, accounting for the majority of the functional properties of endorphins as generalized and understood as a whole. Research is ongoing on each type to further understand the full functional potential of each, along with how they can be used in a medically beneficial manner. Endorphins express functional duality as they fall into the category of either neurotransmitters or neuromodulators in the central nervous system (CNS) and hormones in the pituitary gland.
