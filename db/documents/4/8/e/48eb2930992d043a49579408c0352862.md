Currently, there is no shared agreement on cardiac plexus formation.Â Sympathetic fibers derive from C8-T5; vagal fibers involve, in particular, the ventricles and, with less extension, the atria. Some studies show that some phrenic nerve branches may be involved in the cardiac plexus. In the animal model, it is clear that the cusps receive innervation by the autonomic system, where sympathetic stimulation increases the tone of the cusps. The nerve fibers that go to the aortic valve derive from the ventricular endocardial plexuses and others, to a lesser extent, from the aortic adventitial wall. The most innervated layer of the cusps is the ventricularis.
