MAST devices are still discussed in protocols and textbooks for several EMS agencies in the United States.Â Most hospital systems and EMS agencies, however, have abandoned the use of these devices due to the paucity of supporting evidence and the relatively high cost compared to other treatment modalities. There are no widely accepted indications for MAST use and doing so falls outside the standard of medical care in most developed nations. As of the writing of this article, there is insufficient evidence to support the continued use of these devices.
