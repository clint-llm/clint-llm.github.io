Potential complications with the Ross procedure include

- Aortic insufficiency

- Right ventricular outlet obstruction

- Aortic autograft dilatation

- Pulmonary allograft stenosis

- Cerebrovascular event

- Myocardial infarction/ischemia

- Hemorrhage

- Respiratory distress

- Drug reactions

- Blood reactions

- Arrhythmias

- Infection

- Death

Complications related to surgery occur in 3-5% of patients with early mortality of 1-3%. In experienced centers, the mortality rates are negligible. Long term survival of 80-90 % have been reported at ten years and 70-80% at 20 years.

Early autograft failure is rare but does occur within the first 6 months. In most cases, the cause is technical problems such as leaflet injury or distortion that is caused during the valve harvesting. The pulmonary homograft in most series lasts about 15-20 years and then develops regurgitation or stenosis due to calcific degeneration. However, today the percutaneous placement of a pulmonary valve is being performed instead of open-heart surgery.

There is no doubt that the Ross procedure is superior to the prosthetic valves. Unfortunately, recent data show that in some patients there is increasing enlargement of the new aortic root following the Ross procedure leading to aortic regurgitation, especially when there was a mismatch of the aortic and pulmonary roots at the time of the initial surgery.

Patients who undergo the Ross procedure do not require anticoagulation and have minimal restrictions on their lifestyle. They are also able to participate in exercise programs without limitations. However, the Ross procedure is demanding and life long monitoring of the patients is required. Reoperations have been infrequent and with the availability of percutaneous valve implantation techniques, the morbidity of REDO open heart surgery will be avoided.
