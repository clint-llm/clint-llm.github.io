Routine chest x-ray findings of non-resolving pneumonia or an isolated, persistent, ill-defined opacity have often been reported as the primary starting point of diagnosis.

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest may show an isolated, or more often, a multifocal or diffuse opacity with a predominant ground-glass pattern.

The size and mass of the nodule are important predictors of an invasive component.

Differential diagnosis of a ground glass area of opacity in CT may include organizing pneumonia, focal inflammation, or focal fibrosis. Precise measurement of a subsolid nodule size can often be challenging in axial CT. An alternative method of measurement could be volumetry though it has not been standardized and validated.

While erstwhile non-mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma presents most commonly as ground-glass nodules with a variable solid component, mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma more often present as pneumonic infiltrates with consolidation, pseudo cavitation, and often visualization of blood vessels within the area of mucinous consolidation – known as " angiogram sign."

Consolidation tumor ratio, defined as a ratio of the maximum diameter of the area of consolidation to the tumor, has also been used as a prognostic marker in the non-solid adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth.

Cellular density and turnover being somewhat lower, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in a positron emission tomography (PET) scan is often underwhelming, and these lesions are often, therefore, PET negative.

Forty-five percent to 60% of the erstwhile bronchioloalveolar carcinomas have been reported to present in radiologic stage 1 or stage 2 disease.

Tissue diagnosis by biopsy is the confirmatory step. However, complete histologic evaluation of an excised specimen or biopsy is increasingly stressed to determine the extent of invasiveness. The diagnosis of adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth made by cytology or core biopsy can contain a more invasive component in an excised specimen.

However, the specificity of frozen section biopsy for diagnosing adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth is excellent, with positive predictive values of 93% to 100%.
