Neurological evaluation of the neonate has many inherent limitations that make it challenging to delineate physiological variations from pathological conditions. Neonatal electroencephalography is an objective test to measure the functional integrity of the immature neonatal brain. This activity describes the indications and techniques for performing electroencephalography on neonates and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing neonates with seizures.

**Objectives:**
- Explain how to obtain an electroencephalogram in neonates.
- Review the indications for electroencephalography in neonates.
- Outline which conditions electroencephalography in neonates might reveal.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members for neonates undergoing electroencephalography.
