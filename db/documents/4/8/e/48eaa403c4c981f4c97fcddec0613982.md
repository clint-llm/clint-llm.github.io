Frequent monitoring, clear instructions for patients and caregivers, and a robust on-call system are essential post-CAR-T. Patients and caregivers should be provided with after-hours contact information, clear instructions for monitoring symptoms and vital signs, and when to present to the hospital.

Patients need to be provided with a product-specific wallet card identifying their reception of a CAR T-cell product and giving information about the managing oncologist. They will need to show their wallet card if and when they present for evaluation of symptoms, especially if they arrive at a hospital or emergency department (ED) outside of the CAR-T therapy programs.

Caregiver support throughout the process of CAR-T and after is critical. The need for a 24-hour caregiver for at least four weeks and staying close to the center after treatment should be emphasized.
