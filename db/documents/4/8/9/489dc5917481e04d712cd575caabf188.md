Compromise of the UCL comes from sufficient force enough to hyperabduct and hyperextend the first MCP joint.

Injuries thru the same mechanism also occur from sports such as hockey, soccer, handball, basketball, and volleyball.

A torn UCL can get caught over the aponeurosis of adductor pollicis creating a “lesion” initially described by Stener.
