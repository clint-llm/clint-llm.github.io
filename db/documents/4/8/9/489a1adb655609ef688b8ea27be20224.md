For mild localized disease, potent, topical or intralesional corticosteroids may be effective. However, the majority of cases warrant the use of systemic corticosteroid therapy in the dose of 0.5mg to 1mg per kg of prednisolone equivalent for 4-6 weeks.

Treatment with low dose steroids may have to be continued for a longer time to prevent exacerbations. If remission is not achieved by 3 months, a second line steroid-sparing agent must be added.

The main second-line steroid-sparing agents include dapsone (50 to 100mg/day), KI (300mg 3 times a day), and colchicine (0.5mg 3 times a day).

A baseline G6PD activity should be done in patients before starting dapsone.

Miscellaneous drugs that have been reported to be efficacious in various studies include cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, thalidomide, clofazimine, IVIG, and TNF-alpha antagonists.
