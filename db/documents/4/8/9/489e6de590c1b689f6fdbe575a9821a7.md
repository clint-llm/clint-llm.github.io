The thigh muscles subdivide into theÂ anterior, medial, and posterior compartments. The function of the anterior compartment muscles is to extend the lower limb at the knee joint. The innervation of the anterior compartment of the thigh is from the femoral nerve, which originates from spinal roots L2-L4, and blood supply is from the femoral artery and its first branches. This anatomical region is crucial to human locomotion and dynamic movements, given the critical attachments of the quadriceps group to the patella and the resulting force exerted on knee extension.
