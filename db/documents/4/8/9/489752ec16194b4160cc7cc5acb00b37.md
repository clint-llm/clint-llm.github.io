Invasive infections with fungi are continuing to increase and cause significant morbidity and mortality.

Miconazole and ketoconazole were among the first triazoles synthesized, but safety profile concerns limitations associated with their use. Subsequent generations of triazoles such as voriconazole, posaconazole, efinaconazole, ravuconazole, and isavuconazole all derive from second-generation conazoles itraconazole or fluconazole. They are designed to alleviate the deficiencies of their parent drugs and generally have a broader spectrum of activity.

The azole family of antifungal agents has indications for many fungal pathogens. They have relatively few adverse effects compared with older agents such as amphotericin B. The triazole family has largely supplanted the use of early azoles, such as ketoconazole, due to improved safety and efficacy. Each of the five members of the triazole family (fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole) has different characteristics that prove each one effective for specific cases.

FDA-approved indications for the various agents in this class of drugs:

- Miconazole: oropharyngeal, vulvovaginal, and cutaneous candidiasis, tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis, tinea versicolor

- Ketoconazole: tinea infections, cutaneous candidiasis, pityriasis versicolor, seborrheic dermatitis

- Fluconazole: esophageal, oropharyngeal, and vulvovaginal candidiasis, systemic candidiasis, cryptococcal meningitis, and fungal prophylaxis for bone marrow transplant patients

- Itraconazole: onychomycosis of the toenails and fingernails, oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, invasive aspergillosis

- Voriconazole: various severe fungal infections, invasive aspergillosis, candidemia in non-neutropenic patients

- Posaconazole: prophylaxis for invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients and invasive aspergillosis

- Efinaconazole: onychomycosis of the toenails

- Isavuconazonazole: aspergillosis and mucomycosis
