The diagnosis of multiple biliary duct hamartomas is usually incidental at autopsy or on radiographic imaging. However, when discovered on imaging, it is essential to determine a correct diagnosis due to its close resemblance to metastatic disease of the liver, especially in a patient with extra-hepatic malignant tumors. Typically, liver metastases are ill-defined with variable sizes on plain computed tomography (CT) imaging with varying degrees of enhancement with IV contrast.

Other differential diagnoses include bile duct adenomas, peribiliary cysts, microabscesses of the liver, intrahepatic biliary stones, and Caroliâ€™s disease. Bile duct adenomas have small round tubules with small inconspicuous lumens, while bile duct hamartomas have dilated lumens with inspissated bile.

Microabscesses of the liver are usually present as multiple round loculated hypodense lesions on CT. They are seen in patients with immunosuppression, fever, and epigastric pain, which can be differentiated from bile duct hamartomas by signs of sepsis, which are not typically seen in the latter.
