Pes planus can either be congenital or acquired.

**Congenital**

Pes planus is fairly common in infants.

**Acquired**

The function of the posterior tibial tendon is to support the arch as well as inversion and plantarflexion of the foot. Acquired pes planus is most commonly occurs secondary to posterior tibial tendon dysfunction.

Patients with trauma to the midfoot or hindfoot resulting in navicular, first metatarsal, calcaneal, or Lis-Franc ligament complex demonstrate an increased risk of developing pes planus.

Patients with congenital ligamentous laxity secondary to Down syndrome, Marfan, or Ehlers Danos can present with pes planus.

Patients with arthropathies are at higher risk for acquired pes planus. These can be either degenerative or inflammatory. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis or seronegative arthropathies should be considered at higher risk for developing pes planus, especially if poorly controlled.

Rigid pes planus is rare. It usually develops during childhood, but it can occur at any point in life. It develops from the tarsal coalition, accessory navicular bone, congenital vertical talus, or other forms of congenital hindfoot pathology.
