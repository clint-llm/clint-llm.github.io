The history of present illness will typically be consistent with a sudden onset event. Persistent discomfort without relief causes people to seek care. History of visual acuity deficits is uncommon, although this may be perceived as suchÂ since the patient will have copious tearing and difficulty keeping their eye open. Accompanying symptoms are consistent with a generalized ocular inflammatory response, which will consist of tearing, redness, foreign body sensation, inability to find comfort with the eye opened or closed, and photophobia and blurred vision without overt visual acuity deficit. Most patients will report a high-risk activity such as hammering or grinding, and some will tell you the location of the foreign body.

Caution regarding permitting patients to guide your inspection is in order since although most patients will localize their pain from corneal foreign bodies, this has been shown to be inaccurate.

If present for greater than 24 hours, WBCs may migrate into the cornea/ anterior chamber as a sign of iritis. Gross hyphema, however, may indicate globe perforation. Other gross exam findings may show eyelid edema, as well as generalized or focal injection of the conjunctiva.
