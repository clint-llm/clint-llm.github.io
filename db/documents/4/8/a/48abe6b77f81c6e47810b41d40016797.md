Leukoplakia is the best-known potentially malignant disorder of the oral cavity, and its epidemiology is well documented. The prevalence of leukoplakia varies among various scientific studies. It has a comprehensive global review point at a prevalence of 2.6% and a malignancy conversion rate ranging from 0.1% to 17.5%.

In a study by Martorell-Calatayud et al. determined the prevalence of leukoplakia to be in the range of 0.4% to 0.7%, whereas Feller et al. estimated the prevalence towards a higher range of 0.5% to 3.46%. Furthermore, the same study concluded that the malignant transformation rate of leukoplakia ranged from 0.7% to 2.9%.

In yet another study by Brouns et al. showed the prevalence and annual malignant transformation rate of approximately 2% and 1%, respectively.

Leukoplakia is more common in middle-aged and elderly males than in other group studies. The prevalence increases with increasing age.
