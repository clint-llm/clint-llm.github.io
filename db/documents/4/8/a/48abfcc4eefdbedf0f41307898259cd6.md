Diagnosis of colonic volvulus is clinical, however, radiological investigations are often required for diagnostic confirmation due to an overlap of clinical features with other diseases. The first investigation to be performed is a plain radiograph of the abdomen. Specific signs including "bent inner tube" or a "coffee bean" sign are characteristic for sigmoid volvulus. These refer to the appearance of the air-filled closed loop of the colon which forms the volvulus revealing a thick inner and a thin outer wall. Similarly, plain radiographs of patients with cecal volvulus reveal distended small bowel and large bowel. Contrast enema should be performed only after perforation peritonitis is ruled out. Demonstration of a "bird's beak" at the point where the colon rotates to form the volvulus is characteristic of sigmoid volvulus. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis is generally not indicated in patients with colonic volvulus, however, when performed an upward displacement of the appendix with large and small bowel obstruction is suggestive for cecal volvulus.
