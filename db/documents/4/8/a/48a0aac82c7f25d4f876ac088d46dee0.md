For patients treated promptly, the prognosis is good. However, patients who present with an altered state of consciousness have high morbidity and mortality. Some patients may develop seizures during the illness, which are very difficult to control or are prolonged. Any patient with a residual neurological deficit after meningitis treatment is also left with a disability. Patients art the greatest risk for death usually have the following features:

- Advanced aged

- Low Glasgow coma scale

- CSF WBC count which is low

- Tachycardia

- Gram-positive cocci in the CSF

Serious complications in survivors include:

- Ataxia

- Hearing loss

- Cranial nerve palsies

- Cognitive dysfunction

- Cortical blindness

- Hydrocephalus

- Seizures

- Focal paralysis

The mortality is highest for children less than 12 months of age and decreases in middle age. However, the mortality rates increase with advancing age. Overall, 10% of patients will die from bacterial meningitis. The mortality is highest when the infection is caused by streptococcus and listeria. Patients with meningococcal meningitis do respond well to treatment, but if the presentation is late with meningococcemia, the mortality rates are nearly 30%.
