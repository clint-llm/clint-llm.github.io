Granuloma formation begins with an inflammatory trigger, such as an infectious pathogen or a foreign body. Macrophages are recruited to the site of inflammation and activated as part of the innate immune response. If the recruited and activated macrophage is unable to remove the inflammatory stimulus efficiently, a further immune response may be triggered, orchestrated by dendritic cells and major histocompatibility complex II. Additional macrophages are recruited to the site, and a chronic inflammatory reaction develops. The macrophages form a tight aggregate around the inflammatory stimulus and may become surrounded by a peripheral cuff of lymphocytes. This inflammatory focus is known as a granuloma.

A wide range of stimuli can result in granuloma formation, including infectious and non-infectious triggers. In some cases, such as sarcoidosis, the trigger is yet to be identified. Infectious stimuli include bacteria such as Mycobacteria, parasites such as Schistosomiasis, and fungi such as Aspergillus. Non-infectious triggers include autoimmune disease, neoplasia, and foreign bodies such as sutures.
