As previously mentioned, it is imperative to differentiate small fiber from large fiber neuropathy. Findings such as weakness, reduced proprioception, and absent deep tendon reflexes indicate large fiber (Aα- and Aβ) involvement and may differentiate large fiber neuropathy from small fiber neuropathy.

EMG and nerve conduction studies are also helpful in this differentiation, as these studies will be normal with small fiber involvement and abnormal with large fiber involvement. EMG may also differentiate from lumbar radiculopathy, which may also present with lower extremity burning and numbness. Differentiation between these conditions is imperative for implementing a proper treatment regimen, as management of these conditions varies.
