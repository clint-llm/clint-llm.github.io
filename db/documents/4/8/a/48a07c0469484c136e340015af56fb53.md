Pediatric hearing loss is a broad category that covers a wide range of pathologies. Early detection and prompt management are essential, as the development of language and psychosocial skills are significantly influenced by pediatric hearing loss. Additionally, early detection may identify potentially reversible causes or other underlying problems that can be managed. This activity describes the diagnosis and therapeutic strategies for managing pediatric hearing loss and stresses the role of the interprofessional team in the care of children with hearing loss.
