The prognosis of IHR depends on the severity of the disorders, the extension of the inflammation and tissue damage, and the available treatment and their effectiveness to control the disease. Relapsing or slow progression characterizes myasthenia gravis. If it presents with thymoma, 68% of the affected have a 5-year survival. In SLE, approximately 80% survive at 15 years if treated. Atopic eczema (dermatitis) is usually most severe in infancy and improves with age in 80% of the cases. Allergic bronchial asthma that does not respond to steroids has a reserved prognosis.

The prognosis of other allergic disorders, including food allergy, drug allergy, latex allergy, allergic conjunctivitis, and allergic rhinitis is good once the triggers are identified using skin prick test or RAST and treatment with anti-histamine occurs. The use of monoclonal antibodies directed to IgE (e.g., omalizumab) has improved the prognosis of patients that do not respond well to conventional therapy, although the acquisition of these biologicals is expensive. The use of vaccines, some classic and recently experimental, is another avenue of treatment of allergic disorders that improve the life expectancy and quality of individuals with allergies.
