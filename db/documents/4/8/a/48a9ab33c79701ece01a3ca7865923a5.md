As discussed, cutaneous tuberculosis or other infections, especially fungal, mycobacterial, treponemal, or leishmanial, should be considered. A bilateral, symmetric, relatively rapid onset in an otherwise well patient without associated symptoms makes an infectious etiology less likely. If an infection is excluded, the clinical and pathologic differential may include granulomatous rosacea at one end of the spectrum, and cutaneous sarcoid at the other.

LikeÂ LMDF, granulomatous variants of rosacea can present with bilateral, symmetric facial papules with similar morphology. There is considerable histologic overlap, including relationship to pilosebaceous units, although LMDF may have larger granulomas that are more prone to caseation necrosis, and is not expected to have actinic damage, vascular dilation, or the presence of Demodex mites.

Sarcoidosis should be excluded by clinical and/or laboratory investigations, especially in those whose disease is slow to regress or shows progression.

Other facial granulomatous disorders, including granulomatous perioral dermatitis, may also be considered in the differential.
