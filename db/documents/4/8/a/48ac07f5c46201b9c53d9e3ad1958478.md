**Conservative Treatment**

Multiple non-operative treatment options have been described. Most non-operative treatments are focused on symptom reduction. The first line of treatment should always begin with non-operative modalities prior to any surgical intervention. Along with anti-inflammatories and physical therapy, listed below are some conjunctive therapies that can initially be trialed. The progression of the disease is not changed by non-operative modalities.

**Orthotics/Pads**

In patients with mild disease with minimal symptoms, pads can be placed inside the shoe to offload the parts of the foot where fibromas are present. Increased padding inside the shoe can also help alleviate mild symptoms.

**Steroids**

There are no studies supporting steroid use in plantar fibromatosis; however, studies have shown benefit in its use in Dupuytren disease. Local injection of steroids is thought to help with symptomatology. Injection should help reduce node and strand size in the plantar fascia.

**Verapamil**

The drug verapamil is a common calcium channel blocker used for hypertension. In Ledderhose disease, it can be used to promote the activity of collagenase and inhibit collagen production. The benefits are mainly theoretical and derived from studies investigating the treatment of Peyronies disease. The transdermal and intralesional verapamil injection has demonstrated a decrease in plaque size by 55% to 85%. Contact dermatitis is the most common complication of verapamil use.

**Radiation Therapy**

Radiation therapy through electron beam radiation or orthovoltage x-ray can decrease fibroblast activity through disruption of TGF production by fibroblasts. Two cycles with a total dose of 30 Gy are typically used for a week with a 6-week break between the two cycles. Another study shows using 3 Gy per week for 5 weeks, followed by another session 6 weeks out. One study showed a complete node resolution in 33.3% of cases and decreased node size in 54.5% of cases. Side effects from radiation therapy include: (erythema, dry skin). The incidence of malignant transformation of skin is unknown, lacking long-term follow-up.

**Collagenase**

Collagenase derived from Clostridium histolyticum breaks down collagen. The idea of using collagenase injections for Ledderhose disease came from its use in Peyronie and Dupuytren disease. The evidence for collagenase effectiveness is limited. Lehrman et al. described a case report where they used collagenase to inject a 20F recurrent Ledderhose. The patient had failed 3 months of conservative treatment as well as multiple surgical interventions (local excision as well as multiple endoscopic plantar fasciotomies) prior to attempting collagenase. In their study, using a 25G needle, 0.58 mg of collagenase was injected into the palmar fibroma. One-third of the solution was injected centrally, followed by one-third proximal and one-third of the solution injected distally to the central aspect of the fibroma. Twenty-four hours after injection, the patient was brought back to the clinic to break up the fibroma with PROM of the toes as well as massage of the plantar surface of the foot. The patient reported resolution of symptoms up to their last follow-up 33 months after the intervention.

**Tamoxifen**

Anti-estrogenic drugs are still in the very experimental phases as a possible treatment. It is thought that tamoxifen inhibits TGF-beta expression, which in turn inhibits the proliferative activity of fibroblasts while also decreasing fibroblast maturation and differentiation of myofibroblasts.

**Extra Corporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT)**

Originally stems from its effective use as a treatment in Peyronie. The original protocol for shock wave therapy was described using 2000 pulses at a frequency of 3 Hz at 7-day intervals for 2 weeks. This study found a softening of nodes in the patients who chose to undergo this treatment option. Its mechanism of action is unclear, but theories include that the mechanical action of the shockwaves leads to an overexpression of TGF beta amongst others, which causes an increased production of extracellular matrix components, reducing the maturation process of the myofibroblasts and restricting tissue contraction.
