Cystic kidney disease includes several treatable and preventable complications such as hypertension, infection, and pain.

In ADPKD, recommendations include drinking 1 to 2 L of water daily, sodium restriction, exercise, and weight control. Hypertension is a common finding, and there are several options to control hypertension, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers. Tolvaptan is a vasopressin receptor antagonist that is effective for ADPKD with selective candidates.

ARPKD has no curative treatments; therefore, there is only symptomatic management, including supportive respiratory therapy for pulmonary insufficiency, dialysis for renal failure, salt restriction, and usage of antihypertensives for hypertension, and loop diuretics for edema.

JNPHP and MCKD are managed with salt supplementation when there is severe salt wasting, and dialysis or renal transplantation for ESRD if needed.

Acquired cystic renal disease patients need bed rest and analgesics for mild bleeding episodes of cysts. Hypercalciuria can be treated with oral thiazide diuretics when it occurs in this disease.
