Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), previously known as lymphoepithelioma, is an undifferentiated form of squamous cell carcinoma arising from the epithelium of the nasopharynx. It is the most common malignancy of the nasopharynx. Endemic to parts of Asia and Africa but found worldwide, the malignancy shows a variable rate of occurrence ranging from high incidence in the southern part of China (25Â to 50 cases per 100,000) to a low rate in European populations (1 case per 100,000).
