With treatment, the prognosis is good. Most patients do respond to corticosteroid injection. A few cases do resolve spontaneously when the primary condition is treated. However, even with steroid injection, full recovery can take months. Diabetics tend to have the least favorable response to corticosteroids and often require surgery. Surgery for release of trigger finger is successful and is a reasonable choice for patients who have failed steroid injections.
