Toxicity with furosemide manifests as extensions of its diuretic activity. The main signs and symptoms of overdose with furosemide are blood volume reduction, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, hypotension, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia.

Treatment of overdosage is supportive, and it consists of replacing excessive fluid and electrolyte losses. Clinicians should frequently determine serum electrolytes, arterial blood gas analysis, and blood pressure. In addition, providers must assure adequate drainage in patients with urinary bladder outlet obstruction (such as prostatic hypertrophy).Â Hemodialysis does not accelerate furosemide elimination.
