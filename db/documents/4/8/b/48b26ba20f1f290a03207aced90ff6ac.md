Patency rates of the endovascular approach are slightly lower compared with open surgery. One-year and 5-year patency for the aortic arch occlusive disease is approximately 80% to 90% and 77% to 89%, respectively. Long-term patency rates are better for surgical bypass but carry a higher short-term risk.

Complication rates ranged from 0% to 20% over a 5-year period. They were mostly related to access-entry site types of complications such as pseudoaneurysm, hematoma, and dissection. The incidence of stroke is 1%. Restenosis and stent fracture is described in the literature. Complete occlusion and longer lesions (more than 2 cm) contribute to worse outcomes.

**Postoperative Management**

Management is geared towards controlling PAD risk factors (smoking cessation, statins, beta-blockers, and aspirin). For patients with stent placement, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is highly advocated.

**Patient Follow up**

Physical examination should be performed every six months, including bilateral upper extremity blood pressure measurement. Duplex studies of the brachiocephalic arteries, including upper extremity segmental pressures and pulse volume recordings, should be performed every six months for the first 18 to 24 months; then the interval may be increased to annually.
