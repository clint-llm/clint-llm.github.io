KHE typically presents as an enlarging, firm, purpuric cutaneous or soft tissue lesion. It may be indurated, with a pebbly texture and poorly defined margins. KHE may involve the trunk, extremities, or retroperitoneum. Up to 10% of all KHE casesÂ are not cutaneous.

Infants affected by KMP who have cutaneous involvement of KHE or TA will present with a rapidly enlarging pre-existing lesion that becomes tense, purpuric, or ecchymotic, is markedly painful. The swelling may be dramatic. Of note, if the lesion involves the retroperitoneum, the enlarging lesion may not be readily apparent on physical exam.
