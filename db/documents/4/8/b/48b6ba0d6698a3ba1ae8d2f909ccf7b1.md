A stroke, or cerebrovascular accident, is an emergency medical condition characterized by an acute compromise of the cerebral perfusion or vasculature. The leading cause of ischemic stroke is hypertension whereas clotting disorders, carotid dissection, and illicit drug abuse are common causes in the younger populations. A quick diagnosis followed by prompt management needs to be set in motion by the interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for those with stroke. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of cerebrovascular disease and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the risk factors for a cerebrovascular accident.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with a stroke, and the appropriate examination process, including diagnostic imaging if indicated.
- Review the treatment and management of stroke.
- Outline the value of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to promptly identify the type of stroke (embolic or hemorrhagic) and institute thrombolytic treatment accordingly to decrease morbidity and mortality in those affected.
