The main diagnostic feature is an increase in serum IgE levels of more than 2000 U/mL, and often 500 U/mL. A clinical score has been developed to define the probability of diagnosis. A total IgE concentration greater than 1000 IU/mL and a weighted score of greater than 30 indicate an AD-HIES of the defect in STAT3, and a dominant-negative heterozygote mutation in STAT3 confirms the diagnosis.

Eosinophilia is observed in more than 90% of the patients. The WBC count can be normal, elevated, or reduced in number(neutropenia).
