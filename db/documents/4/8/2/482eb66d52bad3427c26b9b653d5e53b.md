Even with proper antibiotic treatment, most UTI symptoms can last several days. In women with recurrent UTIs, the quality of life can be poor. About 25% of women experience such recurrences within six months. Factors that indicate a poor outlook include:

- Poor overall health

- Advanced age

- Presence of renal calculi

- Diabetes (especially if poorly controlled)

- Sickle cell anemia

- Presence of malignancy

- Urethral catheterization

- Ongoing chemotherapy

- Incontinence

- Chronic diarrhea

While mortality rates are low, the morbidity of UTIs is enormous. Besides the annoying symptoms, the cost of management is prohibitive. Missing work and school are common sequelae; sometimes, hospital admission is required because of the severity of the symptoms.
