One of the significant issues in the management of patients who had ACS is the optimal strategy to balance ischemic risk and bleeding risk in patients who require long-term anticoagulation due to another specific indication, as these patients already require antiplatelet therapy post-ACS. This type of treatment has the name triple therapy. In the most recent ACC/AHA guideline on UA/NSTEMI, the recommendation is that patients who had ACS and underwent PCI should receive triple therapy, but with making every effort to minimize the duration to limit the risk of bleeding.
