Nitroprusside is a fast-acting, easily titratable, highly effective antihypertensive agent that must be used with extreme care. While its use has declined in recent years as newer agents have become available, this drug still has a role in treating hypertensive emergencies and other disease processes that require an urgent reduction in arterial blood pressure.

Interprofessional communication is critical to the safe use of nitroprusside as these patients require intensive monitoring of hemodynamic parameters. All members of the interprofessional healthcare team must be familiar with the potential adverse effects and toxicity syndromes. Careful patient selection based on comorbidities and risk factors is required, and clinicians (surgeons, anesthesiologists, intensivists) should engage in shared decision-making with their pharmacists to assess each patient's risk factors and determine an appropriate dosing protocol. In utilizing this team-oriented approach, sodium nitroprusside can be a safe and effective therapeutic option for managing acutely hypertensive patients. [Level 5]
