Different types of connective tissue have considerable variation in blood supply, although most are well vascularized. Cartilage is an exception as it is avascular with no direct blood supply, although chondrocytes within cartilage are supplied by blood via diffusion. Tendons and ligaments are composed mainly of densely packed collagen fibers which undergo no metabolic activity and do not require a blood supply. While living cells are hidden within the collagen fibers of tendons and ligaments that require a blood supply, their volume is minimal.
