Burns are often preventable. Treatment depends on severity. Superficial burns may be managed with cleaning and pain medication, while major burns require prolonged treatment. Partial-thickness burns require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Burns is considered tetanus-prone wounds, and tetanus toxoids should be given every five years, if not up to date.

Burns often become infected; tetanus toxoid should be given if not current.

Burns account for over 30 million injuries per year in the United States. This resulted in about 3 million hospitalizations and 240,000 deaths per year. In the United States, approximately 96% of those admitted to a burn center survive their injuries, but prompt treatment is required. It is essential for all clinicians to be familiar with the evaluation and appropriate referral of the burned patient.
