Rib fractures can be traumatic or atraumatic. Â Most rib fractures are due to direct penetrating or blunt trauma to the chest. Ribs 1 through 3 are the hardest to break and signify a significant degree of trauma if fractured. Ribs 4 through 10 are typically the most vulnerable while ribs 11 through 12 are more mobile and therefore more difficult to break. In the elderly, falls are a common etiology of rib fractures and are associated with higher mortality and morbidity than younger patients.
