Due to the rarity of diaphragmatic eventration, there is limited data on the incidence and prevalence of this condition. A limited number of case reports have suggested the incidence is as low as less than 0.05% with male predominance and more commonly affecting the left hemidiaphragm. Others have suggested the incidence to be 1 in 10,000 live births. The incidence is likely higher than reported as most patients are asymptomatic, and many remain undiagnosed.
