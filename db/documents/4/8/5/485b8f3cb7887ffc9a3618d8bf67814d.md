The cervix is the structure that connects the uterus to the vagina. It is composed of two regions which are the ectocervix and the endocervical canal. The ectocervix is the portion that projects into the vagina. A stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium lines it. The opening in the ectocervix is the external os and marks the transition from ectocervix to the endocervical canal. The endocervical canal runs the length of the cervix and connects the endometrial cavity with the vagina. It is lined with glandular epithelium. The ectocervix has the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ). It is an area of transformation within which the epithelium changes from glandular to squamous, and it is this area that is most susceptible to the human papillomavirus attachment which can lead to dysplasia and malignant transformation. When considering surgical options to perform a conization procedure, keep in mind the main vascular supply of the cervix is at three o'clock and nine o’clock with the descending branches of the uterine artery and vein.
