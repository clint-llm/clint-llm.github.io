**Arterial Supply**

Branches of the splenic artery (aÂ branch of the celiac trunk), superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and the common hepatic artery provide blood supply to the pancreas.

- Pancreatic head: The gastroduodenal artery (a branch of the common hepatic artery) supplies the head and the uncinate process of the pancreas in the form of the pancreaticoduodenal artery (PDA). Part of the inferior portion of the head is supplied by the inferior PDA, which arises from the SMA.

- Body and the tail: The splenic artery and its branches supply these.

**Venous Supply**

- Pancreatic head: The head drains into the superior mesenteric vein (SMV).

- Body and the neck: The splenic vein drains these.

The SMV and splenic vein merge to form the portal vein.
