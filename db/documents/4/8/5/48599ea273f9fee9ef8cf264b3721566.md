There are no clinical diagnostic criteria for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. Clinical symptoms, family history, and ancestry can increase the yield of the targeted molecular genetic testing.

Although whole-genome sequencing technologies are promising, they lack internal and external validation for CAG expansion specific for DRPLA. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is used to guide management in the context of suspicion of seizures. Focal motor seizures with impaired awareness progressing to generalized tonic-clonic seizures are the typical semiology.

Hypoalbuminemia has also been studied as a possible biological marker, given that some studies show it is inversely correlated with CAG length.
