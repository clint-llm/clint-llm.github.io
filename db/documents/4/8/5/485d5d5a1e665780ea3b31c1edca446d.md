It is most commonly located in the metaphysis or at the epiphysis of femur or tibia. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of giant cell tumors and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for the patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of giant cell tumors.
- Summarize the pathophysiology of giant cell tumors. 
- Outline the treatment options for giant cell tumors.
- Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the early detection of giant cell tumors and improve outcomes.
