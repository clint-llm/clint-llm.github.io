There are 3 techniques for PEG tube placement: the peroral pull technique (Ponsky), the peroral push technique (Sacks-Vine), and the direct percutaneous procedure (Russell), of which the first is the most commonly used.

**Russell Technique**
**

Russell technique is rarely used. After the setup above, the guidewire is passed through the needle and identified inside the stomach by the camera and the needle is removed. The dilator is passed over the guide wire and then the sheath until visible in the stomach. The feeding tube is then passed through the sheath into the stomach, and after visualizing the tube, the balloon of the feeding tube is inflated inside the stomach, and the tube is pulled to the anterior abdomen and clipped percutaneously via a skin disc. The length of the tube at the level of the skin (approximately 3 to 4 cm) and tightness is noted.

****Sacks-Vine Technique****

Sacks-Vine technique (preoral push) has the guidewire passed through the needle and entrapped by a snare passed through the endoscope. Once the wire is securely entrapped, the needle is removed, and the endoscope with the snare and guide wire is withdrawn from the mouth. Once enough guide wire is visible through the mouth, the feeding tube is inserted over the wire and pushed down through the mouth. The tapered end of the feeding tube is caught as it emerges on the skin and is withdrawn to approximately 3 to 4 cm from the anterior abdominal wall. The guide wire is then withdrawn, and the endoscope is reinserted into the stomach to ensure proper positioning of the feeding tube. The skin disc is secured over the feeding tube to hold the tube in place, and the length of the tube and tightness are noted.

****Ponsky Technique****

Ponsky technique (preoral pull) is the most commonly used and is similar to the Sacks-Vine technique; however, it requires pulling the feeding tube rather than pushing it. A braided suture is passed through the needle and entrapped by a snare passed through the endoscope. The needle is removed, and the endoscope with the snare and suture is withdrawn from the mouth. The feeding tube is attached to the rope is withdrawn from the stomach as the tube is carefully guided from the patient's mouth into the stomach and pulled through the anterior abdominal wall. The endoscope is re-inserted into the mouth to visualize the proper positioning of the feeding tube on the stomach wall. The skin disc is placed to hold the tube in position, and the length and tightness of the tube are noted.

Post-operatively, the site should be kept clean, and the stoma should be examined for any signs of infection (erythema, pain,  purulent leakage). Traditionally, feeds were started on the following post-operative day. However, many studies found that feeding initiated as early as 4 hours after PEG placement is safe.
