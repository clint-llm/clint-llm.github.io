The anatomic location of the extensor carpi ulnaris is essential in a variety of orthopedic procedures, including those operations at the level of the distal humerus, elbow joint, forearm, and wrist. For example, during the open reduction and internal fixation of the olecranon and proximal ulnar fractures, the extensor carpi ulnaris is identified based on its original fibers on the lateral epicondyle and dorsal aspect of the ulna and may need to be manipulated to locate the components of the fracture.

One of the injuries that may require surgical intervention is the subluxation of the extensor carpi ulnaris. It more frequently occurs in athletes subject to frequent, forceful wrist rotation than in the general population. This injury most commonly occurs in sports such as tennis, golf, and water polo.

Three different types of retinacular tears can contribute to this condition described in the literature. Type A involves the ulnar rupture of the sheath in which the sheath remains superficial to the tendon. Type B describes a radial rupture of the sheath in which it lies in the ulnar groove of the bone. Lastly, type C occurs when the fibro-osseous sheath is detached from the periosteum of the ulna, thus forming a false pouch for the tendon.

Patients with this injury often describe a painful snap at the dorsal-ulnar aspect of the wrist. There is some controversy concerning the treatment of this injury. However, surgical repair of the fibro-osseous sheath is effective.
