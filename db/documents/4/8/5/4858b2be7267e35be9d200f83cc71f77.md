Effective dose refers to the amount of radiation received by the whole body, and measurement is in millisievert (mSv). Generally speaking, various procedures entail different effective radiation doses based on site and use of contrast. For example, a radiograph of the spine has an approximate effective dose of around 1 mSv.
