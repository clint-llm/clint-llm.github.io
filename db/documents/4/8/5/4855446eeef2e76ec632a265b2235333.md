Patients with oral mucosal infections frequently present with symptoms of pain, inflammation, and odynophagia to the emergency department or dental office. Oral manifestations of bacterial infections are common, and most importantly, they tend to be one of their first clinical signs. Dentists have a unique opportunity to identify these infectious diseases at early stages and make the appropriate referral for further testing and treatment.

The described conditions require an interprofessional team effort and management, including dentists, primary care physicians, nurses, pharmacists, pathologists, and other specialists. Pharmacists should emphasize compliance with the antibiotic regimen and alert patients about antibacterial resistance. The healthcare professionals team should stress any delay in treatment can worsen the disease, increase the risk of transmission and lead to irreversible complications. [Level 5]
