Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) represent a group of severe systemic febrile illnesses caused by four families of viruses - Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, and Flaviviridae. These enveloped viruses are characterized by a myriad of symptoms that range from coagulopathies, hemodynamic instability, altered mental status, and, if severe enough, death. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of viral hemorrhagic fevers and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of viral hemorrhagic fevers.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of patients with viral hemorrhagic fevers.
- Describe the management of viral hemorrhagic fevers.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes in patients with viral hemorrhagic fevers.
