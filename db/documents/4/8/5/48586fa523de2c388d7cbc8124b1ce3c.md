There is no cure for AITL outside the realm of bone marrow transplantation. Early involvement of a hematologist specializing in malignant hematology to choose an ideal chemotherapy regimen to induce remission (either complete or partial remission) in the “transplant eligible” patient is important. In patients who are “transplant-ineligible,” the strategy should be to choose an ideal regimen to increase progression-free survival. A dermatologist, radiation oncologist, and hematologist should evaluate patients with cutaneous T cell lymphomas (MF and PCALCL) to choose an ideal therapeutic regimen that involves a combination of skin directed therapy and systemic therapy or one of them.

A clean line of communication needs to be maintained between these key players mentioned above to provide optimal care to these patients. Treatment of Peripheral T cell lymphomas can result in a lot of drug toxicity; these should be monitored with frequent follow-ups, especially during active chemotherapy.
