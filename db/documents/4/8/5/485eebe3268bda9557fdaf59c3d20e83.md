Osteopathic manipulative treatment, or OMT for short, is a technique by which osteopathic physicians have used their hands to diagnose and treat numerous health conditions for years. This type of hands-on treatment has helped reduce the number of pain medications patients may need for a musculoskeletal injury. High velocity-low amplitude, or HVLA for short, is a type of manipulation in which the provider provides a rapid (high velocity) therapeutic force of brief duration that travels a short distance (low amplitude) within the anatomic range of motion of a joint and engages a restrictive barrier in one or more planes of motion to elicit the release of restriction. This activity describes the mechanics of thoracic HVLA and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the neurophysiologic mechanisms of HVLA.
- Identify the indications/contraindications of HVLA treatment.
- Outline the steps in performing HVLA on the thoracic spine.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients receiving thoracic HVLA.
