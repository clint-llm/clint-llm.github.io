Following are the complications associated with the percutaneous coronary intervention.

- Coronary artery dissection

- Coronary artery perforation

- Distal embolization of clot

- Side branch occlusion

- Stent thrombosis

- Access site bleeding

- Access site hematoma

- Acute kidney injury

- Stroke

- Allergic reaction to contrast

Following are the complications associated with fluoroscopic radiation exposure to patients or staff.

**Tissue Reaction**

- **Skin Injury**: It is the most common tissue reaction at the beam entry site following fluoroscopic guided percutaneous coronary intervention and varies according to time of exposure:

- Few hours  to days of post-exposure: Mild skin erythema

- A week to several weeks of post-exposure: Significant erythema

- After 4 to 8 weeks of post-exposure: Severe skin injury including ulceration in rare cases

- **Bone Injury**: In rare cases, radiation can cause necrosis of superficial bones such as ribs.

- **Eye Injury**: The single-dose threshold of radiation that can cause a cataract to believe to be 500 mGy with a minimum latency period of one year.

**Stochastic Effects: Radiation-Induced Cancer**

It is the most important and catastrophic result of radiation exposure. It is vital to provide knowledge of the scholastic risk of radiation exposure to both patients and healthcare workers. These steps are necessary to reduce the risk, which includes the use of radiation protection instruments.
