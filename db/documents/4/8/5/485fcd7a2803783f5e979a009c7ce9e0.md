Torsion occurs in females of all ages but is most common in women of childbearing age. In a 10-year review of surgical emergencies at a womenâ€™s hospital, ovarian torsion was the fifth most common, accounting for 2.7 percent. Only 20% of patients are premenarchal, and 50% of these will have a normal ovary. The majority of reproductive-age females with torsion had a benign ovarian mass.
