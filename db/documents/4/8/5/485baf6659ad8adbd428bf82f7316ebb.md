Interpolated flaps are often based on a named vascular supply, but frequently include more random blood supply at the distal edges. The paramedian forehead flap is an axial flap based on the supratrochlear arterial blood supply, although some authors have reported that with the abundant anastomoses in the forehead, it can be performed as a random flap. This flap can also be based on the supraorbital vessels, though this is uncommon.

After the interpolated flap is raised and inset in the first surgery, the bridging pedicle is left in place to allow neo-vascularization between the flap and recipient site. For most paramedian, melolabial, and postauricular flaps this connection is maintained for three weeks, then the pedicle is divided. For deltopectoral flaps and waltzing flaps, four to six weeks is often required before the pedicle can be divided safely.
