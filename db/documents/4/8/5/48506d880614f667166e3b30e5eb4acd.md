Patients diagnosed with primary ciliary dysfunctionÂ should be followed by a pulmonologist for routine PFTS and airway clearance management. Additionally, patients should be evaluated at least initially by ENT providers if suffering from chronic sinusitis and recurrent otitis media. Genetic consultation can be helpful for patients seeking additional information. Lastly, fertility consultation may be required for adults with PCD requesting information on family planning.
