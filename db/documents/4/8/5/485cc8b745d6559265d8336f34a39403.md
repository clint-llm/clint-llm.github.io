The diagnosis of hypomelanosis of Ito is clinical. When the disease is suspected, a careful examination with Wood’s lamp can enhance the hypopigmentation and help to confirm the diagnosis.

Diagnostic criteria have been established for HI:

Major criteria:

- Non-hereditary cutaneous hypopigmented linear streaks or patches involving more than two body segments, appearing at birth or in the first months

- One or more neurological or musculoskeletal manifestations.

Minor criteria

- Chromosomal anomalies

- Two or more congenital malformation, excluding nervous and musculoskeletal systems.

The diagnosis is retained with one major or minor criterion or two minor standards.
