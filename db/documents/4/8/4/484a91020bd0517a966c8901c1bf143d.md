An often overlooked and underutilized modality, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), offers a wealth of information about a patient’s functional status. As a dynamic test, CPET can identify cardiac or pulmonary disease in patients with marginally abnormal diagnostics (electrocardiograms (EKGs), echocardiography, spirometer, etc.), or in those who appear more clinically disabled than their diagnostic tests indicate. Collected data during the procedure include EKG, heart rate, oxygen uptake, and carbon dioxide output. From collected data, minute ventilation, and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) can be calculated, allowing the clinician to assess a patient’s overall cardiopulmonary function. This can be useful in pre-operative risk assessment, the diagnosis of various cardiopulmonary diseases, the evaluation of post-operative recovery, or more general assessment of an individual’s exercise capacity.
