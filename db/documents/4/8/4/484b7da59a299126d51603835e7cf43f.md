As of now, radiation therapy is not known to be effective for microcystic adnexal carcinoma. Radiotherapy alone is not recommended. The latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for MAC state that adjuvant radiotherapy may be considered when MAC involves peripheral nerves, margins cannot be surgically cleared, or if the tumor is present at the margins.

A combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel has been used in chemoradiation to treat patients refusing surgical treatment, resulting in the possibility of a six-year tumor-free survival.
