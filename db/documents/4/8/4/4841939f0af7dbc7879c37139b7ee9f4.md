It is essential to recognize the clinical signs as a result of trauma. For example, recognizing signs of blood loss such as tachycardia and hypotension as precursors for potential hypovolemic shock. Another warning sign would be single pupillary palsy post head trauma. The physical exam, along with the patient’s history, is pertinent to initiating the correct treatment. Missing these clinical clues can delay patient treatment and can lead to adverse outcomes, including death.
