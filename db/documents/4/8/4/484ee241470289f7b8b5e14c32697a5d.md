All three thrombin products, bovine thrombin, human thrombin and, recombinant thrombin, have been widely used across surgical specialties to achieve hemostasis and overcome bleeding during surgical procedures. Consequently, it is essential for the medical team involved in the peri- and post-operative care of the patient to be aware of any adverse reactions to any of the thrombin products.

Proper monitoring and surveillance of partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, the international normalized ratio is crucial due to the risk of coagulopathies related to these products. It is of equal importance for the interprofessional healthcare team to avoid re-exposure in patients with a previous adverse reaction to thrombin and the avoidance of human thrombin in patients with a history of harmful reactions to human blood products. With interprofessional coordination and communication between clinicians, mid-level practitioners, surgeons, nurses, and pharmacists, appropriately managed thrombin use will result in improved patient outcomes while minimizing adverse events.

In conclusion, thrombin is a great drug that has been used over the decades to accomplish hemostasis. However, it is not absent from adverse effects. Newer bovine thrombin formulations and, in recent years, the development of alternate thrombin products, like human thrombin and recombinant thrombin, provides the patient with a safer drug that enhances clinical outcomes and reduces morbidity and mortality.
