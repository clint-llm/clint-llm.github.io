Vast differences have been reported in the literature about the nerve distribution to the breast tissue, especially with areola and nipple. However, the majority agrees to the fact that the mammary gland receives innervation by **anterior and lateral cutaneous branches **coming from the** second to sixth intercostal nerves **and also from the** supraclavicular nerves. **They form a plexus underneath the areola in the subdermal tissue and supply the nipple and the areola.

In the case of surgical reconstruction of the breast, it is essential to preserve the nipple and areola along with its innervation. Hence, lots of studies have been done in recent times to understand the breast's nerve supply, especially concerning the nipple and areola.
