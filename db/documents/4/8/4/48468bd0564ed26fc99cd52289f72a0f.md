Renal oncocytomas are common benign kidney neoplasms that account for 3 to 7 percent of renal neoplasms. They usually occur in adults, most frequently in the seventh decade of life. Renal oncocytomas may be discovered incidentally or may be diagnosed with biopsy or excision. Renal oncocytomas usually have an excellent prognosis and are not associated with an aggressive clinical course; however, there can occasionally be metastasis to liver and bone and fatalities have occurred. Surgical excision is curative in the absence of metastases. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of renal oncocytoma and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical presentation of renal oncocytoma.
- Explain how to rule out conditions that may mimic renal oncocytoma.
- Review the management of renal oncocytoma.
- Explain the need for optimizing care coordination, with particular emphasis on communication between interprofessional medical teams, to enhance prompt evaluation and management of renal oncocytomas to decrease risk of metastases and improve outcomes.
