A hard intratesticular mass is a diagnostic of testicular cancer unless proven otherwise. However, some other diagnoses to consider while evaluating a testicular mass include:

- Epididymo-orchitis

- Hematoma

- Inguinal hernia

- Hydrocele

- Spermatocele or epididymal head cyst

- Varicocele

- Lymphoma (the most common finding in bilateral testis lesions in older men)

- Metastasis from other cancers (eg, lung cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer)

- Syphilitic gumma

- Tuberculoma

Ultrasonography helps further narrow down the diagnosis and radical inguinal orchiectomy is the definitive modality for diagnosis.
