There are several genetically inherited muscular dystrophy disorders, which are progressive and have no cure. Because of the high morbidity and mortality, these disorders are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, physical therapist, internist, pediatrician, and a geneticist. Many of these patients develop severe motor problems and either become bedridden or must useÂ a wheelchair. It is important to involve social workers early in their treatment to help improve the home environment and the quality of life. Rehabilitation and neuroscience nurses participate in patient care and report changes to the team. Pharmacists review medication, educate families about proper administration and side effects and monitor compliance. [Level 5]
