Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare cause of cardiomyopathy that occurs during late pregnancy or the early postpartum period. This condition can be life-threatening and is characterized by significant left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.

PPCM is not a precisely defined entity. In 2010, the European Society of Cardiology described PPCM as an idiopathic cardiomyopathy with the following characteristics:

- Development of heart failure toward the end of pregnancy or in the postpartum period.

- Absence of another identifiable cause of the heart failure.

- Left ventricular systolic dysfunction with a left ventricle (LV) ejection fraction nearly always less than 45 percent. The LV may or may not be dilated.
