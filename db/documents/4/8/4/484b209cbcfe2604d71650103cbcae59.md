All POCT or laboratory-based analyses must be subject to quality control (QC) and quality assurance measures. This should encompass a quality system that includes effective training, record-keeping, and review.Â All users of POCT devices must use QC material and participate in external quality assurance (EQA) schemes.

If powders or liquids obtained from patients are to be analyzed, special precautions are needed to avoid contamination of laboratory equipment with high quantities of drugs and to protect laboratory personnel from highly potent drugs or toxic substances.
