**Meningococcal Vaccination**

**Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine**

There are three types of meningococcal vaccines. The oldest vaccine is a polysaccharide containing fragments of the meningococcal polysaccharide capsule of four serotypes as antigens (MPSV4). These vaccines are characterized by low immunogenicity in children, so they should not be used for primary immunization in patients younger than 5 years. They are effective as booster doses after vaccination with a conjugate vaccine.

**Meningococcal C Conjugate Vaccines (MenCC)**

The conjugated vaccines, similarly like polysaccharide one, contains fragments of the N. meningitidis capsule antigens, although they are linked to a protein that is most often a tetanus toxin (MenACWY-D) or a genetically modified diphtheria toxin (MenACWY-CRM). This combination makes these vaccines immunogenic even in the youngest infants. They effectively generate immunological memory and reduce the nasopharyngeal carriage.

The recommendations on MenCC vaccine use vary in different regions. The first country to implement a routine MenCC vaccination into their national childhood immunization program was the United Kingdom in 1999, then followed by other European countries. The routine campaign in the United Kingdom was directed to infants (first dose at 2 months of age), but catch-up programs for other age groups led rapidly to high coverage in all persons in a group aged 2 months to 22 years. Public MenCC vaccination contributed to a reduction in serogroup C nasopharyngeal carriage and reduction of N. meningitidis type C IMD in unvaccinated age groups (herd protection).

Numerous studies have confirmed the efficacy of the meningococcal C conjugate vaccines. In a large epidemiological study conducted in Europe from 2004 through 2014, a significant decrease in IMD prevalence was observed in countries with established MenCC vaccination programs. In countries that had introduced routine MenCC vaccines into their national vaccination program before 2004 and between 2004 and 2014, an annual decrease of 10.2% and 8.3%, respectively, was observed. No significant trend was observed in countries with no routine MenCC vaccination.

**Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Recommendations on Meningococcal C Conjugate Vaccine**

According to the CDC, all children aged 11 to 12 should be vaccinated with one dose of a conjugate meningococcal vaccine. Since protection wanes, whose vaccinated before 16 years of age require a booster dose administered with an interval of a minimum of 8 weeks, preferably at the age of 16 to 18 years. If the first dose was introduced in a person older than 16 years, the booster dose is not recommended.

Although routine vaccination of infants and young children is not recommended, all patients aged 2 months to 10 years should receive the conjugate vaccine if they belong to a high-risk group of developing IMD.

Adults should receive a conjugate meningococcal vaccine if they meet risk factors. For healthy individuals, one-dose vaccination is scheduled. For patients suffering from congenital or acquired immune deficiency (e.g., anatomical or functional asplenia, HIV infection, persistent complement component deficiency, eculizumab use), two doses of primary vaccination implemented with an 8-week interval are recommended. If the risk remains, both groups should receive the booster dose of the same preparation every 5 years.

Meningococcal conjugate vaccines may be given to pregnant women who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease.

**Meningococcal B Protein Vaccine (MenB)**

The third meningococcal vaccine group includes protein vaccines designed against group B meningococci. They are characterized by good immunogenicity; however, no data is available concerning how long their effectiveness persists due to the relatively short time of their use. In Europe, it was licensed in 2013. Since 2015, MenB vaccination had been included in the United Kingdom national childhood vaccination schedule; subsequently, other countries, including Ireland and Italy, followed. It is not publicly funded but strongly recommended in most of the other European countries. The quadrivalent MenB vaccine has been proved to produce a good immune response in children older than 2 months.

**CDC Recommendations on Meningococcal B vaccine**

MenB vaccines are recommended for adolescents aged 10 and older belonging to the risk factors group. The preferred age for MenB vaccination is 16 to 18 years.

As there are no randomized controlled trials concerning the safety of MenB vaccines, use in pregnant or lactation women, the vaccination may be implemented only in case of increased risk of developing B-type meningococcal disease when the potential benefits outweigh the risks.
