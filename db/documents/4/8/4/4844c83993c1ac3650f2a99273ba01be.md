The Apley grind test, also known as the Apley compression test or the Apley test, is a maneuver performed to evaluate meniscus injury. Clinicians usually perform it in conjunction with the Apley distraction test, which assesses for ligamentous injury. Meniscal injuries are very common and are associated with significant pain and morbidity. This activity describes the Apley grind test and its indications and contraindications and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with meniscus injuries.

**Objectives:**
- Describe how the Apley grind test is performed.
- Review the implications of pain with compression during the Apley grind test.
- Summarize the contraindications to the Apley grind test.
- Explain strategies to optimize care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by meniscus injuries.
