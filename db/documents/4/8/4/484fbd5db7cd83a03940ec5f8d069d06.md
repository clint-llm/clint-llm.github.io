The FDA currently lists two contraindications for scopolamine: allergy to belladonna alkaloids and angle-closure glaucoma.Â Patients with angle-closure glaucoma should not be prescribed scopolamine. Scopolamine causes mydriasis or pupillary dilation. A dilated iris prohibits proper drainage of fluid from the anterior chamber, creating a further increase in anterior chamber pressure and precipitating acute angle-closure glaucoma.
