Physical therapy, pain medications, spinal manipulation, facet block, radiofrequency lesioning, and surgical intervention all can be used to treat pain related to facet degeneration.

Physical therapy includes education of proper posture and restoration of correct body mechanics. Positions such as excessive extension or extension with rotation should be avoided. Strengthening of deep neck flexors and abdominal muscles can help to balance the overactivated extensors of the neck and back.

Pain medications such as steroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAID), or cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor(COX-2) can be given orally for initial pharmacologic treatment of acute pain related to facet arthritis or following acute exacerbation of chronic pain related to facet arthritis.

Spinal manipulation, by using the muscle energy technique or high-velocity low-amplitude maneuver to correct the type II dysfunction of the facet joints (flexion-rotation-side bent or extension-rotation-side bent postures) can help to realign the facet joints and can alleviate pain.

Landmark-guided, ultrasound-guided, or fluoroscopically guided techniques in facet block or medial branch block can be used to treat pain related to facet arthritis. Radiofrequency lesioning of the medial branch of the posterior ramus can be used if the pain is recalcitrant to the previous block.

Surgical intervention is not the first-line treatment for the management of facet arthritis. Surgery is indicated when there is a combination of other diseases such as severe spinal stenosis or herniated discs that produce intractable pain, loss of motor function, or incontinence.
