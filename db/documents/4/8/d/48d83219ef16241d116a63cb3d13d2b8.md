Middle-earÂ barotrauma is the most common complication of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Its incidence is approximately 13%, but the vast majority of these cases resolve with no sequela. The incidence of middle ear barotrauma can be lowered using slower compression rates, coaching proper ear clearing techniques, and oral decongestants. The O'Neill grading scale has shown greater inter-rater reliability and utility than Teed's scale in determining the degree of barotrauma and recommended treatment options.
