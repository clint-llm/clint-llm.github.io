Photoprotection is indicated for the reduction of ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced skin damage and skin cancers. Photoprotection includes sunscreens, clothing, hats, makeup, sunglasses, and windshields. The damaging effects of UV radiation include photoaging and photocarcinogenesis. Photoaging can manifest as sagging and wrinkling, while photocarcinogenesis is due to the damage of cells and DNA. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of various photoprotective agents, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating indicated disorders as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of various classes of UV blocking agents.
- Review the benefits of using sunscreens and photoprotection to block UV rays.
- Summarize the adverse events associated with various sun-blocking products.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients who can benefit from therapy with sunscreens and photoprotective agents.
