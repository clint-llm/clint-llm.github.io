Cervical polyps are a common condition seen in the gynecological practice; they are the second most common polyps seen at the gynecological examination, following the endometrial polyps.

In the general population, the estimated prevalence of cervical polyps is between 2 to 5 % of women. Multigravida women have an increased risk of developing cervical polyps compared to the nulliparous. One of eight women has a recurrence of cervical polyp after removal.

Localizing polyps during the routine gynecological examination before the development of high-resolution ultrasound and hysteroscopy, in addition to the fact that the cervical polyps are asymptomatic in most cases, was very challenging. Nowadays, using the currently available technologies made it easier for the gynecologist to identify and localize cervical polyps, which correlates with improved outcomes for the patients.
