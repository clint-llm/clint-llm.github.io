The incidence of tetrodotoxin poisoning is very rare but is higher in countries where people eat pufferfish regularly, such as Japan, Taiwan, and some Southeast Asian countries. From 2002 to 2006, 223 Japanese patients have suffered tetrodotoxin poisoning, and 13 of these patients died. From 2001 to 2006, 53 patients in Singapore were diagnosed with tetrodotoxin poisoning, and 8 of these patients died. In 2008, cheap pufferfish sold in fish markets led to three outbreaks in Bangladesh, affecting 141 people, 17 of whom died from respiratory arrest. Due to the rarity of the disease, exact mortality rates are difficult to establish.
