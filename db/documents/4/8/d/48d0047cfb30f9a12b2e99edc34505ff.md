Chest imaging plays a crucial role in the evaluation of anterior mediastinal masses. The initial detection of anterior mediastinal masses may occur on chest radiographs (CXR); however, basic anatomical structures may not be visible. Chest computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast is the most important radiologic tool for evaluation, as it depicts different tissue attenuations.

Additional imaging tests may be necessary for specific etiologies of anterior mediastinal masses. When evaluating a mediastinal goiter for active thyroid tissue, scintigraphy with radioactive iodine will be useful. If a mediastinal parathyroid adenoma is suspected, nuclear scans with isotopes, such as technetium-99, should be ordered. All male patients with a mediastinal germ cell tumor should undergo testicular ultrasound as part of a thorough work-up for primary gonadal malignancy. Pulmonary function tests are necessary for all patients. Spirometry will typically be normal; however, flattening of the inspiratory flow loop on the flow-volume curve may be identified in cases of variable extrathoracic obstruction caused by the tumor.

The clinician should obtain a complete blood count and complete metabolic panel in all patients. Additionally, AFP and beta-hCG are necessary if there is a high suspicion for non-seminomatous germ cell tumors, as levels will typically present as elevated. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is less specific but is usually also increased with non-seminomatous germ cell tumors, as well as lymphoma. Depending on the clinical picture, the clinician may consider additional labs, such as a thyroid panel, if concerned for thyrotoxicosis. Thyroid carcinoid is associated with Cushing syndrome; therefore, the clinician should pursue a hypercortisolism workup in those cases. When suspecting a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, antibodies against acetylcholine receptors, muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), and lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) are in order. It should be noted, however, that 10 to 15% of patients with clinical MG will be seronegative for commercially tested antibodies due to insufficiently sensitive tests, or the presence of antibodies against other postsynaptic membrane antigens.

A diagnostic biopsy is obtainable via transthoracic or transbronchial needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, anterior mediastinotomy, or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). However, a tissue biopsy is not always necessary for the diagnosis of an anterior mediastinal mass when the clinical picture and the radiographic characteristics fit a classic prototype, as is typically the case with thymoma, teratoma, and thyroid goiter. For example, reliable diagnosis of thymoma can be made in an adult older than 50 years of age with MG and the typical appearance of thymoma on CT. Needle biopsy of thymoma can prove to have adverse effects, such as tumor seeding, which case reports have described.

In the case of lymphoma, tissue is needed to make the diagnosis and characterize the tumor, as some subtypes are manageable purely non-surgically. Although fine-needle biopsy may be initially employed, the yield is not always reliable for the dense, fibrotic lymphomas like Hodgkin lymphoma and mediastinal large cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. To sufficiently define the characteristics of an anterior mediastinal lymphoma, multiple core biopsies (3 to 5) are often necessary for immunohistochemistry, as well as the fine-needle aspiration for flow cytometry.
