Though thrombocytopenia in pregnancy is benign in the majority of patients, it should be investigated thoroughly, especially if the platelet count drops below 70 x 10^9/L. In the case of gestational thrombocytopenia, patients require reassurance about the benign nature of the diagnosis. Appropriate treatment directed towards the underlying etiology should start as soon as possible, and the patients and family members should receive appropriately targeted education. Patients should be followed for platelet counts every 2 to 4 weeks to observe a trend in their platelet counts and every two weeks near term. Patients and family members should understand that the mode of delivery (vaginal or cesarean section) will be decided based on obstetric indication and not the platelet count. In addition to this, patients should also know that platelet transfusions are not routine therapy for thrombocytopenia in pregnancy.Â The delivery is usually uncomplicated if their platelet count is more than 50 x 10^9/L. However, a goal of more than 80 x 10^9/L is considered appropriate for administering epidural anesthesia. An expert hematologist should be involved in the care of the pregnant women with thrombocytopenia, if the platelet count drops below 70 x 10^9/L or if bleeding develops.
