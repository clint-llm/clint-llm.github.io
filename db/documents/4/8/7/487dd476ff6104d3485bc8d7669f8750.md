The management of TDIs in children is challenging; when possible, acute and follow-up care should be provided by a child-orientated teamÂ with experience in managing pediatric orofacial injuries. These teams have access to specialist diagnostic and treatment adjuncts, including sedation and general anesthesia, to minimize pain and anxiety for the child.
