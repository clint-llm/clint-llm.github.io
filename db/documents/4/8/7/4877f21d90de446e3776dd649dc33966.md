Large randomized controlled trials are now available, which has studied the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), or revascularization in 12 to 24 months in patients treated with iFR/FFR guided PCI. The DEFER trial enrolled 325 patients and showed that patients with FFR values greater than 0.75 did not benefit from percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); however,Â patients with FFR less than 0.75 had symptomatic improvement.

The DEFINE-FLAIR and IFR SWEDEHEART trials showed the noninferiority of iFR compared to FFR with the primary outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events at 1 year.
