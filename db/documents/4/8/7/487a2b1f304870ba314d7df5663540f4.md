Many genetic and environmental factors have been studied in glioblastoma multiforme, but no risk factor that accounts for a large proportion of GBM has been identified. So like many other cancers, GBM is sporadic, although a study showed a high prevalence (17%) of prior therapeutic irradiation among patients with GBM.

Studies have shown a low risk of gliomas with allergies and atopic diseases.
