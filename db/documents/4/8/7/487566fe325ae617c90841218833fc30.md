Anodontia, hypodontia, and oligodontia generally have a good prognosis for treatment outcomes, especially with early detection and diagnosis. Depending on the extent and number of teeth missing, different prosthodontic and restorative options exist. With severe hypodontia being associated with syndromes, management of the syndrome itself generally precedes and occasionally precludes management of the dentition.

Hyperdontia and supernumerary teeth typically have a good prognosis, as they are treated or extracted if they pose a threat to erupting teeth, esthetics, or masticatory function.
