Amblyopia is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that amblyopia can only be diagnosed when all other ocular or cerebral pathology has been ruled out as the cause for decreased visual acuity. Common causes of decreased visual acuity include refractive error, cataract, corneal pathology, retinal pathology, and optic nerve pathology. Most of these pathologies can be ruled out by a complete eye exam. Cerebral visual impairment and functional (non-organic) vision loss should also be considered.
