Although there are various genotypes that can cause Turcot syndrome, the phenotype is generally the same, by definition: colorectal cancer with a primary brain tumor.

There is a phenotypic spectrum in TS.

In TS1, patients can also present with hematologic malignancies, café au lait spots, glioblastoma multiforme as a result of various MMR gene mutations. Patients with these mutations have fewer polyps in the colon, although on rare occasions, they can have significant polyposis as well. The converse is true for TS2. In TS2, patients can also present with epidermal cysts, tumors in other areas of the body, medulloblastoma because of a homozygous APC gene mutation. This mutation results in very significant polyposis of the colon, with polyps numbering in the thousands.

In TS2 analyses, it was found that patients who expressed the colonic polyposis phenotype tended to manifest the disease after age 17, and those that did not express the colonic phenotype manifested the disease (via brain tumor) by the age of 10.

Patients present either with glioblastoma in TS1 and medulloblastoma in TS2. Patients can also present with pituitary adenomas, ependymomas, astrocytomas in rare cases.

Patients with TS1 are children of consanguinity in 20% of cases, with no family history of brain tumors or colon cancer. It is categorized by lesser and larger polyps. It is associated with gliomas and skin manifestations such as cafe au lait spots.
