It is very important to distinguish occipital neuralgia from the occipital referral of pain from the atlantoaxial or upper zygapophyseal joints or tender trigger points in neck muscles or their insertions. Occipital neuralgia can produce symptoms indistinguishable from aÂ cervicogenic headache. It typically presents as a sharp pain in the occipital region.

Other differentials are as follows:

- Tension-type headaches and migraine

- Internal carotid or vertebral artery dissection

- Arnold-Chiari malformation

- Herniated intervertebral disc

- Intramedullary or extramedullary spinal tumor

- Spinal nerve compression or tumor

- Arteriovenous malformation

- Neck-tongue syndrome
