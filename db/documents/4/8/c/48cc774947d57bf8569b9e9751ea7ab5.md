Hospice end-of-life care requires an interprofessional team that includes clinicians (e.g., family doctors, specialists as outlined above), specialty trained nursing staff, home and inpatient health aids, psychological and mental health professionals, pharmacists, and, if necessary, clergy. All these specialties and disciplines must coordinate their activities, utilize open communication, work with the patient's family and friends, and exercise the utmost compassion during this sensitive time.
