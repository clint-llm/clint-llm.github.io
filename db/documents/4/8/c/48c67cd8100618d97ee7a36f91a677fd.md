Urinary conduits are often thought to be easier to perform than continent diversions as the surgical technique is less complicated and requires less time to perform.  An ileal conduit does not require anastomosis to the urethra; it also requires a shorter bowel segment to create the conduit.  The conduit itself requires minimal augmentation when compared to a neobladder.

Early complications include those involving the bowel, such as obstruction, anastomotic leak, and ileus. Ileus can occur in up to 20% of cases and is often the reason for prolonged hospital admission. The urinary leak is also important to consider and accounts for about 7% of complications.

Delayed complications include those involving the newly formed stoma, such as parastomal hernia, retraction or stenosis, and bleeding. Frequent urinary tract infection (UTI) can often be a problem for patients, and up to 6% end up dying from end-stage renal failure. These patients are also predisposed to developing renal stones, and ultrasound (USS) imaging can detect this. Metabolic complications can be of significant consequence; hence regular follow-up is needed to ensure electrolytes are normal, and the patient is not acidotic.

Patients can struggle with the psychological impact of living with a stoma and should be appropriately counseled beforehand.
