Medical and surgical history should be obtained from the patient, along with social history, allergies, and current medications.

A complete assessment of the ulcer and its surrounding tissue is crucial. Serial wound measurements, biopsy, and cultures are essential for quantitative evaluation of the wound. Qualitative evaluations include visual appearance and odor.

Necrotic-base ulcers have a black appearance and are non-viable, indicating a peripheral arterial disease or an infection. Fibrotic-base ulcers have a white to yellowish stringy appearance and tend to halt the formation of the granulation tissue. Granular-base ulcers have a beefy red appearance and indicate a positive healing potential. Wound tracking into sinus tracks should be bluntly probed as it can indicate a deeper infection.

Quantitative measurements should be checked at every clinic visit. Comparing the wound dimensions, including the width, length, and depth over time allows for evaluating the wound contracture. Ulceration discharge cultures can be obtained to target antibiotic therapy in the presence of an infection. A biopsy is performed to rule out any malignant changes in long-standing ulcers.
