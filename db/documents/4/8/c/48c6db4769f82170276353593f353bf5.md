Hypospadias is an anatomical congenital malformation of the male external genitalia. It is characterized by abnormal development of the urethral fold and the ventral foreskin of the penis that causesÂ abnormal positioning of the urethral opening.

In hypospadias, the external urethral meatus may present various degrees of malpositioning and may be found with associated penile curvature. Depending on the location of the defect, patients may have an additional genitourinary malformation.

Recent advances have made it possible for children less than 12 months to undergo a single-stage repair with relatively good outcomes.
