Bell and Kiebach in 2014 observed posterior crossbite as a common condition in deciduous and mixed dentition, with a prevalence of 5% to 8% in age group of 3 to 12 years. They also noted a high prevalence of 90% of functional crossbite associated with transverse discrepancies.

A study conducted in Turkish population by Gungor et al. in 2016 evaluated a  high prevalence of bilateral crossbite (51%) and unilateral crossbite on the right side (47.3%) and left side (53.6%) in permanent dentition.
