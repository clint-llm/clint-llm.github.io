Depending on the organ system involved, vascular insufficiency can lead to the following:

- The recurrence of angina or acute myocardial infarction.

- AV fistula or graft failure, which leads to a delay in hemodialysis due to loss of vascular access.

- Transient ischemic attacks or cerebrovascular accident due to post carotid endarterectomy restenosis or thrombosis.
