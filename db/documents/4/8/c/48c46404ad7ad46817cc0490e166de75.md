Rhinitis medicamentosa (RM), also known as ‘rebound congestion’ is inflammation of the nasal mucosa caused by the overuse of topical nasal decongestants.  It classifies as a subset of drug-induced rhinitis.

Topical decongestants are typically used in the relief of nasal congestion due to allergic rhinitis, acute or chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, or upper respiratory tract infection. The earliest nasal decongestants mainly derived from ephedrine, where there were reports of rebound congestion after prolonged use. This situation was found to develop as early as 3 days and up to 4 to 6 weeks of use.
