If the clinical staff suspects early signs of toxic methemoglobinemia in a patient after the use of benzocaine, supplemental oxygen and IV administration of a 1% solution of methylene blue are the recommended treatment. The dose is repeatable if no clinical improvement has occurred within the first hour of administration. Caution is necessary if administering a dose greater than 7 mg/kg; this can worsen symptoms of methemoglobinemia. Ascorbic acid can also be given for suspected methemoglobinemia but has a slower action compared to methylene blue.

When used in a pain control regimen, one of the rarer life-threatening complications of benzocaine toxicity is local anesthetic systemic toxicity syndrome (LAST). Several case studies have shown that the fundamental mechanism of LAST depends on several factors causing an overall decreased function in the cardiovascular system, as well as the central nervous system. These may include cardiac arrest or bradycardia, severe hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Toxicity symptoms may also involve convulsive syncope and seizures in patients after using local anesthetics, especially in the elderly population. Several case study analyses suggest prompt use of lipid emulsion therapy (20%) when there is suspicion of a seizure or a cardiovascular event in the patient. If a seizure due to benzocaine toxicity is suspected, the first step is airway management, followed by controlling the seizure and stabilizing hemodynamics.
