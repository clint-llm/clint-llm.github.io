It remains imperative to identify the risk factors and perform a thorough assessment of the patient before performing non-surgical rhinoplasty. An interprofessional team approach is an ideal way to limit the complications of this procedure. Before surgery, the patient should have the following done:

- Evaluation by a clinician experienced in selecting the appropriate patient for both surgical and non-surgical rhinoplasty

- Assessment by a clinician familiar with the contraindications to non-surgical rhinoplasty with fillers to ensure that the patient can safely undergo the procedure

An interprofessional team of an experienced injector and assistants should be involved during the non-surgical rhinoplasty to maximize outcomes. Nursing staff can prepare the patient for the procedure, assist and monitor during the procedure, and provide post-procedural care. Close follow-up during the initial post-procedural period, either by the clinician and/or the plastic surgery specialty nurse experienced in post-procedural care of nonsurgical rhinoplasty, should evaluate the patient for possible complications, including tissue ischemia and blindness. It is also essential to educate the patient on properly caring for the nose after the procedure by avoiding extensive manipulation of the nose for the first 24 to 48 hours post-procedure to mitigate complications.
