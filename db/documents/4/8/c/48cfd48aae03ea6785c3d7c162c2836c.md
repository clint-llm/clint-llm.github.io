Microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) is a rare cutaneous neoplasm of follicular and sweat gland differentiation, first described by Goldstein and BarrÂ in 1982.

Microcystic adnexal carcinoma is an indolent but locally aggressive and deeply infiltrative tumor with a predilection for the head and neck area. It is most notable for its perineural invasion (upwards of 80%) and infiltration beyond clinically apparent margins. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma spreads characteristically by local invasion with rare cases of spread to regional lymph nodes.

The locally aggressive nature and deep infiltration make complete excision of the tumor with margin control a crucial part of management. In contrast, MAC is reported to have a fairly high recurrence rate with standard-wide local excision (60% in some case series).
