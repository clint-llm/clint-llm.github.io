The dura mater receives vascular supply from the following branches:

- Internal carotid artery

- Maxillary artery

- Ascending pharyngeal artery

- Occipital artery

- Vertebral artery

Venous drainage of the dura matter is via the meningeal veins that are present in the periosteal layer. These veins follow the branches of the middle meningeal artery and drain into the sphenopalatine sinus or the pterygoid venous plexus. The dural venous sinuses are between the periosteal and meningeal layers. These sinuses are responsible for the venous vasculature of the cranium. The sinuses converge and drain into the internal jugular vein.
