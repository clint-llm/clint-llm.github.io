Gunshot wounds result from the discharge of projectiles by firearms. The mechanism of formation of the injury includes the compression of tissue by the projectile and their disruption when these compressive forces exceed the elasticity of the tissue. The disruption of tissue is directly proportional to the mass and velocity of the projectile. The projectile's physical characteristics also greatly affect the wound, including the type and composition, shape, and tendency to fragment and deform.

The injuries are also dependant on the type of firearm used, the distance of fire, and the direction of fire. The type of firearm determines the size (mass) and velocity of the projectile. The distance of fire determines the effects of accompanying components and, therefore, the appearance of skin and tissue surrounding and inside the injury. The direction of fire determines whether the injury is an entry wound or exit wound and therefore affects the characteristics of the injury.
