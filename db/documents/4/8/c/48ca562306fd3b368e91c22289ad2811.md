Patients present primarily with pain, inability to use the affected digit, or bleeding. Important points to elucidate are demographics (age, sex, occupation, and drug, tobacco, and alcohol use), hand dominance, involved digit, mechanism of injury, and previous medical and surgical conditions. Physical examination should be done in a controlled setting with appropriateÂ lighting to allow for visualization of the injury and a proper assessment based on the history. Findings may reveal lacerations, closed or open fractures, and amputations of the tip.
