Primary tracheal cancers are rare and require a high index of suspicion for diagnosis, especially in the absence of response to treatment of other alternative diagnoses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or infections. Squamous cell carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma are the most common histopathological types. Computed tomography is the imaging modality of choice for initial evaluation, and bronchoscopy provides the chance for direct visualization and pathologic cancer diagnosis. Surgery with complete tumor resection should be performed whenever possible as it correlates with increased 5-year survival. Adjuvant radiotherapy is helpful in most cases. In advanced unresectable diseases, radiation and bronchoscopic interventions such as stenting of the trachea serve as palliative therapy, while concurrent platinum-based chemoradiation can be used for disease control in nonmetastatic unresectable cancers.

Care is optimized by having an interprofessional healthcare team, including primary care clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), pulmonologists, radiologists, pathologists, thoracic surgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists. Clinicians need to keep meticulous records of all interactions and interventions with the patient so that everyone on the care team has access to the same updated and accurate patient information. Specialized oncology-trained nurses also play a crucial role in patient care and management, as they counsel patients and facilitate communication between the various disciplines involved in the case. Surgical outcomes are noted to be superior when treated ta high-volume tertiary-level centers. [Level 4] The interprofessional model will result in the best possible patient outcomes. [Level 5]
