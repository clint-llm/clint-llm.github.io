Although a primary care provider can do the diagnosis and the initial treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, referral to general neurology may be necessaryÂ to identify possible secondary causes like multiple sclerosis, arteriovenous malformations, and cerebellopontine tumors. Consultation with a neurosurgeon or a neurovascular surgeon is warranted for patients who are refractory to medical therapy to assess the necessity of microvascular decompression or other surgical procedures.
