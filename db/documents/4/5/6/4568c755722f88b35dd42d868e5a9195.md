Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (FD), or type III hyperlipoproteinemia (Fredrickson-Levy-Lees Classification) is a genetic lipid disorder characterized by increased accumulation of triglyceride-rich remnant lipoproteins. It is associated with an increased risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. FD had a 10-fold increased risk for premature coronary artery disease compared to population-based controls.
