The prognosis of cases with astigmatism is usually good if treated on time, as there are multiple options available to correct astigmatism. Untreated patients, especially during childhood, may result in a permanent reduction in visual acuity and amblyopia.

Astigmatism is subject to change with time and will require new glasses and contact lenses. Refractive correction can often eliminate or reduce astigmatism in most cases. Patients with keratoconus can develop loss of visual acuity due to high astigmatism; hence timely and regular screening is mandated.
