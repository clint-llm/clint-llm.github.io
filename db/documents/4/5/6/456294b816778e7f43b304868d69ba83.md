The most objective and standard tool for evaluating the severity of the anterior wall prolapse is the POPQ system, which was introduced in 1996. This system is recognized by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and consists of 4 stages.

- Stage 0 – no prolapse

- Stage 1 – most distal part of prolapse is -1cm (above the level of the hymen)

- Stage 2 – most distal part of prolapse is >= -1cm but <= +1cm (<=1cm above or below the hymenal plane)

- Stage 3 – most outside portion of the prolapse >+1cm but <+(total vaginal length -2)cm (beyond the hymen; protrudes no farther than 2cm less than the total vaginal length)

- Stage 4 – complete eversion of the vagina; most distal portion of the prolapse >= +(total vaginal length -2) cm.

Three stages are used for patients after removal of the uterus and four if the uterus is present.

The POPQ system uses six measuring points of the vagina (two at the front, two at the bottom, and two in the apex) to create a map of the prolapse in the sagittal section. All the measurements are recorded in centimeters, with the level of the hymenal plane serving as a point of reference. Negative numbers are used to express points above the hymen, and positive numbers are used for points below the hymen.

The anterior wall in the POPQ system has two points. Point Aa is in the middle part of the anterior wall. It can have a value varying from -3 to +3 cm, depending on the severity of the prolapse. Point Ba is the distance between Aa and the apex of the vagina. Another important measurement made is total vaginal length (TVL), which is the length from the cervix (or posterior fornix) to the hymen. Staging classification will be discussed in the staging section.

Another frequently used system is Baden-Walker Halfway Scoring System. The system's downside is a lack of clear demarcations; thus, this system is not as precise as POPQ and is not recommended by leading medical societies. It consists of three grades:

- 0 – Normal position for each respective site

- 1 – Descent halfway to the hymen

- 2 – Descent to the hymen

- 3 – Descent halfway past the hymen

Apart from physical evaluation, imaging and other tests serve to identify issues associated with bladder function or for the further evaluation of the prolapse. For example, medical photography may be used to record changes in the prolapse, especially pre-operatively. Perineal floor ultrasound scan is used to identify the evulsion of the perineal muscles from the symphysis pubis, which can increase the risk of cystocele development three to four times.
