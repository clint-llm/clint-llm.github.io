Riedel thyroiditis (also known as Riedel struma, chronic invasive fibrous thyroiditis, or ligneous struma) is a rare fibrotic condition that involves the thyroid gland and often invades the surrounding structures. It most commonly presents with obstructive symptoms such as dyspnea, dysphagia, and hoarseness as the structures surrounding the thyroid are involved. It can also present with hypoparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, or Horner syndrome. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of Riedel thyroiditis and explains the part played by the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Reidel thyroiditis.
- Review the presentation of Reidel thyroiditis.
- Summarize the treatment options for Reidel thyroiditis.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to relieve obstructive symptoms and prevent the progression of the disease by using glucocorticoids which will improve outcomes for those with Riedel thyroiditis.
