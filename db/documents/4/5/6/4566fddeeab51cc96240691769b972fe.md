In 1881, Colcott-Fox described “erythema gyratum perstans” as persistent, ring-shaped lesions with pruritus. The term “EAC” was introduced by Darier in 1916 while the name “erythema perstans” is still used by some authors to describe similar annular erythemas. Currently, it is thought that all of these previous terms refer to clinical or pathologic variants of the entity now referred to as EAC. Some dermatologists preferred to divide the two histologically different forms (superficial and deep) of EAC “superficial gyrate erythema” and “deep gyrate erythema,” whereas others thought the superficial and deep forms of EAC were unrelated to one another and should not be referred to by the same name.
