Galactoceles are benign, milk-filled cysts that occur almost exclusively in lactating women. The presence of mammary duct obstruction during lactation is the main etiological factor. The incidence of galactocele in women presenting with benign breast conditions to the outpatient department is 4%. It presents as a painless lump in the breast. Triple assessment is needed for accurate diagnosis. This activity describes the pathogenesis, evaluation, and management of galactocele and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving antenatal and postnatal care for the mother and the child.
