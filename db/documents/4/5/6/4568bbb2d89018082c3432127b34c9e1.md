**Skills**

Knowledge of gas cylinders and proper management and utilization of gas cylinders is important.

**Strategy**

It is most appropriate and ideal to maintain continuous closed-loop communication between all members of the perioperative care team regarding the need, technique, and potential management issues associated with gas cylinders.

**Ethics**

It is necessary to obtain thorough and comprehensive informed consent from either the patient or their designated and authorized decision maker before anesthesia administration, as this will likely involve gas cylinders. It is most appropriate for all team members to feel empowered to state, to the team or the patient, any concerns that they might have regarding the process, as this ensures buy-in from all stakeholders as well as provide additional layers of review and insight into any problematic matters as soon as possible.

**Responsibilities**

All team members have a duty to communicate their concerns, responsibilities, and activities with all other team members both contemporaneously and as indicated throughout the perioperative period based on their professional discretion.

**Interprofessional Communication**

All team members should respect the free flow of information and concerns among team members without allowing or producing an environment of hostility.

**Care Coordination**

All team members should consider it their duty to neither disrupt the work done by other team members nor to, through their actions or inaction, create additional issues or increase the workload for other team members. [Level 4]
