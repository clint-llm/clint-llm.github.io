DMD is 2.2 MB gene with 79 exons, located on the X chromosome. Deletions of exons, particularly in the exonic regions 2 to 20 and 44 to 53, comprise 60% to 70% of pathogenic variants. Dystrophin is membrane-associated protein in muscle and neurons, part of a protein complex linking cytoskeleton and membrane proteins, who later on bind to extracellular matrix proteins.
