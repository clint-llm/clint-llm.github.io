The most common and first presenting sign of Lyme disease is the erythema migrans rash, which is found in 70% to 80% of cases and appears at the site of the tick bite as an expanding, erythematous skin lesion, measuring 5 cm in diameter or larger. The lesion may present as homogeneous erythema or display a targetoid appearance. The appearance of the rash occurs one to two weeks after the initial tick bite. If untreated, disease progression may lead to other relatively common findings including early arthritis in up to 30% in some series; neurologic manifestations, 10% to 15%; or cardiac involvement, 1% to 2%.
