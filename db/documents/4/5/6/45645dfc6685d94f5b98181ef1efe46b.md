Even though ALA intoxication is extremely rare, close monitoring is necessary for children who are around diabetic patients, as most of the reported ALA intoxication cases belong to children ingesting ALA by accident. Also, a case of ALA intoxication was reported in which the patient attempted to commit suicide. Thus, it is worth monitoring the use of ALA in people who has suicidal thoughts or psychological issues.

There is no established therapeutic index of ALA in humans. However, studies show that safety dosage has been defined in animals. The experimental values are 400 to 500 mg/kg for dogs, 30 mg/kg for cats, and 500mg/kg for mouses. In animal studies, high levels of ALA were reported to cause hepatotoxicity, apathy, confusion, and hypokinesis.
