Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is more than 10% of hepatocytes with fat droplets on liver biopsy. Functionally, the liver subdivides into three zones; the classification is made based on the oxygen supply. Zone 1 has the highest oxygenation (oxygenated blood from hepatic arteries) and encircles the portal tracts, and zone 3 encircles the central veins where the oxygenation is poor.

The American association for the study of liver diseases (AASLD) defined the histopathological abnormalities required in the diagnosis of NASH, which includes steatosis (macro more than micro), lobular inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning isÂ seen most apparently in the zone 3 steatotic liver cells. Fibrosis, although not necessary for the diagnosis, is usually present. Some other findings seen are Mallory-Denk bodies (MDB, eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions), megamitochondria, glycogenated nuclei, and iron deposition.

Fibrosis starts in the acinar zone 3 and has the appearance of chicken wire from the deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrices along the sinusoids. NASH-related cirrhosis is macronodular or mixed. When cirrhosis develops, the other histological features may not be evident.
