Hematological laboratory findings in microscopic colitis are nonspecific and typically will not guide you. Half of the patients will have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, mild anemia, and positive autoantibodies.

Stool studies for evaluation should include Clostridium difficile toxin, stool cultures, Escherichia coli O157: H7 testing, microscopy for ova and parasites, and a Giardia stool antigen test. Additional testing to be considered can include celiac disease serology (tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody). In most cases, all stool studies described above will be negative, leading to further diagnostic evaluation.

Endoscopic evaluation with mucosal biopsies is the next step of evaluation; this also will typically establish the diagnosis. The procedure of choice is a colonoscopy, with biopsies performed in the left and right colon. During endoscopy, the appearance of the colon tends to be normal, though there can be edema, erythema, friability, exudative lesions, or scarring. Microscopic colitis diagnosis is dependent upon biopsy and histopathological findings.
