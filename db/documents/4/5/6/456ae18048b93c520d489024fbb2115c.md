Hematogenous osteomyelitis is primarily monomicrobial, while osteomyelitis due to contiguous spread or direct inoculation is usually polymicrobial or monomicrobial.Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In some studies, MRSA accounted for over one-third of all staphylococcal isolates.staphylococcus, beta-hemolytic streptococcus, enterococci, aerobic gram-negative bacilli (including Pseudomonas species, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli), and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (such as Peptostreptococcus, Clostridium species, Bacteroides).

It is crucial to consider less common pathogens in the appropriate epidemiological setting and immunocompromised patients. These include Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which may spread to the spine from the lungs; nontuberculous mycobacteria (Mycobacterium avium intracellulare, Bacille Calmette-Guerin, which may complicate intravesical therapy for bladder cancer); Candida species; fungi such as Blastomyces, Coccidiodes, Cryptococcus, and Aspergillus. Infection with Actinomyces and Sporothrix usually follow traumatic inoculation. Salmonella and S. aureus are implicated in hematogenous osteomyelitis in sickle cell disease, while Brucella and Salmonella occur in spinal infections.Bartonella henselae may be associated with HIV-related osteomyelitis and Pasteurella multocida or Eikenella corrodens seen in human or animal bites.

Effective treatment of osteomyelitis involves a collaborative effort among various medical and surgical specialties. The two main aspects of therapy are surgical containment of the infection and prolonged antibiotics. Surgical debridement of all diseased bone is often required as antibiotics penetrate poorly into infected fluid collections such as abscesses and injured or necrotic bone.S. aureus is involved.

Also important is the need for revascularization of the affected limb before surgical intervention if there is evidence of significant peripheral vascular disease, control diabetes mellitus and address other host factors that may impede wound healing, including tobacco use, malnutrition, chronic hypoxia, immunodeficiency states, chronic lymphedema and peripheral neuropathy

Prolonged antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for osteomyelitis. Results of culture and sensitivity should guide antibiotic treatment if possible, but in the absence of this data, it is reasonable to start empiric antibiotics. A commonly used broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic regimen against both gram-positive and negative organisms, including MRSA, is vancomycin (15 mg/kg intravenously [IV] every 12 hours) plus a third a generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone 2 gm IV daily) or a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 IV every 8 hours).

**Pathogen-Specific Antibiotic Therapy for Osteomyelitis in Adults**

**Staphylococcus aureus penicillin-sensitive**

Treatment of choice is penicillin G 4 million units every 6 hours

Alternative regimens are a first-generation cephalosporin, e.g., cefazolin 2 g IV every 8 hours, clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours, vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV every 12 hours, oxacillin or nafcillin 2 g IV every 4 hours

**Staphylococcus aureus penicillin-resistant**

Treatment of choice is nafcillin 2 gm IV every 4 hours

Alternative therapies are cefazolin, clindamycin, or vancomycin (doses as above)

**Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-resistant**

Treatment of choice is vancomycin IV

An alternative regimen is linezolid 600 mg IV every 12 hours.

**Streptococci (group A, B, Beta hemolytic, Streptococcus pneumoniae)**

Treatment of choice is penicillin G 4 million units every 6 hours

Alternative regimens include ceftriaxone 2 gm IV daily, clindamycin IV, vancomycin IV, cefazolin IV (doses as above)

**Enterobacteriaceae quinolone sensitive**

Treatment of choice is ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV twice per day (bid) or 750 mg orally (PO) bid, levofloxacin 500 to 750 mg PO or IV daily

Alternative regimens include ceftriaxone 2g IV daily, cefepime 2 gm IV every 12 hours, ceftazidime 2 gm IV every 8 hours

**Enterobacteriaceae, quinolone-resistant (Escherichia coli)**

Treatment of choice is piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g IV every 8 hours, Ticarcillin/clavulanate 3.1 gm IV every 4 hours

An alternative regimen is ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily

**Pseudomonas aeruginosa**

Treatment of choice is cefepime 2 gm IV every 12 hours, ceftazidime 2 gm IV every 8 hours

Alternative regimens include meropenem 1 gm IV every 8 hours, Imipenem 500 mg IV every 6 hours, ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV every 12 hours, or 750 mg PO daily

**Enterococci**

Treatment of choice is penicillin G 4 million units every 6 hours

Alternatively, vancomycin 15 mg/kg every 12 hours, daptomycin 6 mg/kg IV daily, linezolid 600 mg IV or PO every 12 hours

**Anaerobes**

Treatment of choice is clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours, ticarcillin/clavulanate 3.1 gm IV every 4 hours

Alternatively, metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours (for gram-negative anaerobes)

The recommended duration of treatment for osteomyelitis in adults is 4 to 6 weeks of parenteral antibiotic therapy to achieve acceptable cure rates with a decreased risk of recurrence.

Vacuum-assisted wound closure devices are used in the right clinical setting, especially where large or deep wounds are left after extensive debridement. These devices have been shown to promote healing by both direct and indirect effects on the wound.
