PTX exposure and resulting toxicity are most frequently associated with the inhalation of vapors while cleaning or eradicating the coral from home aquariums. As a result of their rapid growth, unwanted zoanthids require removal from specific areas of the aquarium. This process is most frequently accomplished by boiling in water and/or scrubbing affected rocks. The resultant inhalation of steam or aerosolized droplets can lead to respiratory symptoms such as rhinorrhea, cough, and dyspnea. Similarly, unprotected handling of PTX containing coral can lead to edema, erythema, and systemic symptoms in both broken and intact skin.

Although less likely, PTX associated corneal toxicity results from environmental exposure as described in three different mechanisms: direct contact with contaminated water
