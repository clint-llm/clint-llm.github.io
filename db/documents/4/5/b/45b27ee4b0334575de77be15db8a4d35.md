Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a degenerative condition that affects the gluteal tendons and bursa. Repetitive friction between the greater trochanter and iliotibial band causes microtrauma of the gluteal tendon at the greater trochanter insertion site. This activity illustrates the evaluation of GTPS and the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of greater trochanteric pain syndrome.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with greater trochanteric syndrome.
- Outline the management options available for greater trochanteric pain syndrome.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the care of patients with greater trochanteric pain and improve outcomes.
