Effective treatment of symptomatic piloleiomyomas is often frustrating for both the physician and the patient due to a high rate of recurrence after surgical intervention and lack of successful pharmacological treatment options. The method of treatment is based upon the number of lesions present, the anatomical location of the lesions, and the degree of discomfort they cause the patient. The gold standard of therapy is surgical excision if a patient has a small, localized amount of piloleiomyomas. An in-depth discussion regarding the significant risk of local recurrence, sometimes as early as six weeks after removal, should be held with the patient prior to implementing treatment. Additional ablative treatment options include cryosurgery and carbon dioxide (CO2) laser.

Pharmacological therapy may be indicated for patients who are not considered to be surgical candidates (i.e., extensive, widespread piloleiomyomas or patient is unwilling to accept the possibility of recurrence). Most therapies, such as nifedipine, nitroglycerin, and doxazosin center aroundÂ reducing contraction of the smooth muscle of the pilosebaceous unit. Gabapentin, pregabalin, and duloxetine may be used to help control pain associated with the lesions. Injection of botulinum toxin into the lesions has shown mixed results for symptomatic relief.
