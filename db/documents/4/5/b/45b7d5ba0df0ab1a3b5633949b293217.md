Exenatide is FDA-indicated to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when used as an adjunct to diet and exercise. It is not recommended as a first-line therapy to treat diabetes. Clinical trials have shown exenatide to be safe and effective when used as either monotherapy or in combination with other diabetic medications. Clinical trials have demonstrated exenatide's ability to lower HbA1c and postprandial blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

While the drug is relatively safe, it is also expensive. The interprofessional healthcareÂ team, including clinicians, mid-level providers, nurses, and pharmacists, should regularly educate patients on the importance of exercise and lowering body weight, which helps lower blood glucose and decreases the need for pharmacological agents. The patient should also be informed regarding the signs of adverse events so they can contact their clinician. The pharmacist can verify dosing and perform medication reconciliation to check for potential drug-drug interactions. It is essential to treat the underlying cause of the disease with lifestyle changes, with medication as an adjunct. Using interprofessional strategies will improve therapeutic results with exenatide and decrease adverse events. [Level 5]
