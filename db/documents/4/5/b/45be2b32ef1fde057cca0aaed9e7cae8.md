**Prenatal Readiness**

If the woman is at a medium risk for intrapartum, blood should include be typed and screened. Women with a medium risk factor for uterine atony-related postpartum hemorrhage include prior uterine surgery, multiple gestation, grand multiparity, prior PPH, large fibroids, macrosomia, body mass index greater than 40, anemia, chorioamnionitis, prolonged second stage, oxytocin longer than 24 hours, and magnesium sulfate administration. Those assessed to be high risk should be typed and cross-matched for those at high risk of PPH. High-risk criteria include placental previa or accreta, bleeding diathesis, 2 or more medium risk factors for uterine atony. Use of a cell saver (blood salvage) should be considered for women at increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage, but this is not cost-effective to be routine.

**Intrapartum Prevention**

ThisÂ includes optimal management of the third stage of labor. Active management of the third stage includes uterine massage with concomitant sustained low-level traction on the umbilical cord. Simultaneous oxytocin infusion is helpful, although it is reasonable to defer it to after delivery of the placenta.

**Initial Medical Treatment**

If uterine atony occurs, healthcare providers should be ready for initial medical management which is directed to the use of medications to improve tone and induce uterine contractions. Massaging the uterus is also effective, as is ensuring an empty cavity. Maternal support with intravenous (IV) fluids is commenced through preferably an u8-gauge, intravenous catheter. A team approach is initiated with the summoning of the needed personnel through a standardized built-in alert system. Medications used for postpartum hemorrhage secondary to Uterine atony include the following:

- Oxytocin (Pitocin) can be given IV 10 to 40 units per 1000 ml or 10 units intramuscularly (IM). The rapid undiluted infusion may cause hypotension.

- Methylergonovine (Methergine) given IM 0.2 mg. Given every 2 to 4 hours. Should be avoided in patients with hypertension.

- 15-methyl-PGF2-alpha (Hemabate) given IM 0.25 mg. Given every 15 to 90 minutes for a maximum of 8 doses. Should be avoided in asthmatics. May cause diarrhea, fevers, or tachycardia. It is expensive.

- Misoprostol (Cytotec): 800 to 1000 mg placed rectally. May cause a low-grade fever. It has a delayed action.

- Dinoprostone (Prostin E2) 20 mg vaginal or rectal suppository may be given every 2 hours.

**Surgical Treatment**

Should the medications fail with persisting excess bleeding, then surgical management is engaged.

**Tamponade Techniques**

- Uterine packing with gauze (with vaginal packing to ensure its retention, thus a uterovaginal packing) with Foley catheter insertion to allow bladder drainage. The uterine packing should be tight and uniform, and it is a quickly and efficiently achieved with rolled gauze ribbons.

- Bakri balloon (with vaginal packing to ensure its retention) with Foley catheter insertion to facilitate bladder drainage.

**Surgical Management Techniques
**

- Uterine curettage for retained products

- Uterine artery ligation (O' Leary), with an option to for extending arterial ligation to tubo-ovarian vessels.

- Compression sutures such as the B-Lynch are typically reserved for clinical scenarios where bimanual compression of the uterus leads to arrest in bleeding.

- Hypogastric artery ligation (performed by Gyn/Onc)

- Hysterectomy
