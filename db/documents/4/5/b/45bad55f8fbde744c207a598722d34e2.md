Jervell and Lange Nielsen Syndrome (JLNS) is a rare inherited disorder affecting the heart's electrical system and ears. Symptoms are often seen at an early age and include episodes of fainting spells associated with intense emotion and exercise and also hearing loss. The treatment of JLNS is aimed at fixing the hearing loss and preventing further attacks of unconsciousness called syncope or possibly cardiac arrest. The hearing loss is corrected by a medical device called a cochlear implant, which stimulates the brain's nerve that recognizes sounds. A medication class called beta-blockers treat the cardiac abnormalities. These medications decrease the electrical stimulation to the heart and help prevent further abnormal rhythms that can lead to unconsciousness. If the medications fail or if an individual falls into a high-risk category, a device called an implantable automatic cardioverter-defibrillator is usually placed. This device detects an abnormal rhythm and sends an electrical shock to the heart, preventing syncope. Regular follow-up with the patient's pediatrician/primary care doctor and cardiologist is essential in preventing complications. Genetic evaluation of the patient and the family members is recommended.
