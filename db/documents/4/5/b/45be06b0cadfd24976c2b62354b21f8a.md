Camper's fascia provides strength and insulation to the abdominal wall. The strength of Camper's fascia is of particular clinical relevance when considering the risk of postoperative hernia formation. Generally, the fascia provides enough support to prevent the vertical extension of a hernia.

Given the high-fat content of Camper's fascia, there have been isolated reports of panniculitis originating within the fascia.

Severe burns have the potential to damage Camper's fascia if the skin is completely infiltrated, leading to increased fluid loss. The fat content of Camper's fascia serves to prevent water loss through the skin. Without this fatty layer, severe hypovolemia is more likely to occur.

As mentioned in the "Nerves" section, nerves can be negatively affected if the fascial plane is interrupted. In the setting of fascial plane interruption, there is a possibility that the sensory nerves of the skin may begin to communicate aberrantly with the motor nerves of the abdominal muscles, potentially leading to miscommunication, as motor signals can cause cross-talk with the skin and vice-versa. The proper alignment of the fascial planes upon surgical closure is essential to avoid this complication.

Scars may also form within the fascia following penetrating or blunt trauma. The scar tissue may adhere to the fascia to other tissues in the adjacent area, which may lead to pain in the area and are palpable as knots or deficits of tissue under the surface of the skin.
