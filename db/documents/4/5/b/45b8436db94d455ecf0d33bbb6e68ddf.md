It is important to consider other pathologies that could present with a similar clinical picture to chronic suppurative otitis media. Because otorrhea is one of the most common signs encountered in this entity and the most frequent age at presentation is usually less than 5 years, the presence of a foreign body in the ear canal needs to be ruled out. The presence of a foul-smelling odor emanating from the ear can help differentiate an otorrhea caused by a foreign body or chronic supportive otitis media. Other conditions that can be mistaken for chronic otitis media are myringitis and otitis externa (both share the signs of otorrhea), but with a physical examination, the diagnosis can be elucidated. More serious conditions that must also be ruled out are mastoiditis, abscess, and meningitis. In these cases, the presentation is more severe, and systemic symptoms are present.
