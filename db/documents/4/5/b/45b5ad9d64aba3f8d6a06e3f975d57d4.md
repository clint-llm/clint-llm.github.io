The ductus arteriosus can be of surgical importance when treating certain congenital heart defects. One such example is when a child is born with transposition of the great arteries. In this condition, the ascending aorta and the pulmonary trunk are switched in their locations; this leads to an inability for oxygenated blood to leave the pulmonary circulation and enter the systemic circulation. If left untreated, this condition is incompatible with life.

Another important surgical consideration is in casesÂ where a patent ductus arteriosus is resistant to medical treatment. In these cases, the ductus arteriosus can be closed manually in surgery. There are two different approaches used to accomplish this. A more traditional surgical approach requires the surgeon to open the thoracic cavity and ligate the vessel directly. The other is much less invasive and is done percutaneously. This version of the procedure involves the intravenous delivery of an occlusion device that plugs up the shunt from within.
