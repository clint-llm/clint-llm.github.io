Interprofessional communication is important for promoting safe and effective osteopathic manipulative treatment. The interprofessional healthcare team includes clinicians (particularly osteopaths), nursing staff, and possibly physical therapists.

All healthcare team members need to understand the proper use of OMT and the risks and benefits of OMT for various medical conditions. Each healthcare team member can assist with patient education to promote the safe and appropriate use of OMT as well as explain differences between manual modalities available to the patient. Muscle energy treatment and counterstrain treatments are amongst the safest and most effective osteopathic treatment modalities.
