The ulnar bursa typically originates at the level of the pronator quadratus and continues distally to approximately 1 to 3 cm proximal to the flexor tendon sheaths of digits two, three, and four. However, studies have shown communication between the ulnar bursa and the flexor tendon sheaths of digits two, three, and four at rates of 5.1%, 4%, and 3.5% respectively.
