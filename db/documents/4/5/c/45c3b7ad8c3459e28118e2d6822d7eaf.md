The problem with diagnosing radiation necrosis of the brain is that it is difficult to distinguish tumor recurrence versus radiation necrosis. This distinction is especially difficult with glioblastoma multiforme which often may have a palisading pattern of necrosis. Brain MRI perfusion scanning can be helpful in differentiating because in radiation necrosis there is often a lack of T2 flair usually involving the white matter but is commonly present with tumors. MR spectroscopy typically shows low choline and creatine and NAA in radiation necrosis. FDG-PET scanning typically shows lower activity in radiation necrosis, while recurrent tumors typically have increased metabolic activity. Conventional imaging can be misleading and ultimately surgical biopsy may be necessary to distinguish whether the lesion is from radiation necrosis or recurrence of cancer.
