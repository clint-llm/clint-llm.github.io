The diagnosis and management of SVAS is with an interprofessional team consisting of a neonatologist, pediatrician, cardiologist, and a cardiac surgeon. Once the diagnosis is made, surgery is necessary.  Surgery is usually curative and is recommended for symptomatic disease with a measured gradient with cardiac angiography of more than 30 mmHg.

Surgical intervention has been successful in most patients with good long-term results. Ross procedure is usually performed, where the diseased aortic valve is replaced with the patient's own pulmonary valve. Sometimes the application of a Y patch and resection with end to end anastomosis have also been successful. Operative risk is higher in patients if there is associated diffuse arteriopathy and biventricular outflow obstruction. Trans-catheter stent placement is another effective alternative, or adjunctive therapy can be used in some patients, especially in those with the involvement of smaller aortic branch vessels.

Outcomes after surgical correction depend on the nature of the stenosis and the presence of associated cardiac lesions. Predictors of worse outcomes and frequent surgical intervention are the presence of diffuse lesions compared to discrete stenosis or the presence of associated aortic valve disease.
