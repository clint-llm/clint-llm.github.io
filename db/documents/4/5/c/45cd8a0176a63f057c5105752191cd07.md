Spinal metastases are the most common tumors of the spine. These are more commonly found as bone metastasis and may present with symptoms of spinal canal invasion and cord compression. A defining feature of these lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the sparing of inter-vertebral disc space. The following activity emphasizes the essential knowledge necessary for interprofessional team members to have while treating patients with spinal metastasis. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of spinal metastatic disease, and the role of the inter-professional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the most common cancers that can manifest as metastases to the spinal column.
- Review the diagnostic modalities most commonly used in a workup for spinal metastases.
- Describe treatment strategies for spinal metastasis, both with and without spinal cord involvement.
- Summarize the significance of coordination among the members of the interprofessional team in providing pain and palliative care to improve the quality of life for patients with spinal metastatic disease.
