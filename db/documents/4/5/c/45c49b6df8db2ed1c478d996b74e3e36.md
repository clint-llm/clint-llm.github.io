Endophthalmitis is defined as an inflammation of the inner coats of the eye, resulting from intraocular colonization of infectious agents with exudation within intraocular fluids. It is a potentially blinding condition. The category or type of endophthalmitis such as postoperative, post-traumatic, or endogenous, etc. influences the clinical presentation, microbiology, and visual outcome. If left untreated or inadequately treated, it progresses to panophthalmitis requiring evisceration or enucleation of the eyeball. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of endophthalmitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathogenesis of endophthalmitis.
- Summarize the relevant history and physical examination of patients with endophthalmitis.
- Review the evaluation process of patients with endophthalmitis.
- Outline the interprofessional care of patients with endophthalmitis.
