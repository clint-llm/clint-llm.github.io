It is important to note that the diagnosis of UTI based on the combination of both leukocyte esterase and nitrites, will miss cases caused by S. saprophyticus. Like most other gram-positive uropathogens, S. saprophyticus does not reduce nitrate to nitrite.

S. saprophyticus has resistance to antibiotic regimes commonly prescribed and effective for E. coli induced UTIs, including ampicillin, ceftriaxone, cephalexin, and ciprofloxacin. In cases where UTI symptoms persist following treatment with one of the previously mentioned antibiotics, S. saprophyticus should be highly suspected.
