Pemphigus vulgaris has a known association with myasthenia gravis and thymoma, and patients diagnosed with these conditions are more likely to develop pemphigus.

Patients taking penicillamine or ACE inhibitors (particularly captopril and enalapril) are at increased risk of developing pemphigus. The reported prevalence of pemphigus among patients taking penicillamine is around 7%.

There is a known association between intranasal heroin use and pemphigus vegetans.

Special care should be taken not to pop the blisters; no scrubbing or high-pressure water, as this increases the risk of infection.
