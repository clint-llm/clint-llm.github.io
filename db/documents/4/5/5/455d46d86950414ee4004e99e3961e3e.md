- Anatomically abdominal muscles exert multiple forces that contribute to hernia formation. These forces result from contraction of the external oblique, internal oblique, and transverse abdominis muscles, as well as increased intra-abdominal pressure. The rectus abdominis muscles are the only muscle group of the anterior abdominal wall that probably does not contribute to hernia recurrence due to the contraction in cephalad-caudal direction

- When the hernia defect cannot be easily approximated in the midline, component separation may be helpful. Instead a bridged mesh repair may be performed. Repair with bridged mesh associated with higher recurrence and complication rates compared with nonbridged repairs and are, therefore, suboptimal

- Usually ventral hernias including umbilical hernia repaired with synthetic non-degradable meshes which are basically made from one of three main materials: polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate polyester or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene

- Synthetic degradable meshes are intended to reduce adhesions and provide safe repair in infected fields. Examples of this type of meshes are polyglactin and polyglycolic. The disadvantage of the mesh is that they degrade within one to three months; therefore are associated with high recurrence rates [31].

- Biological meshes used for hernia repair with infected or contaminated surgical field. It is believed to promote regeneration and new collagen deposition, rather than scarring
