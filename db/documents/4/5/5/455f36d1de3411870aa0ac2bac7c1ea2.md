NICE and the BNF suggest that contraindications to all heparins includeÂ trauma, epidural half-life, hemorrhagic disorders, peptic ulcer disease, recent cerebral hemorrhage, severe hypertension, and recent surgery to the eye or nervous system. In these cases, the risks of anticoagulation and bleeding outweigh the potential benefit from LMWH acting as a VTE prophylaxis or at treatment doses. As LMWHs are self-administered, it is important to consider dosing in cases of chronic kidney disease, where there is a risk of accumulation and, thus, higher chances of problematic bleeding.
