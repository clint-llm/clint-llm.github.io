The prognosis for mild idiopathic polyhydramnios is excellent. Maternal and fetal prognosis decreases with the severity of polyhydramnios. The majority of cases of idiopathic polyhydramnios are self-limited and will usually resolve without any intervention.

The risk of complications increases with the overdistension of the uterus. These include maternal dyspnea, preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, breech presentation, umbilical cord prolapse, postpartum hemorrhage, fetal macrosomia associated with maternal diabetes, hypertensive disorders, and urinary tract infections.

Data on the intrauterine fetal demise in polyhydramnios is inconsistent. Severe and rapidly progressing polyhydramnios is an independent risk factor for perinatal mortality. In addition, small for gestational age fetuses with polyhydramnios have the poorest prognosis. The prognosis directly correlates with the underlying cause of polyhydramnios.
