The azygos vein originates from the last portion of the posterior cardinal veins.

The subcardinal, sacrocardinal, and supracardinal veins form between the fifth and seventh weeks of gestation. The supracardinal veins function to drain the body wall by intercostal veins formed from posterior cardinal veins. The anterior cardinal veins, common cardinal, and proximal right posterior cardinal veins go through a significant evolutionary process to become the veins of the heart, the SVC, and its tributaries. Since the proximal portion of the azygos vein is a tributary to the SVC, it shares a common lineage as the SVC. The proximal portion of the azygos vein also derives from the anterior, common cardinal vein, and the sinus venosus. With the proximal segment of the right posterior cardinal vein, the posterior cardinal derived veins, supracardinal, are further involved in the formation of the arch of the azygos system. The azygos venous system appears in the image below.
