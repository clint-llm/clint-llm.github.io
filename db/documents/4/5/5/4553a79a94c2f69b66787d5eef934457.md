After most surgical procedures for corns, the patient is allowed to weight-bear as tolerated in a special surgical shoe. The exact time required to wear the surgical shoe depends on the exact procedure performed but ranges from two to six weeks. Typically the patient is not allowed to remove the dressing nor get the foot wet. During the recovery, pain medications may be required for the first few days. If the right foot has undergone surgery, the patient will not be allowed to drive. Sutures are normally removed around two weeks after surgery. Physically therapy is not typically required.
