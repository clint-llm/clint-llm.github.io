aIn asymptomatic patients with Chilaiditi sign, intervention is not necessary, and treatment is usually conservative; however, more serious conditions should be ruled out first. Initial management of patients with the syndrome includes intravenous fluids, nasogastric bowel decompression, bed rest, stool softeners, and enemas. It is advisable to repeat radiographic imaging after bowel decompression to observe the resolution of the air below the diaphragm. If this is the case, it would confirm the diagnosis of Chilaiditi syndrome. Surgical intervention is indicated when the patient does not respond to conservative management, the obstruction does not resolve, or there is evidence of bowel ischemia. There is no clear consensus on the optimal surgical approach to correct bowel interposition. Ceceopexy is an option to prevent recurrence in an uncomplicated cecal volvulus unless surgical resection is indicated, and if so, colonic resection is the best option to treat a volvulus of the transverse colon. Colonoscopic reduction is not recommended due to a high frequency of gangrene with these types of volvulus. If the patient is to receive a colonoscopy, it must be done with great caution due to the risk of progressive air entrapment in an acutely angulated and interposed bowel because it could potentially lead to perforation. Administrating carbon dioxide as an insufflating agent would decrease this risk.
