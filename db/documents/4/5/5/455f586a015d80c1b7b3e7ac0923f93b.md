Pelvic sonography has become an indispensable modality for screening pelvic pathologies in routine obstetrics and gynecology practice. Sonography is performed and interpreted by a wide spectrum of healthcare providers like obstetricians and gynecologists, radiologists, anesthetists, and sonographers owing to the point-of-care ultrasound availability and the training of obstetricians and gynecologists to routine ultrasound in gynecology and obstetrics. Sonography of the pelvis to assess the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tube, pouch of Douglas, and bladder is a mere extension of physical examination and has now become an innate part of evaluation before the commencement of treatment of any pelvic pathology at office clinic settings as well as in emergency obstetrics and gynecology care. This activity outlines the protocols and interpretation of sonography in the assessment and evaluation of patients with pelvic pathology and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in its efficient management.
