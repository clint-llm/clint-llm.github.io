Erb palsy requires early diagnosis and management for the best outcomes. Prenatal counseling of mothers with diabetes to have good glycemic control is important to reduce the risk of Erb palsy due to macrosomia and shoulder dystocia. Parents of the affected children should be counseled about the importance of physiotherapy at an early ageÂ for the functional recovery of the arm as well as surgical repair in case of sustained injury.
