Prior to undergoing LVRS, patients require an extensive pre-operative workup to ensure the proper patient selection and potential maximal benefit compared to medical therapy for severe COPD. This includes imaging: a chest x-ray and a high-resolution CT scan. Laboratory workup should also be performed, including an arterial blood gas (ABG). Pulmonary function testing includes values for FEV1 and DLCO. A 6-minute walk test is standard to observe oxygen requirements and distance. This is also a baseline metric to assess improvement after rehabilitation. Patients should also have a cardiopulmonary workup, including an electrocardiogram (EKG) and a stress test if significant coronary artery disease is suspected.

Most patients enroll in pulmonary pre-habilitation programs for several weeks to observe whether there is an improvement in functional status and exercise capacity. Patients also need to comply with smoking cessation requirements (usually greater than 6 months). Pulmonary post-operative rehabilitation programs are also recommended for patients after they undergo LVRS.
