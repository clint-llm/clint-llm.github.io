The presentation is usually at the time of weaning in infants who are breastfed and earlier when they are formula-fed. In some cases, an infant who is breastfed may present with the manifestations of acrodermatitis enteropathica even before weaning. This could be due to the decreased secretion of zinc into breast milk due to a mutation in the mothers. The characteristic skin findings include sharply-demarcated, dry, scaly erythematous plaques that are usually periorificial on the face or the anogenital area. The upper lip usually is spared. The plaques can be psoriasiform, eczematous, vesiculobullous, pustular, or erosive with the characteristic crusted border in the periphery. Nail changes, including paronychia, may be present, and the hair becomes brittle, dry, and lusterless. In profound deficiency, diffuse alopecia may be seen. Angular cheilitis delayed wound healing and pigmentary abnormalities also have been reported.

The systemic features include diarrhea, irritability, lethargy, anorexia, growth retardation, anemia, amenorrhea, neuropsychiatric problems, perinatal morbidity, hypogonadism, hyposmia, and hypogeusia, and eye abnormalities including conjunctivitis, blepharitis, corneal opacities, and photophobia. Immunological abnormalities also are seen. Superinfection with Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans is reported. The classical triad of acrodermatitis enteropathica includes alopecia, diarrhea, and a periorificial and acral cutaneous rash. If untreated, the disease could be fatal. The differential diagnoses of AE include protein-energy malnutrition, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and glucagonoma syndrome. Acrodermatitis dysmetabolic is the term used for metabolic disorders that result in a clinical presentation resembling AE. The causes most often reported include acquired deficiencies of zinc, amino acids, or biotin.
