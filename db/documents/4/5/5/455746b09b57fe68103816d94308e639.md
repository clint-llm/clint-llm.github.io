Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) continues to evolve as an essential adjunct to clinical examination not only in the acute care setting but also in other disciplines such as critical care medicine, internal medicine, and pediatrics. As this modality continues to evolve, a comprehensive training curriculum is an important foundation in medical education to acquire and enhance this skill set.

There is a wide array of simulation and clinical integration strategies for POCUS training. The common approach often begins with workshops and conferences with didactics, phantom, and live models to simulate bedside skills and techniques; this often translates to further learning at the bedside by scanning patients with clinically indicated diagnoses or chief complaints. As established by various oversight governing bodies such as the American Academy of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), competence is then based on achieving specific milestones for knowledge and skill acquisition.
