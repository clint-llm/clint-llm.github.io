ICH's familial form is autosomal dominant with variable penetrance and classically associated with a COL1A1 point gene mutation (3040C to T) on chromosome 17q21.

The relation between this missense mutation and the skeletal findings of ICH are unknown. Still, proposed mechanisms include an inability of chromosome interactions with proteins (IL-2), defective cross-linking between the bone and abnormal collagen, and decreased thermal stability of collagen.

COL1A1 and COL1A2 gene mutations cause subtypes of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and osteogenesis imperfecta. Gly substitutions in the triple helix lead to defective type I collagen resulting in fractures and findings consistent with osteogenesis imperfecta types II-IV. Some individuals with ICH have features seen in Ehlers-Danlos, such as hyperextensible skin, joint hyperlaxity, and inguinal hernias.
