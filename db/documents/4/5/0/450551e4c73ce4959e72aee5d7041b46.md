Thyroid disease is the second most common endocrine disorder after diabetes in pregnancy. Thyroid disease poses a substantial challenge on the physiology of pregnant women and has significant maternal and fetal implications. During pregnancy, thyroid hormone production increases by around 50% along with a similar increase in total daily iodine requirements. Thyroid dysfunction in pregnant women including hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism requires close monitoring and treatment as warranted. This activity reviews thyroid disease in pregnancy and its management. This activity will review the most common causes of thyroid disease in pregnancy and outline the treatment approach according to current evidence. This activity will highlight the role of the interprofessional team in recognizing and treating thyroid disease in pregnancy.

**Objectives:**
- Recall the presentation of
thyroid disease in pregnancy. 
- Describe the workup of thyroid disease in pregnancy. 
- Summarize the treatment options for thyroid disease in pregnancy. 
- Explain how the facilitation of interprofessional team education and discussion can optimize the effective detection of thyroid disease in pregnancy and monitor the subsequent evaluations.
