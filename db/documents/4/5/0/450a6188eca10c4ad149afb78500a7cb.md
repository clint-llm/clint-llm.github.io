Central serous chorioretinopathy is a retinal disorder characterized by localized serous detachment of the macula. It is secondary to retinal pigment epithelial decompensation and choroidal vascular changes. Most of the cases resolve spontaneously and gain normal vision. Some cases are non-resolving and require treatment. Such chronic cases, if not treated, will lead to permanent loss of vision. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of central serous chorioretinopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of central serous chorioretinopathy.
- Explain the typical presentation of central serous chorioretinopathy.
- Review the typical imaging findings and treatments associated with central serous chorioretinopathy.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve the outcome of patients affected with central serous chorioretinopathy.
