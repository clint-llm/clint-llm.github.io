Urinary incontinence is known as the leakage of any volume of urine, which is mostly involuntary. The three most well-known types of urinary incontinence are urgency/urge incontinence, stress incontinence, and overflow incontinence. Some patients have symptoms of many different types (mixed), and some can have functional symptoms.

Stress incontinence involves involuntary, often sudden, loss of urine due to increased intra-abdominal pressure. On the other hand, overflow incontinence mainly includes an overdistended bladder (either due to reduced detrusor contractility and/or bladder outlet obstruction), often leading to involuntary loss of urine. This article will be focusing on a brief review of urgency/urge urinary incontinence.
