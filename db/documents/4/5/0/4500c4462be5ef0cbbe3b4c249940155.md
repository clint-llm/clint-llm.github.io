ALM, like mucosal melanomas, is a low mutational burden sub-type of melanoma and does not carry UV-radiation induced mutations that are commonly seen in other CMMs.

In a paper on FISH analysis of ALM, CCND1 gains, MYC gains, and CDKN2A loss were common alterations seen in their cohort.Â TERT promoter mutations, commonly found in UV-radiation induced melanomas, are not prevalent in ALM; however, other mutations involving the TERT gene including copy gains, translocations, missense, and promoter mutations were found in up to 41% of cases.
