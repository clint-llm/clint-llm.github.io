It is vital to assess a person’s quality and quantity of sleep. Seven to eight hours and nine hours of sleep are generally ideal for adults and adolescents, respectively. Less sleep correlates with obesity, diabetes & impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease & hypertension, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and alcohol use.

When taking a history, essential questions to ask to assess a patient's sleep are:

Do you have trouble falling asleep? Staying asleep? Do you feel tired upon waking from sleep?

If the patient answers affirmatively to any of these questions, follow up with: Do these problems with sleep occur despite adequate time and opportunity for rest? Is the sleep difficulty impairing your functioning during the day? Do you feel distressed from the lack of quality sleep?

It is also essential to make an inquiry regarding the severity and frequency of these symptoms.
