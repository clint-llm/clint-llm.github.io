Bile duct carcinoma is very difficult to diagnose as it may present with similar symptoms to gallstones including obstructive symptoms such as jaundice; abdominal pain; clay-colored stools; cola-colored urine; and skin pruritus. Patients can also present with unspecific symptoms of advanced malignancy including fever, night sweats, weight loss, and general malaise. The healthcare team needs to be diligent in considering the possibility of this deadly form of cancer and always include it as a possibility when evaluating patients with presentations of gallbladder disease. an interprofessional team approach of nurses, pharmacists, and physicians will provide the best possible results.
