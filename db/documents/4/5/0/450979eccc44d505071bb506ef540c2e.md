There is no standardized treatment for Riehl melanosis. Several therapeutic options have been attempted, either individually or in combinations, with variable results in RM.

Treatment modalities for RM are as follows:

- Removal of causal agents to prevent further disease progression and relapse

- Cosmetic camouflage makeup

- Vigilant sun-protection

- Topical agents including hydroquinone, topical corticosteroids, retinoids, vitamin C, azelaic acid, with or without the addition of light to medium chemical peels (trichloroacetic acid, glycolic acid)

- Light-based therapies such as intense pulsed-light therapy and low-fluence Q-switched Nd: YAG lasers (QSNY).

A recent study showing the higher effectiveness of mid-fluence QSNY 1064-nm laser in targetting the deep pigmentation of RM has also been conducted.

A combination of therapies should be considered for recalcitrant forms.

Another study used a combination of therapies to include low-fluence, 1064-nm, Q-switched Nd: YAG laser, hydroquinone cream, and oral tranexamic acid, with the majority of patients experiencing significant improvement.
