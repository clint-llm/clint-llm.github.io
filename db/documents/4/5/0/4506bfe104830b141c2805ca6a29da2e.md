Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) is a relatively common disorder that presents with band-like cicatricial alopecia of the frontotemporal zone of the scalp. There may be signs of perifollicular inflammation at the edge of the hairy region. Alopecia of the eyebrows is frequently associated, and axillary, pubic, facial, and hairy lesions of the limbs could be involved. Even though the condition has no specific treatment, healthcare workers, including nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and primary care providers, should consult with a dermatologist for guidance in management. Dermatology nurses assist in care by providing education, monitoring results, and reporting back to the dermatologist. Pharmacists are involved in the review of prescribed medications, assisting for interactions, and educating patients about possible side effects. The outcomes of patients with FFA are poor as most end up with a marked degree of hair loss. [Level 5]
