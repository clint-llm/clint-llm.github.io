Cardiac tamponade occurs when excessive fluid accumulates in the pericardium, in turn compressing the heart and restricting the filling of the cardiac chambers and ultimately causing hypotension and cardiac arrest. This activity reviews the etiology, signs and symptoms, diagnosis, and management of pericarditis and cardiac tamponade and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the classic presentation of a patient with cardiac tamponade. 
- Explain how to evaluate a patient with cardiac tamponade.
- Outline how to treat a patient with cardiac tamponade.
- Summarize the importance of a cohesive, interprofessional team approach to caring for patients with cardiac tamponade.
