Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that results in chronic inflammation and damage of more than one organ. It is diagnosed clinically and serologically with the presence of autoantibodies. "Lupus" is a Latin term meaning "wolf," since one of the hallmark facial SLE rashes is similar to the bitemark of a wolf. Lupus nephritis typically occurs after at least three years since the onset of SLE. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis of lupus nephritis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of lupus nephritis.
- Review the presentation of a patient with lupus nephritis.
- Outline the management options available for lupus nephritis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with lupus nephritis.
