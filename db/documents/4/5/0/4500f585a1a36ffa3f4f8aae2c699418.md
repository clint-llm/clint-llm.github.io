The development of targeted biologic therapies, ranging from TNF inhibitors to IL-17, IL-23, and JAK/STAT pathway inhibition has provided marked advances in the ability to manage the inflammatory complications of HLA-B27 related disease. Factors associated with poor prognosis in psoriatic arthritis include the presence of radiographic erosions, dactylitis, and elevated ESR and CRP.Â  Joint deformities affecting the function and highly active disease particularly impact the quality of life. Mild to moderate ankylosing spondylitis is associated with impairments in physical function. Complications of the disease include osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and vertebral fractures. Patients can develop severe hip involvement requiring total hip arthroplasty and severe flexion deformities of the cervical spine, restricting their range of motion. Hopefully, early identification and initiation of effective treatment may decrease the progression of radiographic disease and preserve physical function. Effective treatment limits the risk of radiographic joint disease in peripheral arthritis. Reactive arthritis usually affects patients for three to five months, and most patients will be disease-free within six to twelve months. Rarely, there is chronic arthritis, which may prompt evaluation for one of the other spondyloarthropathies.
