Excessive primary hemorrhage may occur intraoperatively due to injury to the inferior epigastric vessels, which lie medial to the internal ring. Damage to the ilioinguinal nerve can cause paraesthesia or numbness on the patch of skin on the medial part of the upper thigh and the anterior part of the scrotum, or predispose the patient to direct inguinal hernia due to weakness of the posterior inguinal wall muscles. Wound complications may include wound infection, extensive bruising, seroma, or hematoma.

Most wound complications resolve spontaneously with few requiring aspiration or re-exploration for evacuation. Scrotal edema or hematoma may occur following extensive scrotal dissection in delivering large tumors and may require management with scrotal support, analgesia and anti-inflammatories. Rarely, large hematomas will require surgical exploration and evacuation. Early handling of the tumor or late clamping of the cord may cause micro-metastases or increase the risk for local recurrence.

Long term psychological or social complications due to the absence of the testis may be improved with the use of testicular prosthesis. A testicular prosthesis may be associated with complications such as rupture, scarring, retraction, contracture, or implant infection.
