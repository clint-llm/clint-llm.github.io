Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and the leading cause of death in the United States. Cardiac rehabilitation is customized to individual patients. Candidates for cardiac rehabilitation include patients with cardiovascular diseases such as ischemic heart disease, heart failure, myocardial infarctions, or patients who have undergone cardiovascular interventions such as coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting. Cardiac rehabilitation programs aim to limit the psychological and physiological stresses associated with cardiovascular disease, reduce the risk of associated mortality, and improve cardiovascular function to help patients optimize their quality of life. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and phases of cardiac rehabilitation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the patient populations that may benefit from cardiac rehabilitation.
- Review the phases of cardiac rehabilitation.
- Outline the contraindications to cardiac rehabilitation.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance cardiac rehabilitation and improve outcomes.
