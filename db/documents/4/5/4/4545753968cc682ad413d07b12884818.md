Sentinel lymph node biopsy is indicated as part of the staging workup of early-stage breast cancers of epithelial origin, such as ductal and lobular carcinomas, since these tumors metastasize to lymph nodes. Sarcomatous tumors of the breast typically metastasize to the lung and do not involve the axillary lymph nodes. For example, cystosarcoma phyllodes tumors are not evaluated with sentinel lymph node biopsy. In patients with invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas, T1 and T2 lesions, merit consideration considered for sentinel lymph node biopsy. The exception to this is if preoperative imaging, either ultrasound, mammogram, or MRI, shows evidence of possible lymph node enlargement. Core needle biopsy of these enlarged nodes is typically performed before lymph node surgery. Some advocate for a complete axillary dissection if two or more axillary nodes are positive for malignancy.
