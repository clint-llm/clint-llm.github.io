The standard of care for head, neck, trunk, and extremities UPS is en bloc surgical excision with microscopically negative margins, particularly for stage I tumors. This may be achieved by wide local excision with 2 cm margins of uninvolved tissue, albeit some cases may pose greater difficulty due to the involvement of important neurovascular structures. Postoperative radiotherapy (RT) is indicated when margins are close to the tumor (< 1 cm), microscopically positive, involve bone, major blood vessels, or nerves.

Broadly, chemotherapy with different antineoplastics is employed for advanced, widespread, or irresectable stages of various STSs.

SimilarÂ principles apply to internal, retroperitoneal, or intraabdominal UPS management. Excision with negative margins, with or without IORT, is the treatment of choice for resectable disease, whilst chemotherapy, chemoradiation, or HDR are preferred for unresectable cases.
