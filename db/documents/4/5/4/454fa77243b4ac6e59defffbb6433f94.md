Embolism is the most common neurological complications in both IE and NBTE. However, a wide range of clinical manifestations can occur.

- Twenty to forty percent of patients with infectious endocarditis present with symptomatic neurological sequelae such as stroke, TIA, meningitis, or brain abscess. Patients may present neurological complications before or after the diagnosis of infectious endocarditis.clinical manifestations, blood cultures, and echocardiography. A blood culture may be negative in infective endocarditis, also known as culture-negative endocarditis, previous antibiotic treatments, or living in developing countries are risks factors for culture-negative endocarditis.

- Patients with NBTE are often asymptomatic. Previous autopsy study in cancer patients reported an approximately fifteen percent of cerebral vascular diseases, while only less than ten percent of patients experienced clinical neurological manifestations, e.g., stroke with focal neurological deficits, delirium, change of mental status. Fever is uncommon. However, the majority of NBTE patients have an advanced underlying malignancy or autoimmune diseases such as SLE; therefore, patients might present as febrile.
