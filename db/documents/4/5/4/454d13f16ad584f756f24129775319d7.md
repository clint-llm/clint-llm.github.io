**ACE2 Receptor**

SARS-CoV-2 uses its S-spike to bind to ACE2 receptors as the point of entry into the cell. These ACE2 receptors are expressed in type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes and other cell types, including endothelial cells. ACE2 is an inverse regulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 uses these ACE2 receptors to target the respiratory system primarily.

**SARS-CoV-2 and the Immune Response**

There are two immune-response phases of COVID-19 disease. Phase 1 occurs during the incubation stage of the disease, during which the adaptive immune system works to eliminate the virus; if any defects occur at this stage, SARS-CoV-2 will disseminate and induce systemic organ damage, with more significant destruction of organs with higher expression of ACE2 receptors, including lung, endothelial cells, the heart, and the kidneys. This massive damage leads to phase 2: severe inflammation in the affected organs.

Diabetes, atherosclerosis, and obesity, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, downregulate the immune system. These have been associated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19.

**Mechanisms of Cardiac Damage in COVID-19**

Multiple mechanisms have been suggested for cardiac damage, based on studies conducted during the previous SARS and MERS epidemics and the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. Part of the systemic inflammatory response in severe COVID-19 is the release of high levels of cytokines (known as cytokine release syndrome) that can injure multiple tissues, including vascular endothelium and cardiac myocytes.

**Cytokine Release Syndrome**

Cytokine release syndrome occurs in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Many proinflammatory cytokines are significantly elevated in severe cases, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±.

**Direct Myocardial Cell Injury**

The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 can cause changes to the ACE2 pathways, leading to acute injury of the lung, heart, and endothelial cells. A small number of case reports have indicated that SARS-CoV2 might directly infect the myocardium, causing viral myocarditis. However, in most cases, myocardial damage appeared to be caused by increased cardiometabolic demand associated with the systemic infection and ongoing hypoxia caused by severe pneumonia or ARDS.

**Acute Coronary Syndrome**

Plaque rupture leading to acute coronary syndrome can result from the systemic inflammation and catecholamine surge inherent in this disease.

**Other Possible Mechanisms**

Certain medications such as corticosteroids, antiviral medications, and immunological agents may have cardiotoxic side effects. Electrolyte disturbances can occur in any critical systemic illness and trigger arrhythmias, for which patients with underlying cardiac disease are at higher risk. There is particular concern about hypokalemia in patients with COVID-19, given the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Hypokalemia is well known to increase vulnerability to various kinds of arrhythmia.
