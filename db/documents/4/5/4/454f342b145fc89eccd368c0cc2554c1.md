Pernio commonly presents as multiple erythrocyanotic lesions, typically macules, papules, or nodules that develop in response to exposure to cold, damp environments. These lesions are generally symmetric, affecting bilateral hands or feet, particularly targeting the toes and fingers. Pernio has also been reported to affect other body sites with less frequency. Pernio lesions commonly appear within 24 hours of exposure to cold and will often resolve within a few weeks.

A worrisome potential complication is the development of a secondary infection. In patients who experience blisters or ulceration associated with pernio, as with any disease process where there is an entry point for bacteria due to skin breakdown, secondary infection can easily occur, making it increasingly necessary to treat these patients and encourage rapid resolution of blisters or ulcerations.
