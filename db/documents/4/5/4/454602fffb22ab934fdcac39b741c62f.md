The prognosis depends on the clinical condition of the patient, the severity of the injury, the time of detection, concomitant injuries, and finally, the type of repair undertaken. Almost 80% of the patients with tracheobronchial injuries in blunt trauma die before reaching a medical facility. One major compounding reason could be associated with concomitant injuries, which by themselves are lethal. However, the mortality of traumatic tracheobronchial injury has decreased significantly from 36% before 1950 to 9% in 2001.

Superimposed mediastinitis, delayed diagnosis before undergoing a surgical correction, and surgical repair in critically ill patients increases mortality significantly. Up to 80% of mortality is observed in critically ill patients undergoing repair. Patients should also be followed up for the development of stenosis in all airway injuries until complete healing occurs. Health expenditures are significant for periodic monitoring of such patients who may require therapeutic endoscopic dilatations during the follow-up.
