The incubation period of the West Nile virus varies from 4-14 days.Symptoms tend to last 5-7 days and include fever in at least 1/4th of patients.

The clinical presentation of West Nile virus in most cases include myalgia, malaise, and a low-grade fever. Other associated symptoms include headache, eye pain, vomiting, anorexia, and up to 50% may have a maculopapular rash on the trunk appearing upon defervescence. However, in rare cases, the virus can cause neurologic symptoms, including severe muscle weakness, changes in mental status, seizures, or flaccid paralysis. These patients initially present with features of encephalitis and/or meningitis that progresses rapidly, and they require ICU care. Even with aggressive supportive treatment, the mortality rate following a case of neuroinvasive West Nile infection is high.

Most people infected with West Nile virus have a history of travel to an area where the virus is endemic during the summer or fall. However, this includes areas on most continents, as listed in the epidemiology section. The West Nile virus incubation period is two to 14 days. The typical infection includes a fever for five days, headache for 10 days and fatigue for around a month.
