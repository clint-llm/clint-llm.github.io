Any bleeding from the genitourinary tract or gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) can mimic abnormal uterine bleeding. Therefore, bleeding from other sources fits into the differential diagnosis and must be ruled out.

The differential diagnosis for genital tract bleeding based on anatomic location or system:

- Vulva: Benign growths or malignancy

- Vagina: Benign growths, sexually transmitted infections, vaginitis, malignancy, trauma, foreign bodies

- Cervix: Benign growths, sexually transmitted infections, malignancy

- Fallopian tubes and ovaries: Pelvic inflammatory disease, malignancy

- Urinary tract: Infections, malignancy

- Gastrointestinal tract: Inflammatory bowel disease, Beh√ßet syndrome

- Pregnancy complications: Spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, placenta previa

- Uterus: Etiologies of bleeding arising from the uterine corpus are listed in the acronym PALM-COEIN
