Granulomas may regress with appropriate treatment, especially if drug-induced or infectious in etiology. Granulomas in sarcoidosis may resolve spontaneously or may persist for years. They may be asymptomatic or progress to fibrosis, portal hypertension, or cirrhosis. Ursodeoxycholic acid therapy has been shown to reduce the progression of PBC and results in histologic improvement. It improves overall and transplantation-free survival. For those patients that do undergo liver transplantation in PBC, outcomes are excellent, with a 1-year survival rate of greater than 90%.
