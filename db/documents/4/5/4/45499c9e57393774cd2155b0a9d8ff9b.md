The coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure is used to improve blood flow to at-risk areas of myocardial tissues. When a patient requires subsequent CABG procedures, they may require additional perioperative management techniques and considerations. CABG is one of the most common cardiac procedures undertaken nowadays. With an aging population and high prevalence of coronary artery disease, a percentage of patients will require a second intervention which is mostly carried out in the form of percutaneous coronary intervention. Few will require a redo CABG for various reasons, which carries significant risk as a redo procedure and requires specific measures for work up to avoid complications. This activity reviews the management of patients undergoing a redo CABG procedure and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who undergo redo CABG.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of repeat revascularisation.
- Review the challenges anticipated with redo sternotomy in general and redo CABG in particular.
- Describe the surgical approach and myocardial protection strategy in redo CABG as well as conduit selection.
- Summarize the importance of secondary prevention measures.
