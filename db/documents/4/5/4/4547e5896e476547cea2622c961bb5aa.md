Ocular adverse events include transient stinging, photophobia, superficial punctate keratitis, blurred vision, and a rise in intraocular pressure.

Potential anticholinergic effects include dry mouth, high temperature, constipation, increased heart rate, and headache. Young children and the elderly are most susceptible to these side effects. Fortunately, due to its low affinity for muscarinic receptors and very low receptor occupancy in plasma, tropicamide applied as an eye drop rarely causes the systemic effects listed above.

Serious adverse events, especially vasomotor and cardiorespiratory collapse, behavioral changes, and psychotic reactions, have been reported rarely in children with the use of anticholinergic drugs, especially cyclopentolate.

Precipitating angle closure in primary open-angle glaucoma patients, as well as the potential increase in intraocular pressure after mydriasis, is a frequent concern to many ophthalmologists.
