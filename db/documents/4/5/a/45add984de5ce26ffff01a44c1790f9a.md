The monitoring of neuromuscular blockade with pancuronium should be through qualitative and/or quantitative peripheral nerve stimulation. This often occurs by placing electrodes overlying the facial nerve on the lateral face, the ulnar nerve at the wrist, or the tibial nerve at the ankle. Supramaximal electrical stimulation produces muscular contraction, which may be observed to achieve qualitative evaluation or measured by acceleromyography to achieve a quantitative assessment. There are patterns of neural stimulation to monitor neuromuscular blockade, including train-of-four (TOF), tetanus, and double burst stimulation (DBS).

Typical TOF stimulation occurs with four electrical impulses at 2 Hz. With each repetitive stimulation in the presence of pancuronium or other nondepolarizing NMBD, ACh is released at the NMJ in diminishing amounts correlating to the decreased amplitude of muscular contraction. The ratio of the first and fourth muscular contraction is measured as the TOF ratio, which allows for quantification and estimation of recovery from the neuromuscular blockade.

Typical tetanic stimulation occurs with a continuous electrical stimulation at 50 Hz over 5 seconds. Pancuronium and other nondepolarizing NMBD result in a non-sustained or fading amplitude of muscular contraction. DBS is characterized by two bursts of three electrical stimuli separated by 750 ms, which are recognized clinically as two separated twitches. DBS provides an improved ability to discern deep levels of neuromuscular blockade.
