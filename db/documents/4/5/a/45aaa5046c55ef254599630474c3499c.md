Individual variations exist in terms of the size and shape of the cochlea. These variations can have wide-ranging effectsÂ on surgical outcomes.

Common variations include:

- The length of the outer cochlear wall

- The diameter of the cochlear tube (first turn of the cochlea)

- Length of the pars ascendens (first turn of the cochlea)

- The width of the scala tympani (the ascending portion of the cochlear duct)

Individuals with narrow scala tympani or small cochlear size are at potential risk of experiencing trauma during electrode implantation. Also, the variation in diameter of the cochlear tube may result in limitations with conventional cochlear implants. Some of the smaller diameter tubes may not be large enough for the surgeries in some individuals.
