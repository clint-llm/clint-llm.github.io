Myofibroblasts are frequently part of the scar either scattered through or in aggregates mainly present in the 2 to 6 months post-injury. After this time, as more collagen is laid down, their number diminishes.

With standard HE stains, one can observe the irregular axon fascicles surrounded by prominent perineurium in various stages of maturation. Depending on when the sample gets taken, perineurium can also still be damaged. Especially close to the cut nerve endings, Schwann cells and myofibroblasts can be present within the scar tissue. There is also a relatively high content of glycosaminoglycans.

There is a very rare subtype of neuroma called Pacinian corpuscle neuroma. Pacinian corpuscles are mechanoreceptors in various organs, including the skin. This post-traumatic neuroma can form after skin injuries, frequently in fingers. It can be easily identified under the microscope as the corpuscles are larger in size and number than usual.
