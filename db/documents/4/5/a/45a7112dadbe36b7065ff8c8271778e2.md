For most children, the prognosis is good. Viral pneumonia tends to resolve without treatment. Long-term sequelae are rare. However, both staphylococcal and varicella pneumonia have guarded outcomes in children.

Children with tuberculosis are at high risk for disease progression if the condition is not treated Immunocompromized children have the worst prognosis. Each year, roughly 3 million children die from pneumonia and the majority of these children also have other comorbidities like congenital heart disease, immunosuppression, or chronic lung disease of prematurity.
