**Tooth Eruption**

Tooth eruption is the movement of the developing tooth from its position in the alveolar bone (nonfunctional position) to the occlusal plane (functional position).

Various theories have been described to explain the physiology of dental eruption. The most widely accepted theory advocates that the dental follicle regulates bone remodeling mechanisms necessary for translocating the tooth through the eruption pathway to the alveolar crest.

The dental follicle is a connective tissue pouch surrounding the tooth germ in the first stages of tooth development.

The periodontal ligament (PDL) is believed to play a vital role in generating the post-emergence forces that move the tooth from the gingival plane to the occlusal plane (supraosseous stage). The maturation process of the PDL collagen fibers involves the cross-linking and shortening of the fibers, leading to propulsive eruptive movements.

**Tooth Impaction**

The potential for tooth impaction exists in all individuals, and the incidence of impaction can vary based on different studies. Research findings indicate that the occurrence of tooth impaction ranges from 5.6% to 18.8%. Moreover, studies suggest that impaction tends to be more common in females than males.

The frequency of tooth impaction follows a pattern opposite to the typical chronological eruption sequence. Teeth that erupt later in the dental development process tend to have a higher likelihood of impaction due to insufficient arch space. The mandibular third molar (wisdom tooth) is the most commonly impacted tooth, followed by the maxillary third molar, maxillary canine, mandibular premolars, maxillary premolars, and second molar.

The teeth with the lowest impaction rates are the mandibular incisors, first molars, and primary teeth. Impaction of these teeth is relatively rare and is typically associated with specific conditions such as retained deciduous teeth or abnormalities like an odontoma.

Multiple dental impactions can present with syndromes, such as Gardner syndrome, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome), and cleidocranial dysostosis.
