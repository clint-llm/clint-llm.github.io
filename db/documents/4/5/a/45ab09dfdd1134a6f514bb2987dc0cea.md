The hemodynamic alterations from vascular variants can predispose to aneurysm formation within the VB system. Other vascular anomalies include arteriovenous malformations (AVM), dural AV fistulas (DAVF), and sometimes persistent primitive carotid-vertebrobasilar communications. Aneurysms and AVM though less common compared to their supratentorial counterparts, the risk of rupture as well as ensuing morbidity and mortality is substantially high. Though micro-neurosurgery remains a gold standard in their management, Â other modalities like radiotherapy and endovascular modalities also play a pivotal role in selecting and planning a correct therapeutic algorithm in many of them.

The intrasellar primitive persistent trigeminal artery can be inadvertently damaged during trans-nasal transsphenoidal endoscopic or microscopic pituitary surgery thereby leading to neurological deficits contributable to vascular compromise in territories within the distal VB system.

The presence of fetal posterior communicating arteries plays a significant role while managing internal carotid artery (ICA) bifurcation, posterior communicating artery (PCOM), and basilar tip aneurysms. The fetal PCOMs should be preserved, and their patency assured to maintain normal vascularity in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory.
