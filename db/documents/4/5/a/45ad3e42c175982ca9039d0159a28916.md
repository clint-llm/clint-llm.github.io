Management of myxopapillary ependymoma needs an interprofessional approach involving a team that consists of a neurosurgeon, neurologist, radiotherapist, radiologist, and pathologist. The primary clinicians should refer patients with any neurological deficits to a neurologist or a neurosurgeon for further workup. All health professionals must coordinate their actions to enhance the management of patients with myxopapillary ependymoma. Coordination begins with proper communication between clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists.

The optimal treatment of myxopapillary ependymoma relies on surgical removal of the tumor. The interprofessional team should perform an exhaustive preoperative workup to minimize postoperative complications of surgery.
