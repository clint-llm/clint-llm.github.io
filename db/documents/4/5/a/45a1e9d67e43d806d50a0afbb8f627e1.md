In a 1925 to 1993 retrospective study conducted by a group of physicians, only 185 reports of injury caused by OMT appears in literature. HVLA techniques have not statistically caused significant adverse effects on patients; there are generally no side effects of OMT except for probable soreness for a day or two after the procedure; in fact, most manual procedures may cause transient adverse effects on patients. The degree of this potential soreness will depend on the approach taken by the physician.

HVLA procedures are considered the riskiest in that band, as it produces rapid impulses. The literature records one harmful effect per 50,000 HVLA thrust procedures; however, there is currently no compelling evidence to prescribe that HVLA thrust techniques administered by well-trained providers should be terminated because of risk. In addition to experience and adequate training in these techniques, the way to a safe OMT session is taking a thorough patient history and performing a thorough physical examination before the administration of any procedure.
