The consensus is that dysfunction of the superior oblique tendon-trochlear complex results in Brown syndrome. The condition is commonly divided into primary congenital and acquired causes. Acquired cases can be further classified into inflammatory, traumatic, or iatrogenic, although many different causes have been identified and are listed below for completeness.

**Congenital Brown Syndrome**

- The tight, superior oblique anterior tendon sheath

- Short superior oblique muscle and tendon

- Nodule on the superior tendon

- Anomalous innervation

**Acquired Brown Syndrome**

- Systemic disease

- Dysthyroid disease

- Enteropathic arthropathy

- Hurler-Scheie syndrome

- Hypogammaglobulinemia

- Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis

- Rheumatoid arthritis

- Sjogren syndrome

- Systemic lupus erythematosus

**Ophthalmic Disease**

- Blepharoplasty

- Glaucoma implant in the superior nasal quadrant

- Orbital floor fracture

- Retinal encircling band

- Sinus surgery/sinusitis

- Superior oblique tuck

- Trochleitis

- Neoplasm superior nasal orbit

- Trauma to the superior or nasal orbit, e.g., canine tooth syndrome

**Other Causes**

- Cyclic Brown syndrome

- Idiopathic

- Inflammatory click syndrome

- Tenosynovitis of the superior oblique

- Cardiopulmonary resuscitation

- Postpartum
