Extensive or too frequent dosage can lead to acute volume and electrolyte depletion, low circulatory volume with a possibility of vascular thrombosis, and embolism. Symptoms such as weakness, mental confusion, anorexia, lethargy, vomiting, and cramps may occur because of electrolyte depletion. Treatment is with the adequate replacement of fluids and electrolytes such as add potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics in case of potassium depletion. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia and slight reversible elevations of BUN and creatinine may also occur, particularly associated with dehydration or patients with renal insufficiency. Bumetanide has shown an increase in urinary calcium with resultant hypocalcemia. Similarly, hypomagnesemia should be measured periodically.
