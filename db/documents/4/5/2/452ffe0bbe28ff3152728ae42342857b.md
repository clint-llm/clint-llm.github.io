The prognosis depends on the nature and the size of the iris cyst. Generally, primary cysts have a better prognosis than secondary cysts.Â Of the primary cysts, pigment epithelial cysts have a better prognosis than stromal cysts. Other factors for poor prognosis include large size (occupying more than 50% of anterior chamber), young age at presentation, apposition to cornea or lens, and reduced visual acuity at presentation.
