The superior and inferior laryngeal arteries supply most of the blood to the larynx.

The superior laryngeal artery is a branch of the superior thyroid artery near its bifurcation from the external carotid artery. It enters the larynx with the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve through the aperture of the thyrohyoid membrane. It supplies blood to the muscles, mucous membrane, and glands of the larynx, and will anastomose with the superior laryngeal artery from the opposite side.

The inferior laryngeal artery starts at the inferior thyroid branch of the thyrocervical trunk, a branch of the subclavian artery. It ascends into the larynx along with the recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve.

The lymphatic system of the larynx can be differentiated based on if draining from above or below the vocal folds:

- Lymph drainage from above the vocal folds travels along the superior laryngeal artery, passing through the foramen in the thyrohyoid membrane, and drain into the deep cervical lymph nodes at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery.

- Lymph drainage from below the vocal folds travels along the inferior thyroid artery and drains to the upper tracheal lymph nodes.
