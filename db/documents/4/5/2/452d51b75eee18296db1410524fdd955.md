Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection can cause various types of illness including gastroenteritis, wound infections, and, in more severe cases, sepsis. It is a common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in Asia, specifically in Japan. Despite being relatively uncommon, outbreaks of Vibrio parahaemolyticus are on the rise in the United States. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of vibrio parahaemolyticus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Vibrio parahaemolyticus.
- Outline the supportive management of patients affected by Vibrio parahaemolyticus.
- Review the risk factors for developing Vibrio parahaemolyticus infections.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients with Vibrio parahaemolyticus infections.
