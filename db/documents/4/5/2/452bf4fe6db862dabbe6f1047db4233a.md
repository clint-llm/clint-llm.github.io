Similar to other medications for type 2 diabetes mellitus, HbA1c should be checked every 3 months to monitor glycemic control, and blood glucose levels should be checked regularly. Patients may opt for a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device to examine their glycemic patterns to help make dosage changes. There are reported cases of acute renal failure and renal insufficiency with the use of exenatide and lixisenatide.

Monitoring with renal function tests is recommended for patients taking these medications. Patients taking GLP-1 receptor agonists should be educated about the adverse effect profile and monitored for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, and compressive symptoms of medullary thyroid cancer such as hoarseness or dysphagia. Currently, the FDA does not recommend monitoring calcitonin levels in patients taking GLP-1 analogs. It is exceedingly important for patients to receive yearly comprehensive eye exams as these agents, particularly semaglutide, may carry the risk of retinopathy associated with rapid glucose reduction.

If patients take GLP-1 receptor agonists along with sulfonylureas or insulin, there is an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Patients should be educated on signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and monitored periodically by their clinician.
