Epidural catheters are widely used in surgical, obstetric, and chronic pain settings as they serve as an excellent adjunct or alternative to general anesthesia. Through an epidural catheter, local anesthetic and other adjuvants can be continuously infused or given intermittently, inhibiting pain signals at the nerve root. This method of administration can potentially decrease adverse side effects and hospital length of stay while maintaining or improving optimal patient safety. This activity describes the placement techniques of epidural catheters and their indications, contraindications, and adverse effects. The role of each primary interprofessional team member is highlighted throughout the process of managing patients who undergo epidural anesthesia.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the contraindications for epidural catheter placement.
- Describe the equipment and personnel required for epidural catheter placement.
- Review the clinical significance of epidural catheter placement.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance epidural catheter placement success and improve outcomes.
