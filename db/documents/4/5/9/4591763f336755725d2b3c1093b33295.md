The lymphatic system can easily be overlooked, but it has a drastic impact on the immune system. This mesh of tissues and organs exports toxins, waste, and unnecessary materials via lymph fluid out of the body. Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) is used to treat somatic dysfunctions. OMT focuses on enhancing the neuromuscular connection, improving biomechanical balance, decrease pain, and increase range of motion.

Some osteopathic techniques are similar to those implemented by chiropractors, physical therapist, and massage therapists, and other methods are solely used by osteopathic physicians. However, one main difference is that these physicians are trained to apply their knowledge of these techniques in combination with their extensive knowledge of physiology. This allows the osteopathic physician to tailor their treatment to each patient.
