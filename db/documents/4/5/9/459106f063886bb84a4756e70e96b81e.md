The briefing before simulation has four key components.

- Review the session's goals and objectives.

- Educators should review learning objectives, outlining the simulation session sequence of events, familiarizing the learners with the simulation equipment and environment, and explaining the roles of the educators.

- Establish a fiction contract with the learners.

- The educator is responsible for creating a scenario that is as real as possible within the limitations of the simulated environment. The learners are responsible for fully engaging in the simulation and acting as if everything is real.

- Provide logistic details about the session to the learners.

- Logistic details include the length of the session, timing of breaks, and how to manage telephone calls, texts, pages, and emails throughout the session.

- Pledge to respect the learners.

- Educators should inquire about the learner's decisionmaking process and rationale behind their choices - this provides the educator insight into the learner'sÂ knowledge gaps and helps guide feedback.
