Unfortunately, there is no cure for hydranencephaly, and treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

The survival of patients with hydranencephaly is dependent on the integrity of the brainstem, which regulates vital aspects such as cardiorespiratory functions and temperature regulation. Those few patients described in the literature that survive past the 1st year of life do not improve after shunt placement. The neurological function remains stable during their lifetime. There is limited use of hands and communication responses; however, some patients can use some words.
