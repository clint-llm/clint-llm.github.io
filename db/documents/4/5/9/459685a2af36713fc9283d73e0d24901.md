The precise pathophysiology of papular acrodermatitis is unknown, but it is presumed to be immunologically mediated given its association with viral infections and vaccination. Its increased prevalence in patients with a history of atopic disease, family history of atopic disease,Â and/or elevated immunoglobulin E also supports an immune-mediated pathology. Proposed processes include immune complexes or delayed hypersensitivity reactions, but to date, this has not been well defined.
