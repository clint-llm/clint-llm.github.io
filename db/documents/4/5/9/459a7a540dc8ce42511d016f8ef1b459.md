Adaptive support ventilation (ASV) is highly impactful in the context of the respiratory therapist shortage in intensive care units. ASV allows automation to take over the controls rather than to depend on human resources for minute setting changes. ASV is also associated with lesser alarms, and manual setting changes are evident in many studies of the past.

When the patient begins the attempts to spontaneous breaths, there occurs an automatic decrease of PS. Such subtle reductions in ventilator demand are often missed by non-automated and human-operated modes of ventilation, thus taking more time for weaning. ASV Â allows a reduced requirement for skilled human resources in the care of the ventilated patient.
