Subcutaneous emphysema is the de novo generation or infiltration of air underneath the dermal layers of skin. The development of subcutaneous air may be a benign symptom or an indication of a deeper, more concerning pathologic disease state. This activity will review the etiologies, risk factors, and management of subcutaneous emphysema and the importance of interprofessional care during the evaluation and treatment of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the difference between benign from extensive subcutaneous emphysema.
- Review patient symptoms associated with subcutaneous emphysema. 
- Outline the treatment of subcutaneous emphysema. 
- Identify how an interprofessional team can improve care and how communication will promote better patient outcomes in subcutaneous emphysema.
