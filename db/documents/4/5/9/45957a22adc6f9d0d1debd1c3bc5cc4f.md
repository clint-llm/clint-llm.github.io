**The Surgical Neck**

Fractures at the surgical neck are more frequent than fractures at the anatomical neck, very important structures pass through the surgical neck, the axillary nerve, and the posterior circumflex humeral artery. Damage to those structures may cause paralysis of the deltoid and teres minor muscles and loss of dermal sensation over the lower half of the deltoid muscle.

**The Spiral Groove**

Injuries to the radial nerve in the spiral groove, the injury to the radial nerve occurs most commonly in the distal part of the groove, beyond the origin of the nerves to the triceps, the anconeus and the origin of the cutaneous nerves. The patient is unable to extend the wrist, and the fingers “wrist drop” and a variable, small area of loss of the sensation is present over the dorsal surface of the hand and the dorsal surface the lateral three and a half fingers except the tips of the fingers.

Clinicians can treat the presence of adhesion neuropathy of the median nerve with neurolysis; as with other nerves, it can be transferred to restore the function of neighboring non-functional nerves for various causes (arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, penetrating injuries, palsy, etc.).
