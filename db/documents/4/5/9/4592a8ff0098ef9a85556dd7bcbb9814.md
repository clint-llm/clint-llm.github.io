The patient-physician relationship is built on trust, allowing a physician to provide an accepted standard of care within the practitioner's scope of practice and training.

Collaboration amongst the interprofessional team to understand and interpret somatic dysfunctions and understand HVLA therapy is paramount to guide further diagnostics, therapeutics, and consultations for the patient's overall benefit. Collaboration with other members of the health care team (other physicians, as well as physical therapists, occupational therapists, social workers, acupuncturists, counselors, etc.) may ensure complementary healthcare modalities, such as dietary changes, nutritional supplements, therapeutic exercises, and medicinal regimes as part of the overall treatment plan.
