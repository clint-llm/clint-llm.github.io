Pediatric facial trauma is most often the result of blunt force (e.g., falls, motor vehicle collision, bicycle injury, sports-related, assault), though penetrating injuries may occur.

Age-related etiology considerations include non-accidental trauma, particularly in infants, accidental self-injurious behavior, suicide attempts, and assaults, which are more common in adolescents, and less frequently occupational exposure or weapons-based injuries.

At birth, the skull is relatively much larger than the face, which grows over time.

Lacerations and contusions are common in young patients when more acutely edged bony structures strike against hard objects, such as the floor, stairs, or furniture, resulting in common presentations of lacerations to the chin, cheek, and forehead (often overlying the lower mandible, zygomatic arch, or superior orbital rim respectively).

**Special Consideration**

Children are at risk of unique facial injuries due to age-related accidental self-injurious behavior. A distinctive oral commissure electrical burn may occur if a young child bites into or sucks on an active electrical cable.
