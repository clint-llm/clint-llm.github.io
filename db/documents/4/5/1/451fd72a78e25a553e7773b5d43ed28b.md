Pediatric lateral humeral condyle fractures are complex elbow injuries requiring an interprofessional approach. Initial assessment by a clinician with neurovascular documentation is the first crucial step. Radiographers should know the importance of obtaining AP, lateral, and internal oblique views of the affected elbow. This imaging will aid in better visualization and management decision by the referring clinician. When further investigation is required, a radiologist should be consulted to discuss magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate the articular cartilage.

Nurses play a crucial role in managing these patients. During the initial assessment or in the postoperative period, they will be paramount in spotting neurovascular compromise. Rehabilitation is also key to ensuring good outcomes following this injury. Physiotherapists will be able to orient and counsel these patients to restore elbow function as much as possible. The interprofessional care model with open communication channels between various healthcare disciplines will yield the best results. [Level 5]
