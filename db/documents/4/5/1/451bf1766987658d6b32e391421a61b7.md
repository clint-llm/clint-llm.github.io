C. botulinum can produce several types of botulinum toxin. In fact, each subtype of clostridium can produce a different type of toxin. The botulinum toxin is potent and even at a dose of picomoles, it is more potent than mustard gas.

The active form of the C. botulinum spore produces a neurotoxin that causes descending paralysis. This active form is made of polypeptide chains connected with disulfide bonds. The toxin will enter the presynaptic nerve terminals where it prevents the release of acetylcholine by blocking calcium channels. The resulting action causes an overall decrease of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction and leads to flaccid paralysis. Traditionally, the toxin will first affect bulbar musculature than somatic musculature.

The key feature of infantile botulism is that it is only seen in children less than 12 months. The spores do not germinate in older children because of gastric acidity. Infants younger than 12 months have an immature immune system, a relative lack of gastric acidity, and diminished bacterial flora,- all factors that increase the risk of botulism.
