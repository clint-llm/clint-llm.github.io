The ulnar nerve passes directly through the Guyon canal. As it passes through the canal, the ulnar nerve typically bifurcates into 2 branches: the superficial branch and the deep branch. The superficial branch contains nerves that provide sensation to the hypothenar region as well as half of the fourth and all of the fifth digit. This nerve continues distally giving off the common digital nerve of the fourth web and the ulnar digital nerve to the little finger. The deep branch is a motor branch.
