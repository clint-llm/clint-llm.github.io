While most bullous pemphigoid cases are due to autoantibodies against proteins arranged at the dermal-epidermal junction, some cases of bullous pemphigoid are caused by systemic medications. Drug-induced bullous pemphigoid occurs up to three months after medication initiation and is typically noted in a younger subset of patients. The drugs reported in the literature to cause bullous pemphigoid-like eruptions to include diuretics such as furosemide and spironolactone, NSAIDs, amoxicillin, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, gliptins, and TNF-alpha inhibitors.
