2-octyl cyanoacrylate is one of the most commonly used, commercially available wound adhesives. It received initial approval in 1998 as an alternative to closure of skin wounds with 5-0 or smaller sutures, staples, or adhesive strips by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. Current indications include all easily approximated wounds from surgical incisions or properly cleaned lacerations from trauma in dry areas and have minimal friction. It additionally was approved for use in combination with subcuticular sutures for deeper or higher tension wounds. Original FDA labeling included a warning against use in high tension areas without immobilization.  This recommendation has support from findings in 1999 by Saxena and Willital in a randomized, controlled trial that showed no difference in rates of wound dehiscence and scar formation between usual suture repair and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate closure on properly immobilized high-tension areas.

While listed as a contraindication in the initial FDA labeling, mucosal repair may be an additional area where 2-octyl cyanoacrylate could be considered. A case report has highlighted the repair of a 7-year-old’s tongue laceration, and a blinded comparison between sutures and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate for cleft lip repair showed equivalent cosmesis when comparing wound dehiscence and scar formation.
