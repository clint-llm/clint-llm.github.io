Once the patient is ready to initiate the weaning process, it requires the appropriate settings on the ventilator. The parameters include tidal volume, respiratory rate, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), and, if used, the pressure support setting. After the initiation of mechanical ventilation, it is best practice to obtain an arterial blood gas within 60 minutes and to titrate the ventilator settings accordingly.

SIMV is rarely used for weaning. A survey of intensivists from various geographic regions showed SIMV was used 0 to 6% for weaning, depending on the region. More common methods of weaning are pressure support with PEEP (regional range of 56.5 to 72.3%) and T-piece (regional range of 8.9 to 59.5).
