# Continuing Education Activity

Nutcracker syndrome is a venous compression syndrome involving the left renal vein. It is an uncommon, although possibly underdiagnosed, condition that may lead to serious complications if left untreated. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of nutcracker syndrome and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of nutcracker syndrome.
- Explain the appropriate evaluation of nutcracker syndrome.
- Outline the management considerations for patients with nutcracker syndrome.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by nutcracker syndrome.

# Introduction

Left renal vein entrapment syndrome, or nutcracker syndrome (NCS), is characterized by extrinsic compression of the left renal vein (LRV), most commonly between the aorta (Ao) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA),

# Etiology

NCS results from compression of the LRV, associated with embryological LRV development from the aortic collar at 6-8 weeks gestation.

The inferior vena cava (IVC) derives from this anastomosis of fetal veins, forming the final infrarenal, renal, suprarenal, and hepatic segments of the IVC at 8 weeks gestation.

# Epidemiology

NCS is considered a rare condition, although the exact prevalence is unknown, and the incidence rates are reported to vary among different age groups

# Pathophysiology

Anterior NCS is the most common type, in which the LRV is compressed between the Ao and SMA. Rarely, posterior NCS occurs and is most commonly a variant involving a retro aortic or circumaortic LRV compressed between the Ao and spinal column.

Moreover, co-occurrence of venous compression syndromes in the paralumbar area and resultant hypertensive venous collaterals might describe the association of two underdiagnosed entities of NCS and May - Thurner (MTS).

Hematuria occurs when the elevated blood pressure in the collaterals and subsequent venous sinuses near the renal calyces ruptures the thin-walled septum between the small veins and the renal collecting system.

# History and Physical

A study of 112 cases reported a frequency of symptoms including 78.57% for hematuria, 38.39% for left flank pain, 35.71% for varicocele in males, 30.36% for proteinuria, and 13.39% for anemia.

Symptoms of autonomic dysfunction may occur, although rare, including hypotension, syncope, and tachycardia.

# Evaluation

A diagnosis of exclusion of other causes is employed and confirmed with imaging. A stepwise approach includes history and physical examination, doppler ultrasonography (DUS), computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), venography, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).

Diagnostic imaging criteria include: a renocaval pullback gradient ≥ 3 mmHg, a maximum flow velocity five times increased in the LRV passing the SMA compared to the renal hilum, or an angle less than 45º between the Ao and SMA on CTA or MRA.

CT has been recommended more recently because of its accuracy and ability to investigate abdominal findings. Of the CT parameters, the most accurate is the "beak sign" and LRV diameter ratio (hilar-aortomesenteric) of ≥4.9.

# Treatment / Management

There is currently a lack of established treatment guidelines because of limited data. Management is controversial, ranging from conservative treatment to nephrectomy, and depends on symptom severity with interventions typically reserved for those who are symptomatic.

Prolonged conservative treatment in the pediatric population is highly recommended due to the possibility of spontaneous resolution following adipose tissue development, and multiple venous collateralizations. Medical treatments, including low dose aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, specifically, alacepril, have been assumed to improve orthostatic proteinuria.

Endovascular treatment or open surgery is indicated if symptoms persist following conservative treatment, or for those with significant hematuria, severe pain, or renal dysfunction.

A review of literature from October 1982 to July 2017 reported 47% of articles described the open surgical approach (most commonly LRV transposition followed by renal autotransplantation), 41.1% described endovascular stenting (EVS), and 11.7% described the minimally invasive extravascular stenting.

Endovascular stenting has been extrapolated from stenting experience that demonstrated good results in the treatment of other venous compression syndromes, including May-Thurner syndrome, and superior vena cava syndrome.

No perioperative complications occurred. Three out of five patients whose symptoms remained had previously undergone LRV transposition. Stent restenosis or symptom recurrence required stent reintervention in three patients at 5.8 months, 16.8 months, and 51.7 months. No stent migration occurred.

Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy are recommended during stent endothelialization and include a regimen of 3 days on low molecular weight heparin, 30 days on clopidogrel, and 3 months on aspirin.

# Differential Diagnosis

Entrapment of the LRV can be caused by retroperitoneal tumors, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, or pancreatic neoplasm.

# Prognosis

The natural history of NCS is not entirely clear.

# Complications

Insufficient venous outflow from the left gonadal vein (LGV) can cause dilatation of the LGV walls and rupture, varicocele in men, and pelvic congestion syndrome in women.

Hypertensive venous collateral in the paralumbar territory might cause the uncommon association of NCS and MTS. Correction of one might aggravate unopposed hypertension, and worsen the symptom.

A 2016 retrospective evaluation of 75 patients who underwent endovascular stenting at a single center reported stent migration occurred in 5 patients (6.7%) during a mean 55 months of follow-up. The stent migrated into the left side of the LRV in one patient, IVC in two patients, right atrium in one patient, and right ventricle in one patient. They concluded that preoperative LRV measurements, stent choice, stent deployment, close follow-up, and early detection and treatment are needed to reduce the number of stent migrations, particularly into the heart.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients should be educated on the complications, particularly renal injury if left untreated. The risk of infertility in those with pelvic congestion syndrome or varicocele should be discussed. Screening is not necessary for family members, as NCS is not a genetic condition.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

A primary care clinician or emergency medical clinician may sometimes be the first to encounter a patient presenting with symptoms of NCS. Considering the differential diagnoses, complications, and different treatment strategies, it is crucial to consult promptly with an interprofessional team of specialists to improve outcomes. This may include an adult or pediatric urologist, nephrologist, obstetrician, gynecologist, interventional cardiologist, interventional radiologist, vascular surgeon, general surgeon, or transplant surgeon. Radiologists are essential to interpreting imaging modalities, including CT or MRI, to determine the cause. Sonographers play an essential role in obtaining doppler ultrasonography images. Nurses serve as vital team members in caring for, monitoring, and educating the patients before and after treatment.

Catheterization laboratory or operating room teams are critical in ensuring safe and effective endovascular or open surgery interventions. Pharmacists are necessary to conservative management involving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and to post-intervention anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy, and analgesics when indicated. This collaboration is especially important, as Carroll and Moll note that the potential benefit of keeping venous stents patent with antiplatelets is unknown, and guidelines related to venous stents are currently lacking because of insufficient evidence, rendering the need for clinical trials.

In recent years, de Macedo et al. and Velasquez et al. have performed systematic reviews and produced treatment approaches. (Level 1)
