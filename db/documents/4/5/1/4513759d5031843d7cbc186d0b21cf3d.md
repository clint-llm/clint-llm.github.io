The fluoroscope's C-arm imaging projector should be positioned such that the L2 and L3 vertebrae are easily visualized, and the superior endplates are aligned. Occasionally, the procedure is done under computed tomography guidance. The C-arm is placed in the oblique plane until the end of the transverse process is aligned with the anterior aspect of the vertebral body to avoid the transverse process during the insertion of the needle. The needle should be aimed towards the anterior aspect of the vertebral bodies of L2 or L3.

Once in the correct position, and aspiration was negative for air, blood, or cerebrospinal fluid, 1 mL of contrast is injected to ensure adequate flow and proper location. The clinician should be able to visualize the contrast covering the anterior portion of the vertebral body with an inferior and superior spread at L1 to L3. After adequate location and craniocaudal spread, the medication (anesthetic bupivacaine 0.5%, ethanol 96%, or botulinum toxin) is injected to complete the lumbar sympathetic blockade. The needle is removed and pressure is applied on the entry point and then covered with a bandage. The greatest indication of a successful lumbar sympathetic block is a two-three degree Celcius rise in the temperature of the affected limb. The patient might also note that the skin of the extremity on the injected side will become flushed as a result of blood vessel dilation.
