Consciousness is the awareness of oneself and the environment and the ability to respond to external stimuli.

Coma is a profound and occasionally persistent state of unconsciousness. Plum and Posner define a coma as "a state of unresponsiveness in which the patient lies with eyes closed and cannot be aroused to respond appropriately to stimuli even with vigorous stimulation."
