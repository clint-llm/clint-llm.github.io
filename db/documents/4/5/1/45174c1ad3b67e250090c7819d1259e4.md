A clear cell acanthoma presents as a solitary, red or red-brown, dome-shaped papule or nodule. A peripheral, wafer-like scale collarette is classically described in a majority of lesions, but may not always be present. The surface may also have a crusted or moist appearance and may bleed with minor trauma. These tumors slowly enlarge over several years and range in size from a few millimeters to 2 centimeters.
