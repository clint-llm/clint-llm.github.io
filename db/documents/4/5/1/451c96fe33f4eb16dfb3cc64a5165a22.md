The most common etiology of subclavian steal syndrome is atherosclerosis. Subclavian steal syndrome is more commonly seen on the left side, possibly due to the more acute origin of the left subclavian artery, leading to increased turbulence, causing accelerated atherosclerosis

Some of the other risk factors for SSS include

- Takayasu arteritis,Â which is a form of large vessel granulomatous vasculitis, commonly seen in young or middle-aged women of Asian descent

- Subclavian artery compression in the thoracic outlet. This presentation usually presents in athletes like cricket bowlers and baseball pitchers, due to neuromuscular compression, as the subclavian artery crosses over the first rib.

- Presence of cervical rib, which is an extra rib that originates from the seventh cervical vertebra

- Following surgical repair of coarctation of the aorta

- Congenital abnormalities like right aortic arch

- Rare anatomical factors include aortic dissection, vertebral artery congenital malformations, and even external vertebral artery compression
