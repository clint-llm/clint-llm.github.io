Better outcomes are likely if patients are educated on:

- What constitutes a change in the benign lesion that is worrisome. An example is providing the ABCDE criteria of nevus conversion to malignancy.

- What to do to reduce the risk of recurrence of the lesion: An example of this is providing instructions on the daily application of warm compresses and eyelid hygiene to prevent chalazia.

- The frequency of follow-up intervals. An example is a young patient with neurofibromatosis should be seen at least every six months.

- What other specialists need to be consulted? For example, a referral to a gastroenterologist for a patient with a Leser-Trélat sign is prudent.
