Damage to the secretory glands of the ocular adnexa is a potential complication of periocular surgery. The lacrimal gland and its ducts can suffer injury by transconjunctival surgical intervention, such as in the recession of the lateral horn of the levator aponeurosis in correcting temporal flare. A transcutaneous approach is favored when feasible to avoid direct damage to the lacrimal secretory system.

Aside from direct structural trauma incurred by surgery, fibers of the ophthalmic nerve traversing the orbicularis muscle and fascia are easily disrupted.
