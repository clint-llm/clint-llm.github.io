Histologically, EED is characterized by early changes of a leukocytoclastic vasculitis with a polymorphonuclear cell infiltrate and deposition of fibrin in the superficial and mid dermis. Polymorphonuclear cells, macrophages, histiocytes, and eosinophils may surround the blood vessels. TheseÂ infiltrates may accumulate between collagen bundles. A papillary edema also may be seen in early lesions as a reflection of clinical pseudo vesiculation.

Over time, the infiltrate contains more histiocytes and granulation tissue, and spindle cell proliferation may be seen. Extracellular cholesterol deposits may be observed in the fibrotic tissue. The fibrosis of late lesions is most likely a result of chronic dermal injury of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Direct immunofluorescence may reveal changes consistent with vasculitis, such as fibrin deposits, intravascularly and perivascularly, complement, and immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM).
