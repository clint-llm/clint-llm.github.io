After labyrinthectomy, the monitoring of the patient is typically shared between the otologist and the audiologist. Assuming that vertigo has been controlled, the degree of residual disequilibrium needs to be assessed and addressed. If vertigo recurs, vestibular testing with the audiologist will need to be repeated to determine if there is a remaining vestibular function in the operated ear or if the opposite ear has become diseased. The patientâ€™s ability to adapt to the loss of hearing will need to be assessed. Hearing rehabilitation options will be discussed with the audiologist. This discussion will include options such as a CROS-type hearing aid, a bone-anchored hearing aid, and/or cochlear implantation.
