Complications also depend on the cause of poikilocytosis. Sometimes the severity of the disease may overshadow or obscure the underlying dyserythropoiesis. Clinical acumen, coupled with a thorough observation, can use poikilocytosis to point in the right diagnostic direction. The following are some of the complications associated with common etiologies of poikilocytosis:

Sickle cell disease complications include:

- Infections

- Osteomyelitis

- Stroke, priapism

- Acute chest syndrome

- Hemolytic crisis

- Aplastic crisis

- Autosplenectomy (seen in sickle cell disease)

Hereditary spherocytosis complications include:

- Folate deficiency (might be a functional deficit).

- Hemolysis

- Pigmented gall stones

- Aplastic crisis

Anemia complications include palpitations, heart failure, pregnancy complications, and delayed growth in infants and children.
