R. rickettsia transmits into human hostsÂ by the bite of an infected tick. Humans are not a natural reservoir of disease. The Rickettsia does not harm the tick. In the United States, transmission occurs most often after a bite of the American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis), the Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni), or the brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus). Because of its association with tick bites, diagnosis more likely in the summer months in people with outdoor exposure. Despite its name, the diagnosis is most common in the southeastern and south-central United States. Importantly, because the tick bite may be brief, a lack of history of a tick bite should not exclude this diagnosis in a patient residing in or with a history of travel to an endemic area.
