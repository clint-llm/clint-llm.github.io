Becker melanosis (Becker's Nevus) (BM) is a form of acquired hyperpigmentation. This condition was described by S. William Becker as "concurrent melanosis and hypertrichosis in the distribution of nevus unius lateris." This activity describes the evaluation and management of Becker melanosis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the role of androgens in the pathophysiology of Becker melanosis.
- Describe the typical appearance of lesions during the evaluation of Becker melanosis.
- Summarize the use of lasers in treating the hyperpigmentation and hypertrichosis of Becker melanosis.
- Outline the importance of improved care coordination among the interprofessional team members to look for extra cutaneous involvement and to counsel the patients on the cosmetic outcomes of Becker melanosis.
