The physiology of the ischemic cascade is fundamental for a stress test and myocardial viability assessment, as different imaging modalities utilize different stages of the cascade. The following imaging modalities are commonly used in the evaluation of myocardial viability.

**Dobutamine Stress Echocardiography**

Dobutamine stress echocardiography is used to assess the myocardial viability in patients with resting systolic dysfunction before revascularization. It is based on the principle that viable myocardium will undergo augmentation in contractility in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation, whereas non-viable myocardium will not. Dobutamine is infused at a rate of 2.5 to 10 micrograms/kg/min.

Improvement in contractility at low dose followed by diminished wall motion at high dose (10 to 40 micrograms/kg/min) is termed a biphasic response and suggests viable myocardium. A biphasic response is predictive of recovery in myocardial contractility after revascularization.

**Radionuclide Techniques**

Radiotracers used in the viability study are the analogs of our endogenous second messenger system and metabolites used in cell signaling and metabolism. Quantitative analysis of these radiotracers' uptake thus yields indirect evidence of intact cellular function and the cell membrane and subcellular organelles' integrity. These tracers have unstable nuclei and electrons, which emit characteristic radiation after being taken up by the myocardial cells, which are converted to photons and imaged by a camera system.

The degree of uptake is proportional to myocardial blood flow. The strength of the emitted radiation correlates with the degree of uptake and, thus, the extent of viability. The infarcted myocardium does not take up tracers; hence, no radiation is emitted by this portion of the myocardium. The images show perfusion defects in that area. Radiotracer perfusion study thus aims to study the flow disparity component of the ischemic cascade, which is the early stage. The areas with normal perfusion are viable, but those with perfusion defects may be infarcted or hibernating.

Metabolic tracers like 18F-FDG, as well as delayed imaging with Thallium-201, help differentiate this. The following imaging protocols are commonly used for viability assessment:

- Thallium-201 Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) Study: Thallium-201 is a potassium analog, and its uptake via Na/K ATPase is evidence of intact cell membrane and, thus, cellular viability. Thallium-201 has a high first-pass myocardial extraction of about 85% after the intravenous injection. The initial myocardial uptake after intravenous injection is a function of blood flow, and hence uptake will be high in normal myocardium and low in ischemic myocardium. Thallium has a unique property of late redistribution from the myocardium to the blood pool, which depends on its concentration difference between the myocardium and blood pool, and not on blood flow. Since the concentration difference between the blood pool and ischemic myocardium is low, washout is low, retaining more TI-201 activity, while washout is high in normal myocardium. This phenomenon of differential washout is utilized in the viability study. The rest or stress images are taken 15 to 20 minutes after injection, and then redistribution images are obtained after 3 to 4 hours. The presence of perfusion defect in the initial images followed by improvement in redistribution images is the hallmark of myocardial viability. The specificity of this study can be further improved by enhancing redistribution by reinjecting the tracer during the redistribution stage or taking late distribution images at 24 to 48 hours later, thus allowing more time for redistribution and improving positive predictive value for improvement in LV function.

- Technetium 99m Sestamibi SPECT: Tc-99m Sestamibi is a cation that diffuses across the cell membrane and then into the mitochondria, and positive uptake is suggestive of viable myocardial cells. The protocols used are rest-stress and rest protocol with nitrate enhancement to promote uptake.

- 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET Scan: 18F-FDG is an analog of glucose tagged with a radiotracer, taken up by mitochondria, phosphorylated in the stage of glycolysis, and gets trapped in this state without further metabolism. In hibernating myocardium, GLUT receptors are overexpressed; hence, the myocardium is FDG avid. In ischemic myocardium, beta-oxidation of fatty acids is suppressed by hypoxia, so cells switch to anaerobic glycolysis for energy metabolism. Viable tissue characteristically shows flow-metabolism mismatch. The first component tests for the perfusion using PET radiotracers like rubidium-82, 13-N ammonia, and hibernating myocardium exhibit perfusion defects. The metabolic component of the test consists of keeping the patient in a fasting state for 6 hours, followed by a glucose load, insulin infusion, and finally, radiotracer F-FDG. The uptake in hibernating and normal myocardium is thus facilitated by insulin, and an image with uniform uptake is shown in a PET scanner.

**Contrast-Enhanced Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR)**

The initial method of viability assessment using CMR is quantifying end-diastolic wall thickness (EDWT). A myocardial thickness of less than 6 mm is likely a 'scar' and less likely to improve after revascularization. One of the fundamental histologic changes in necrotic myocardium is extracellular volume expansion and death of myocytes. This change enables the high uptake and retention of high-density gadolinium-based contrast agents in the cell as well as extracellular space, termed late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and forms the basis for a viability study with contrast-enhanced CMR.

The LGE starts from the endocardium (subendocardial infarct) and then progresses transmurally (transmural infarct) in the segments supplied by the coronary artery. The degree of LGE correlates with the extent of viability and potential benefit from revascularization. The myocardial segment with >50% LGE is non-viable and will not improve after revascularization, <25% is viable and will benefit from revascularization, and 25 to 50% LGE needs to be further investigated for inotropic contractile reserve by a dobutamine infusion and assessment of wall motion in echocardiography or CMR.

Figure 1 shows a transmural LGE in the right coronary artery consistent with transmural infarction and lack of viability. Dobutamine stress CMR can be used to assess viability. A dysfunctional but viable myocardium will exhibit an increased systolic thickening of over 2 mm on low-dose dobutamine stress.
