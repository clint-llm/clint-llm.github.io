**Mechanism of Radiation Associated Damage**

Ionizing radiation affects the human body by causing damage at the atomic or molecular level leading to cellular damage. They can cause damage to the vital organelles of cells resulting in cell death, or they can damage human Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) either directly or indirectly. Direct effects occur when ionizing radiation comes directly in contact with molecules of DNA, leading to DNA strand breaks. Indirect effects are related to the ionization of molecules. Ionizing radiation causes the formation of hydroxyl ions at the cellular level by ionizing water molecules. These hydroxyl ions interact with DNA leading to strand breaking or base damage. Adequate DNA repair mechanisms usually repair these DNA damages immediately, and if the damage cannot be repaired, these cells undergo apoptosis. The absence of DNA repair mechanisms or faulty repair of DNA leads to Genetic mutations that result in carcinoma formation.

**Health Risks of Radiation Exposure**

Two types of responses, Tissue reaction, and stochastic effect, have been associated with ionizing radiation exposure.

- Tissue reaction (Deterministic effect) is the one in which the severity of damage increases proportionately with an increase in radiation dose, and it usually occurs when radiation dose exceeds a particular threshold. Tissue reactions are largely caused by the death or radiation-induced reproductive sterilization of large numbers of cells. Normally there is a latent period between radiation exposure and the appearance of visible effects. Clinical expression of radiation effects is not evident until these cells unsuccessfully attempt division or differentiation. Skin burn and cataract development are examples of tissue reactions.

- Stochastic effects, including cancer and hereditary effects, are caused by a mutation or other permanent changes in which the cell remains viable. Although the severity of the response observed in the stochastic effect is not dependent upon the radiation dosage threshold, the probability of stochastic effect increases with an increase in radiation dosage. There is a variable latency period between the radiation exposure and development of carcinoma, but the latent period extends up to a decade or two in most cases.

**Radiation Exposure Monitoring**

Lif TLD badges or rings are used to quantify the absorbed radiation dose that a health care worker acquires while performing diagnostic or therapeutic procedures that require radiation use. Lif crystals store radiation energy. At the end of the monitoring period, these badges or rings are melted, and energy stored is released as visible light, which allows the determination of radiation exposure. These badges are able enough to detect radiation exposure of as low as 1 mrem. International Council on Radiation Protection (ICRP) recommends wearing two personal dosimeters in the interventional lab. One is worn at the neck or left shoulder level outside the apron, while the other is at the waist level inside the apron.

- Effective dose = 0.025 H (Neck) + 0.5 H (Waist)

Although effective dose value, derived from dosimeter readings, overestimates absorbed radiation dose by 100 times yet, due to health risks associated with radiation exposure, itâ€™s still recommended to calculate it.

**Occupational Dose Limitation**

International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) provides guidelines regarding the health and safety aspects of ionizing radiation exposure in relevance to patients and healthcare providers.

**Pregnancy**

During pregnancy, radiation exposure poses an extra risk to the fetus due to its teratogenic potential, especially if exposure occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy. For this purpose, health care workers at risk of radiation exposure should notify hospital authorities, and a dosimeter badge should be worn under the lead apron at the waist level at all times to monitor radiation exposure. Readings from the dosimeter should be checked periodically. ICRP provides a strict guideline regarding radiation exposure control and recommends that radiation exposure to a fetus should not exceed greater than 1 mSv during the whole pregnancy. The NCRP recommends limiting occupational radiation exposure of the fetus as low as reasonably achievable but no more than 5 mSv during the entire pregnancy and 0.5 mSv per month of the pregnancy.
