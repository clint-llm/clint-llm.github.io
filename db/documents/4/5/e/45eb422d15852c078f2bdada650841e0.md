Since the 1950s, ossiculoplasty has been performed in patients with conductive hearing loss associated with ossicular chain disruption, leading to significant improvements in speech, social development, and overall quality of life. However, the rates of air-bone gap closure on audiometry, long-term continuation of postoperative hearing improvement, and overall surgical success have varied.

A myriad of prosthetics and surgical techniques have been described over the last half-century with no overall consensus on the ideal method of treatment. This further highlights the need for additional research to determine the optimal algorithm of hearing habilitation. Healthcare providers that deal with conductive hearing loss and ossicular chain disruption must be well-informed on the etiology of middle ear disease, the anatomy of ear structures, diagnostic practices, chronic ear management, surgical repair techniques, postoperative care, and mitigation of complications.
