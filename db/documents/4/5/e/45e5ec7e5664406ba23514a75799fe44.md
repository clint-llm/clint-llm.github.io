Given that pericardial calcification can be an asymptomatic incidental finding, its true prevalence is unknown. However, it is found to be more likely to occur following trauma, purulent pericarditis, and when acute pericarditis or pericardial effusions are associated with malignancy and connective tissue diseases.

For idiopathic and viral constrictive pericarditis, an incidence of 0.76 cases per 1000 person-years has been reported in a series of 500 consecutive patients; this contrasts with the connective tissue disease, neoplasms, tuberculosis, and purulent CP in which the incidence was noted to be 4.40, 6.33, 31.65, and 52.74 cases per 1000 person-years, respectively.

Tuberculous pericarditis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is found in approximately 1% of all autopsied cases of TB and 1 to 2% of instances of pulmonary TB. Most constrictive tuberculosis caused by TB is subacute so calcifications of the pericardium are rare.

A study by Ling et al. suggests that calcified CP is more common in males.
