The cause of constipation is multifactorial. The problem may arise in the colon or rectum or it may be due to an external cause. In most people, slow colonic motility that occurs after years of laxative abuse is the problem. In a few patients, the cause may be related to an outlet obstruction like rectal prolapse or a rectocele. External causes of constipation may include poor dietary habits, lack of fluid intake, overuse of certain medications, an endocrine problem like hypothyroidism or some type of an emotional issue.

Factors involved in constipation include:

- low fiber diet

- Caffeine abuse

- Overuse of alcohol

- Medications

- Endocrine disorders (hypothyroid)

- Neurologic disease (neuropathy)

- Psychological issues
