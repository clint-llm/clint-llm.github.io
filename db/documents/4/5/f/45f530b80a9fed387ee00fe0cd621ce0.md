Candida albicans is the most common cause of candidemia, representing 35% to 60% of isolates. Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata and Candida krusei, are the most common nonalbicans Candida species identified in cultures. glabrata and C. krusei are frequently resistant to the azole antifungals.

C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. glabrata are the more virulent species, and infections with them represent a higher risk of mortality.
