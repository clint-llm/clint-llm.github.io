The management of a patient with pruritus gravidarum requires an interprofessional team consisting of an obstetrician, dermatologist, hepatologist, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, and the nursing team. The management team must focus on making the patient as comfortable as possible while monitoring the fetus of any complications. The patient should be counseled appropriately regarding the complications of the disease. Patient preferences for delivery and management options should be discussed beforehand and considered appropriately while making management decisions.
