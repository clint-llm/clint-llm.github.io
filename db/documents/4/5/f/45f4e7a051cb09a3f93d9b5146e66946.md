Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an intrinsically multidrug-resistant bacteria that usually infects patients with weak immunity. It is often uneasy about treating, given the limited options of antibiotics that can work against it. Always seek your physician’s help to answer any questions about this infection since information about it is not readily available to the public. Patients should mention to their provider if they have allergies to the antibiotic co-trimoxazole since it is usually involved in the treatment.
