Coronary arteriovenous fistula can pose a  diagnostic challenge. The patients may present with shortness of breath and chest pain and exhibit signs of heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. The condition can also mimic other diseases like patent ductus arteriosus. While the physical exam may reveal some clues, the underlying cause is difficult to know without proper diagnostic studies. The condition can be first encountered by a pediatrician, primary care physician, or a hospitalist. It is essential to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a general cardiologist, interventional cardiologist, radiologist, and cardiothoracic surgeon. The nurses are vital members of the interprofessional group as they will monitor the patient's vital signs and assist with the education of the patient and family. The pharmacist will ensure that the patient is on the right medications. The radiologist plays a vital role in determining the cause by CT or MRI.

Overall, to improve patient outcomes, prompt consultation with interprofessional group specialists and care coordination between physicians, nurses, and pharmacists is vital.
