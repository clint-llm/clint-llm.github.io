Menstrual-related headaches (MRH) are a common class of headaches that occur in women related to a decline in estrogen during the menstrual cycle. To treat this type of headache, it must be appropriately diagnosed in relation to the menstrual cycle or aligned with exogenous hormones, usually two days before the onset of menses to the third day of menstrual bleeding. Triptans, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and hormone therapy are just a few of the many pharmacological interventions used in the management and treatment of menstrual-related headaches.
