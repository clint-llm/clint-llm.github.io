A brief review of embryology will assist greatly in the understanding of the formation of the lesser sac as well as the foramen of Winslow. The embryonic foregut is suspended from the abdominal wall by both a ventral and dorsal mesentery. The liver forms within the ventral mesentery. The portion of the ventral mesentery between liver and abdominal wall persists in the mature fetus as the falciform ligament, and the portion of ventral mesentery between stomach and liver persists in the mature fetus as the lesser omentum. The lesser omentum includes the hepatogastric and hepatoduodenal ligaments. That portion of dorsal mesentery attached to the stomach persists in the mature fetus as the greater omentum. With the first 90 degrees of intestinal rotation, the stomach comes to lie on its right side, bringing with it the lesser omentum. Thus the right side of the stomach and the lesser omentum come to lie against the posterior abdominal wall but do not fuse with it. The space posterior to the stomach becomes the lesser sac. The midgut then rotates counterclockwise an additional 180 degrees, pivoting around the axis of the superior mesenteric artery. In the process, the third portion of the duodenum is draped transversely across the peritoneal cavity, from right to left, posterior to the superior mesenteric artery. This portion of the duodenum, along with the pancreas, becomes secondarily retroperitoneal and forms the posterior wall of the lesser sac. The transverse colon is similarly draped transversely across the peritoneal cavity but lies anterior to the superior mesenteric artery. The greater omentum then becomes attached to the transverse colon, and the separation of lesser sac from the greater peritoneal cavity becomes complete except for the small window at the free distal margin of the hepatoduodenal ligament, the foramen of Winslow.
