There is inflammation of sub-epithelial structures and dysregulated repair in response to injury from inhalational toxins or autoimmune responses, leading to fibroproliferation and abnormal regeneration of epithelium of the small airways. Histopathology classically demonstrates the involvement of terminal and respiratory bronchioles (distal small airways) but without significant changes in alveolar spaces and distal lung parenchyma. Hypertrophy of the smooth muscles of the bronchioles, peribronchiolar inflammatory infiltrates, accumulation of mucus in the bronchiolar lumen, and bronchiolar scarring can be noted in bronchiolitis obliterans.

In lung transplantation, microvascular insufficiency and alloimmune responses to the transplanted lung may result in airway injury and the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Episodes of acute cellular rejection, HLA antibodies, and gastroesophageal reflux disease with microaspiration have been shown to increase the risk of developing bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after transplantation.

In bronchiolitis obliterans associated with paraneoplastic pemphigus, autoantibodies against desmoglein and plakin protein are found in both cutaneous and respiratory epithelium have been implicated.
