The nasopalatine (or sphenopalatine) artery is a branch of the internal maxillary artery that enters the nasal cavity via the sphenopalatine foramen to supply the frontal, maxillary, ethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses. One branch descends into the incisive canal to anastomose with the descending palatine artery, entering the nasopalatine canal with the nasopalatine nerve.

The veins of the palate are diffuse and variable. The primary vessel draining this region is the facial vein which courses from the medial canthus, behind the facial artery, to join with the retromandibular vein below the mandible; this union is sometimes termed the common facial vein. Venous drainage of the hard palate is via the pterygoid plexus of veins in the infratemporal fossa, while the soft palate drains via the pharyngeal venous plexus.

Lymphatics from the palate generally terminate in the jugulodigastric nodes. The drainage of the palatal gingivae varies, as sometimes it occurs directly via the jugulodigastric nodes and sometimes indirectly via the submandibular nodes. Posterior soft palate lymphatics drain into the pharyngeal lymph nodes.
