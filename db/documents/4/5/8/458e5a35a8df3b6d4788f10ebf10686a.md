Various studies have found that there may be considerable variability in the stellate ganglion across the population. Only 80% of the population has shown to have a structurally fused inferior cervical and first thoracic ganglion.

In the rest of the cases, the inferior cervical and the first thoracic ganglion do not fuse in the usual manner. The inferior cervical ganglion has the designation as the stellate ganglion, which wouldÂ usually be located anteriorly to the transverse process of the C7 cervical vertebrae.
