Any patient presenting for routine ophthalmic examination may have an underlying refractive error. It is the duty of the examining ophthalmologist or the optometrist to determine the underlying refractive error and treat them correctly. The patient may be advised to use contact lenses or spectacles based on the need. Correction of refractive error in the pediatric age group is critical to prevent amblyopia.
