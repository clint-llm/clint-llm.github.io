DFSP is poorly circumscribed and usually involves dermis and subcutis. Rare cases can be limited to the dermis. DFSP is considered an intermediate tumor between a benign dermatofibroma and a frank fibrosarcoma due to the possibility of having distant metastasis and aggressive local invasion. Transformation to a high-grade sarcoma is extremely rare.

The overlying epidermis does not show any atypical histological features, but macroscopically the skin appears greyish or lightly pigmented.

Tumor cells are arranged in a storiform or intersecting pattern, parallel to the epidermal surface. DFSP is constituted by spindle cells with little pleomorphism and scant cytoplasm. Mitoses are present, but there is no striking mitotic activity, and atypical mitosis is rare. A mitotic count that reaches 10/10 HPF and tumor size correlates with metastatic spread

All DFSP show a recurrent translocation: t(17;22)(q22;q13) resulting in COL1A1-PDGFB fusion. This constitutively activates the tyrosine kinase PDGF-B receptor and leads to altered cell cycle control and tumor spread.

**Differential diagnosis**of DFSP include:

- Cellular fibrous histiocytoma/dermatofibroma, negative for CD34 and positive for FXIIIa;

- Solitary fibrous tumor: CD34 and STAT-6 positive, has a typical NAB2-STAT6 gene fusion;

- Spindle cell lipoma: S100 positive

- Angiosarcoma: positive for CD31 and ERG

- Peripheral nerve sheath tumors that express S100, SOX-10, GFAP;

- Spindle cell melanoma that expresses S100, MART1/MELANA

- Angiomyxoma,

- Myxoid sarcoma

- Synovial sarcoma is rarely positive for CD34 but is positive for TLE1 and EMA.

- Sarcomatoid carcinoma: pleomorphic variant of undifferentiated carcinomas and is CD34-negative, keratin-positive.
