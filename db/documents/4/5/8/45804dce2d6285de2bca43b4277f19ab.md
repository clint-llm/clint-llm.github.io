Acne fulminans or acne maligna is a rare skin disorder presenting as an acute, painful, ulcerating, and hemorrhagic clinical form of acne. It may or may not be associated with systemic symptoms such as fever and polyarthritis. Acne fulminans also may cause bone lesions and laboratory abnormalities. Acne fulminans often is confused with acne conglobata. The condition usually is resistant to the usual acne antibiotics.
