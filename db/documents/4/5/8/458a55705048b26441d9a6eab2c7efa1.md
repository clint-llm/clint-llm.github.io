Treatment and management of malar rash are different based on the condition which causes it. In general, patients with cellulitis, erysipelas, and pellagra will improve with proper treatment. Patients with rosacea might have a course of remission and relapse, and multiple dermatology follows up might be needed. Patients with SLE and dermatomyositis diseases need rheumatology to follow up.
