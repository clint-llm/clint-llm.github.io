Rattlesnakes are found throughout the Americas and include snakes in the genera Crotalus and Sistrurus. They are also known as pit vipers, lanceheads, and Asian pit vipers (genus Trimeresurus). Their primary defense mechanism is to hide, and then rattle and hiss which are meant to scare predators away. When they are further challenged, they bite and envenomate with potentially deadly effects. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and presentation of rattlesnake bites and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of rattle snake toxin.
- Review the presentation of a patient with rattle snake bite.
- Summarize the treatment options for rattle snake bite.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by rattle snake bite.
