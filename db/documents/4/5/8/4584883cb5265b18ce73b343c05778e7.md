The normal aortic valve is one of two semilunar valves and separates the left ventricle from the aorta.  It is comprised of three leaflets/cusps (left coronary, right coronary and non-coronary cusp) that are attached to an aortic annulus normally opening to approximately 3-5 cm².  Transthoracic echocardiography is typically used to evaluate the aortic valve, however additional imaging modalities including transesophageal echocardiography and CT are also commonly used. An aortic valve is considered severely stenotic when it opens to an area of ≤1.0 cm². High gradient AS is the most common form of severe AS and is defined by the mean gradient of ≥40 mmHg and an aortic jet velocity of >4 m/s across the valve. Low flow, low gradient severe AS is a less common form of severe AS. This subset of patients has low flow rate across the valve either due to systolic dysfunction with reduced ejection fraction or small ventricular volumes secondary to left ventricular hypertrophy (with normal LVEF). When LVEF is normal, low flow is defined as a stroke volume index =35 mL/m². Patients with low flow and depressed LVEF undergo dobutamine stress echocardiogram to differentiate true severe stenosis from pseudostenosis (inadequate valve cusp opening caused by low cardiac output causing an artefactually low value).
