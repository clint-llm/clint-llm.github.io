Treatment and management should focus on specific patient complaints, gestational age, and if the patient is hemodynamically stable or unstable. Depending on the severity of the patientâ€™s complaint (which is commonly vaginal bleeding in the setting of a subchorionic hemorrhage), treatment should be rapidly initiated.

Some sources suggest vaginal progesterone supplementation for patients with vaginal bleeding in the first trimester; however, this has not been shown to increase live birth rates, and its routine use is not recommended.
