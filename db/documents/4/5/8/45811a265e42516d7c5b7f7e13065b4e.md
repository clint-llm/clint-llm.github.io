Golimumab is FDA approved for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), ulcerative colitis (UC), and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pcJIA). It is a human monoclonal antibody tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) blocker, binding human TNF-a soluble and transmembrane structures and blocking its binding with the respective TNF-a receptors. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors pertinent to interprofessional team members in the management of patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PA), ulcerative colitis (UC), and polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pcJIA) that is unresponsive to first-line therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of golimumab.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of golimumab.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for patients receiving golimumab.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance golimumab use in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), ulcerative colitis (UC), and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pcJIA) and improve outcomes.
