Zonisamide is a sulfonamide antiepileptic drug that is a 1,2 benzisoxazole derivative and is the first compound from this group of chemicals to be used as an antiepileptic drug. It is chemically unrelated to other antiepileptic medications.

**Antiepileptic Uses**

- It was FDA-approved in the United States in 2000 for use as adjunctive therapy to treat partial seizures in adults.

- It is not FDA-approved in the United States for use in children, but clinical studies have shown efficacy and benefits.

- Small clinical studies have indicated that zonisamide is effective for other types of epilepsy and epilepsy syndromes like infantile spasms, progressive myoclonus epilepsy, Lennox- Gastaut syndrome, simple partial seizures, complex partial seizures, and myoclonic seizures.

Only a few clinical trials have evaluated the use of zonisamide as monotherapy for the treatment of epilepsy.

**Nonepileptic Uses**

- There have been clinical trials for zonisamide use and benefits in patients with mania and acute psychotic conditions.

- It also has shown efficacy in patients with neuropathic pain.

- Some studies report improvement in Parkinson disease symptoms when added to their other medications.

- Studies suggest zonisamide may be as effective as propranolol in patients with head tremors or essential tremors.
