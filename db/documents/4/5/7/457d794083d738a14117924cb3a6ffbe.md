Renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are considered the most prevalent benign renal tumor. Renal AMLs are generally composed of blood vessels, smooth muscles, and adipose tissues. Although most of these tumors are found incidentally on radiological imaging, symptomatic presentations such as flank pain, gross hematuria, or severe retroperitoneal hemorrhage may also exist. Imaging plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of these tumors. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, complications, and prognosis of renal angiomyolipomas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of renal angiomyolipoma.
- Review the evaluation of a renal angiomyolipoma.
- Summarize the treatment of a renal angiomyolipoma.
- Outline the complications associated with renal angiomyolipoma.
