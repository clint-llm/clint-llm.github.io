CNS-TB is a rare form of tuberculosis but has a devastating impact on the quantity and quality of life. Screening for active infected cases in the community in the high TB burden settings may also prevent CNS-TB. Once diagnosed, treatment adherence is a significant predictor of treatment outcomes. Most countries have national policies in place, but global evidence-based approaches to CNS-TB care need to be fully adopted for optimal patient care and support.

CNS-TB involves holistic and integrated team care to improve patient outcomes. Each team member, including the treating clinician, infectious disease specialist, neuroradiologist, neurologist, neurosurgeon and ophthalmologist, nurse, and pharmacist, has their individual and collaborative responsibility. The nurse is essential for overall patient care, and the pharmacist is critical for dispensing and ensuring compliance with treatment.

The entire team must communicate and collaborate for shared decision-making to minimize complications and hasten recovery in these critically ill patients.

To summarise, evidence-based guidelines for managing pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB are released by most countries. However, they often cannot consider the unique and compelling circumstances of every patient, region, and healthcare setting. Therefore, clinical decisions have to be individualized on case to case basis.
