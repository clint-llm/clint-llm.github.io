Radial forearm tissue transfer cannot be considered a reconstructive option for patients who do not show reliable Allen test results of adequate collateral ulnar perfusion to the distal digits when the radial artery is occluded. This test should be repeated up to three times to ensure adequate collateral perfusion. Relative contraindications also include evidence of past surgery or injury to the donor arm.

Specifically concerning osteocutaneous tissue transfer of the radius, it is not recommended that this bone be used when endosseous dental implants are being considered for the patient. This limitation is due to the recommended 40% of the radial diameter that should be harvested, as larger bone harvests significantly increase the risk of pathologic radius fractures.
