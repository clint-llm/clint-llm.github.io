The medial rectus receives blood through the inferior muscular branch of the ophthalmic artery. The primary blood supply for all of the extraocular muscles are the muscular branches of the ophthalmic artery. The two branches are the inferior muscular branch and the superior muscular branch. The larger inferior muscular branch supplies the medial rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique. The superior muscular branch supplies the lateral rectus, superior rectus, superior oblique and levator palpebrae superioris. Additionally, the lateral rectus muscle receives some blood supply from the lacrimal artery.

Venous drainage is similar to the arterial system and empties into the superior and inferior orbital veins. Usually, there are a total of four vortex veins, and these are found at the lateral and medial sides of the superior and inferior rectus muscles.
