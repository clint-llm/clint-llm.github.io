Patients with Chiari I malformation are asymptomatic. The most common symptom, however, in both the adult and child, is pain or headache in the occipital/cervical region (neck pain)

It should be noted that the headache produced in Chiari I is often exacerbated with the Valsalva maneuver due to the reduced size of the foramen magnum. This should be differentiated from chronic headaches that do not vary with the Valsalva maneuver, which may be attributed to pathologies other than Chiari I, for example, intracranial hypertension.

Apart from headache and pain, a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations may characterize the malformation. In particular, signs and symptoms are mainly due to direct brainstem compression that may cause autonomic dysfunction.

- Syncopal episodes and sinus bradycardia due to autonomic dysfunction

- Swallowing alterations and vomiting

- Balance difficulties with an unsteady gait

- Problems in hand coordination

- Sensorial manifestations such as numbness and tingling, in the extremities

- Dizziness

- Tinnitus

- Progressive muscular weakness in the arms and legs is seen, and stiffness in the back, shoulders, arms, or legs, represent clinical manifestations of syringomyelia. Acute paraparesis has been described as case reports. Syringobulbia can produce weakness in the facial muscles.

- Bladder and bowel problems can be the result of syrinx-induced compressive effects.

- Scoliosis, particularly in pediatric patients. Although scoliosis is due to syringomyelia, recent studies suggest that there is no association of syrinx length and holocord syrinx with scoliosis.

- Nystagmus may also manifest in Chiari I with syringobulbia; however, this is a less specific sign.

Adults and children may present with Chiari I differently. For example, pediatric patients are increasingly likely to present with brainstem dysfunction, sleep apnea, or feeding difficulty.
