Several physiologic changes occur within the body during diving that can predispose a patient to cardiac events. Most evident, SCUBA diving causes an increase in metabolic oxygen consumption from the muscular contraction required to swim while carrying the necessaryÂ gear.

The other primary concern when assessing fitness to dive is the risk for decompression sickness (DCS). While resurfacing from diving, the ambient pressure exerted on the gases inhaled while underwater decreases. Consequently, the inert gasses (primarily nitrogen) can expand and form micro-bubbles in the blood. Typically, these bubbles can be exhaled through gas exchange at the lungs. However, if ascent is too rapid, the micro-bubbles can form in the other tissues of the body. There are two recognized forms: minor and major. The minor type which affects primarily the musculoskeletal system and is characterized by joint pain, itching, and skin changes. The major type is typified by neurological symptoms such as altered mental status, vertigo, confusions, and vision abnormalities.

In general, it has been shown that the most effective tool for assessing cardiovascular risk is a well-designed questionnaire as physical examination is unlikely to identify abnormalities that preclude diving.
