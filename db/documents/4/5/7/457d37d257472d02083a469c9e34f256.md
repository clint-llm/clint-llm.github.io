There is no question that 24-hour urine for nephrolithiasis prevention analysis is considered the "standard of care" by many national experts and professional organizations. It can find and identify kidney stone chemical risk factors that are amenable to dietary or medical therapy and may have other medical or health-related benefits. It avoids preventable complications, pain, and surgeries. Future stone production can be reduced by 90% or more. It can identify underlying medical problems not easily diagnosed by any other means, such as hypercalciuria, renal tubular acidosis, renal phosphate leak, cystinuria, hyperoxaluria, and hypocitraturia. Such testing can be kidney-saving or life-saving in some patients with potential medical/legal implications. Finally, testing, interpretation, and treatment selection can be greatly simplified, making it easy to perform and interpret in any medical practice by using the previously presented guidelines. Clinicians and nurses should work together with laboratory technicians to obtain quality specimens and accurate results.
