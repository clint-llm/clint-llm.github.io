The visual prognosis in optic atrophy depends upon the extent of axonal loss. In partial optic atrophy, the visual impairment would be mild to moderate. However, in total optic atrophy, the prognosis is poor. Early and intensive treatment in conditions such as optic neuritis, toxic and nutritional situations may lead to nearly complete recovery.
