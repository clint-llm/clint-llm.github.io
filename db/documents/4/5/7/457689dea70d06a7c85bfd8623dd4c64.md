The main pancreatic duct connects to the common bile duct and drains at the ampulla of Vater (hepato-pancreatic ampulla), controlled by the sphincter of Oddi. The major duodenal papilla is the opening of the ampulla of Vater into the second part of the duodenum. The common bile duct and the pancreatic duct may remain separate or merge at the end of the papilla, or they may form a common duct.

In 10% of the population, a normal anatomic variant happens, called pancreas divisum, where the major pancreatic duct (duct of Wirsung) and the lesser pancreatic duct (duct of Santorini) do not fuse, and the minor duodenal papilla would be the main way for drainage of the pancreas. The minor duodenal papilla is about 2 cm proximal to the ampulla of Vater and may have a sphincter, known as the sphincter of Helly.
