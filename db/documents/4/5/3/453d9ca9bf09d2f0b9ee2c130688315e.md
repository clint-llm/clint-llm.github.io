It has taken several decades of study to elucidate the precise pathophysiologic basis of Heyde syndrome. The development of the syndrome involves insult at the level of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and hematologic systems. In 1986, Gill et al. discovered that patients with congenital cardiac defects who had developed AVWS had abnormal blood clotting times, which suggested a causal relationship between cardiac dysfunction, changes to von Willebrand factor (VWF) and disorders of hemostasis.
