Apart from the causes listed above for astigmatism, the exact cause of spontaneous astigmatism is not clearly understood. Recent research indicates that genetic factors play an essential role in the development of astigmatism.

Other factors contributing to astigmatism include pressure from the lids, extraocular muscle tension, and visual feedback. The likely interaction between eyelid and cornea is a logical explanation for increased astigmatism between various groups. In children also, eyelid pressure influences the axis and degree of astigmatism. With the growing improvement of technology, the ability to measure and define ocular astigmatism has improved.
