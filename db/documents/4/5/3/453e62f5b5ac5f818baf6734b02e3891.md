Prolonged discomfort due to delayed diagnosis and treatment is the leading complication of perianal streptococcal dermatitis. There are also extremely rare cases, such as proctitis and abscess formation, caused by concurrent PSD. A prolonged disease course also increases the risk of bacterial transmission to close contacts, particularly siblings and parents. Rheumatic fever is a theoretical complication of PSD. However, there are no case reports published describing this sequela. Cellulitis caused by GABHS, including PSD, can cause post-streptococcal nephritis. Therefore, follow-up urinalysis is essential to monitor kidney function.
