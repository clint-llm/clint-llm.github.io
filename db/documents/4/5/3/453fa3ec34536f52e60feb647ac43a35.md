As already mentioned, the accommodation reflex involves several different components of the central and peripheral nervous system. Unlike the pupillary light reflex, this requires the participation of visual association cortex and the cerebellum in addition to the parasympathetic nervous system.

The stimulus for accommodation reflex is either an 'out of focus' or blurred retinal image or conscious visual fixation on a near object. A The afferent limb of the reflex involves optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tract, the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and the visual cortex including the primary visual and visual association areas in the occipital lobe.

The efferent limb includes the Edinger Westphal nucleus and the oculomotor neurons. The Edinger Westphal nucleus in the midbrain is the parasympathetic preganglionic nucleus. It sends its axons through the oculomotor nerve to the ciliary ganglion and short ciliary nerve to control the pupil sphincter, ciliary muscles of the eye. The efferent fibers from the medial rectus subnucleus of the oculomotor complex innervate the medial rectus muscles, resulting in the convergence of the eyes.
