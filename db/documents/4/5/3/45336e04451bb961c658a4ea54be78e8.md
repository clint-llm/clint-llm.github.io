The etiology of Alcoholic ketoacidosis stems from the patient's inability to ingest, absorb and utilize glucose from their diet. The vomiting and nausea prevent adequate solute intake from the gastrointestinal tract. The alcohol further depresses gluconeogenesis in the body and keeps blood sugar levels low. An anxiety state and alcohol withdrawal further exacerbate the patient's ability to eat. The lack of nutrients other than alcohol causes the formation of ketones and elevated gap ketoacidosis in the absence of diabetes.
