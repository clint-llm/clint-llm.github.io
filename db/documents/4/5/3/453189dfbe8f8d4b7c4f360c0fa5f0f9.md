The pathophysiology of anemia varies greatly depending on the primary cause. For instance, in acute hemorrhagic anemia, it is the restoration of blood volume with intracellular and extracellular fluid that dilutes the remaining red blood cells (RBCs), which results in anemia. A proportionate reduction in both plasma and red cells results in falsely normal hemoglobin and hematocrit.

RBC are produced in the bone marrow and released into circulation. Approximately 1% of RBC are removed from circulation per day. Imbalance in production to removal or destruction of RBC leads to anemia.

The main mechanisms involved in anemia are listed below:

1. Increased RBC destruction

- Blood loss

- Acute- hemorrhage, surgery, trauma, menorrhagia
- Chronic- heavy menstrual bleeding, chronic gastrointestinal blood losses

- Hemolytic anemia

- Acquired- immune-mediated, infection, microangiopathic, blood transfusion-related, and secondary to hypersplenism
- Hereditary- enzymopathies, disorders of hemoglobin (sickle cell), defects in red blood cell metabolism (G6PD deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency), defects in red blood cell membrane production (hereditary spherocytosis and elliptocytosis)

2. Deficient/defective erythropoiesis

- Microcytic

- Normocytic, normochromic

- Macrocytic
