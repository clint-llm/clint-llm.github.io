Intrathecal delivery system implantation is typically performed primarily by neurosurgeons, interventional pain management physicians, and orthopedic spine specialists. Intraoperative personnel may also include a fluoroscopy technician and nurse. Most patients will need to undergo general anesthesia to have their device implanted and therefore an anesthesiology team should be present.
