Serum iron level peaks at 2 to 4 hours post-ingestion, but serum concentrations of enteric-coated or sustained-release formulations are erratic and warrant serial levels. Approximately 10% of ingested iron is absorbed from the intestine and is subsequently bound to transferrin. Normal serum iron levels range from 50 to 150 micrograms/dL, and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) ranges from 300 to 400 micrograms/dL. When iron levels rise after significant ingestion, transferrin becomes saturated. Excess iron will circulate in the blood as free iron, which is directly toxic to target organs.
