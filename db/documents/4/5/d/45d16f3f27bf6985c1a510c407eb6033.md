Current developments in oral cancer research have steered to the development and expansion of potentially valuable diagnostic tools at the clinical and micromolecular levels for the timely detection of leukoplakia. The gold standard for diagnosis of leukoplakia is always a biopsy from the site of the lesion, but this procedure needs a qualified health-care provider and is considered as an invasive, painful, expensive, and time-consuming procedure. In the case of small lesions, excisional biopsy is indicated, and in large lesions, incisional biopsy, including the adjacent healthy tissue, is removed for histopathological examination.

The main histopathological changes seen are:

- Keratinization of the epithelium (hyper ortho-keratinization or hyper para-keratinization)

- Increased thickness of the epithelium

- Acanthosis

- Basement membrane becomes thin

- The inflammatory component in connective tissue

- Change in the cellular layer

- Increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio

- Hyperchromatic nuclei

- Nuclear hyperplasia

- Abnormal mitotic figures

- Increased mitosis

- Pleomorphic nuclei

- Basilar hyperplasia

- Drop-shaped rete pegs

- Loss of polarity

Other conventional clinical diagnostic tools for timely detection of leukoplakia include toluidine blue dye, oral brush biopsy kits, and salivary diagnostics and optical imaging systems. In recent years, a few new easy-to-use light sources and chairside diagnostic instruments have been advertised to dentists.
