Hepatic and renal toxicity was reported during clinical trials with givosiran. 15% of subjects receiving therapy reported ALT elevations three times above the normal range. 15% of subjects reported elevated serum creatinine levels and reductions in eGFR with a median elevation in creatinine of 0.07 mg/dL at three months. Continuing therapy should be determined based on the severity of laboratory alterations and clinical symptoms.

**Pregnancy**

Data on using patisiran and lumasiran therapy during pregnancy has not been reported. A reduction in vitamin A levels is recognized with patisiran use, which is a crucial component of normal embryo maturation and fetal development. An excess in vitamin A levels correlates with adverse effects on the fetus.

Although givosiran has not been studied in humans during pregnancy, animals reproduction analyses demonstrated unfavorable developmental effects during organogenesis. Givosiran during pregnancy should be assessed, weighing the advantages and dangers to the mother and probable impacts on the developing fetus.Â Inclisiran therapy is recommended to be discontinued during pregnancy. It is reported that the agent's mechanism of action for decreasing cholesterol and additional potential biologically active substances may result in harm to the developing fetus.
