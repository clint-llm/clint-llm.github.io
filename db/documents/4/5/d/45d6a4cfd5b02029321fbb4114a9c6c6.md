Complications from pancreatitis and malignancy occur when the etiology of pancreatic panniculitis is not properly investigated, as pancreatic panniculitis can precede any common signs of pancreatitis or pancreatic neoplasm.

Rarely lipase hypersecretion syndrome (LHS), a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, can reduce survival to less than one year.

In one published case of PPP presenting with panniculitis and rapidly declining renal function, osteonecrosis of multiple joints, kidney basement membrane necrosis with the glomerular crescent formation, and fat necrosis with calcifications were found in gastric submucosa and bone marrow on autopsy after in-hospital death.
