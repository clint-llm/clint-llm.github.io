Given the complexity of care required in treating this condition, an interprofessional healthcare team, including primary clinicians, pulmonologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgical oncologists, and palliative care, is needed. Nurses, pharmacists, and respiratory and physical therapists round out the care team. Strong collaboration and communication within the interprofessional team, along with meticulous record keeping allowing all care team members access to the most accurate and updated patient information, are vital to improving outcomes.

While clinicians will direct the overall direction of the case, with other specialties working in their particular discipline. Nurses will play a pivotal role in helping with patient assessment, assisting in surgery and providing post-surgical care, administering chemotherapy, and offering patient counsel. An oncology-specialized pharmacist should oversee all chemotherapy regimens and can also check for drug interactions, answer clinician and patient questions about the drugs, and help monitor the patient's progress. All interprofessional team members must be open to communication from the rest of the team and report any concerns to everyone involved in patient care.
