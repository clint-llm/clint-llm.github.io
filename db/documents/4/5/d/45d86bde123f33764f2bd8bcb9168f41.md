The differential diagnosis for acute PNIs includes:

- Spinal radiculopathy

- Spinal cord injury

- Peripheral neuropathy

- Stroke or brain injury

- Musculoskeletal or vascular injury

- Peripheral nerve tumors

Supplemented by a solid knowledge of central/peripheral nervous system anatomy and physiology, a good history and physical exam are crucial for ruling out other differential diagnoses. Further investigations with imaging and/or electrodiagnostic tests can help confirm the diagnosis.
