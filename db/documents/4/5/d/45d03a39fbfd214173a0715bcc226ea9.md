The most common conditions associated with RICAD are breast cancer (BC) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).

Younger age at the time of RT exposure is associated with increased risk for RICAD, with a study on patients receiving RT for HL showing the highest relative risk of RICAD in patientsÂ under 25 years of age at the time of exposure.
