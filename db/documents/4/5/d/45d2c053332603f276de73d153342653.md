Due to trazodone's hepatic and renal metabolism, special care is necessary for patients with severe hepatic impairment and severe renal impairment. Serotonin syndrome, while rare, is potentially life-threatening, presenting as a triad of mental status alteration, neuromuscular abnormality, and autonomic instability. Initial clinical suspicion varies from presenting tremor, clonus, or akathisia. The first step to address this should be discontinuation of serotonergic agents, hydration, and control of agitation with anxiolytics. The risk is higher with certain antidepressants, antibiotics, migraine medications, antiemetics, and analgesics. The idiopathic drug-induced liver injury may result from trazodone administration. The timeframe typically is three months, but reported cases require liver transplantation.

Trazodone overdose can precipitate arrhythmias, respiratory arrest, coma, and priapism. Treatment is usually symptomatic and supportive in the case of hypotension and excessive sedation. If priapism occurs, it requires urgent urologist interventuon. Intracavernosal injection (phenylephrine injection) is indicated in patients with ischemic priapism. The medical team should call the local poison center for up-to-date guidance on trazodone overdose.
