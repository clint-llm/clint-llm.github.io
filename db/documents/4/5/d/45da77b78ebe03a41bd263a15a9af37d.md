Methamphetamine promotes the release of monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine within central (CNS) and peripheral nerve endings. It also blocks re-uptake of dopamine similar to cocaine, and it may act as a false transmitter. This explains its euphoric effects in the CNS and sympathomimetic effects such as tachycardia and hypertension.
