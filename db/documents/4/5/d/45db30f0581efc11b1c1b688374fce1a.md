CCTA provides another tool in the diagnosticianâ€™s armamentarium to discover and manage cardiovascular disease. As a diagnostic modality, CCTA avoids the risks associated with invasive coronary angiography, while also providing a cost-effective, timely, and accurate means of quantifying CAD. Non-contrast portions of the CCTA study can also yield prognostic information, while post-processing techniques such as three-dimensional volumetric formatting can provide insight into the cardiac anatomy. Risks of CCTA include radiation and contrast exposure, but continued refinements of CT technology will likely mitigate these shortcomings in future.
