Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity.

When considering other pathologies such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), MV can be both non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or invasive-mechanical ventilation (IMV), of which the former has shown a better prognosis. Although NIV has proven to reduce mortality by half compared to IMV, quarter to half of that population eventually requires IMV over time.**.**

Hypercapnia is permissible to an extent as it enables the lungs for better healing by reducing inflammation. Hypercapnia becomes problematic with its action in the brain and heart - increasing intracranial pressure (in those with an already high value) and reducing cardiac output (in those with low cardiac function), respectively. Hypercapnoeic failure is one of the common reasons for patient ineligibility for lung transplants. Bridging patients through this phase with the use of ECCO2R has demonstrated promising results.
