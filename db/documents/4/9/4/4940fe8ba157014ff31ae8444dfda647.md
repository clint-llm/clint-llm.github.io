Lung cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer in the United States. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women, accounting for approximately a quarter of all cancer deaths. Lung cancer is histologically divided into 2 main types: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC comprises about 15% of lung cancer while NSCLC comprises approximately 85%. Since the late 1980s, there has been a decline in the incidence of lung cancer coincident with a decline in smoking, the leading cause of lung cancer. Current treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology and presentation of small cell lung cancer and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of small cell lung cancer.
- Review the staging of small cell lung cancer.
- Summarize the treatment options for small cell lung cancer.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by small cell lung cancer.
