Cystinuria is the most common inheritable cause of kidney stone disease. Worldwide and United States incidence is about 1 in 7,000 population. Prevalence is 1 per 100,000 in Sweden, 1 per 18,000 in Japan, 1 per 4,000 in Australia, 1 per 2,500 in Israel, and 1 per 2,000 in Great Britain and Spain. In cystinuric stone formers, the typical patient makes about one stone every one to two years, has one surgical procedure every three years, and has undergone seven surgeries by the time they are middle-aged.

- Men are affected about twice as often as women. The peak age of presentation of the first cystine stone is 22 years of age, although 22% of cystinuria patients will start making calculi as children.

- The overall risk of some degree of renal injury or failure is high at up to 70%, but end-stage renal failure is relatively low in cystinuria patients at less than 5%.

- Twenty to forty percent of cystinuria patients have other kidney stone-related urinary chemical abnormalities such as hypocitraturia (44%), hypercalciuria (19%), or hyperuricosuria (22%).

- Infrequently, cystinuria is associated with hemophilia, muscular dystrophy, mongolism, hereditary pancreatitis, and retinitis pigmentosa.

- Recurrence rates after surgical intervention approach 45% at three months without prophylactic medical treatment. With treatment, the average recurrence rate drops to 25% at three years.
