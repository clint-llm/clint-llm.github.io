Rifaximin has an excellent safety profile due to its lack of systemic absorption. Clinical trials have shown that adverse effects of rifaximin are similar to or even lower frequency than placebo, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin. Clinical trials did not show any serious adverse events while using rifaximin. There were no deaths while using rifaximin in clinical trials. Rifaximin does not require dose adjustments for hepatic dysfunction.

There are published case reports of rifaximin interacting with warfarin, which resulted in reductions in INR levels. In vivo studies have previously shown that CYP3A4 can be induced by rifaximin, affecting the bioavailability of CYP3A4 substrates. Although these studies have demonstrated that rifaximin can affect CYP3A4 enzyme activity, this would likely never happen in a patient because of the minimal systemic absorption.

Patients treated with rifaximin may develop adverse drug reactions, including nausea, gastrointestinal upset, fatigue, peripheral edema, dizziness, and muscle spasms. In addition, long-term use has been associated with fungal or bacterial super-infections. There is little evidence that rifaximin causes clinically apparent liver disease or serum enzyme elevations despite widespread use. Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).
