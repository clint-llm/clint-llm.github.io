The anterior or ventral white commissure is a collection of nerve fibers that cross the midline of the spinal cord and transmit information from or to the contralateral side of the brain. It is present throughout the length of the spinal cord and lies behind the anterior median fissure. Among the important pathways that decussate in the spinal cord via the anterior white commissure are the second-order neurons of the spinothalamic tract and the upper motor neurons of the anterior corticospinal tract. These crossing fibers make the anterior white commissure an important link in communication between the brain and the contralateral side of the body for both sensory and motor pathways.
