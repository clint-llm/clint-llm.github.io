Minimal equipment is necessary for lumbar HVLA. A treatment table designed for osteopathic manipulation is helpful, but a standard treatment table is still appropriate for use. The benefits of the osteopathic treatment tables include the ability to adjust the height of the table for the practitioner's preference and a larger area for the patient to lay flat. The typical orientation and location of articulation points on a standard office chair or treatment table may create points of discomfort for patients and limit options with respect to patient positioning.
