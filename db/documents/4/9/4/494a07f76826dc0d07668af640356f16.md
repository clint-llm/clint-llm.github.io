Major risk factors for sialadenitis include reduced salivary secretion and duct obstruction. Hyposecretion of saliva can occur in dehydrated people, postoperative patients, immunocompromised, and undernourished. Medications that decrease salivary flow like antihistaminics, diuretics,beta-blockers can predispose to sialadenitis. Decreased salivary production can occur in patients with a history of radiation to the head and neck region, long-standing xerostomia (e.g., Sjogren syndrome), and those with chronic illness. Salivary duct obstruction is usually due to sialolithiasis, ductal stricture, ductal foreign body, and external compression of the duct.

Other risk factors include old age, poor oral hygiene, postoperative state, intubation, use of anticholinergic agents.Staphylococcus aureus is the most frequently isolated organism. Other bacterias include Streptococcus viridans, Haemophilus influenza, Enterobacteriaceae spp, and anaerobes like Prevotella, Fusobacterium spp, Peptostreptococcus. Viral sialadenitis can result from mumps, parainfluenza, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV.
