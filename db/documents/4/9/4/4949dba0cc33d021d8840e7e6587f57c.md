Anetoderma is a benign skin condition, and once the diagnosis has been made, it is important to identify the type of anetoderma. This helps the patient to understand the disease course and look into treating underlying factors of the secondary type of anetoderma to halt the formation of new lesions. Patients should be educated about the disease, the disease course, and the understanding that once lesions have developed, they do not resolve.
