Interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians, nurses, dieticians, and pharmacists, should know that empirical dispensing of vitamin A is not recommended.  Unless there is a deficiency, patients should not be encouraged to take excess amounts of this vitamin as it is known to cause toxicity. Instead, patients should be urged to eat a healthy diet rather than rely on supplements. All interprofessional team members need to share open access to patient information to prevent vitamin A toxicity and deficiency, recognize signs of both conditions, and intervene appropriately to attain the best patient outcomes.
