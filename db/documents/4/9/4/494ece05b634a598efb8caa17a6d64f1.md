It is generally accepted that HHV-6B is the causal variant responsible for most primary infections while HHV-6A is acquired after HHV-6B, through asymptomatic infection.

HHV-6 infection correlates with more severe diseases including mononucleosis, colitis, myocarditis, and hepatitis, in addition to the documented central nervous system complications of encephalitis and meningoencephalitis. Early recognition and treatment of neurological complications are integral in preventing adverse outcomes. Children and adults that have cancer, who are recipients of allogeneic transplants and those with immunosuppression disorders are at risk for reactivation of HHV-6. In such cases, individuals may present with a fever, rash, and a decrease in circulating granulocytes and erythroid cells.
