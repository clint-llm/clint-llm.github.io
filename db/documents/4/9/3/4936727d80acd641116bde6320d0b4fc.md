Nail-patella syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a heterozygous loss of function mutation of the LMXB1 gene on chromosome 9q34.1.LMXB1 encodes a transcription factor involved in multiple important embryological developments to include limb dorsal-ventral patterning, differentiation of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons, skull patterning, periocular mesenchyme development, and renal podocyte development.LMXB1 mutations have been identified as well as evidence of somatic mosaicism, which is known to occur in unaffected parents of patients affected by autosomal dominant disorders.LMXB1 homeodomain with other genes. The PAX2 transcription factor has been studied for its interaction with LMXB1 as both proteins are involved in renal and eye development.LMXB1 gene homeodomain have been shown to affect interactions with PAX2 raising the question of the latter’s role in the NPS phenotypic variability, although more research would be needed to test this possibility.
