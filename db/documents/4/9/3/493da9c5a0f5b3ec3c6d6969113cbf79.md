Testing for Bence Jones proteinuria is indicated when plasma cell disorders such as multiple myeloma are suspected. Signs and symptoms that may prompt testing include anemia, hypercalcemia, and renal impairment. Bone manifestations such as painful lytic lesions, vertebral crushing, and long bone fractures are also indications. Increased suspicion for disorders such as multiple myeloma may also be prompted by symptoms of hyperviscosity like blurred vision, headaches, and epistaxis, as well as increased susceptibility to infection. Unfortunately, patients will often initially present with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and back pain, which can delay diagnostic testing, such as assessing urine for Bence Jones proteinuria.

At least 60% of patients with classical myeloma have BJP in their urine. More importantly, 20% of patients with multiple myeloma produce only Bence Jones proteins without heavy chains. Excessive secretion of Bence Jones proteins causes acute kidney injury from tubular obstruction and tubulointerstitial inflammation, termed tubular nephropathy. Tubular damage results in Fanconi syndrome with glycosuria, aminoaciduria, phosphaturia, and renal tubular acidosis type 2.

The presence of Bence Jones proteinuria significantly raises suspicion for multiple myeloma and warrants referral to a hematology clinic. Bone marrow aspiration for plasma cells and investigation for BJP are also significant markers of prognosis and disease progression. Plasma cells in multiple myeloma can present in various forms, including a mature, normal plasma cell, demonstrating features of immaturity such as a low cytoplasmic-nuclear ratio or loose chromatin, or present as bizarre “flame cells” with red cytoplasm. Bone marrow in patients with multiple myeloma generally is hypercellular and infiltrated diffusely by plasma cells.

More specifically, changes in the urinary light chain excretion level can assess response to therapy. Direct positive effects on the treatment of multiple myeloma are defined as a reduction to 50% or less of the pretreatment value of urinary M-protein.

Testing for BJP and interpreting its clinical implications is best accomplished by an interprofessional team that includes multiple healthcare professionals, including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician associates, nursing (particularly oncology nurses), and laboratory personnel. [Level V]
