Prognosis is predominantly dependent on the severity of the eliciting event. However, if the patient is otherwise hemodynamically stable and prophylaxis with PPI or histamine blocker is disregarded, life-threatening intestinal hemorrhage may occur, followed by perforation, resultant septic shock, and possible death. If aggressive prophylactic measures for the appropriate patient population at risk of developing stress ulceration are employed, prognosis usually remains favorable in most circumstances.
