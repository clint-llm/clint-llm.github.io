Radial nerve injuries can occur after trauma. Common forms of radial nerve injuries occur with the following:

- After fractures of the humerus, especially spiral fracture patterns along the distal third of the humerus (Holstein-Lewis fracture) with a known associated incidence of radial nerve neuropraxia in the range of 15% to 25%

- Improper use of crutches

- Overuse of the arm (secondary to manual labor, chronic overuse, or sport-related participation)

- Work-related accidents

Radial nerve injuries have distinct presentations and symptoms, depending on the anatomic location and type of injury occurring to the nerve. For example, injuring the radial nerve at the axilla has a different clinical presentation than injuring it at the distal forearm.
