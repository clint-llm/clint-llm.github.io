MAC is a lung pathogen and most commonly affects patients with HIV and those who are immunosuppressed or have malignancies, and is best managed through an interprofessional team approach. The organism typically infects the lung but can affect any other organ in the body at the same time. Besides the infectious disease expert, the nurse and pharmacist need to educate the patient on the importance of drug compliance and the potential adverse effects of therapy. In addition, these patients develop severe wasting and a dietary consult is recommended to ensure that they consume at least 1800 to 2000 calories a day. Patients with MAC need to be educated on the symptoms of anemia and when to seek help. Many require repeated transfusions and hence, an outpatient nurse should follow up on these patients. Since many patients with MAC have low exercise tolerance, a physical therapy program is recommended to increase muscle mass and improve exercise endurance. The pharmacist should educate the patient on compliance with HAART, or the macrolide therapy may not be as effective. Nursing will play a significant part in monitoring treatment effectiveness, as well as being alert for signs of adverse drug events, and inform the clinician team promptly. Finally, patients with MAC need regular X-rays to monitor their disease progression and hence follow up visit with a pulmonologist is recommended.

**Evidence-based Outcomes**

Before the availability of the macrolide antibiotics, the majority of patients who acquired MAC died within 3 to 4 months. By the 1990s, the survival improved to 9 to 12 months. Today, with the availability of HAART and macrolides, many people have a much-improved outcome. However, despite treatment, wasting is common and many patients develop anemia requiring multiple transfusions. In patients without HIV, the course of MAC is somewhat mild with a life expectancy of 50% at 5 years. In patients with HIV, 5-year survival rates of 20 to 70% are reported- this depends on compliance with HAART therapy. Even patients with extensive disease can recover with treatment, but relapse is common. In children, MAC tends to cause lymphadenitis which runs a benign course. Sometimes lymph node rupture and sinus tracts may develop.
