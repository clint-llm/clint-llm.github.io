Like the premalignant cervical lesions and carcinoma of the cervix, continual HPV infection, especially the HPV 16 subtype, is associated with the long-term development of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and carcinoma of the vagina. The squamous cells of the vaginal mucosa are similar to the cells of the ectocervix. Recently, the terminology for precancerous lesions has changed from vaginal intraepithelial lesion (VAIN) 1 to low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and VAIN 2-3 to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL). Because the vaginal epithelium does not transform via squamous metaplasia, vaginal tissue less commonly undergoes malignant transformation from HPV infection.

Primary melanomas arising from the female reproductive system are uncommon and aggressive cancers. The vulva is the most frequent site (70%), followed by the vagina and, more rarely, the cervix.
