The exact etiology of Rotor syndrome (RS) is unknown but appears to be attributable to a deficiency in the intra-cellular capacity of the liver to store organic anions, such as bilirubin diglucuronide.

In a normal liver, a majority of bilirubin is conjugated by hepatocytes and secreted back into the blood. It is then reabsorbed in downstream hepatocytes by the OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 proteins.

A study of eight families of Rotor syndrome found that it was associated with mutations that are predicted to cause deficiencies of the organic anion transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. These crucial detoxification-limiting proteins carry out the uptake and clearance of a large number of drugs and drug conjugates through the sinusoidal hepatocyte membrane. The observation suggested the risk of life-threatening toxicities with the use of certain medications in Rotor syndrome.

A recent study looked at the insertion of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) in genes potentially causing Rotor syndrome.
