Labyrinthectomy is a surgical procedure of the temporal bone used to treat intractable and refractory vertigo. This procedure surgically removes the neuroepithelial elements of the semicircular canals and vestibule. Its goal is to ablate abnormal signals from a diseased vestibular system in order to facilitate central compensation, and it is generally very successful. The procedure does result in loss of all remaining hearing in the operated ear.
