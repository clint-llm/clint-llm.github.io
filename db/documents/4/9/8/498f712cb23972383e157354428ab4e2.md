Immediate management of acute splenic sequestration episodes consists of restoring the circulating blood volume, typically accomplished by the transfusion of RBCs, which improves the hemoglobin level directly and promote the release of trapped RBCs by the spleen. The usual recommended dose for transfusion is 5-10 ml/kg. Initial transfusions should target a post-transfusional hematocrit of less than 35%. This is to avoid complications from excessive RBC release and subsequent hyperviscosity syndrome.
