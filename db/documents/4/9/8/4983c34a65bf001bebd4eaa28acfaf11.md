Alpha-adrenergic agonist toxicity is due to a broad group of pharmaceutical agents known as alpha agonists, which can be further broken down into central alpha-2 agonists and peripheral alpha-1 agonists. Stimulation of central alpha-2 receptors causes decreased secretion of catecholamines through a negative feedback mechanism. Stimulation of peripheral alpha-1 receptors primarily increases blood pressure via induced vasoconstriction. Alpha-adrenergic agonist toxicity is of primary concern with alpha-2 adrenergic agonist xenobiotics through the resulting depletion of catecholamines associated with these agents; however, there are many topical alpha-1 agonists that when misused cause similar toxicity. This activity illustrates the pathophysiology and typical presentation of alpha-adrenergic agonist toxicity and discusses the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing the condition to achieve better clinical outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pharmacology of alpha adrenergic agonists and the pathophysiology of alpha agonist toxicity.
- Identify the etiology and clinical presentation of alpha-adrenergic agonist toxicity.
- Summarize the the importance of initiating early symptomatic management in patients with alpha-adrenergic agonist toxicity,
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with alpha agonist toxicity.
