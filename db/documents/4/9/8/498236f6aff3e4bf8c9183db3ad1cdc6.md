Primary healthcare providers should refer women presenting with (HG) to obstetric providersÂ as it is the most severe form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Inpatient management is indicated for intravenous antiemetics and fluids in the setting of refractory symptoms, failed outpatient treatment, severe dehydration, or electrolyte disturbance. Management of women with (HG) should involve a multidisciplinary team to improve outcomes for both the mother and the baby.
