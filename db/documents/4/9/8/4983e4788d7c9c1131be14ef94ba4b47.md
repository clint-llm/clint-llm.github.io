**Diagnostic Considerations**

M. pneumoniae is a prevalent cause of community-acquired pneumonia in healthy individuals under the age of 40. Large outbreaks are known to occur in the late summer months and early fall. The infection is also more common in populations that live in close quarters like prisoners and military personnel. Unlike other viral pneumonia, the incubation period for mycoplasma is 14 to 21 days. The key feature to the diagnosis is the absence of a wet cough. Other diagnoses that can be confused with mycoplasma pneumonia include the following:

- Aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia

- Bacterial pneumonia

- Chlamydia pneumoniae

- Coxiella burnetii infection

- Empyema

- Legionella pneumophila

- Lung abscess

- Pediatric pneumonia

- Q fever

- Viral pneumonia
