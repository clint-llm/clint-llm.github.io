A multidimensional approach is required to manage patients suffering from FTD. Genetic counseling, in terms of genetic testing and recommendations, should be provided to patients and their families.

**Non-Pharmacologic Treatment**

It includes an interprofessional approach, such as social support services, physical therapy & occupational therapy, speech therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, rehabilitation services, and caregivers' education. Regular monitoring of the behavior of both the patient and caregiver for assessing activities of daily living, such as financial account managing, driving, environmental modification, and eating, is mandatory.

**Pharmacological Treatment**

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate inhibitors have no proven benefit. Similarly, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have a limited role. They can improve certain behaviors, but not cognition. Antipsychotics have mixed results but comes with a price of severe extrapyramidal side effects to which the patients with FTD are susceptible; therefore, they are not approved by the US food and drug administration as a treatment for FTD. Selective dopaminergic antagonists can improve motivation and apathy. Several disease-modifying drugs like salsalate (tau acetylation inhibitor) and gosuraneb (anti-tau monoclonal antibodies) targeting different biomarkers are being studied, but no recommendations yet have been made. Several other promising disease-modifying drugs are currently under clinical trials.
