Fluid maintenance in patients: When administering fluids to patients, an important consideration is the osmotic content of the solution. In the case that the patient does not have any underlying electrolyte abnormalities,  normal saline (0.9% NaCl) is a common choice for maintenance (particularly in pediatric populations) as it mimics the tonicity of blood. In cases of hypovolemic shock, hypertonic solutions are increasingly recognized as an alternative resuscitation fluid, albeit insufficient evidence, since they promote fluid movement into the intravascular space (by creating a high osmotic gradient across cellular membranes).

Osmolar gap: The osmolar gap is the difference between the measured osmolality and the calculated osmolarity. The calculated osmolarity is given as: 2[Na] + [Glucose] + [Urea] ( all in mmol/L). Clinically, the osmolar gap may be used to detect the presence of an osmotically active particle that is not normally present in plasma. Common examples include toxic alcohol such as methanol or butanol.

Diuretics: The principles of osmoregulation apply nicely to explain the physiological effects of many diuretics. For instance, loop diuretics operate mechanistically by blocking the sodium potassium chloride pump (NKCC) in the ascending loop of Henle. This blockade prevents reabsorption of sodium back into the blood, and by osmotic pressure leads to increased water loss through the urine as well.
