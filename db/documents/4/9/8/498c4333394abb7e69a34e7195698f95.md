In the United States, trauma is the 4th leading cause of death. The incidence of blunt cardiac injury (BCI) has a broad range due to a lack of widely accepted diagnostic criteria, inconsistencies in reporting, and a lack of consensus on its definition. Diagnosis can be mistaken when symptoms are misattributed and not related to BCI. For example, an arrhythmia may simply be a pre-existing condition. Furthermore, diagnostics, including elevated troponins, can be due to trauma unrelated to the chest.
