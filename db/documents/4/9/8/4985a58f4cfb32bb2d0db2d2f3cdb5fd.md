Depending on the age of presentation and the degree of hyperopia, clinical presentation varies from no symptom to a wide range of complaints. Age is an important factor not only due to the ability to express but also the accommodative effort of the patient.

**Asymptomatic:**The patient's inherent ciliary muscle tone and accommodative effort can overcome some degree of hyperopia without creating any difficulty.

**Symptomatic:**

**Deviation of eyes (noted by the parents)****:**Parents sometimes note deviation of either or both eyes (simultaneous or alternative) in very young children with hyperopia. The commonest type is an inward deviation (esotropia).

**Asthenopia**: With total accommodative effort, the patient's hyperopia is corrected here. In these cases, asthenopia (i.e., varied amount of tiredness of eyes with localized frontal/frontotemporal headache) is a very common symptom due to prolonged accommodative effort. Sometimes it may be associated with photophobia and watering. Usually, asthenopia increases after near activity of long-duration.

**Dimness of vision:**There will be dimness of vision if existing hyperopia is not corrected with total accommodative effort. In hyperopia, infinity focuses beyond the neurosensory retina. So, nearer objects focus behind the retina. Characteristically the defective vision affects near vision more than distant vision. Thus, the objects appear more blurred as they come closer. This dimness may (small amount of hyperopia) or may not (a large amount of hyperopia or after 40 years of age when accommodation is lost) be associated with asthenopia. A significant difference in uncorrected hyperopia may predispose the worse eye to develop amblyopia. Uncorrected hyperopia of both the eyes may develop ametropic amblyopia bilaterally.

**Sudden blurring of vision****(intermittent)******Due to prolonged accommodative effort (e.g., during reading), there may be an episode of accommodative spasm leading to a sudden blurring of vision, often termed as pseudomyopia. It is commonly found inteenagers with uncorrected hyperopia.

**Recurrent Internal/External Hordeolum or Conjunctivitis:**The exact mechanism of the recurrent eyelid or conjunctival inflammation is unrevealed. The proposed theory is the frequent rubbing of the eyes with unhygienic hands, which leads to recurrent inflammatory episodes. Proper treatment of recurrent inflammation helps to get good best-corrected visual acuity in the future and vice-versa.

**A sensation of Crossed Eye:**Prolonged sustained accommodation is sometimes felt as a crossed eye. The patient may complain that the eyes are crossing each other (due to convergence) without any diplopia. Ignorance towards this symptom in the pre-school age group may lead to amblyopia in the future.

**Premature Presbyopia:**As the age progresses, obvious receding of the near point becomes apparent. It occurs earlier(earlier than the 40s) in hyperope than emmetrope. The progressive accommodation loss with age is more frustrating to the patient as the near vision was already compromised earlier due to hyperopia.
