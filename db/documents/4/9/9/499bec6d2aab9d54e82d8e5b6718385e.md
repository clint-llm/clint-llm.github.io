In the United States, approximately 500,000 people seek care for burn injuries yearly. For civilians, these injuries are typically sustained in house fires, motor vehicle crashes, and work-related accidents. In combat, burn injuries represent 5% to 10% of combat casualties. The severity of burns is determined by the intensity of the thermal energy sustained, duration of exposure, and the area of the body affected. These parameters determine whether a patient will require treatment at a dedicated burn center. This activity emphasizes the importance of burn fluid resuscitation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing burn patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the formula used to estimate fluid resuscitation in burn patients.
- Describe the types of fluids used to resuscitate and maintain patients with burns.
- Review the complications of burn fluid management.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance fluid resuscitation in burn patients.
