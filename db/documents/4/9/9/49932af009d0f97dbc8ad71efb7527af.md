The choice of access vessel for stent placement depends on the venous disease's extent, location, and etiology. In patients with an acute DVT, stenting is often performed in conjunction with thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy. Venous access sites for acute interventions are commonly the popliteal vein and posterior tibial vein. The mid-femoral access has its advantages of avoiding prone positioning and jugular access if the femoral vein is diseased. In patients with chronic DVT, the extent of disease directs where the end of the venous sheath and stent are positioned. The greater saphenous vein can be accessed to cross a lower extremity occlusion by snaring the wire in the IVC placed via an internal jugular vein (IJV) access and redirecting the IJV wire into the profunda femoris vein or diseased femoral vein. Under venography, directing the stent landing at the lesser trochanter is optimal because of its location of the confluence of the profunda and femoral veins.

After obtaining access with a large sheath, confirmatory imaging is completed, and anticoagulation is given and maintained at an activated clotting time > 250 seconds during treatment. Patients with an acute DVT undergo lytic therapy with completion venography and IVUS to confirm acute thrombus clearance and stent placement for any residual underlying lesions. IVUS imaging is performed, and the percentage stenosis is estimated by comparing the stenotic segment with an area of normal adjacent iliac or common femoral vein (CFV). The vein diameter on IVUS is calculated by the average of the two cross-sectional diameters: transverse larger and perpendicular smaller diameter. For long-segment iliac vein stenosis, when it is difficult to determine the normal vein size, diameter measurements are compared to prior imaging. Known normal diameters of iliac veins for chronically occluded veins: 14 to 16 mm for the CIV, 12 to 14 mm for the external iliac vein (EIV), and 10 to 12 mm for the CFV.

The diagnosis of ICVO is based on a >50% reduction in the luminal diameter of the vein, with or without the presence of collateral formation. The radiopaque markers on the IVUS catheter will determine a more accurate assessment of the stent length needed to achieve placement in a non-diseased segment. Depending on the length, there may be a size discrepancy between the vessel diameters of the stent landing zones. IVUS can determine accurate assessment. Pre- and post dilatation of venous segments of the diameter is recommended with a high-pressure balloon. Serial dilatation with balloons of increasing diameter may be needed. Predilatation assists in allowing for accurate sizing and stent expansion. With inflation to nominal size, venography can be performed. Vein stent diameter is under measured if contrast is visualized passing around the balloon or if the balloon can be retracted easily. Post dilatation, especially for nitinol stents, provides the maximal resistive force of the stent.

Stents are oversized by 10% to 20% based on diameter measurements from IVUS. The pattern of iliac vein obstruction is classified based on anatomic involvement of the iliocaval venous outflow tract: type I, stenosis of a single venous segment; type II, stenosis of multiple venous segments; type III, occlusion of a single venous segment; and type IV, occlusion of multiple venous segments.

There is a paucity of literature regarding post-procedural follow-up imaging to ensure stent patency and the duration of anticoagulation. After the procedure, patients undergo early ambulation, receiving anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy according to the physician's discretion; with a history of acute or chronic DVT, patients transition to either a vitamin K antagonist or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for a variable period of time. For patients with a hypercoagulable state, DOACs are generally administered indefinitely. There are no clear recommendations regarding anticoagulation for patients with NIVL anticoagulation postprocedure. However, post-procedural imaging is usually performed within weeks of the procedure to assess for flow disturbance in the stents and the presence of any mural thrombus. Subsequently, patency is evaluated by duplex sonography at 3 months and 6 months and then at yearly follow-up. With duplex sonography, central and truncal veins are evaluated. Qualitative assessment is made regarding patency, presence of thrombus, phasicity, and augmentation with provocative maneuvers.

Chronic, post-thrombotic iliofemoral, and ICVO is associated with debilitating morbidity. In the presence of a diseased or occluded CFV, failure is common. A hybrid operative procedure of open surgical CFV endovenectomy and endoluminal recanalization or bypass of the obstructed iliofemoral and vena cava segments has been developed and modified.
