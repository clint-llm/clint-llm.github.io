Epilepsy affects over 68 million people globally, approximately 2.2 million people in the United States. With over 150,000 new cases diagnosed yearly, epilepsy has been established as one of the most common neuronal disorders. By 20 years of age, one out of every 100 people will develop epilepsy, whereas three out of every 100 individuals will be diagnosed by age 80.

Across North America, epilepsy is more common in racial and ethnic minorities and individuals from impoverished backgrounds, with males affected at a slightly higher rate than females.

In children, apart from febrile convulsions, the most prevalent form of partial epilepsy is benign partial epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (benign rolandic epilepsy) occurring between the ages of 5 and 10.
