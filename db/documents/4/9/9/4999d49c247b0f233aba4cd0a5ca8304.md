Staging is most often used for surgical planning and is not used much in rehabilitation management. Brooker Classification System, used for severity of HO in the hip, is the most commonly used staging system

Brooker classification divides the extent of HO formation in the hip into 4 classes:

- Class 1: Islands of bone within the soft tissues around the hip

- Class 2: Bone spurs that originate from the pelvis or proximal end of the femur, leaving at least 1 cm between opposing bone surfaces

- Class 3: Bone spurs originating from the pelvis or proximal end of the femur, reduced space between opposing bone surfaces to less than 1 cm

- Class 4: Ankylosis of the hip

The "Della Valle" classification system

- Grade A: Absence of HO (or if bone is present, it may be greater than or equal to 1 island of bone of less than 1 cm in length

- Grade B: Presence of greater than or equal to 1 islands of bone at least 1 cm in length with 1 cm distance between opposing surfaces of bone

- Grade C: Bone spurs arising from the pelvis or femur with less than 1 cm between opposing surfaces or bone ankylosis
