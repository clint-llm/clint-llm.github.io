Prior to the ovulation induction, it is essential to assess the ovulation reserve.

**Assessing ovulation reserve**

Ovulation reserve is the capacity of the ovaries to produce fertilizable ova. This depends on the quality and quantity of ovarian antral follicles. Antral follicle count is considered to be a reliable parameter for ovarian reserve assessment.
