Compartment syndrome is an emergent clinical condition that is well-documented in the literature. It is a clinical diagnosis that is often difficult to determine because it must be assessed in a timely manner. Although the lower leg and the forearm have the most common incidence, compartment syndrome may occur in any muscle compartment in the body.

Even though compartment syndrome of the hand is rare, it is important to have a high index of suspicion. The hallmark of diagnosis is pain with passive stretching, yet one may see pain and swelling as well. Determining the pressure in the compartment is key in the diagnosis. Pressures above 30 mmHg warrant an emergent surgery. Failure to act may lead to debilitating consequences.
