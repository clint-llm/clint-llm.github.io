The process begins with obtaining informed consent from the patient. After the relevant risks, benefits, and alternatives have been explained, standard vital sign monitors are placed, and the patient can be positioned appropriately. An upright sitting position is ideal for the posterior approach to access the scapula and suprascapular notch. A reclined position is preferred for the anterior approach lateral to the supraclavicular brachial plexus. A blanket behind the patientâ€™s shoulders can improve the visualization of the anatomy around the clavicle.

The skin overlying the block site should be widely prepped with 2% chlorhexidine and allowed to dry. A sterile ultrasound probe cover and gel should be used. The block solution can be drawn up into an appropriately sized syringe, connected to the block needle with extension tubing, and flushed to remove air from the system.
