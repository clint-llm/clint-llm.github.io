Atrioventricular reentry tachycardia is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia that requires an accessory pathway that bypasses the AV node. Atrioventricular reentry tachycardia and Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome are often used interchangeably. However, to be specific, AVRT is the most common type of arrhythmia associated with Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome. Other examples of arrhythmia include AVNRT, atrial fibrillation with preexcitation, and atrial flutter.
