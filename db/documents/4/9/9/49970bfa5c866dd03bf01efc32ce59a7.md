Pseudocholinesterase deficiency can be acquired and/or be inherited.

The inherited form of the enzyme transfers in an autosomal recessive manner secondary to mutations in the butyrylcholinesterase gene, located on chromosome 3, 3q26.1-26.20.

Acquired pseudocholinesterase deficiency can also occur in several disease states or with the use of certain drugs.  Malnutrition, pregnancy and the postpartum period, burns, liver disease, kidney disease, hemodialysis, MI, CHF, malignancy, chronic infections and drugs such as steroids and cytotoxic agents can decrease the production of the pseudocholinesterase enzyme.  Certain other medications and chemicals, such as organophosphate insecticides, MAO inhibitors, and anticholinesterase drugs can inhibit the activity of the enzyme.
