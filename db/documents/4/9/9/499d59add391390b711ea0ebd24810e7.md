All healthcare professionals who look after ventilated patients should know the indications and potential adverse effects of PEEP. The ventilator settings should only be changed by one dedicated person- namely the respiratory therapist. Anytime a change is made, it should be charted. Nurses who look after ventilated patients should be aware that high PEEP can lead to barotrauma and a drop in cardiac output- thus protocols should be in place to counter these complications. Daily rounds should be conducted on each ventilated patient to determine the patient's progress and need for changes in the ventilator settings.
