All T lymphocytes have the TCR (T-cell receptor) and the pan-T-cell co-receptor CD3. It recognizes the antigen-loaded MHC molecules on other cells. Whether it can recognize MHC 1 or MHC 2 depends on its co-receptor (rather CD4 or CD8) as previously discussed. The TCR itself is a transmembrane receptor made up of various alpha and beta chains, each with variable regions. These variations develop to recognize different antigens and become selected for during the T-cell maturation process (involving positive and negative selection, within the thymus).

The other structural markers of T cells depend on the T-cell type in question. CD4+ T cells have CD4, whereas CD8+ T cells have CD8 as an added co-receptor. T regulatory cells have CD4, and CD25 added as co-receptors for their TCRs. As mentioned above, T cells have numerous other biochemical receptors on their surface, and these largely depend on the T cell's function.
