**Problems Related to Pacing**

**Output Failure**

It is defined as the inability of the pacemaker to generate an impulse resulting in a heart rate lower than the programmed lower rate limit. It is characterized by the absence of a pacing spike on an electrocardiogram, and device interrogation confirms the diagnosis. (Figure.1) Causes of output failure include lead fracture,  generator failure, and inhibition of pacing due to over-sensing and crosstalk.

**Failure to Capture**

Failure to capture is defined as the inability of pacing impulse to produce an evoked potential. It is characterized by a pacing spike on the surface electrocardiogram at programmed heart rate, which is not followed by an evoked potential (P or a QRS). (Figure.2) Causes of failure to capture include lead dislodgment and elevated thresholds due to fibrosis or exit block at the site of lead implantation.

These pacing problems could lead to life-threatening bradyarrhythmias as well as asystole in pacemaker-dependent patients.

**Problems Related to Sensing**

**Under-sensing**

Under-sensing is defined by a failure of the pacemaker to see the spontaneous intrinsic activity, which results in asynchronous pacing. On a surface ECG, it is characterized by pacing spikes regardless of P waves or QRS complex. (Figure.3) The main causes of under-sensing include an improperly programmed sensing threshold (high sensing threshold), insufficient myocardial voltage signal,  lead displacement, or pacemaker failure.

**Over-sensing**

Over-sensing happens when the pacemaker detects an electrical signal which is not expected to be sensed. Over-sensing results in an inappropriate inhibition of the pacing stimulus leading to potentially life-threatening consequences. In addition to the native cardiac depolarization signals (P or R waves), any electrical activity with sufficient amplitude can be sensed by a pacemaker, inhibiting the pacing when required. Over-sensing can be caused either by a physiologic signal like T waves or by a non-physiologic signal like electromagnetic interference or a lead failure (an insulation break or a lead fracture.

Sensing plays a major role in pacemakers, in patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), sensing problems lead to inappropriate shocks.

**Pseudomalformations**

**Fusion and Pseudofusion**

Fusion is an electrical summation of an intrinsic beat and a depolarization from a pacing stimulus. The hallmark of the fusion phenomenon is that its morphology lies between a fully paced beat and an intrinsic beat. (Figure.5)

Pseudofusion occurs when the pacemaker spikes coincide with an intrinsic; however, it does not contribute to the actual depolarization.  It is characterized by a morphology similar to an intrinsic beat. Fusion and pseudo-fusion beats are considered normal pacemaker behavior.

**Pacemaker Crosstalk**

Pacemaker crosstalk is a feature of a dual-chamber pacemaker, characterized by detecting a paced signal in one chamber by the lead in another chamber and by the misrepresentation of the paced signal as a cardiac depolarization signal. This, in turn, results in inappropriate inhibition of pacing in the 2nd chamber.

**Ventricular Safety Pacing**

During ventricular safety pacing, the pacemaker delivers a ventricular pacing stimulus after detecting a ventricular sensed event shortly after an atrial paced event. It is typical characterized by the appearance of two very closely spaced atrial and ventricular paced events on ECG. Safety pacing (SP) algorithms differ among pacemaker manufacturers.

Pacemaker Mediated Tachycardia

Pacemaker-mediated tachycardia is a feature dual-chamber pacemaker with tracking mode (DDD, VDD). It is also called an endless-loop tachycardia characterized by atrial sensing followed by ventricular pacing at an upper tracking rate.

rant tachycardia, except that the pacemaker forms part of the re-entrant circuit.

**Upper Rate Behavior**

Upper-rate behavior is also a feature of dual-chamber pacemakers with atrial tracking mode. In dual-chambered pacemakers, it is necessary to limit the atrial rate at which the device paces the ventricle. This limit is called the maximum tracking rate (MTR), and it is a programmable value. Upper rate behavior occurs when the atrial rate increases and approaches the maximum tracking rate.

**Runaway Pacemaker**

Runaway pacemaker is a rare, life-threatening phenomenon caused by generator dysfunction, usually related to pacemaker battery depletion.
