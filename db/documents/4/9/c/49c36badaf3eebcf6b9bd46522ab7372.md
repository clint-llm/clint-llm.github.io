The pathophysiology of anhidrosis varies depending on the etiology, as anhidrosis is a clinical finding and not a distinct entity. For central and neuropathic anhidrosis, interruption of innervation at any level along the pathway from the sweating centers located in the brain to the sweat glands can result in absent sweating. Drugs that interfere with the synaptic transmission in the autonomic ganglia can inhibit sweating. Peripheral alterations can result in the absence of sweating. Peripheral alterations include genetic disorders, destruction, or obstruction. Genetic abnormalities underlie several types of anhidrosis, and the pathogenesis may be unknown. Other etiologies may have a known cause, such as local tissue destruction by prior radiation therapy. The clinical presentation and history can help delineate the pathophysiology.

As anhidrosis is a clinical presentation of an underlying disorder, it is beyond the scope to describe the pathophysiology of each disorder separately. However, for instance, Horner syndrome, which is a common cause of ipsilateral anhidrosis, depends on the level of interruption of the sympathetic supply. Anhidrosis with first-order neuron lesions affects the ipsilateral side of the body as the sympathetic supply from its central origin. The ipsilateral face is involved in lesions involving the second-order neurons. Postganglionic third-order neuron lesions occurring after the vasomotor and sudomotor fibers have branched off show very limited involvement of the face (area adjacent to the ipsilateral brow).
