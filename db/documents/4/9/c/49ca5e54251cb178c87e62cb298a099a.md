The vagina is part of the female genitalia between the urethral meatus and anus. It is a muscular canal that serves as a connection between the external genitalia and the uterus. The vaginal opening has protection from the vulva, a structure comprised of the labia majora and labia minora. At the most proximal portion of the vagina is the cervix, a highly vascularized structure that guards the entrance to the uterus.
