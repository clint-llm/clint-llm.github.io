As the clinical signs and symptoms of Irukandji syndrome can present similarly to many other disease processes, the patient’s history is critical in making the diagnosis, as well as distinguishing it from alternatives. A location where Irukandji-causative cnidarian species are endemic should increase one’s clinical suspicion for Irukandji syndrome compared to other cnidarian envenomations. Other disease processes that could potentially cause similar symptoms are listed below:

- Other cnidaria stings

- Sympathomimetic toxicity

- Acute decompensated heart failure

- Hyperthyroidism

- Anaphylaxis

- Rhabdomyolysis

- Pancreatitis

- Black widow envenomation

- Pheochromocytoma

- Acute coronary syndrome

- Decompression illness
