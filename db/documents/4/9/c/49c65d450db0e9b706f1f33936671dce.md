The most common complication after fixation is a varus and procurvatum malunion or nonunion due to the characteristic deformity at the fracture site. This complication can be decreased by achieving an adequate reduction and stable fixation at the time of initial intervention. As with all fracture nonunions, it is important to rule out potential systemic contributors to the nonunion such as vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and infection. Once systemic contributors are ruled out or addressed, revision can then be carried out with a focus on correcting the deformity.
