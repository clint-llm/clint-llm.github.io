Neonatal abstinence syndrome is a constellation of signs and symptoms with multisystem involvement. The clinical features categorize into CNS, autonomic, respiratory, and GI system disturbances. Initial clinical presentation varies widely; however, the most specific presentation for withdrawal is a triad of increased muscle tone, tremors when undisturbed, and exaggerated Moro reflex. Other initial presenting symptoms include excessive high-pitched crying, irritability, sneezing, and diarrhea, all of which are due to increased noradrenergic state.

CNS symptoms typically include hyperirritability, high-pitched cry, jitteriness, and tremors. Hyperirritability, in turn, leads to sleep disturbances and difficulty maintaining a calm state.

GI symptoms observed in NAS include poor feeding, regurgitation, vomiting, and diarrhea. Heroin withdrawal is notable for severe GI symptoms leading to dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. Diarrhea, in turn, leads to skin breakdown around the perianal region and the resultant rash. Withdrawal is a state of excessive caloric demand; this, combined with the GI losses and excessive autonomic stimulation, can lead to weight loss and failure to thrive. Hence it may be necessary to increase caloric intake with feeding.

Neonatal abstinence syndrome clinical features are also believed to be due to neurobehavioral dysregulation. An imbalance exists between the four behavioral components, i.e., state control/attention, autonomic control, sensory processing, and motor and tone control. When the infant spends more time in one subsystem, such as increased muscle tone, the energy consumed in another subsystem, like attention, is very minimal, and this imbalance is also considered to be a hallmark feature. The neonate's self-regulatory capacity is lost, leading to hyperirritability and difficulty being consoled by the caregiver; this also alters the infant's developmental trajectory.

Neonatal abstinence syndrome babies have significant variability in the presenting symptoms and severity of the presentation. Inter and intra-subject differences also exist.
