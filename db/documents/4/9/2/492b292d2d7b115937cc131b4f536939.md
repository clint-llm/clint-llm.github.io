Evaluation of a patient with alexia includes a thorough physical examination to assess for reading fluency as well as comprehension. A baseline reading level prior to the insulting injury would be beneficial to the evaluation of the patient. Patients should be asked to read short stories and evaluated on comprehension of the material and the speed at which the material was read. Patients should also be evaluated on their ability to spell out words, comprehend spelled words, and writing. A comprehensive neurological examination should be completed to assess for other neurocognitive disfunction. Neuroimaging with a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be done to help localize the affected area, severity, and acuity of the condition. A stat head CT scan should be done on anyone presenting with new-onset alexia to assess for acute cerebral vascular accidents.
