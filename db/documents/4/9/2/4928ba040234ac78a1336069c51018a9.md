Non-tunneled catheters for short-term extracorporeal RRT are preferentially inserted under ultrasound guidance, as this allows subcutaneous structures to be visualized and reduces the complication rates,

By contrast, peritoneal dialysis catheters target the intraperitoneal space rather than a vascular structure. When correctly placed, they should traverse the anterior abdominal wall with the distal tip resting superficial to the visceral peritoneum and deep to the parietal peritoneum, pointed in the direction of the pelvis.
