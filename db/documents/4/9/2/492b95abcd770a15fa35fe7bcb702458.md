The USPSTF and National Institute of Health (NIH) recommend screening all adults over the age of 18 years for obesity. The NIH recommends screening for waist circumference as well.

The assessment of these patients should begin with a thorough history and physical exam. It should include a chronology of weight gain, family history of obesity, high-risk eating behavior (such as binge eating, fast food consumption, nighttime eating, sugary beverages, etc.), exercise routines, and symptoms of cardiovascular disease. Routine tests involve laboratory testing such as lipid panel, glycated hemoglobin, blood pressure testing, and routine age-appropriate cancer screening.

As mentioned above, obesity can affect almost every physiologic system in the human body.

**Common Obesity-related Health Problems**

- Cardiovascular: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart failure, venous stasis, atrial fibrillation

- Pulmonary: Obstructive sleep apnea, restrictive lung disease

- Renal: Chronic kidney disease, nephrolithiasis, proteinuria

- Gastrointestinal: Gastritis, gastric reflux disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cholelithiasis

- Neurologic: Stroke, migraine, pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension)

- Endocrine: Diabetes Mellitus type 2, Polycystic ovarian disease (PCOS)

- Musculoskeletal: Osteoarthritis, low back pain

- Infectious disease: Increased susceptibility to infection

- Cancer: Colorectal cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer

Interestingly, recent studies have indicated that patients who were overweight or had class 1 obesity had an overall mortality risk similar to those with a normal BMI. These results were fairly controversial and have caused scientists and healthcare providers to re-examine the definition of optimal body weight. Despite this, increased life expectancy does not necessarily equate to improved healthy life years. It is, therefore, still an issue of serious concern.
