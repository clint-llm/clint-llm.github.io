Tolcapone is only available as an oral formulation in 100 mg and 200 mg tablets. The recommended starting dose for tolcapone is 100 mg three times a day while concurrently taking levodopa and carbidopa. An increase in dosage to 200 mg three times daily may be warranted if the clinical benefit outweighs the potential risk of increasing therapy.
