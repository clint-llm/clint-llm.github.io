The end goal of SBEM deliberate practice of technical and cognitive skills is for the transfer of those skills from simulation-based practice to clinical practice situations. Studies have shown deliberate practice to be effective in the performance of many clinical skills in the technical/procedural category: central venous catheter placement;

Additional studies have supported DP use for teaching and learning skills which require a higher cognitive load (i.e., less likely to be automated as rote muscle memory) and some aspect of hands-on, such as point of care ultrasound (POCUS);

Thus, SBEM deliberate practice can be used to acquire new skills, refresh on previously learned but seldom used skills, and continually improve via self-reflection and peer feedback.
