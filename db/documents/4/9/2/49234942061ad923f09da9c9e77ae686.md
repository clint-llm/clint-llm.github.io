If tarsal tunnel syndrome is identified early in the disease course, the patient can benefit from a conservative treatment plan depending on the cause, if found. If the syndrome is due to tight foot-wear, the simple fact of changing it may be sufficient. For progressive tarsal tunnel syndrome, surgical exploration of the nerves in the tarsal tunnel and distally may be necessary. ENG and EMG, when done efficiently and effectively, can lead to the early diagnosis of tarsal tunnel syndrome.
