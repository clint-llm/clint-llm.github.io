Even though nickel contact can occur through diet and natural sources such as soil and water, workplace exposure is the predominant location for significant toxicity. Occupational use can be seen with refining nickel itself, whether smelting or reclaiming. Industries include battery manufacturers, stainless steel, welders, and petroleum refining. Industrial use is seen throughout the United States, while only one active mine exists in Michigan. Historically there have been several notable toxicity cases. In 1953, nickel carbonyl inhalation occurred at a Gulf Oil Company refinery in Texas, causing two deaths.

In 1987, an incident took place at an electroplating plant in Canada where twenty employees fell ill after consuming contaminated water from a fountain. The affected individuals experienced symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Fortunately, there were no fatalities, and the reported symptoms subsided within 3 days.

Nickel is recognized as one of the primary allergens that cause contact dermatitis, particularly in industrialized countries. It can be found in various household items including jewelry, cosmetics, clothing, and detergents. Women are more commonly affected by nickel sensitivity, with approximately 10% of them exhibiting a reaction. Reactions to nickel have also been associated with ear piercing.

Nickel is also found in dental materials and surgical implants. The exposure leads to absorption and a hypersensitivity reaction causing the notable erythematous, vesicular, and pruritic rash.
