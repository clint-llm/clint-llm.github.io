Although vaccinations containing the tetanus toxoid are generally safe, some adverse effects can occur.  Any vaccine with tetanus toxoid as a component has the potential to cause brachial neuritis.

A study of 740 patients with adverse effects to the tetanus toxoid showed that, when present, the most common symptoms are local edema and tenderness, fever, and anaphylactoid response.

In the 1990s, whole-cell pertussis was replaced with acellular pertussis, which is a common component of vaccines containing the tetanus toxoid. Before the switch to acellular pertussis, swelling, redness, and pain at the injection site were commonly noted adverse events; however, these reactions are much less common today.
