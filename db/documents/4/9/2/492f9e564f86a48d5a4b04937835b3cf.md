Glaucoma is the second leading cause of permanent blindness in the United States and occurs most often in older adults.

The patient with POAG is often asymptomatic until the optic nerve damage is severe unless signs of early glaucoma are recognized on a routine eye exam. Acute angle-closure glaucoma, in contrast, can develop suddenly and result in a more rapid decline in vision with associated corneal edema, eye pain, headache, nausea, and emesis. Secondary glaucoma is usually correlated with a prior eye injury or disease state causing elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and related optic neuropathy. The last type is normal or low-tension type glaucoma in which patients have the same visual loss pattern as POAG but at normal intraocular pressure readings.

While there are congenital, infantile, development glaucomas, and a juvenile variant of POAG, the four previously mentioned glaucoma types typically occur in people over the age of 40. The cause is generally correlated with increased intraocular pressure, though it has not been proven to have a direct cause-and-effect relationship. There may also be a genetic component to the development of glaucoma. Monozygotic twin pairs have a higher percentage of concordance, but not pairs, which suggests that environmental factors also influence the development of the disease.
