Much research has been done on the effects of severe social isolation and neglect on children removed from abusive homes or raised in institutions; however, there is still much work to be done to determine the impact of inadequate caregiving in the home. Psychosocial stressors such as poverty, lack of suitable childcare, parental substance abuse, incarceration, or severe mental illness increase the risk of all forms of abuse, particularly neglect. Parents facing extreme psychosocial stressors may find themselves unable to provide more than very necessities and may lack the healthcare literacy to understand the importance of their infant’s emotional development. Clinicians working with parents and children should be cognizant of the psychosocial factors which may impede a parents’ ability to provide consistent emotional feedback and intervene or refer for additional support when indicated. Healthcare providers should assess for maternal depression and evaluate parent-child interactions during routine appointments.
