SPS is an autoimmune condition associated with high titers of autoantibodies to various components of inhibitory synapses, which leads to their impaired functioning through a low level of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on pre-synaptic or post-synaptic neuronal junctions.

The paraneoplastic form accounts for 5% to 10% of all cases and is characterized by the presence of antibodies to amphiphysin and less frequently to gephyrin. The most common malignancy associated with paraneoplastic variant includes breast adenocarcinoma followed by adenocarcinoma of the colon, small-cell lung carcinoma, malignancies of thymus and thyroid gland, and Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma.

Genetic predisposition has been determined by the presence of DQB1 and DRB1 MHC-II alleles which increase the risk of idiopathic and paraneoplastic variants of SPS.
