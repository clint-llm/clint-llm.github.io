Aortic valve replacement is indicated when aortic stenosis or regurgitation disturbs the flow of blood out of the heart. Homograft valve and pulmonary autograft valve are two commonly used bioprosthetic grafts for aortic valve replacement. Main indications for aortic valve replacement are symptomatic aortic stenosis or regurgitation. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of aortic valve disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for aortic valve replacement, stentless, autograft/homograft.
- Describe the preparation, and technique of aortic valve replacement, stentless, autograft/homograft.
- Review the potential complications of aortic valve replacement, stentless, autograft/homograft.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance aortic valve replacement, stentless, autograft/homograft, and improve outcomes.
