Synovial chondromatosis develops as cartilaginous foci in synovial membranes, bursae, and tendon sheaths.

The hyaline cartilage is hypercellular, and the cells are often atypical. These atypical changes are multinucleated cells, myxoid degeneration of matrix, crowding of cell nuclei, and large nuclei. Almost two-thirds of these loose bodies will ossify through endochondral ossification, while the rest will be unossified.

Primary or idiopathic synovial chondromatosis involves otherwise normal joints with no association with trauma, infection, synovial irritation, or genetics. It presents at an earlier age, 30 to 40, and is relatively rare. This is compared to secondary synovial chondromatosis, where there is an underlying joint pathology resulting in synovitis and/or articular destruction such as trauma (single traumatic event or repetitive microtrauma), osteochondritis dissecans, advanced osteonecrosis, or Charcot neuropathic joint. Patients with secondary synovial chondromatosis are relatively older, in their 50s to 60s.

There is no consensus on whether synovial chondromatosis is neoplastic or metaplastic. However, there is a small risk of malignant transformation to chondrosarcoma. Despite the rarity of malignant transformation, it is associated with recurrence after initial treatment.
