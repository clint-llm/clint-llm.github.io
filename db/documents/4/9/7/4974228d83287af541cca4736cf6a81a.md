Fecal impaction commonly occurs among the elderly who are hospitalized patients or under institutional care. It is associated with generalized diseases, such as scleroderma and chronic renal failure, and conditions which cause an alteration in the normal anatomy such as congenital abnormalities in the anorectal region or previous surgical procedure of the intestine. In older adults who regularly consume nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, a higher occurrence of fecal impaction has been reported. Among hospitalized patients, administration in the elderly of medications with an opioid can result in fecal impaction, especially in those who have a history of chronic constipation and are bedridden.
