The most common presenting symptom of jugular foramen syndrome is hoarseness of voice or dysphagia. Pain is also a common associated symptom (persistent unilateral periauricular pain and headache).

Clinical features depend on the structures affected by JFS

- Vagus: Vagal compression initially causes paralysis of the laryngeal muscles leading to hoarseness and a nasal pitch. If the nerve gets compressed further, it results in unilateral paralysis of the soft palate and deviation of the uvula to the normal side.

- Involvement of the glossopharyngeal nerve leads to the following:

- Loss of sensation to the posterior ipsilateral aspect of the tongue
- Reduced secretions from the ipsilateral parotid gland, and
- Loss of the ipsilateral gag reflex.

- Dysfunction of the accessory nerve: This manifests as drooping of the shoulder, difficulties in abducting the ipsilateral arm and rotating the head contralaterally due to weakness of sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles

- Obstruction of the traversing venous sinuses and veins: Headache and papilledema due to intracranial venous congestion leading to cerebral edema and raised intracranial pressure

The clinician should specifically note the following findings in the case of JFS:

- Palatal and gag reflexes

- Drooping of shoulder

- Unilateral vocal cord palsy

- Power of sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles

- Fasciculation or winging of the scapula

- Other cranial nerve and brainstem involvement

- Cerebellar signs

- Examination of the mouth and external auditory canal for any vesicular rash or mass

Some unique presentations include

- Glossopharyngeal neuralgia syncope syndrome

- Pulsatile tinnitus
