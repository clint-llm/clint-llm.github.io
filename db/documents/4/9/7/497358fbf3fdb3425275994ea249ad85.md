Potter syndrome is an autosomally inherited congenital disease with poor outcomes associated with multiple problems. Psychological effects in the family are common. So counseling of the family members, especially the mother about the consequences of the disease, plays a vital role in the management of the post-delivery stress. The family should be informed beforehand and the interventions required with possible benefits. Patients should be provided with information about the disease and disease condition as much as they can understand to increase the mutual understanding and doctor-patient relationship. It is easier to deal with patients who are informed and counseled prior to delivery. In all congenital diseases, including Potter syndrome, antenatal screening is advised to reduce the probable complications to both mothers as well as children. Education about the chances of recurrenceÂ in the next offspring is very important.
