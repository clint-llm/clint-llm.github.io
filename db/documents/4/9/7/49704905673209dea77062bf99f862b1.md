Most cases of hypertension are asymptomatic and are diagnosed incidentally on blood pressures recording or measurement.

Some cases present directly with symptoms of end-organ damage as stroke-like symptoms or hypertensive encephalopathy, chest pain, shortness of breath and acute pulmonary edema.

Physical examination may be unyielding other than occasional pedal edema or raised blood pressure, but one needs to look for signs of:

- Coarctation of the aorta (radio-radial delay, radio-femoral delay, differences in left and right arm BP or upper and lower limb BP more than 20mmHg)

- Aortic valve disease (systolic ejection murmur, 4th heart sound)

- Renovascular disease or fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) - (renal bruit, carotid bruit)

- Polycystic kidneys (enlarged kidneys bilaterally)

- Endocrine disorders [hypercortisolism(thin skin, easy bruising,  hyperglycemia)

- Thyroid disorders(palpable/ painful or enlarged thyroid] which make up the common treatable causes for secondary hypertension

The presence of a 4th heart sound, which represents a stiff and non-compliant left ventricle, hints towards left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction.

Presence of lung rales and/or peripheral edema suggests cardiac dysfunction and gives a clue to the chronicity of hypertension.
