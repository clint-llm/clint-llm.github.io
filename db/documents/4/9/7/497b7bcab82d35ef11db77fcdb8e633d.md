The drug of choice for treating rickettsial infections is doxycycline, with the dosing and length of therapy depending on the specific causative organism. In the case of allergy and severe disease, chloramphenicol is an option. In milder disease, macrolides such as clarithromycin can be considered. Fluoroquinolones have been associated with worse outcomes and are not recommended for the treatment of rickettsial disease. It is important to note that in severe rickettsial disease, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, mortality rates are as high as 20 to 30% without prompt antibiotic treatment. Additionally, while doxycycline is not routinely utilized in children younger than 8 years of age, it is indicated for certain rickettsial infections in this age group due to the high mortality associated with the severe rickettsial disease. Thus, treatment should not be delayed while awaiting confirmatory laboratory testing in a patient with a suspected rickettsial infection.
