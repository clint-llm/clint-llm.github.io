**Malignant Hyperthermia**(MH) occurs in response to certain triggers such as volatile anesthetics (e.g. isoflurane) and muscle relaxants (e.g. succinylcholine) that are often used during surgical procedures. At-risk individuals may experience hyperthermia, an increase in heart rate, respiration, and muscle rigidity. This can also lead to rhabdomyolysis, acidosis, and myoglobinuria.

Certain muscle disorders caused by mutations in genes such as RYR1 (ryanodine receptor1) and CACNA1S (Calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1S) can predispose affected individuals to malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. The majority of these cases are caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in the RYR1gene that encodes the ryanodine receptor resulting in an uncontrolled release and abnormal accumulation of intracellular calcium in the skeletal muscle. This triggers the activation of other cellular processes involved in the generation of heat and sustained muscle contraction for aÂ  prolonged duration resulting in muscle rigidity. Besides addressing the symptoms and triggers, dantrolene sodium is used to treat malignant hyperthermia. Dantrolene is a hydantoin derivative that binds to the ryanodine receptor to inhibit the release of calcium and thus interfering with muscle contraction. However, calcium channel blockers such as Verapamil are contraindicated for the treatment of MH can interact with dantrolene, and result in hyperkalemia and cardiac depression. The patient should also be observed for at least 24 hours in an intensive care unit. In the 1970s, the mortality rate of Malignant Hyperthermia was 80%. Because of increased knowledge and understanding, it is below 5%

**Hyperthermia caused by uncouplers**: While UCP-1 is a physiological uncoupler, other non-physiological compounds such as Aspirin in high doses and 2,4-dinitrophenol can uncouple the oxidative phosphorylation producing excessive heat resulting in hyperthermia

**Non-shivering Thermogenesis:**In contrast to adults, heat production by shivering is not functional in newborns. Here, another mechanism known as non-shivering thermogenesis plays an important role in temperature regulation in neonates. Fat from brown adipose tissue contains an abundance of mitochondria and is used along with a specific physiological uncoupling protein called thermogenin or uncoupling protein (UCP-1). UCP-1 protein is present in the inner mitochondrial membrane and when activated, increases the membrane permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The fat from brown adipose tissue is broken down and activates the UCP-1 causing the pores to open, uncoupling the oxidative phosphorylation, thus disrupting the proton gradient. This allows the protons to diffuse into the mitochondrial matrix, releasing heat in the process
