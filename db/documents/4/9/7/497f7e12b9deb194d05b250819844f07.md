Vascular supply to the nasopharynx is provided by branches of the internal carotid artery (mandibular artery), maxillary artery (pterygopalatine artery), facial artery (ascending palatine artery), and ascending pharyngeal artery (superior pharyngeal artery). Venous drainage is via the parapharyngeal venous plexus. The plexus drains into the retropharyngeal and facial veins, which both drain to the internal jugular vein.

Lymphatic drainage of the nasopharynx is particularly clinically relevant for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The initial lymph collecting system is a capillary network within the mucosal membrane, which is connected to a similar network within the nasal atrium, turbinates, and posterior floor. From there, the first-tier lymph nodes are the retropharyngeal, referred to as the Rouvi√®re nodes. The retropharyngeal nodes lead to the internal jugular nodes.
