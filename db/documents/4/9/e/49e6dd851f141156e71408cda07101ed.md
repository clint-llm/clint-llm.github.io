**Indications of Fluoroscopy in Orthopedics**

Ionizing radiation is routinely used in diagnosis, during daycare procedures, and in trauma and cold orthopedic surgery to facilitate preoperative planning and intra-operative evaluation. The following are examples of uses of fluoroscopy in regular orthopedic practice:

**Diagnostic Fluoroscopy**

- Joint assessment: To see for joint degeneration and deformity

- Arthrography: Joint is assessed after injection of radio-opaque contrast to assess for stability, impingement, and congruent reduction in pediatric hips

- Spinal stability assessment in cervical spine injuries

- Guidance for percutaneous biopsy of the diseased vertebra

**Daycare Procedures**

- Guidance for diagnostic and therapeutic injections into various joints for patients with adhesive capsulitis, synovitis, and osteoarthritis

- Guidance for accurate placement of intra-articular contrast for computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) arthrograms

- Facet joint injections

- Spinal nerve root blocks and medial branch blocks

- Assessment of the accuracy of closed reduction of joints and fractured bones

**Preoperative Assessment****and Per-operative Assessment**

- Assessment of pre-operative deformity under anesthesia in deformity correction procedures

**Trauma Surgery**

- Improves the accuracy of osteosynthesis in iliosacral joint and pelvic/acetabular fractures, intramedullary nailing, extra- and intracapsular femoral neck fracture fixation, and physeal injuries

- Guidance of pedicle screw placement in spinal surgery

- Percutaneous vertebroplasty
