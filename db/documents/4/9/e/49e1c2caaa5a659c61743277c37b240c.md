Initial history and physical examination tailor the provider's approach towards the appropriate investigation for determining the underlying etiology. The initial laboratory workup should include a complete blood count (CBC), complete metabolic panel (CMP), urine studies (urinalysis with microscopy, urine protein to creatinine ratio, urine sodium), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and troponin. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is calculable from the creatinine level to help determine the degree of renal impairment. In patients with possible cardiorenal syndrome type 5, further investigations including blood & urine cultures, lupus serologies (antinuclear antibody [ANA], anti-double-stranded DNA, serum complement levels [C3, C4]), and a procalcitonin may be useful. An electrocardiogram and cardiac monitoring should be included in the initial evaluation to evaluate for any underlying arrhythmias that may be contributing to or resulting from the cardiorenal syndrome. A transthoracic echocardiogram is invaluable in evaluating for wall motion abnormalities, obtaining measurements such as the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and determining whether or not there is a pericardial effusion. A renal ultrasound can help evaluate kidney size and function. Smaller kidney disease and increased renal echogenicity are consistent with chronic kidney disease.
