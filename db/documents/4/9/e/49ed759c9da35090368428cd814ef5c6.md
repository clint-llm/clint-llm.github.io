- Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for the function of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, anticoagulation proteins C, S, and Z, osteocalcin, matrix GLA protein, and many other non-hematologic proteins.

- Direct vitamin K testing and body concentration are difficult to assess due to interfering substances, different vitamers, and tissue distribution.

- PIVKA-II is currently the best test commonly available to determine vitamin K status.

- There is no known toxicity associated with high levels of vitamin K.

- Formulations of vitamin K have some association with rare anaphylactoid reactions.
