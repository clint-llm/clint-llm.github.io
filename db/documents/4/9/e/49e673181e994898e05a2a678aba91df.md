Ionizing radiations generate free radicles, which subsequently damage vital cellular components and lead to double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs), resulting in chromosomal aberrations and rearrangements. These lethally damaged cells may continue to divide a limited number of times before undergoing mitotic or apoptotic cell death, explaining the latency of acute side effects. Normal cells can repair DNA breaks better than tumor cells.Â Some cells undergo apoptosis due to the resulting damage, and some cells die during mitosis due to improperly repaired chromosomal damage.
