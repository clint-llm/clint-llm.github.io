In the United States, this type of issue is managed by various professionals in eye care. Optometrists and ophthalmologists frequently collaborate in the management of patients with aphakia. Since each case is individualized, the role of each provider varies. Nonsurgical management, such as spectacle measurements, contact lens fitting, amblyopia, and strabismus management, may involve the optometrist, ophthalmologist, or both. Surgical interventions are performed exclusively by an ophthalmologist.
