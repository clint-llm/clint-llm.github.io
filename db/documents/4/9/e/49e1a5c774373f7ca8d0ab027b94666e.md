Although nummular headache is a primary headache disorder, the possibility of a secondary cause mimicking the symptoms require rigorous exclusion through neurologic exams, laboratory tests, and neuroimaging. The nurse practitioner, primary care provider, emergency department physician, neurologist, andÂ an internist should inform the patient about the benign nature of this disorder. However, any focal neurologic symptoms, new-onset headache, persistent or morning headaches apart from the nummular headache, should prompt a physician consultation.

Nummular headaches, along with all headaches disorders, are best addressed in a collaborative, interprofessional team approach regarding both diagnosis and treatment. This healthcare team includes physicians and specialists, neuroscience specialty trained nursing staff, and pharmacists, working collaboratively to bring about optimal patient care and results. Often the pharmacist will need to assist in medication management and assist in educating the patient regarding compliance. A coordinated interprofessional approach will result in the best outcomes.
