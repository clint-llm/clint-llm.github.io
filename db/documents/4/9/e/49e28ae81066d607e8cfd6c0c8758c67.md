The management of type 1 diabetes requires a diabetes healthcare team may include the medical provider, nurse, diabetes educator, dietician, social worker, and psychologist; However, not all specialties are always available, convenient, or covered by insurance. Contact between the child and family and medical team between in-office visits is frequent, at least initially, while treatment is adjusted and the family learns the daily management tasks of caring for a child with diabetes. The patient and family make long-term day to day treatment decisions.

A social worker should be involved to ensure that the child has adequate support and finances for treatment. An exercise specialist should teach the child what exercises may be beneficial. The diabetic nurse should assess the child's growth, blood pressure and injection site at every home visit. Because many children with diabetes become depressed, a mental health nurse should provide counseling. The nursing staff should assist with the coordination of care and education of the patient and family with the clinicians.

All patients and their families need comprehensive education about the disease and its potential complications. In addition, all diabetics should be referred to an ophthalmologist, nephrologist, cardiologist and a neurologist for baseline workup of their respective organ systems.

The provider will also screen for associated disorders (e.g., thyroid disease, celiac disease, dyslipidemia), ensure screening for complications of chronic hyperglycemia (e.g., retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy), and ongoing healthcare maintenance such as influenza vaccine. A detailed description of diabetes care is documented in the American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes publication which is updated each January in the journal Diabetes Care.
