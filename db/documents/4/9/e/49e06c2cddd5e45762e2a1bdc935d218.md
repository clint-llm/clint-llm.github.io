The prognosis of myocarditis varies by the type and etiology of the disease. Viral myocarditis usually resolves spontaneously. Even fulminant myocarditis which is marked by severe ventricular impairment and multiple foci of myocarditis (while it might require aggressive interventions during the active phase of the disease) eventually resolves completely.

The presence of biventricular dysfunction at the time of diagnosis is a major predictor of death or the need for a cardiac transplant.
