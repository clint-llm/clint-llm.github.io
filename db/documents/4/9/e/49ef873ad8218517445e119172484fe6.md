The key area of interprofessional communication for treating patients with A. haemolyticum is the coordination between clinicians, clinical laboratory microbiologists, and pharmacists. Clinicians need to communicate with the laboratory if they are considering this diagnosis in order to make sure that pharyngeal culture specimens are handled properly. Infectious disease specialty consultation may be useful. Coordination with the laboratory and pharmacy may be necessary in cases where non-beta lactam antibiotics may be needed for the treatment of patients with a known allergy or intolerance. This coordination will ensure that patients who have pharyngitis that is not caused by S.Â pyogenes have the best clinical outcomes. Evidence for the findings discussed in this article is all from historical cohort or case-control studies and case series, studies with no controls, and expert opinion.
