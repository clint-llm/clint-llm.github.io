**Dealing with Perianal Complications in Crohn's Disease: A Need for an Interprofessional Approach**

**Lack of Medical Evidence**

Perianal abscess in patients with Crohn disease causes significant morbidity. Even though there are several treatments for perianal abscess, very few are based on evidence.

- Colorectal surgeon

- Dietitian to determine the need for nutrition

- Gastroenterologist to monitor for Crohn's disease

- Nurses to educate the patient on perianal complications

- Pharmacists to follow the prescribed drugs and ensure that the patient is not developing adverse drug reactions

**Outcomes**

The outcomes of perianal abscess treatment depend on the timing of the surgery. Patients with early diagnosis and treatment tend to have good outcomes, but those who have a delay in treatment usually have prolonged hospital course, need for repeated surgical treatments at higher risk of recurrence. The key to improving outcomes is to follow the patient and monitor for any perianal symptoms closely.
