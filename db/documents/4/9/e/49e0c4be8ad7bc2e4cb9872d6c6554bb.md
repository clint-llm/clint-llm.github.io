Although head injury can lead to fatal brain injury and death, the majority of skull fractures are simple and can be managed conservatively. A head injury with a skull fracture, understandably, can generate huge parental anxiety, and clinicians need to be equipped with information to educate parents and allay fears. In addition, addressing concerns about safeguarding and non-accidental injury should be dealt with openly and in a professional manner. When the discharge occurs directly from the emergency department, it should be to a safe environment with clear discharge instructions and return precautions.
