History should focus on ingestions within the last few hours. History of ingestion of herbal remedies should raise suspicion for strychnine poisoning. Recent cocaine or heroin use can be a useful historical clue, as sometimes illicit drugs are cut with strychnine. Time from exposure should be ascertained to evaluate the usefulness of gastrointestinal decontamination.

The physical exam should be comprised of basic emergency medical evaluation beginning with airway, breathing, and circulation. A temperature should be obtained to assess for hyperthermia from excessive muscle contraction. The airway should be secured if there are signs of respiratory distress. Severe acidosis from muscle contractions may result in paralysis, and respiratory muscle paralysis is a major cause of mortality.
