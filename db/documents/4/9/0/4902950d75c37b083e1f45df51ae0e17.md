Accurate preoperative pathological diagnosis of phyllodes tumors enables adequate surgical planning and avoidance of reoperation. The distinction between phyllodes tumor and fibroadenoma is important but can be difficult on core biopsy.

The primary care provider and nurse practitioner must refer patients with suspected breast masses to an oncologist for further workup. Treatment can be either wide local excision or mastectomy to achieve histologically clear margins. After the treatment of phyllodes tumor, long-term follow-up by the primary care providers/nurse practitioner is necessary to detect local and distant relapse.
