Therapeutic monitoring includes periodic blood pressure assessments, heart rate, and electrocardiograms. When treating hypertension and arrhythmias, objective findings assess the therapy's efficacy. In contrast, subjective findings, such as a patient's frequency and severity of chest pain, are used to evaluate effectiveness when treating chronic angina.

A comprehensive metabolic panel is also performed at baseline to track potential changes in electrolytes and kidney and liver function.

Additional monitoring is required when using diltiazem parenterally. When treating arrhythmias, an IV bolus is administered over two minutes. Continuous blood pressure and ECG monitoring are necessary during bolus administration.

For the treatment of hypertension during pregnancy, recommendations state that using an alternative agent, since diltiazem has shown adverse fetal effects in animal studies. If a patient is controlled on diltiazem to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, diltiazem therapy may continue, but additional fetal monitoring is required.

Similarly, serum digoxin levels should be monitored with concurrent administration of diltiazem. Clinicians should monitor apixaban anti-Xa assay or heparin anti-Xa assay to decide if patients require dose adjustment to reduce adverse events in patients prescribed apixaban and concomitant p-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 inhibitors like diltiazem with statins.
