The prevalence and relative etiologies for unconsciousness vary by institution and patient population.  A high-volume trauma center will likely see a significant amount of unconscious patients related to traumatic brain injury. Overall, the most prevalent etiology of non-traumatic coma was ischemic or hemorrhage stroke (6 to 54%), followed by anoxia injury (3 to 42%), poisoning (1 to 39%), and metabolic (1 to 29%). Despite stroke being the overall most common cause of non-traumatic coma, the total non-structural causes (37 to 75%) tended to slightly outnumber the structural causes (28 to 64%).

Overall mortality is 25-87%. Stroke and anoxic coma had the highest mortality at 60 to 95% and 54 to 89% respectively. The lowest mortality was found in epilepsy and poisoning, which both had rates less than 10%.
