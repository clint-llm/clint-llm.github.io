The focus of replanting any part of the upper extremity is maximizing functional outcome rather than the simple survival of the amputated part. Functional outcomes are dependent on anatomical characteristics of the injury as well as patient-specific factors. Anatomical considerations include the level of amputation and the degree injury to the arterial intima and other soft tissue structures. Other considerations must focus on patient factors such as age, occupation, and cultural significance attributed to the hands.
