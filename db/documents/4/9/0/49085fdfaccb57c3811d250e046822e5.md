Contraindications for oral or transdermal estrogen-based therapies include:

- Known, suspected, or history of breast cancer

- Known or suspected history of other estrogen-based cancer, i.e., uterine cancer. Women who have had a hysterectomy and have no remaining evidence of disease are still candidates for HRT

- Active deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or a history of DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE)

- History of blood clotting disorder, the most common being Factor V Leiden mutation carriers

- Active or history of arterial thrombotic diseases such as myocardial infarction or stroke

- Chronic liver disease or dysfunction

- Migraine with aura

These contraindications do not apply to transvaginal based estrogen therapies, as the serum concentration of estrogen from this route is extremely low. The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) has recommended that the black-box warning that applies to conventional HRT not be applied to transvaginal estrogen treatments.
