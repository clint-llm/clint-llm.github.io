**Anorexia Nervosa**

- Anorexia nervosa is the most familiar and well-studied eating disorder.

-  Anorexia nervosa usually develops during adolescence and occurs more in women than men

- The characteristics features of anorexia nervosa are as follows,

- 
              
- Extremely underweight 
              
              
- Intense fear of gaining weight
              
              
- a distorted body image, including denial of being seriously underweight
              
              
- Persistent compensatory behaviors to avoid gaining weight, despite being underweight
              
              
- Preoccupation with food and weight

- Individuals with anorexia nervosa might have obsessive-compulsive symptoms like using the same cutlery or breaking the food into small pieces.

- In women, anorexia nervosa could manifest as amenorrhea, which is defined as the absence of at least three consecutive menstrual cycles. However, amenorrhea is no longer a mandatory criterion in DSM 5 to diagnose anorexia nervosa.

- Anorexia nervosa is of 2 types.

- In the Restricting type, individuals lose weight through fasting or excessive exercise. 
- In the Binge eating/purging type, individuals binge on large amounts of food and purge after that. They purge by self-induced vomiting, laxative/diuretic usage.

- The mortality rate in Anorexia nervosa is the highest of any psychiatric disorders.

- Anorexia nervosa is complicated by dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis causing hypothalamic amenorrhea and dysregulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis causing hypercortisolemia and growth hormone resistance.

**Bulimia Nervosa**

- Bulimia nervosa is substantially more common than anorexia nervosa in the population,

- The disorder generally starts in late adolescence or early adulthood.

- The characteristic features of bulimia nervosa are as follow,

- 
              
- Eating substantial amounts of food in a short period,
              
              
- Loss of control during binge eating,
              
              
- Binge eating is followed by compensatory behavior to prevent weight gain like forced vomiting, laxatives/diuretics usage, restricted eating, or excessive exercise.
              
              
- Fear of gaining weight despite weighing normal range

- DSM 5 criteria for diagnosing bulimia nervosa require at least one binge-eating episode with compensatory behavior in a week for a minimum of 3 months.

- Bulimia nervosa can manifest with a sore throat, swollen salivary glands, tooth decay, acid reflux, severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and hormonal disturbances.

- Individuals with bulimia nervosa may be underweight, normal weight, or slightly overweight. Even those who lost weight initially tend to regain and become overweight later gradually.

- Though symptoms of Bulimia nervosa are very similar to binge eating/purging subtypes of anorexia nervosa, persons with bulimia nervosa maintain near normal weight instead of being underweight.

**Binge Eating Disorder (BED)**

- BED is the most common eating disorder.

- BED usually begins in adolescence. One-third of BED patients are male.

- Individuals with binge eating disorder eat enormous amounts of food in a short period, accompanied by loss of control during binge-eating behavior.

- The binge eating behavior in BED is identical to Bulimia nervosa or binge eating type of anorexia nervosa. Nevertheless, individuals with BED do not restrict eating or use purging behaviors to compensate.

- The characteristic feature of Binge eating disorders are as follows,

- 
              
- Eating substantial amounts of food in a short period,
              
              
- Loss of control during binge eating,
              
              
- Feeling guilt about binge eating,
              
              
- No compensatory or purging behaviors

- Binge eating disorder poses a risk of obesity and complications associated with obesity like diabetes, heart disease, or stroke.

- BED tends to remit and recur.

- Treatment for binge eating disorder should target decreasing binge eating behavior. The focus should not be targeting weight loss because this will increase binge eating behavior.

**Avoidant or Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)**

- Avoidant or restrictive food intake disorder is new terminology for "feeding disorder of infancy, toddlers and childhood."

- ARFID usually occurs during the first seven years of life. Sometimes it can persist into adulthood.

- Picky eating in early childhood is normal behavior, which is not included under ARFID.

- ARFID can be due to loss of interest in eating, intense dislike for specific tastes, smells, texture, or colors.

- ARFID does not include the restriction of foods due to religious reasons or lack of availability.

- ARFID impairs social function and inhibits the individual from eating with others. Also, it causes underweight and micronutrient deficiency.

- Cognitive behavior therapy can be used for managing ARFID in individuals above ten years of age.

**Pica**

- Pica is one of the eating disorders in which an individual craves non-food items like soil, chalk, soap, paper, ice hair.

- Pica is common among pregnant women, children, and intellectually disabled persons.

- Pica is benign and self-resolving in pregnant and children. However, it can be chronic and devastating in intellectually disabled persons.

- Pica poses a risk for parasitic infections, micronutrient deficiency, intestinal obstruction, and heavy metal poisoning.

- The treatment strategy for pica includes decreasing the exposure to the craved items, micronutrient supplementation, and behavioral/aversive treatment, particularly among mentally disabled individuals.

**Rumination Disorder**

- Rumination disorder is a new addition to the eating disorder in which an individual regurgitates the previously swallowed food, chews it again, and then swallows or spits.

- Rumination is a voluntary action that usually happens within 30 minutes after having the food.

- Rumination developed in infancy usually resolves by 12 months. Rumination disorder in children and adults can lead to weight loss or malnutrition.

- Rumination disorder can be a comorbid condition in Anorexia nervosa.

- Postprandial high-resolution impedance-pH manometry contributes to a more detailed description of rumination events. The rumination syndrome can be diagnosed if reflux events extending to the proximal esophagus is closely associated with an increase in intragastric pressure more than 30 mm Hg.

- Biofeedback therapy reduces regurgitation episodes in rumination. Biofeed back techniques like re-education of abdominal contractions and diaphragmatic breathing are used.

**Other Specified Feeding and Eating Disorder (OSFED)**

The terminology EDNOS (Eating disorder - not otherwise specified) in DSM-IV is changed to the Other Specified Feeding and Eating Disorder (OSFED) in DSM 5. It includes purging disorder, night eating syndrome, atypical anorexia nervosa, and subclinical bulimia nervosa / binge eating disorder. These eating disorders share the same concern about eating, body shape, and weight and have disordered eating behavior. Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder, pica disorder, and rumination disorder are not included in this subsection because weight and shape concerns are not a feature in these disorders. Many people with an atypical eating disorder will later develop a typical eating disorder.

- **Purging disorder**is characterized by the purging behaviors like vomiting, excessive exercising, using laxatives or diuretics to control weight. They do not have binge eating. The complications of Purging disorders are similar to Bulimia nervosa like metabolic disturbances, electrolyte imbalances, dental issues, oral bleeding due to esophageal tears, and swollen parotid glands. The management of purging disorder is similar to bulimia nervosa.

- **Night eating syndrome**is characterized by overeating, often after awakening from sleep. It has a strong association with sleep disturbance. The management is similar to Binge eating disorder.

- **Atypical anorexia nervosa**has similar features to anorexia nervosa except for BMI in the ‘adequate’ range of 20–25 kg/m2 or higher. Management is similar to anorexia nervosa.

- **Subthreshold bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder**do not meet the ideal definition criteria of bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder.

- **Orthorexia -**Orthorexia has yet to be recognized as a separate eating disorder by the current DSM. Individuals with orthorexia have an obsessive focus on healthy eating. Individuals with orthorexia may eliminate entire food groups, fearing they are unhealthy.
