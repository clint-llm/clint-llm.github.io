Using phase-contrast MR imaging, CSF flow through the cerebral aqueduct has some physiologic age and sex-related variants. The maximum aqueduct CSF flow in the aqueduct is higher in younger individuals compared to CSF flow in the elderly. Peak CSF velocity also decreases with age in both the caudal and cranial direction. As the brain ages, the parenchyma begins to soften causing decreased elasticity. CSF flow dynamics show a smooth sine wave-form that develops with age due to this physiologic change. Males have higher aqueduct CSF stroke volumes as well as higher average aqueduct CSF flow rates compared to their female counterparts. These physiological variants are essential to consider when looking at aqueduct pathological changes.
