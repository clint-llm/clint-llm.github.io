Determining serum and urine osmolality and identifying the difference between the calculated and measured osmolality (measurement of osmolar gap) are essential components in diagnosing and treating patients in various clinical scenarios. The modern osmometers in clinical laboratories are simple to operate and produce rapid and accurate results using a small volume of specimens. For better patient management, it is recommended that osmolality measurements are performed stat. This ensures better accuracy and minimum errors. Effective communication between all members of a patient's interprofessional care team, from laboratory technologists to nurses, physicians, pharmacists, and other health professionals, is necessary for patients to receive appropriate and timely medical care. A systematic process for stat measurement of osmolality is beneficial, as is a properly equipped and calibrated osmometer and fully qualified and trained laboratory technologists to run this instrument.
