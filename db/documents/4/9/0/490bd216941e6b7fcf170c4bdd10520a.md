Healthcare workers and patients that self-catheterize should receive education about the risks associated with improper catheterization techniques and have appropriate training to avoid urethral injuries. Also, community education on how to prevent motor vehicle injuries, and the proper use of seatbelts can decrease urethral injuries. Finally, inappropriate patient self-extraction of Foley catheters with resultant urethral trauma can be minimized by implementation of a prevention plan as described above.
