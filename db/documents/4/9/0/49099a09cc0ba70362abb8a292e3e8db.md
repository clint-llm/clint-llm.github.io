The oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe is a systemic illness that impacts morbidity and mortality if poorly controlled. Optimizing the quality of life in patients requires a multidisciplinary and interprofessional team approach to treatment.

Clinicians involved in the care of patients with Lowe syndrome may include pediatric ophthalmologists, nephrologists, neurologists, endocrinologists, and dentists. Geneticists and genetic counselors should work with the patient’s family to discuss genetic testing options and results. Physical and speech therapists implement early rehabilitation and help achieve developmental milestones. Behavioral and child development specialists are also important members of the care team.

All interprofessional team members must be able to contact other team members if they note any concerns or changes in the patient's condition. Further, every team member must keep accurate records of all observations and interactions with the patient, so the entire care team operates from the same accurate, up-to-date information and better optimize care.
