Simulation is important to clinical education. Simulation leads to increased student and resident knowledge and confidence and reduces risks to patient safety.

The benefits of simulation are abundant, but the costs associated with simulation should not be overlooked. Mannequins and high-fidelity simulation may require costly maintenance and repairs. Hiring the appropriate staff to lead the simulations, as well as their continuing education to further improve their skills, can also be costly. These costs must be weighed against the budget of the program looking to add them to their curriculum.
