Distal femur fractures and hip fractures have a well-established mortality rate of 30%. Streubel et al. analyzed 92 patients from 1992 to 2009, with an average age of 77.9 years. 78% of the patients were female.  The majority of fractures were closed (95%) and extraarticular (76%). 52% of fractures occurred around a total knee arthroplasty. The overall mortality rate was 38% with a ten year follow up. Mortality rate increased over their time frames of 30 days, six months, and one year. Their rates were 6%, 18%, and 25%, respectively. Streubel et al. outlined several factors that correlate with successful patient outcomes. Patients with poor preoperative medical status, advanced age, and restricted ambulatory status tend to have a complicated postoperative course plagued with numerous medical complications. Complex fracture morphology and fractures with significant bone loss are best suited for surgeons with considerable experience in overcoming these obstacles.
