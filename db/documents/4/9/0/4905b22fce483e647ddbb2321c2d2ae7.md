Alopecia areata seems to have a genetic basis. A 55% concordance rate between identical twins has been observed.  Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) metanalysis have localized the HLA signal of AA mostly to the HLA-DRB1. One locus harboring the genes that encode the natural killer cell receptor D (NKG2D) was implicated in AA and not in other autoimmune diseases, which suggests a key role in pathogenesis. Therefore, CD8+ NKG2D T cells have been a subject of study and found to be the major effectors in AA.
