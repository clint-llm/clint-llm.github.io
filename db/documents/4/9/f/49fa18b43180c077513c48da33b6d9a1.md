Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a condition resulting from a developmental defect in the diaphragm leading to protrusion of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity. Depending on the location of the defect in the diaphragm, the hernias can be classified into different types. Bochdalek hernias result from a defect in the postero-lateral part of the diaphragm and are the most common type (70% to 75%), with the majority occurring on the left side and less frequently on the right side. Morgagni hernias result from a defect in the anteromedial part of the diaphragm (20% to 25%), and central hernias account for 2% to 5%. Bilateral defects are very rare and associated with a poor prognosis. Acquired diaphragmatic hernia, which is most often a result of trauma to the diaphragm, and is not discussed here.
