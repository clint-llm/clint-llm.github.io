Supportive interventions were the mainstay for treating cardiac glycoside toxicity before the advent of digoxin immune fab (DIF). In 1976, Smith et al. reported the first use of these antibody fragments, and they were made commercially available by 1986.

**Current FDA Approved Indications**

- Chronic ingestion of digoxin, leading to a steady-state concentration of >4 ng/mL in children or >6 ng/mL in adults.

- Acute ingestion of a fatal digoxin dose - this includes accidental or suicidal consumption of >10 mg in a healthy adult or >4 mg (>0.1 mg/kg) in a healthy child.

- Ingestion that results in an acute steady serum concentration of 10 ng/mL or more

- Digoxin overdose resulting in life-threatening instances such as : 

- Symptomatic and hemodynamically significant bradycardia
- Asystole
- Atropine non-responsive second or third-degree Atrioventricular heart block
- Ventricular tachycardia
- Ventricular fibrillation
- Signs and symptoms of end-organ dysfunction
- Serum potassium >5.5 mEq/L in adults
- Serum potassium >6 mEq/L in children

- FDA labeled orphan drug, also beneficial for Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.

**Non-FDA Approved Indications**

Several studies have yielded a comfortable degree of cross-reactivity between digoxin and other plant-derived cardiac glycosides.Acokanthera oblongifolia, Adonis microcarpa (pheasants eye), Asclepias physocarpa (balloon cotton bush), Bryophyllum tubiflorum (mother of millions), Calotropis procera (kings crown), Carissa laxiflora, Cerbera manghas (sea-mango), Cryptostegia grandiflora (rubber-vine), Nerium oleander, Thevetia peruviana (yellow oleander), Indian hemp and Cerbera odollam (pong-pong seeds).
