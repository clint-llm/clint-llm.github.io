There have been many studies examining the variations in the branching patterns of the femoral vessels. In most people, the lateral femoral circumflex artery (LFCA) branches from the deep femoral artery just superior to the origin of the medial femoral circumflex artery (MFCA). In some cases, the lateral femoral circumflex artery and the medial circumflex artery branch from the deep femoral artery at the same level. The lateral femoral circumflex artery may also directly branch from the femoral artery both above and below the level where the deep femoral artery branches from the femoral artery.

An article by Tomaszewski, Vikse, et al.,

- Type 1 (normal): LFCA branches from the deep femoral artery superior to the origin of the MFCA

- Type 2: The LFCA branches from the common femoral artery above the origin of the deep femoral artery

- Type 3: The LFCA branches from the common femoral artery at the level of the origin of the deep femoral artery

- Type 4: The LFCA branches from the superficial femoral artery

- Type 5: The lateral ascending and lateral descending branches of the LFCA individually branch from either the common femoral artery, deep femoral artery or superficial femoral artery and do not originate from a common branch (i.e., LFCA).

These types have also been reported in other anatomic studies as well.

One study also reported that the diameter of the femoral vessels was greater in males than in females.

Prakash et al. hypothesized that the anatomical variations of the femoral artery branches exist because of an evolutionary shift in the origin of the deep femoral artery. The deep femoral artery used to be a branch of the internal iliac artery, and over the course of evolution, now branches from the femoral artery.
