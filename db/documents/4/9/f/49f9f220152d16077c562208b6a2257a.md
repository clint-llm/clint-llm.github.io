In six per 1000 live births, congenital cardiac malformations occur. Ventricular septal defects (VSD), atrial septal defects, and tetralogy of Fallot among the commonest.Â  Tetralogy of Fallot consists of a combination of VSD of the membranous portion of the interventricular septum, stenosis of the orifice of the pulmonary artery, the aortic orifice overriding the VSD, and hypertrophy of the right ventricle. This requires surgical correction, usually at an early age.
