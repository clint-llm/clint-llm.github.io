The obstructive type of middle lobe syndrome usually results from extrinsic compression of the right middle lobe bronchus resulting from peribronchial lymphadenopathy or tumors that exploit the anatomic peculiarities of the right middle lobe bronchus

Extrinsic compression may involve a plethora of tumors, including hamartomas, primary lung cancers, and distant metastasis from unknown primaries.

In the nonobstructive type, there is no identifiable obstruction on bronchoscopic evaluation, and the physiological basis of the recurrent atelectasis is poorly understood. The collateral ventilation of the middle lobe constitutes a zone of high resistance in comparison to the upper lobes, as a result of the higher ratio of pleural to the non-pleural surface area. The hypothesis is that ineffective collateral ventilation may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of middle lobe syndrome. Nonobstructive middle lobe syndrome is usually due to transient hypoventilation in the setting of chronic inflammatory and infectious changes (in conditions like cystic fibrosis) due to a wide array of infections, pulmonary infarcts, bronchopulmonary cysts, or disease processes that predispose to bronchiectasis.
