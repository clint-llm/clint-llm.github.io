There is no indication to use opioids in the treatment of CNCP however for many years, opioids have been the standard of care for the management of acute and chronic pain related to severe medical diseases like cancer. Due to the potential for abuse and addiction, the effectiveness of opioids in the treatment of CNCP has been controversial and challenging. Patients are overtreated or undertreated. There is little evidence to support the efficacy of opioids in the management of CNCP.

The limitation of data from most studies is that they exclude patients with a history of drug use or dependency, so clinicians do not have accurate information about the efficacy of opioids used for CNCP. Furthermore, the fact that using opioids can interfere with patients' employment status, functionality, and quality of life should force clinicians to consider other treatment options in the management of CNCP. Inadequate treatment of pain in patients with a previous history of dependency and addiction is also another management challenge of which physicians need to be aware. In this group of patients, there is a propensity for providers to attribute pain complaints and requests for pain medication to drug-seeking or addictive behavior instead of a true pain disorder.[11]
