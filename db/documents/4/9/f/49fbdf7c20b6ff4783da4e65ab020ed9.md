A Chance fracture is an unstable, flexion-distraction injury of the spine, typically at the thoracolumbar junction, with a horizontal fracture through the spinous process, pedicles, and vertebral body.

Also known as a “seatbelt fracture,” the most common mechanism of injury is a rapid deceleration in a motor vehicle collision, with flexion of the spine over the lap seat belt.

The incidence of concurrent intra-abdominal injuries is as high as 50%, with bowel perforation and mesenteric laceration being the most common types of injuries. A “seatbelt sign,” or bruising/abrasion on the abdomen in the distribution of a seat belt, should greatly elevate concern for Chance fracture and intra-abdominal injury. This sign can also be identified on computed tomography of the abdomen by inspecting the subcutaneous soft tissues of the anterior abdominal wall.
