**Hypothyroidism**

Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy may result in adverse maternal and fetal outcomes including preterm labor, preeclampsia, preterm delivery, gestational hypertension, postpartum hemorrhage, low birth weight, neuropsychological and cognitive impairment in the fetus, and increased perinatal morbidity and mortality.

**Hyperthyroidism**

Similarly, untreated or inadequately treated hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm labor, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, low birth weight, stillbirth, and fetal malformations.
