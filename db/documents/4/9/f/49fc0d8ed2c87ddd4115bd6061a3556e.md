Although the initial lesions of pityriasis alba are mildly erythematous, the erythematous stage may go unnoticed. The most common presentation is asymptomatic (or mildly pruritic), hypopigmented lesions, often on the face. The patient or family history may include atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, or asthma. The lesions may be an incidental finding on physical examination, although concern about the cosmetic appearance of the lesions on the part of the patient or the parent often leads to a consultation with a healthcare provider. The hypopigmentation often becomes more apparent with sun exposure (and darkening of the surrounding skin) during the spring and summer.

Physical examination reveals multiple round or oval-shaped hypopigmented macules or patches (or thin papules and plaques) with indistinct margins. There may be mild erythema and/or scaling. The lesions most commonly number from four to 20, measure 0.5 cm - 5 cm in size, and are distributed predominantly on the face, neck, upper arms, and upper trunk. Signs of atopic dermatitis may be present, including an eczematous rash in the popliteal or antecubital fossa, nipple eczema, cheilitis, and infra-auricular fissuring.

It is important to carefully examine the patient because the scaly lesions may often represent psoriasis.
