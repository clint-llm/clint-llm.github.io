Axillary lymphadenectomy does carry increased morbidity when compared to sentinel lymph node biopsy, which is, in part, why it is performed more selectively in recent years. Typical complications with any surgery include infection and bleeding. Complications specific to this procedure include temporarily decreased range of motion of the shoulder, hematoma, lymphedema, lymphocele, lymphatic fibrosis, lymphangiosarcoma, injury to vasculature, or nerves within the region, or axillary vein thrombosis. Drains are placed commonly after this procedure, and while not a complication in itself, prolonged need for the drain can be a complication. Typically after an axillary lymphadenectomy is performed, there is not a need for additional surgery in the same region, unless there is an axillary recurrence in the future.
