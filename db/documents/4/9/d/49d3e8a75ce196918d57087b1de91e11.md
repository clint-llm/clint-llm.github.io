Cadaveric studies have reported significant variation in the course of the genitofemoral nerve in over half of specimens.

While most specimens exhibit a predictable bifurcation pattern of the nerve in the mid-substance of the psoas muscle, a recent study noted that the genitofemoral nerve prematurely bifurcates in the upper portion of the psoas muscle about 20% of the time.  Also, the femoral and genital branches do not form a common trunk within the psoas muscle and remain as distinct nerves as they course in the retroperitoneum.
