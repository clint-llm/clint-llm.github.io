The pathogenesis of AGEP is partially, but not yet fully, understood. AGEP is typically described as a T-cell-mediated type IV hypersensitivity reaction with neutrophilic inflammation. After exposure to a triggering factor, such as a new medication, host proteins bind drug metabolites to form an epitope captured by antigen-presenting cells. Drug-specific CD4+ and CD8+ cells are then activated and migrate to the skin, then cytotoxic proteins (perforin, granzyme B, Fas ligand) are released to induce keratinocyte apoptosis. This creates vesicles that become sterile pustules as neutrophils are recruited via CXCL8 and IL-8. Interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) propagates additional neutrophil recruitment via additional CXCL8, while granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) protects the neutrophils from apoptosis.

The innate immune system's involvement has also been implicated based on elevated IL-17 and IL-22 in peripheral blood samples of AGEP patients. Th17 cells produce IL-17 and IL-22, which stimulate additional IL-8 production from keratinocytes, thereby propagating neutrophil recruitment and pustule formation.

Furthermore, IL-36 gene mutations resulting in dysregulated IL-36 signaling have been associated with AGEP, implying participation of the IL-36 pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade in the propagation of this condition.
