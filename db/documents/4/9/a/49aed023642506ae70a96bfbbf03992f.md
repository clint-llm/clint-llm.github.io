The exact cause of the disease process is still unclear, and some authors consider it a part of the aging process due to involutional changes of the fatty peri-ductal tissue, but this hypothesis cannot fully explain cases reported in children and young adults. Pregnancy, lactation, and abortion history are all inconsistently related to the development of MDE. Histopathologic findings demonstrate plugging of the lactiferous duct system with thick secretions and cellular debris, with subsequent duct dilatation. It is not known yet what are the underlying factors that initiate the disease.
