The following are the risk factors for DDH include female sex, first-born infant, breech positioning in the third trimester, swaddling, postmaturity, LGA, conditions causing limited in utero space, and family history.

- Female sex: Approximately 4 times that of boys. The increased incidence is probably due to ligamentous laxity from maternal hormones. The odds ratio for the female sex is 4.14 (3.0 to 5.7).

- Breech position in the last trimester is the most significant risk factor for DDH. The odds ratio is 5.47 (2.58 to 11.6). The procedures that decrease the time spent in the breech Position, like the external cephalic version and pre-labor CS, reduce the risk for DDH.

- Family history: Many genes have postulated in the Asian population: COL2A1, DKK1, HOXB9, HOXD9, WISP3. The relative risk is 1.72 (0.05 to 55.00). The risk of recurrence is high approximately 6%. Robert et al.

- Swaddling in the adducted and extended position explains the increased incidence in specific populations including American Indians, Japanese and Turkish infants. Many international societies like AAP(American academy of pediatrics, Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America(POSNA), International hip dysplasia recommend hip-healthy swaddling.

- Any physical limitation(LGA, oligohydramnios, twins) in utero can contribute to DDH. It also increases the risk of other abnormalities like Metatarsus adducts, congenital muscular torticollis, and congenital knee dislocation.

- Postmaturity is a risk factor. Prematurity is not associated with increased risk.
