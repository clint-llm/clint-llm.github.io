Muscles, tendons, vessels, and connective tissue derive from the mesodermal germ layer. The mesodermal germ layer has mesenchymal tissue. The mesenchyme tissue will differentiate into the structures formed by the mesoderm layer. The muscles and tendons will grow as the limbs elongate. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) induces elongation of the limbs.
