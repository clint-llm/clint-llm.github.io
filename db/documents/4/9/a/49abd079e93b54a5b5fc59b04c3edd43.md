The supraorbital nerve block is a procedure performed to provide immediate localized anesthesia for a multitude of injuries such as complex lacerations to the forehead, upper eyelid laceration repair, debridement of abrasions, or burns to the forehead, removal of foreign bodies, or pain relief from acute herpes zoster. A regional block allows for minimal anesthetic use, which permits the operator to obtain the intended anesthesia over a larger surface area versus that of local infiltration. The smaller anesthetic volume used also allows for minimal dissemination of anesthetic into tissues, which willÂ prevent the distortion of normal anatomy during the intended procedure.
