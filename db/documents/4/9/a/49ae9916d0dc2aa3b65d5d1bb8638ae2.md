TSH is the first-line screening test for both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism since changes in TSH occur earlier that changes in T3/T4. If values are outside the range of 0.4 to 4.5 milliunits per liter (mU/L), measuring T3 and T4 should follow. However, TSH is always the best first test because it is more reliable than plasma T3/T4 levels, which tend to fluctuate. In primary hypothyroidism, TSH levels are elevated due to the loss of negative inhibition on the anterior pituitary. In contrast, in primary hyperthyroidism, TSH levels go down.

Another relevant test when it comes to thyroid disease is thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI). The test is diagnostic for a condition called Grave's disease. As discussed later, Grave's disease is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of autoantibodies in the blood that exert TSH-like effects. The antibodies stimulate TSHR on thyroid follicular cells leading to uncontrolled thyroid hormone synthesis and release. The test detects the presence of thyroid-stimulating antibodies (TSIs) in the blood.
