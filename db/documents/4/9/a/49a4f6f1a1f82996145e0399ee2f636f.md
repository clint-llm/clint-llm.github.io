HPV infection occurs in sexually active women of any age but is more common in adolescent women and women under the age of 30.  The highest incidence is in women ages 20 to 24.  These young women are the most likely to clear the infection to undetectable levels in an average of 8 months; this is the rationale for increasing the initiation of Pap smear screening to age 21.

Women over age 30 with HPV detected are more likely to have a persistent infection and warrant more aggressive follow-up to rule out cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
