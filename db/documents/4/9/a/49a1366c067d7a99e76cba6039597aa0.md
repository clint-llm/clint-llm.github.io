Nuclear medicine (NM) relies heavily on imaging and non-imaging instruments to accurately count and detect radiation. Gamma cameras (GC), also known as single-photonÂ emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), are standard imaging instruments used to capture two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) images.

Dose calibrators, radiation survey meters, and pocket dosimeters are examples of non-imaging tools used for various purposes, including dose measurement and radioactive contamination surveys. Furthermore, all of these instrument standards must be checked at multiple time intervals using different Quality Control (QC) procedures.

The majority of NM instrument QC procedures are recommended by vendors which are based on the specifications of international regulatory bodies, i.e., National Electrical Manufacturing Association (NEMA), American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM), Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI), and European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM).
