Classical teaching says thatÂ the median nerve innervates the lateral two lumbricals, and the ulnar nerve innervates the medial two lumbricals. While this is the case for roughly 50-60 percent of hands, 20-30 percent of hands have median nerve innervation to only the first lumbrical with approximately 20 percent of hands having median nerve innervation to the first three lumbricals.

Other physiological variations of the lumbrical muscles include a double first lumbrical and a bipennate second lumbrical, which were found in roughly 10 percent of specimens in one study. This study also found an absent third lumbrical in two percent of specimens.

Distal insertions sites also show high variability in the lumbricals, with an increasedg variability from lateral to medial lumbricals. Such locations include the proximal phalanx, volar aspect of the metacarpophalangeal joint, the extensor hood, or any combination of these sites.
