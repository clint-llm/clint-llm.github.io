The outcome of NH depends on the etiology and severity of the condition. NH associated with renal venous thrombosis, umbilical catheterization, or acute renal tubular necrosis are transient and resolve as the underlying disorder ameliorates. The presence of end-organ damage is associated with poor prognosis. Most newborns generally require drug therapy for a short period, and long-term therapy is infrequently needed. A retrospective study reported that only 15 percent of the 40 percent of infants who were discharged from the hospital on antihypertensive medication required treatment by the age of 3 to 6 months.

The natural history of NH is different from that of hypertension in older children. The median duration of therapy with antihypertensive drugs in infants in NICU  was reported to be ten days in a study that included 700 infants. Infants suffering from hypertension due to BPD are usually found to have their BP normalized on follow-up examinations.
