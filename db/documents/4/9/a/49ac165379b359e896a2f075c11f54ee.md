ALT enzyme catalyzes the transfer of amino groups from the L-alanine to alpha-ketoglutarate, and the conversion products are L-glutamate and pyruvate. The process is critical in the liver in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Pyruvate can be used in the citric acid cycle to produce cellular energy. The coenzyme needed for this reaction is pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, also known as vitamin B6.

The pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (P-5′-P)  is bound to the inactive apoenzyme and serves as a true prosthetic group. The pyridoxal 5'-phosphate attached to the apoenzyme accepts the amino group from the first substrate, aspartate or alanine, to form enzyme-bound pyridoxamine-5′-phosphate and the first reaction product, oxaloacetate or pyruvate, respectively.

Both coenzyme-deficient apoenzymes and holoenzymes may be present in serum.

ALT is found ubiquitously throughout the human body, in the kidney, myocardium, skeletal muscle, brain, pancreas, spleen, and lung. More specifically, the highest tissue concentration of ALT activity is in the cytosol of hepatocytes. The activity of ALT in hepatocytes is approximately 3000 times higher than that of serum ALT activity.
