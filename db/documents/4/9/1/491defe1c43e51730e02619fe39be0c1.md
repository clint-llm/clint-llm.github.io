The ionization constant of aspirin is 3, which makes it is more readily absorbed in acidic environments such as the stomach. A variety of factors can affect absorption. The formulation of the salicylate (extended vs. immediate release) being one. Food in the stomach at the time of ingestion can delay absorption. Aspirin has the propensity to form bezoars which will delay absorption. Aspirin can cause pyloric sphincter spasms, which increases the amount of time in the stomach allowing for more absorption.  Absorption continues in the small intestine.

The liver metabolizes salicylates by first-order elimination, and the inactive metabolites are then excreted in the urine. With increased salicylate levels, these pathways become saturated resulting in zero order elimination. Elimination is further delayed in patients with underlying renal and liver disease.

Dermal salicylate preparations have been shown to reach the bloodstream. However, the serum concentrations do not reach toxic levels. Theoretically, this may occur in children or patients with compromised skin, such as due to burns or psoriasis.
