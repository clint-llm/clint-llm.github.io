Tamoxifen exhibits both estrogenic agonist and antagonist effects in different parts of the body. It selectively binds to estrogen receptors, producing both estrogenic and anti-estrogen effects; because it has two actions, it is patient-specific as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM).

In the breast tissue, it antagonistically competes with estrogen for binding sites and causes antiestrogenic and antitumor effects. It slows cell cycling through downstream intracellular processes, whichÂ classifies it as cytostatic. In bone, it stimulates estrogen receptors instead of blocking them, exerting an estrogenic agonist effect, and may prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

Tamoxifen is metabolized hepatically via the CYP450 enzyme system; specifically, it is a 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 substrate. Its half-life is between 5 and 7 days as tamoxifen and 14 days as its active metabolite N-desmethyl-tamoxifen. It is primarily excreted in the feces.
