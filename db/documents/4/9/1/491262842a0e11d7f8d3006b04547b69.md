Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a disease of retinal vascular and capillary proliferation affecting premature infants undergoing oxygen therapy. Screening guidelines for this leading cause of childhood blindness are based upon gestational age and birth weight, although numerous factors increase both the incidence and severity of disease development. Early treatment of disease with cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy has improved visual outcomes for patients; however, early recognition through screening is critical. This activity demonstrates the keys to the prevention of ROP, highlights the multidisciplinary approach needed before the infant is born, and continuing throughout childhood.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of retinopathy of prematurity.
- Summarize the evaluation of retinopathy of prematurity.
- Outline the management options available for retinopathy of prematurity.
