**Surgical Management**

Early tonsil cancer is preferably managed with single modality treatment, with transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) having comparable oncological outcomes.

In more advanced disease, TLM or TORS can still be offered for early T3 tumors; however, this is often not possible for T4 malignancies. Most of these cases will instead undergo chemoradiotherapy, as a surgical intervention will usually require a mandibulotomy and extensive surgical reconstruction resulting in poor post-operative functional outcomes.

Given the high rate of nodal disease in both early and advanced tonsillar cancer, it is recommended that most cases undergoing surgical intervention should also have an elective level II to IV neck dissection.

**Oncological Management**

Primary radiotherapy for early tonsillar cancer has been shown to have good oncological outcomes and overall survival. Unilateral radiotherapy to levels II to IV can be used in non-lateralized cancers with a low rate of contralateral nodal recurrence and improved rates of radiation toxicity.

A previous Cochrane review has established chemoradiotherapy as the management of choice for advanced tonsil and oropharyngeal cancers.
