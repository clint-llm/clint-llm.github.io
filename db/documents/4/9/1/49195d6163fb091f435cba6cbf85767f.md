Hirayama is a rare nonfamiliar monomelic amyotrophy also known as benign juvenile brachial spinal muscular atrophy, juvenile asymmetric segmental spinal muscular atrophy, juvenile muscular atrophy of the distal upper extremity, monomelic amyotrophy, and oblique amyotrophy. Classically, it presents with muscle atrophy and weakness of bilateral or unilateral forearms and hands in the absence of sensory alterations, progressing for one to two years before plateauing. The condition is caused by a tight dural sac in the cervical canal that leads to chronic ischemic changes to the anterior horn cells. Although commonly considered a non-progressive and self-limiting disease, this has been a source of significant disability for some affected individuals. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with this condition and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical presentation of Hirayama disease.
- Review the etiology of Hirayama disease. 
- Summarize the typical clinical course of Hirayama disease.
- Explain strategies to improve care coordination between the interprofessional teams caring for patients with Hirayama disease to improve proper disease recognition and treatment and improve patient outcomes.
