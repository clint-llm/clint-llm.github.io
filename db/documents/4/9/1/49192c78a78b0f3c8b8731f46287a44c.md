The intrinsic muscles of the shoulder connect the scapula and/or clavicle to the humerus. These include

**Deltoid**

- Function:

- Anterior aspect is responsible for flexion and medial rotation of the arm
- Middle aspect is responsible for the abduction of the arm (up to 90 degrees)
- The posterior aspect is responsible for extension and lateral rotation of the arm

- Insertion: Deltoid tuberosity

- Innervation: Axillary nerve (C5, C6)

**Teres major**

- Innervation: Suprascapular nerve (C5, C6)

**Infraspinatus (Rotator Cuff)**

- Function: Lateral rotation of the arm, stabilize glenohumeral joint

- Origin: Posterior scapula, inferior to the scapular spine/Infraspinous fossa

- Insertion: Greater tubercle of the humerus, between the supraspinatus and teres minor insertion

- Innervation: Suprascapular nerve (C5, C6)

**Teres minor (Rotator Cuff)**

- Function: Lateral rotation of the arm, stabilize glenohumeral joint

- Origin: Inferior angle of the scapula

- Insertion: Inferior aspect of the greater tubercle

- Innervation: Axillary nerve (C5, C6)

**Subscapularis (Rotator Cuff)**

- Function: Adduction and medial rotation of the arm, stabilize glenohumeral joint

- Origin: Anterior aspect of the scapula

- Insertion: Lesser tubercle of the humerus

- Innervation: Subscapular nerves (C5, C6, C7)

Other muscles that affect movement at the shoulder joint include:

**Trapezius**

- Function:

- Upper fibers elevate the scapula and rotate it during abduction of the arm (90 to 180 degrees)
- Middle fibers retract the scapula
- Lower fibers pull the scapula inferiorly.

- Origin: Skull, nuchal ligament and the spinous processes of C7 to T12

- Insertion: clavicle, acromion and the scapular spine

- Innervation: Accessory nerve (C5, C6)

**Latissmus dorsi**

- Function: Extends, adducts and medially rotates the upper limb

- Origin: Spinous processes of T6 to T12, iliac crest, thoracolumbar fascia, and the inferior three ribs

- Insertion: Intertubercular sulcus of the humerus

- Innervation: Thoracodorsal nerve (C6, C7, C8)

**Levator scapulae**

- Function: Elevates the scapula

- Origin: Transverse processes of the C1 to C4 vertebrae

- Insertion: Medial border of the scapula

- Innervation: Dorsal scapular nerve (C5)

**Rhomboid major**

- Function: Retracts and rotates the scapula

- Origin: Spinous processes of T2 to T5 vertebrae

- Insertion: Inferomedial border of the scapula

- Innervation: Dorsal scapular nerve (C5)

**Rhomboid minor**

- Function: Retracts and rotates the scapula

- Origin: Spinous processes of C7 to T1 vertebrae

- Insertion: Medial border of the scapula

- Innervation: Dorsal scapular nerve (C5)

**Serratus anterior**

- Function: fixes the scapula into the thoracic wall, and aids in rotation and abduction of the arm (90 to 180 degrees)

- Origin: Surface of the upper eight ribs at the side of the chest

- Insertion: Along the entire anterior length of the medial border of the scapula

- Innervation: Long thoracic nerve (C5, C6, C7)

**Pectoralis major**

- Function:

- Clavicular head flexes and adducts arm
- Sternal head adducts and medially rotates the arm
- Accessory for inspiration

- Origin:

- Clavicular head: medial half clavicle
- Sternocostal head: Lateral manubrium and sternum, six upper costal cartilages and external oblique aponeurosis

- Insertion: Intertubercular groove of the proximal humerus on its lateral aspect

- Innervation: Medial and lateral pectoral nerves (C6, C7, C8)

**Pectoralis minor**

- Function: Depression of the shoulder, protraction of the scapula

- Origin: Third, fourth, fifth ribs close to their respective costal cartilages

- Insertion: Coracoid process

- Innervation: Medial pectoral nerve (C8, T1)

**Subclavius**

- Function: Depression and stabilization of the clavicle

- Origin: First rib medially

- Insertion: Middle of the clavicle, inferiorly

- Innervation: Nerve to subclavius (C5, C6)

**Coracobrachialis**

- Function: Flexion and adduction of the arm

- Origin: Coracoid process

- Insertion: Middle of the humerus, on its medial aspect

- Innervation: Musculocutaneous nerve (C5, C6, C7)

**Biceps brachii**

- Function: Resists dislocation of the shoulder, flexion of the forearm, supination of the forearm

- Origin:

- Short head: coracoid process
- Long head: supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula and superior labrum

- Insertion: Radial tuberosity of radius and forearm fascia (as bicipital aponeurosis)

- Innervation: Musculocutaneous nerve (C5, C6)

**Triceps brachii**

- Function: Resists dislocation of the shoulder, major extensor of the forearm

- Origin:

- Lateral head: above the radial groove of the humerus,
- Medial head: below the radial groove of the humerus
- Long head: infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula

- Insertion: Olecranon process of ulna and forearm fascia
