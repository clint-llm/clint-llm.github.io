Initial evaluation of napalm exposed patients includes immediate efforts to stop any ongoing burning generally by smothering or chemical fire extinguisher.  In patients exposed to napalm via a blast dispersal, typical trauma evaluation should be undertaken looking systematically for blunt and penetrating injuries requiring immediate treatment.  Except for minor exposures clinicians should consider intubation and early airway control to prevent late recognition of airway edema resulting in a difficult or failed intubation.  Many more severely injured patients will require high doses of opioids to control pain which may impair their respiratory drive when already under physiologic distress. Patients not intubated early must be re-evaluated at short intervals to determine the status of the airway.  Drooling, change in voice, swelling of the uvula, palate, tongue or lips are signs of worsening airway and should prompt consideration of intubation before the development of an airway crisis.

After decontamination and airway control clinicians should assess breathing and oxygenation; impaired ventilation and oxygenation may result from the head injury, carbon dioxide exposure, carbon monoxide exposure, exposure to other toxins burning in the environment, or restricted chest movement due to burns.  Blast victims could have pneumothoraces or sucking chest wounds requiring decompression and chest seals. Rapid evaluation by auscultation, visualization of chest rise, oxygen saturation, and evaluation of respiratory rate may prompt interventions unrelated to burns. Torso burns may require early chest escharotomy to allow ventilation.

A circulatory evaluation includes measurement of blood pressure, peripheral pulses, and assessment of shock.  Hypotensive patients may have internal injuries from the blast effect and clinicians should evaluate for the need for surgical intervention. Clinicians must evaluate for external bleeding, cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax, hemothorax, intraabdominal, and retroperitoneal bleeding apart from the visible external burns.  Inhalation of cyanide from nearby combustibles may cause shock and highly elevated serum lactate.

Once initial stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation is complete additional evaluation depends on the clinical situation. Some patients will require extensive trauma evaluation including CT scanning of the brain, cervical spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis for internal injuries.  Altered patients may require an arterial blood gas and co-oximetry for carbon monoxide. In more severely ill patients highly elevated serum lactate may suggest cyanide inhalation.

Determination of the total body surface area (BSA) burned aids in the determination of fluid resuscitation and the necessity for transfer to a burn center.
