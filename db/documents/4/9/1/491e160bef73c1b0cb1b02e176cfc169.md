Early identification and intervention are imperative to limit time away from activity for athletes. Distal clavicular osteolysis should be on the differential for any patient presenting for evaluation of AC joint or superior shoulder pain.

Athletic trainers and primary care physicians should be empowered to obtain imaging of these patients, especially ultrasound or plain radiographs, as these are the most cost-effective ways of identifying distal clavicular osteolysis. Frontline healthcare workers must receive education to guide the patient through various conservative measures, including injections, appropriate activity modifications, or surgical intervention.

Musculoskeletal specialists such as athletic trainers, strength coaches, physical therapists, sports medicine physicians, and orthopedists are well suited to diagnose and manage DCO. Shared decision-making allows for counseling these specific patients and identifying their goals and treatment options. Overall, optimal care requires a multi-disciplinary team approach to healthcare that can identify them and provide them with their definitive treatment in the most effective way.
