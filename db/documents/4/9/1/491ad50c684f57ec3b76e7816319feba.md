As follows with all peripheral nerves, the cutaneous innervation of the hand arises from neural crest cells, which derive from the embryonic ectoderm. These cells take the form of bilateral strips at the junction of the ectoderm and neural plate, which detach and migrate with the merging of the two ectodermal regions during embryogenesis. These neural crest cells migrate in a rostral to caudal distribution ending in the formation of the peripheral nervous system, which includes the cutaneous innervation of the hand.
