Oral TY21a is a live vaccine, so it should not be given in pregnancy or to immunocompromised patients. Immunocompromised individuals include those with HIV/AIDS, those taking steroids for longer than two weeks, or anyone with cancer receiving cancer treatment or radiation treatment. Caution is advised in female patients of reproductive potential.

Injectible Vi capsular polysaccharide vaccine is contraindicated in anyone who has had an allergic reaction to any component. There have been no studies conducted on pregnant patients, and vaccination is only recommended if absolutely needed. Delay to the second trimester of pregnancy is felt to be prudent.
