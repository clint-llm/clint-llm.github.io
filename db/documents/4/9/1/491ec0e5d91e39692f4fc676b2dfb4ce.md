Alveolar cells are often observed in biopsy samples using needle, transbronchial, thoracoscopic, or open techniques. H&E, trichrome, immunofluorescent, and carbon staining methods are useful in identifying specific pathologies within samples. Light and electron microscopy are also diagnostic options.

Alveoli are affected by several pathologies. In summary, these include chronic obstructive respiratory diseases, fibrosis, bacterial infections, viral infections, sarcoidosis, pneumonia, and carcinomas. Left-sided congestive heart failure and various inflammatory conditions can also lead to alveolar damage.
