The diaphragm is composed of the central tendon, costal, sternal, and lumbar components, the lateral parts of which are a continuation of the oblique muscles. At rest, it sits near the fifth and sixth intercostal space, and incompletely separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Its central location, in addition to movement during respiration,Â renders it a potential target in both thoracic and abdominal trauma.
