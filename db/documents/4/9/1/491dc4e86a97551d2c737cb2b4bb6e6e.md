Nicotinic ganglion receptors found in the autonomic ganglia are involved in both sympathetic and parasympathetic transmission. These receptors classify as neuronal nicotinic (Nn) cholinergic receptors, and they are on postganglionic efferent neurons. The activation of the Nn receptor is mediated by the release of acetylcholine from preganglionic efferent neurons. Interruption of acetylcholine-receptor binding at the level of the autonomic ganglia results in complete interruption of both sympathetic and parasympathetic signaling.

FDA approved indications for selected nicotinic ganglion blockers (off-label uses indicated when applicable):

Mecamylamine

- Indications: Moderately severe to severe essential hypertension, Uncomplicated malignant hypertension

- Administration: Oral tablets

- Notes: Mecamylamine exhibits excellent gastrointestinal absorption. It a secondary amine and thus can cross the blood-brain barrier. For this reason, mecamylamine has been the object of research for potential use in the treatment of Tourette's, smoking cessation, and depression.

Hexamethonium

- Notes: Experimental use only
