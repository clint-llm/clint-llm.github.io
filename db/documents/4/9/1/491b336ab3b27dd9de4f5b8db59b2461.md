Hurler syndrome, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPH I), is one of the eleven mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) disorders. Hurler syndrome was formerly known as gargoylism. It is an inherited lysosomal disorder caused by the absence of alpha-L-iduronidase, an enzyme responsible for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs or mucopolysaccharides). This leads to a buildup of dermatan sulfate and heparin sulfate in multiple tissues, resulting in progressive deterioration and eventually, death. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of hurler syndrome and the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the etiology of Hurler syndrome.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with Hurler syndrome.
- Review the treatment and management options available for Hurler syndrome.
- Explain a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by Hurler syndrome.
