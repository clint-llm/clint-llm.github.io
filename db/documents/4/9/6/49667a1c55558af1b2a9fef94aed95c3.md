Complications of A. haemolyticum pharyngitis include Lemierre syndrome, brain abscesses, endocarditis, and bacteremia. Rarely have long-term sequelae of A. haemolyticum infection been reported. Persistent infection due to the delayed recognition of the organism as the causative agent may lead to a poor outcome and mortality due to sepsis especially inÂ patients with serious comorbidities.
