The Rule of Nines, also known as the Wallace Rule of Nines, is a tool used by health care professionals to assess the total body surface area (TBSA) involved in burn patients. Measurement of the initial burn surface area by the healthcare team is important in estimating fluid resuscitation requirements since patients with severe burns have massive fluid losses due to the removal of the skin barrier. The activity updates healthcare teams on the Rule of Nine use in burn victims which will produce better patient outcomes. [Level V]
