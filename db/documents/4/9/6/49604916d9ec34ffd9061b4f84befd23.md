The Eustachian tube partially originates from the first pharyngeal pouch andÂ extends as tubotympanic recess. After contact with the outer ear canal, mesoderm between 2 canals forms the tympanic membrane; this expands to form the tympanic recess. The stalk of the recess forms the Eustachian tube. The skeletal elements have two parts, the boney lateral portion that arises from the anterior wall of the auditory bulla and the cartilage portion that covers the dorsal region along the length of the tube.
