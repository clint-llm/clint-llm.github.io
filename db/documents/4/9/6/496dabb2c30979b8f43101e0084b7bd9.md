In many tumors and particularly those that occur in the spine, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is imperative to delineate the spinal cord and to identify the volume of the target mass. A computed tomography (CT) myelogram, while less ideal, may be used in patients with previous spine hardware placement due to image distortion and artifact, which occur in a metal obstructed MRI.

Patients must be immobilized with a rigid body immobilization device prior to therapy to minimize intrafraction motion or small patient movements and to increase the precision of radiation delivery.
