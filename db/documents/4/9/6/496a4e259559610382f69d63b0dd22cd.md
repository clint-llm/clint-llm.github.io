Gastrointestinal stromal tumors may present in several different fashions. Most commonly, patients with these tumors present with gastrointestinal bleeding, which may present as an acute bleed with melena or hematochezia, or as chronic bleeding with associated anemia and sequelae thereof. In addition to gastrointestinal bleeding, GISTs may also present with signs and symptoms of a mass effect caused by the tumor such as abdominal pain or discomfort, early satiety, abdominal distension, or palpable mass. In an additional 15% to 30% of cases, GISTs are found incidentally on surgery, imaging, or autopsy.
