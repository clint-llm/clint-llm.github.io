Generally, resection is considered an adequate treatment of benign mesotheliomas. However, in casesÂ where there is incomplete excision of the mass, local recurrence is common. Some recommend more aggressive surgical excision for specific variants such as the benign cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum with heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy to prevent a recurrence.
