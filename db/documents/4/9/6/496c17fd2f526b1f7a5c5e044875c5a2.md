Owing to the varying etiology of fine motor disability, laboratory and radiographic should be determined on a case-by-case basis based on the history and physical examination elucidated from the patient. Furthermore, in some incidents, a fine motor disability can be diagnosed on a purely clinical basis without the need for any further invasive imaging and/or blood tests. However, modalities of investigation are mandatory for numerous etiologies. Below lists the most common tests required to determineÂ common underlying causative factors; this list is not exhaustive:

- Blood tests: Complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), liver function test (LFT), C-reactive protein (CRP), B12 level, folate level, bone profile, rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA), fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1c

- Imaging: Computed tomography (CT) brain/spine, X-ray cervical spine, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain/spine

- Nerve conduction studies

- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling: Microbiology, biochemistry, and specialized tests as indicated

- Genetic testing
