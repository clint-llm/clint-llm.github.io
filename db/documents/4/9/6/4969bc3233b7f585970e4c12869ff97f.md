Cauliflower ear: Repeated trauma can cause abnormalities of the outer ear. Trauma can induce a hematoma of the auricle in which blood accumulates between the perichondrium and auricular cartilage. This can distort the contours of the ear, impair blood flow to the cartilage, and lead to fibrosis and anatomical deformity (i.e., cauliflower ear).

Otis media: Otitis media is an inflammation of the lining of the middle ear. These types of infections are common in children with more horizontally directed auditory tubes. As the skull develops, the tubes will slope in a lateral and caudal direction and allow better drainage. Therefore, otitis media is much more common in young children.Â  The inflammation in these cases causes swelling and subsequent pressure on the tympanic membrane. In severe cases, the tympanic membrane can rupture leading to a decrease in the auditory acuity of affected individuals.
