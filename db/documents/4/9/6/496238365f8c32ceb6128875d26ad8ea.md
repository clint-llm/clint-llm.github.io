- Symptoms of acute radiation enteritis often self-resolve within weeks of supportive treatment with antimotility agents and good water intake; surgery is rarely needed.

- Antioxidant administration during radiotherapy has been shown to increase efficacy and decrease the side effect profile.

- Oral antibiotics are given to patients suspected of having bacterial overgrowth, along with vitamins and electrolytes replacement if needed.

- If malnourishment is suspected, patients should be checked for decrease intake and/or malabsorption. Surgical removal in patients with mechanical malabsorption does not relieve symptoms.

- Mild bleeding and minimal symptoms do not require further treatment.

- First-line treatment for radiation proctitis and tenesmus includes enemas, for example, the sucralfate enema.

- As a consequence of chronic radiation, Patients who have enteritis leading to the formation of intestinal strictures, fistulas, and perforations require surgical procedures. One study showed high postoperative morbidity (74.8%) after the first surgical procedure. Many patients required parenteral nutrition after surgery. Data indicates repeated surgical procedures may be needed; they do not seem to increase the morbidity.

- It is important to resect the whole irradiated bowel in the first operation to reduce the need for more surgical procedures, but it is not a suitable option in every case due to fear of complications such as short bowel syndrome.
