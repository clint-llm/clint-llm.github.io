Complicated vanishing twin pregnancy carries risks of premature labor, obstructed labor, intrauterine growth restriction of the surviving fetus, neurodevelopmental impairment, placental abruption that may cause the death of the surviving fetus, or chorioamnionitis.

Care coordination between health care team members, i.e., an obstetrician/gynecologist, nurse, and clinical staff before and during the pregnancy, is essential, as detecting a vanishing twin during early pregnancy via ultrasonographic examination has many benefits. If the loss of a twin is identified during the second or third trimester, the health care practitioner needs to monitor more carefully the health of the mother and the remaining fetus and watch closely for any complications. If the surviving co-twin is at risk, the obstetrician/gynecologist may recommend aborting the ailing fetus, which could be agonizing for the parents.

An interprofessional approach to health care of the patient must be taken to prevent errors and improve health care outcomes through communication, staying up-to-date on the patientâ€™s current health status, recent physical and diagnostic evaluation of the patient, and mental well-being.
