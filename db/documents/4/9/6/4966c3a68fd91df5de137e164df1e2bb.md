Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disease process that results in either decreased release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also known as vasopressin or AVP) or decreased response to ADH, causing electrolyte imbalances. There are two types of diabetes insipidus, central and nephrogenic, and each has congenital and acquired causes. Diabetes insipidus is caused by a problem with vasopressin production in the pituitary gland (central) or the action of vasopressin in the kidneys (nephrogenic). Based on the site of its pathology, it can be divided into central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of diabetes insipidus and the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of the two primary categories of diabetes insipidus causes in each category.
- Outline the factors in evaluating a patient with suspected diabetes insipidus, including laboratory analysis.
- Describe the treatment options for diabetes insipidus, depending on the specific etiology.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by diabetes insipidus.
