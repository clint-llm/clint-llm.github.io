A dilated, non-compressible bowel is pathognomonic of small bowel obstruction on ultrasound. A small bowel of more than three centimeters is considered dilated. The small bowel wall is thick when it is more than 3 mm. Back and forth peristalsis and identifying a transition point are specific ultrasound findings. CTÂ scan is the most accurate method to diagnose and characterize a small bowel obstruction.
