While conventional stress tests are exercise-based, in certain circumstances, there may be contraindications to exercise. In these cases, pharmacologically-based stress tests are an option. These tests typically involve the administration of a vasodilator to mimic the cardiac response to exercise. The most commonly used vasodilator is dipyridamole; less commonly used agents include adenosine and regadenoson. This activity describes dipyridamole stress testing and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients who undergo pharmacological stress testing.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the mechanism of action of dipyridamole.
- Outline the indications for dipyridamole stress tests.
- Summarize the contraindications to dipyridamole.
- Explain how collaboration between healthcare professionals performing exercise stress tests and dipyridamole stress tests can help reduce the healthcare burden.
