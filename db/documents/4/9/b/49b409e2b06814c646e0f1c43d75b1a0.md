Distal humerus fractures are most often the result of trauma to the elbow. This can be in the form of a direct blow to the affected extremity by either foreign object or fall. High-energy mechanisms often are the result of a motor vehicle collision or motorcycle accident and have even been reported in instances of projectile injury. Patient age usually is an associated factor in whether the mechanism is low- or high-energy.
