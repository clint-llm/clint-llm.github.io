Testing for active/latent tuberculosis and viral hepatitis B and C should occur before initiating anti-TNF agents. Clinicians should monitor patientsÂ for signs of infection before, during, and after treatment.

Patients on anti-TNF agents should not receive any live immunizations, and patients should be up to date with vaccinations before initiating anti-TNF agents.

Anti-TNF agents may be associated with a higher risk in patients undergoing major surgeries such as hip or knee replacement. The recommendation is to hold these medications one week and one dosing cycle before the surgery. They can be resumed two weeks after the surgery, provided there is no infection and incisions are healing well.
