Patients require education about the dissociative effect associated with ketamine,Â which can result in a significant alteration in consciousness, thereby resulting in accidental injury to oneself or others. Ketamine can impair psychomotor performance, such as coordination, balance, and hand-eye movements. This lack of coordination can result in an increase in mortality from motor vehicle collisions if patients choose to drive while intoxicated. Since ketamine is subject to misuse and is classified by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency as a schedule-III controlled substance, patients given access to ketamine for chronic pain or depression should receive education on the risk of addiction and risk-stratified similar to those under consideration for chronic opioid therapy.

Ketamine misuse can result in chronic health problems that can be costly to manage. Ulcerative cystitis, a common effect associated with ketamine, is often refractory to conventional management. A diagnosis of ketamine-induced ulcerative cystitis often leads to repetitive cystoscopies and palliative bladder catheterization. These patients may require life-long treatments.
