For most patients with symptoms related to ozone toxicity, history will be non-specific. Findings will likely depend on the bodily system involved, such as worsening respiratory symptoms in a patient with underlying asthma, since this population is particularly susceptible to ozone effects.

Symptoms themselves are largely related to the delivery method of exposure, concentration, and duration. Ozone has been delivered in many routes including, but not limited to, intravenous, intramuscular, topically, intra-articular, nasal, rectal, and oral.
