Patients with pityriasis versicolor present with multiple, well-demarcated, oval, finely scaling patches or plaques. Skin lesions may be hypopigmented, hyperpigmented, or erythematous and occasionally become confluent and widespread. The fine scale may not be readily apparent on the lesions, but it is easily provoked when the affected skin is stretched or scraped. The distribution of affected skin reflects the lipophilic nature of the fungus since the seborrheic areas (trunk, neck, and/or arms) are predominantly involved. The face also may be affected, particularly in children. Pityriasis versicolor skin lesions are usually asymptomatic or slightly pruritic. However, severe pruritus can be present in very warm and humid conditions.
