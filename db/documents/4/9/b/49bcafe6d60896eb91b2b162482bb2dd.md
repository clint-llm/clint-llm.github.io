# Continuing Education Activity

Gastroparesis is an uncommon condition in the community that can be associated with significant morbidity, healthcare burden and could have poor outcomes due to complications and misunderstanding of the disease process. This topic will review the etiology plus evaluation and management of gastroparesis. This highlights the role of the healthcare teams in understanding the presentation, thus improving care for patients with gastroparesis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of gastroparesis.
- Summarize appropriate points in history, physical, and evaluation of gastroparesis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for gastroparesis.
- Explain the importance of care coordination amongst physicians, nursing, and ancillary teams to enhance the delivery of care for patients with gastroparesis.

# Introduction

The term gastroparesis literally means “stomach paralysis.” Gastroparesis could be defined as a condition of collective symptoms of nausea and vomiting associated with bloating and early satiety plus or minus upper abdominal pain, caused by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction.

# Etiology

Various conditions have correlations with gastroparesis; the majority of cases are idiopathic, diabetic, medication-induced, or postsurgical. One of the studies done at a tertiary care center categorized the etiologies in 146 patients: 36% idiopathic, 29% diabetic, 13% postgastric surgery, 7.5% Parkinson disease, 4.8% collagen vascular disorders, 4.1% intestinal pseudoobstruction, and 6% miscellaneous causes.

- Idiopathic - most common cause present in about half of patients

- Diabetes mellitus (DM) - most common and severe in type 1 diabetics

- Rheumatological diseases - amyloidosis, scleroderma

- Autoimmune - autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility causing delayed emptying

- Neurological conditions - stress, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, brainstem CVA and tumors, autonomic neuropathy

- Postsurgical -  vagal nerve injury during fundoplication and partial gastric resection

- Trauma - spinal cord injury

- Viral infections including Norwalk virus and rotavirus

- Medications - narcotics, cyclosporine, phenothiazines, dopamine agonists, octreotide, alpha-2-adrenergic agonists (e.g. clonidine), tricyclic antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, GLP-1 agonists exenatide or analogs liraglutide, lithium, progesterone

Diabetic patients at risk of developing gastroparesis include type 1 diabetes, long duration of the disease, poorly controlled blood sugars with higher fluctuations, and associated other autonomic neuropathic complications. As noted in other diabetes-related complications, oxidative damage of these tissues is the prominent mechanism in gastroparesis.

Post-surgical etiology: Any surgery involving the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and pancreas could pose a risk of injury to the vagal nerve. Vagus nerve controls contraction and smooth muscles of the stomach and sensory pathways that coordinate forward propulsion of gastric contents. Hence, injury of the vagus nerve delays gastric emptying. Postsurgical gastroparesis may develop immediately after the surgery or months to years after the surgery occurred. Common surgical procedures associated with this complication include Nissen fundoplication, gastrectomy, pancreatic cancer cryoablation, pancreatoduodenectomy. Rarely gastroparesis has been reported in gynecological surgeries involving the lower abdomen.

# Epidemiology

The epidemiology of gastroparesis is unclear and difficult to estimate due to the relatively weak correlation of symptoms with gastric emptying resulting in a high rate of underdiagnosis.

# Pathophysiology

Abnormal coordination of the motor functions of the stomach results in delayed gastric emptying; this could be due to various pathology and can affect different areas of the stomach like fundus, body, and antrum. In patients with diabetes, the pathophysiology is noted at various levels, including intrinsic and extrinsic neurons, smooth muscle, and interstitial cells of Cajal. Oxidative damage results in abnormal motor coordination in the antral region, causing dysfunctional contractions and impaired postprandial gastric accommodation phenomenon.

# Histopathology

Histopathologically, gastroparesis is associated with a reduced number of autonomic ganglia and ganglion cells in addition to inflammatory changes resulting in abnormal gastric myoelectric motor functions.

# History and Physical

History: Gastroparesis is a heterogeneous disorder; its etiology affects symptoms and severity.

# Evaluation

Gastroparesis gets evaluated in clinical practice through the recognition of the clinical symptoms and documentation of delayed gastric emptying. The goal of the evaluation is to exclude a mechanical obstruction and establish the diagnosis of gastroparesis by an assessment of gastric motility. Robust patient history should point to suspicion of a possible diagnosis. Gastroparesis should be a suspicion in patients with chronic nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, abdominal pain, or bloating. The next step would be ruling out mechanical obstruction, which could be done with a careful upper GI endoscopy to rule out malignancy or strictures due to peptic ulcer disease.

Imaging modalities like computed tomographic (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abdomen may be needed to exclude mechanical obstruction. After ruling out mechanical causes, gastric emptying studies (GES) are performed by scintigraphy to confirm the presence of delayed gastric emptying of solids. A solid or liquid radioisotope containing meal may be used to measure gastric emptying.

# Treatment / Management

Management of gastroparesis should include a holistic approach to target different aspects of the disease such as assessment of nutritional status, measures to correct fluid, electrolyte, and nutritional deficiencies, relief of symptoms of gastroparesis, improving gastric emptying, recognize and rectify the underlying cause of gastroparesis to prevent progressing of the disease, e.g., tight glycemic control in diabetes, stopping causative medications.

Diet modifications: Small Meal size could limit emptying time and help symptom alleviation. Patients may need to eat 4 or 5 times per day to compensate for the small meal size. Carbonated drinks like soda and beer could release carbon dioxide, which can aggravate gastric distention. Smoking or high doses of alcohol can decrease antral contractility and impair gastric emptying.

Medical treatment: As needed antiemetics such as prochlorperazine (5 to 10 mg up to 3 times a day), diphenhydramine (12.5 mg up to 3 or 4 times a day) and ondansetron (4 or 8 mg up to 3 times a day) can provide symptomatic relief in gastroparesis. Metoclopramide, a prokinetic medication, is the only FDA approved drug for gastroparesis. It is usually started with 5 mg three times a day, fifteen minutes before meals. It can be titrated up to 40 mg per day but need very close monitoring for adverse effects. Also, the duration of treatment approved by the FDA is 12 weeks due to the possibility of severe side effects.

Non-medical approaches: Gastric electrical stimulation (GES) has shown to relieve symptoms, mainly vomiting frequency and the need for nutrition supplementation.

Future prospects: Multiple prospective treatments have been considered or being investigated for the management of gastroparesis. Granisetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist, administered as a transdermal patch, has improved gastroparesis symptoms of nausea and vomiting, as evident in a prospective study.

# Differential Diagnosis

Symptoms of nausea and vomiting are so nonspecific that they could have a wide variety of differential diagnoses. But the following conditions mentioned below could pose a very similar presentation to gastroparesis.

1. Gastric Outlet Obstruction: very similar presentation but with underlying mechanical obstruction.

2. Cyclical vomiting syndrome: Typically has recurrent cyclical episodes of intractable nausea and vomiting lasting few hours to days.

3. Functional dyspepsia: diagnosed by Rome IV criteria for functional dyspepsia.

4. Rumination syndrome: A behavioral disorder consists of daily, effortless regurgitation of undigested food after ingestion of a meal. In contrast, it is not preceded by nausea or wretching.

5. Psychiatric diseases – many psychiatric conditions, including anxiety neurosis, eating disorders like anorexia nervosa, bulimia could have persistent upper GI symptoms confusing with gastroparesis. It could get complicated, especially as some psychiatric medications can cause delayed gastric emptying.

# Prognosis

Gastroparesis is a rather uncommon condition in the community but can be associated with poor outcome.

# Complications

The incidence of complications from gastroparesis could vary according to underlying etiology. Longstanding patients of gastroparesis will most likely suffer from the following complications.

- Severe protein-calorie malnourishment

- Bezoars

- Mallory Weiss tears from retching and vomiting

- Procedure-related complications

- Narcotic dependence and social stigma

- Recurrent hospitalizations

- Significant healthcare burden

Bezoar - a solid mass of indigestible material that accumulates in the stomach, eventually mechanical obstruction. Bezoars can cause loss of appetite, weight loss, and a feeling of fullness. They can also lead to gastric ulcers, GI bleeding, and bowel obstruction. Usually diagnosed by endoscopy and large bezoars often require surgical intervention.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients with gastroparesis frequently present challenging clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic problems.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

The number of gastroparesis-related hospitalizations has been increasing in the United States, and the economic impact of gastroparesis-related hospitalizations is significant and may be increasing.

An interprofessional team approach is essential to improve the morbidity of the disorder. The pharmacist should educate the patient on medications that can help improve gastric motility but at the same time, warn them about the adverse effects. The diabetes educator nurse should inform the patient on control of blood glucose, and the dietitian should recommend smaller meals at each setting. Patients should be encouraged to eat a healthy diet and consume ample water. Any food that triggers gastroparesis should be avoided. Healthy body weight and regular exercise are also recommended interventions. These examples demonstrate how an interprofessional team approach to gastroparesis can improve patient outcomes [Level 5]

One of the main aspects overlooked is the quality of life of the patient. Both patient and healthcare provider education plays a critical role in identifying and managing patients of gastroparesis. Most parts of the diagnostic approach to gastroparesis and recommendations regarding its treatment have their basis on the cumulative experience and opinions of physicians who specialize in the care of these patients. A more controlled investigation is needed to validate any therapeutic algorithm in managing this challenging condition.

Interprofessional team dynamics can bring about optimal patient results. [Level 5]
