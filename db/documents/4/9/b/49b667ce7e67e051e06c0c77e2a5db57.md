Management of emergent medical cases is at the crux and the focal point of emergency medicine resident training. Simulation has the added benefit of allowing medical providers to practice stressful and high-risk scenarios in an environment that is safe for the patient and safe for the practitioners. Almost invariably, the emergency physician is viewed as the leader of the resuscitative (or code) team. Simulation is a natural extension to teach team leadership and communication skills. In code situations, the EM physician is usually assisted by an extensive interdisciplinary team with varying degrees of skill and knowledge. These team members may range from students, paramedics, nurses, respiratory therapists, and medical assistants. Of paramount importance is that the team leader can effectively communicate with each team member and rapidly asses the skill levels and knowledge present within those team members.[23] By designing team-based medical scenarios, instructors are more easily able to teach and assess learner communication and leadership skills. Additionally, reflective scenario debriefing can help address individual, departmental, and or institutional gaps in knowledge or administration of best practice measures. Effective simulation can also allow more formalized processes to be instituted to ensure that these best practices are followed, and gaps in knowledge are addressed.

The American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Surgeons (ACS) as national professional medical organizations have both incorporated simulation into the certification process for:

- Basic Life Support (BLS)

- Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS)

- Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS)

- Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS)

For instance, a student or resident learning ACLS may be presented with a "mock" or simulated code in which the patient will arrive in Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA). The learner would be expected to proceed through the cognitive process of identifying the causes of PEA arrest and working through the treatments of those causes. The instructor may design the case so that any of the causes of PEA arrest is the causative factor, and the case scenario would end when the learner correctly treats the rhythm.
