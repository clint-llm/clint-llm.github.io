Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) known formerly as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a form of idiopathic diffuse interstitial lung disease. Davison et al. coined the term COP in 1983. This was followed by detailed descriptions of the disease under the term BOOP by Epler et al. in 1985. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is believed to be a consequence of alveolar injury and is characterized by the formation of organized buds of granulation tissue obstructing the alveolar lumen and bronchioles resulting in respiratory failure. Organizing pneumonia is a pathologic diagnosis and can be secondary to an identifiable etiology. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia should be diagnosed only after exclusion of any other possible etiology.
