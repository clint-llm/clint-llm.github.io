**Reversal Agent**

- Atropine sulfate

Atropine sulfate competes with bethanechol at the muscarinic receptor junction, competitively blocking its binding at the postganglionic arch receptors and preventing parasympathetic cholinergic activation.

This diagnosis of overdose and toxicity is based on clinical manifestations, as there are no definite lab examinations or radiographic imaging that will affirm the determination.
