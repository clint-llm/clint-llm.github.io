CT renal angiography is usually performed to better evaluate the vasculature, identify the specific vessels involved, and determine the degree of occlusion. This is generally not necessary if the earlier diagnostic contrast-enhanced abdominal CT demonstrates a shrunken, atrophic kidney or a clearly demarcated, dense wedge-shaped scar suggesting an old infarction where the involved renal tissue would be unlikely to benefit from revascularization.

Treating renal infarction could be broadly categorized into catheter-directed thrombolysis, systemic thrombolysis, anticoagulation, and surgery. All patients are assessed for the benefit of revascularization procedures by considering the time since onset of ischemia, current kidney function, size and extent of the renal infarct, the presence of arterial dissection, the function of the contralateral kidney, the precise vessels involved, and whether the occlusion of the renal artery is partial or complete.

Revascularization is more likely to be beneficial if the patient has the following:

- Complete arterial occlusion of main or major segmental renal artery of <6 hours duration, solitary kidney, or significant reduction in renal function from baseline (usually <50 mL/min GFR).

- Partial arterial occlusion of main or major segmental renal artery of <24 hours duration. If >24 hours duration, consider revascularization if the patient has renal failure, continuing symptoms (flank pain), or hypertension that is new or worsening.

- A renal infarction associated with arterial dissection.

An infarction of the main renal artery jeopardizes the function of the entire organ. Segmental arterial occlusion can lead to reduced function of a large portion of the kidney, which will be significant in patients with pre-existing renal failure or solitary kidneys. Blockage of a subsegmental artery is what leads to the typical wedge-shaped diffusion defect of the parenchyma seen on contrast-enhanced CT scans of the abdomen.

Determining the timing of the onset of the infarction may not always be simple. Acute symptoms, such as flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and hypertension, suggest a more recent onset of one week or less.

Patients with normal kidney function may not demonstrate any decrease in overall kidney function even with complete, acute unilateral renal arterial occlusion. However, a significant reduction in renal function would be expected in patients with pre-existing kidney disease, those who develop acute kidney injury, and those with bilateral complete renal infarctions.

The degree of renal arterial blockage can be determined by CT renal angiography. Partial occlusion with some degree of visualized parenchymal perfusion suggests potential recovery. Typically, even complete occlusions of 6 hours or less are considered potentially reversible.

**Catheter-directed thrombolysis**(also known as percutaneous endovascular therapy) is mostly attempted for revascularization in proximal or bilateral renal artery occlusions and to restore perfusion in a solitary kidney. It may also be considered for selected patients with significant segmental artery occlusions. Patients with underlying fibromuscular dysplasia should be referred for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or vascular reconstructive surgery.

Catheter-directed thrombolysis in the form of local intraarterial thrombolysis, thrombectomy, angioplasty, and/or stenting is beneficial only in patients diagnosed early within the ischemic tolerance of normal kidneys.

One published protocol attempts thrombectomy first; if unsuccessful, a bolus injection of 250,000 IU of urokinase is given directly into the affected artery. If results are not deemed adequate, the catheter is left in place, and a continuous infusion of urokinase at a rate of 50,000 IU per hour is utilized for up to 72 hours. Daily renal angiograms are done while the urokinase infusion is administered, and the patients are carefully monitored for possible complications. If the infarction remains unchanged after 72 hours, the treatment is deemed ineffective and discontinued.

According to Blum et al., recovery of renal function is expected if revascularization is attempted within 90 to 120 minutes of symptom onset.

While some studies have reported renal function loss within two hours of ischemia, other studies have shown successful revascularization for up to 96 hours after presentation.

All patients are given continuous intraarterial heparin during the procedure. Follow-up angiograms are taken to look for any residual thrombi. Patients who undergo angioplasty and/or stenting typically receive three to six months of aspirin and clopidogrel.

In a comparative study by Silverberg et al., 13 out of 42 patients (31%) were treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis. A complete resolution of the thrombus was seen in 10 out of 13 patients (76%), and a partial solution in the rest.

Two patients in this study required permanent hemodialysis despite catheter-directed thrombolysis, but they were recipients of kidney transplants. Others have reported similar results, with the vast majority of patients showing complete or at least partial resolution if diagnosed and treated promptly.

The maximal duration of complete blockage from a renal infarct that would still benefit from catheter-directed thrombolysis is unknown but is most likely limited to several days at most, but anecdotal reports of longer durations have been reported.

**Ultrasound-enhanced catheter-directed thrombolysis**may be an innovative treatment option in renal artery thrombosis, wherein the ultrasound waves allow better penetration of thrombolytic agents by acoustic streaming.

**Systemic thrombolysis**can be attempted if catheter-directed thrombolysis is not available.

**Anticoagulation**is considered the treatment of choice for patients who present several days or longer after their renal infarction, as revascularization therapy is not likely to be beneficial. Long-term anticoagulation is also initiated for those with underlying hypercoagulation disorders or atrial fibrillation. The duration of anticoagulation is typically at least six months if the patient does not have risk factors for repeat embolization like atrial fibrillation or other hypercoagulable disorders. Intravenous heparin, followed by warfarin, is the standard anticoagulation regimen, with a target INR of 2 to 3. (This increases in patients already on warfarin before their renal infarct, in which an INR of 2.5 to 3.5 is suggested.)

Apixaban (a Factor Xa inhibitor and a direct oral anticoagulant) may also be used. It has the benefit of lower renal clearance and does not require the routine monitoring associated with long-term warfarin therapy. If anticoagulants are stopped after six months, life-long aspirin has been recommended for renal infarction patients even if no specific hypercoagulable state has been identified. Aspirin may also benefit those with asymptomatic remote renal infarctions who present with an atrophic kidney.

**Open surgery**is mostly attempted in the event of trauma-related renal artery injury and aortic dissection extending into the renal artery. In 1987, Ouriel et al. commented that operative intervention is likely to be unfavorable in cases of embolic renal infarctions.

For renovascular hypertension, which patients may develop in the first week after a renal infarction, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or blocker is suggested. This is due to the increased renin levels that are not uncommon after a renal infarction. The associated hypertension frequently subsides in the following weeks unless the patients have underlying essential hypertension.

**Long-term follow-up**for patients with thromboembolic renal infarctions has not been standardized. It is reasonable to monitor for complications related to ongoing therapy, such as bleeding episodes, and to check renal function regularly. Permanent life-long aspirin therapy is typically recommended as well.

Follow-up imaging is recommended, and some experts have suggested serial abdominal imaging (preferably with magnetic resonance angiography) at 6 and 12 months. If no lesions or problems are found, further surveillance imaging may not be necessary. Patients with underlying renal or cardiac issues will require closer and longer-term monitoring.

**Treatment of atherosclerotic emboli**in the renal arteries causing a renal infarct is primarily supportive.

Additional angiographic and vascular procedures should be canceled, postponed, or delayed. Patients with renal infarcts due to atheroembolic have a relatively poor overall prognosis due to the severity of their underlying atherosclerotic disease. In one large study of 354 patients, 28% died within two years, and 33% developed end-stage kidney disease.

Other measures such as using aspirin, stopping smoking, improving hypertension control, improving weight management, and good glycemic control in patients with diabetes are generally recommended, but there is no supportive data for confirmation.

**Summary**

- CT renal angiography will establish the diagnosis and allow transcatheter treatment for acute cases, if appropriate.

- Thrombectomy is usually tried first, then thrombolysis.

- A continuous infusion of thrombolytics can be considered for up to 72 hours if bolus treatment is unsuccessful.

- Angioplasty and/or arterial stenting can be utilized when thrombolysis fails or is inappropriate.

- Systemic thrombolysis is reasonable in selected cases if catheter-directed therapy is not available.

- Systemic anticoagulation is recommended for late cases and is usually required for at least six months. Apixaban is suggested.

- Open surgery is appropriate for trauma cases and those associated with aortic dissections.

- Renovascular hypertension should be treated with ACE inhibitors.
