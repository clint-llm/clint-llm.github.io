- Pulseless electrical activity is a significant cause of mortality, especially in hospitalized, elderly patients.

- Immediate evaluation to look for the cause is warranted.

- Good quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation is the first step after the activation of the emergency response system.

- Epinephrine should be used in conjunction with cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

- The foremost priority is the hemodynamic stability of the patient.

- A six-person, high-performance cardiac arrest team, is best to manage patients with PEA.
