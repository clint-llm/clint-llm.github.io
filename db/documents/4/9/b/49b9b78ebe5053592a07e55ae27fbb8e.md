In the emergency department, a meticulous trauma evaluation with the management of the airway, breathing, and circulation is most important. Placement on an oral or nasogastric tube may be helpful in making the diagnosis if the tube remains in the chest and in decompressing the stomach contents thus preventing further herniation. In some settings, a chest tube, inserted carefully to avoid causing additional injury, should be placed to address associated hemothorax or pneumothorax. Injuries to the diaphragm do not heal spontaneously, so operative repair is required in almost all patients.

All left-sided injuries require repair, as do most right-sided injuries. In the rare patient with a small, right-sided tear that is a candidate for expectant management, it is important for the patient to understand the risk of delayed rupture. Surgical management is often via a transabdominal approach, typically during the laparotomy performed for other injuries.Â  In less severely injured patients, a less invasive laparoscopic or even thoracoscopic approach may be appropriate.

The actual repair is simple; once the herniated contents have been reduced, the rupture to the diaphragm can be closed with interrupted non-absorbable sutures. A chest tube should be left in the chest for a few days.
