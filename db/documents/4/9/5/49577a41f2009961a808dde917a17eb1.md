Marburg virus disease (MVD) is caused by Marburg virus (MARV), a highly pathogenic, enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the Filoviridae family.

Only viruses in the Marburgvirus or Ebolavirus genera are known to cause disease in humans and are most well known because of their high case-fatality rates and dramatic clinical presentation.Marburg Marburgvirus, which encompasses two viruses: the Marburg virus and Ravn virus (RAVV). Marburg virus can further be broken down into variants with a less genomic difference; Marburg Muskoke, Marburg Angola, Ci67, Ozolin, and isolates within a variant (Pop, Ci67).

MARV is currently classified as a Group 4 pathogen by the World Health Organization (WHO), indicating high individual and community risk.
