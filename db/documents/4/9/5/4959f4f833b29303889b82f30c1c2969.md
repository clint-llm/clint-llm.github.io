The diagnosis of botulism includes isolation of the bacilli and demonstration of the toxin.

**Isolation of the Bacilli**

- Gram staining of smears made from suspected food or feces-reveals gram-positive, non-capsulated bacilli with subterminal, oval, bulging spores.

- It is motile by peritricate flagella.

- Isolation is possible when cultures are on blood agar or Robertson's cooked meat (RCM) broth. Bacterial colonies appear as large, irregular, semi-transparent, hemolytic with a fimbriated border on blood agar. In RCM broth, turbidity occurs with meat particles turning black and production of foul odor with C. botulinum A, B, F (proteolytic), and turn pink with C. botulinum C, D, E (saccharolytic). Growth on culture media may be confirmed by Gram staining and biochemical tests.

- The mere presence of bacilli in food or feces is of less significance. Toxin demonstration is more meaningful.

- Serotyping is through type-specific antisera.

**Toxin Demonstration (Mouse Bioassay)**

Toxins are detectable in the specimens (serum, stool, sterile water or saline enema, gastric aspirates, wound material) or samples of ingested foods.

• Specimens get injected into a mouse that develops paralysis in 48 hours, which can be inhibited by prior administration of specific antitoxin.

• The sensitivity of the mouse bioassay varies inversely with the time elapsed between the onset of symptoms and sample collection.
