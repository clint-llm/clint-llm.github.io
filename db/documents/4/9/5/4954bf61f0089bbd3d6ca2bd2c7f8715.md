There are increasing reports about outcomes mainly for chondral defects around the knee.

Histologic studies show high cartilage survivorship reporting ten years mean survival rates ranging from 72 to 85% for femoral condyles, 68 to 88% for the tibial plateau, and 71-78% for patella-femoral grafts.

Bipolar defects treated with bipolar allograft transplantation have shown a 39% survivorship at ten years follow up and a much higher revision/failure rate than unipolar transplantation.

Functional outcome reports improved IKDC scores in 88% of patients and significant improvement in knee pain in 74 to 85% of patients at follow up.

In regard to sports activity studies addressing femoral condyle osteochondral allograft show that 79% of patients return to sports at preinjury levels, whereas up to 88% return to sports at any level at a mean time of 9.6 months. However, quality evidence is still lacking.

There are some factors as body mass index, age at the time of surgery, and the number of previous cartilage preserving procedures that are associated with less favorable outcomes. Patients above 30 years old undergoing surgery have a 3.5 times higher risk of failure, whereas previous procedures increase the risk by 2.5 times.
