Impression materials are classified as either elastic or non-elastic based on mechanical properties.

Hydrocolloids were the first elastic materials used in the dental field. Hydrocolloids produce an imprint providing high-definition details despite undercuts. While the impressions deform upon removal, they later adapt to the original shape due to their elastic properties. Alginate is an elastic, irreversible hydrocolloid that offers lower costs, improved patient tolerance, ease of manipulation, reduced execution times, and the possibility of obtaining a detailed impression in a single step.
