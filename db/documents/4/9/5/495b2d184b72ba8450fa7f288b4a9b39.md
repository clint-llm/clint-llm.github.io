The role of Immunoglobulin E is central in allergy sensitization and atopic disorders such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis. These disorders manifest due to Type I hypersensitivity reactions involving IgE and other immune cells to produce the clinical symptoms seen in those disorders ultimately. It starts with an initial exposure to an antigen or allergen, which is taken up and processed by a dendritic cell or macrophage, which presents the antigen to a T cell. In the presence of cytokine mediators IL-4 and IL-13, these T cells are induced to differentiate into TH2 helper T cells capable of presenting the antigen to B-cells.

Once initial exposure to an antigen has occurred, and an immune response has been activated, antigen-specific IgE will remain bound via the Fc-epsilon RI receptor to mast cells and basophils. It has been shown that binding alone of IgE to that receptor cause IgE-dependent upregulation of mast cell Fc-epsilon RI receptor expression, which allows these cells to bind more IgE antibodies.
