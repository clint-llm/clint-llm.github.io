Patients that have sinus of Valsalva aneurysm may be completely asymptomatic or may present with non-specific complaints, such as dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations, or loss of consciousness. Physical exam findings are usually not present unless an aneurysm is large or has ruptured. The classic finding on auscultation is a continuous sawing-like murmur that occurs over both heart sounds. There may be a diastolic descrescendo murmur suggestive of aortic regurgitation. Patients with ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm will frequently present with dyspnea and decreased exercise tolerance. In advanced stages, congestive heart failure may occur.
