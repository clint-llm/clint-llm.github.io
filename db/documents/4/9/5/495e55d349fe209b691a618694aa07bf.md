Perinatal asphyxia can occur due to maternal hemodynamic compromise (amniotic fluid embolus), uterine conditions (uterine rupture), or placenta and umbilical cord (placental abruption, umbilical cord knot or compression) and infection. The asphyxia can occur prior to the birth or can occur immediately following birth in a compromised patient requiring resuscitation.

The majority of cases of perinatal asphyxia occur intrapartum, although 20% occur antepartum and other cases occur in the early post-natal period. Perinatal asphyxia can occur due to maternal events (hemorrhage, amniotic fluid embolism; hemodynamic collapse), placental events (acute abruption), uterine events (rupture), cord events (tight nuchal cord, cord prolapse/avulsion) and intrapartum infection (maternal fever in labor). A careful obstetrical and peripartum history is essential to determine the etiology.
