During embryogenesis, the paired ventral segmental arteries come close to one another in the midline in the mesentery. Some of the vessels fuse together to form the median vessel, and this eventually results in a three vessel visceral arterial system. This system includes the celiac trunk and the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. The superior mesenteric artery is derived from the omphalomesenteric artery and a special segmental artery.
