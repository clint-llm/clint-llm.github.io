Antithyroid drugs or thionamides are associated with rare but serious adverse effects of agranulocytosis, hepatotoxicity, and vasculitis. Hepatotoxicity is more common with the use of propylthiouracil (2.7%) than methimazole (0.4%).

If patients develop an acute febrile illness with symptoms of pharyngitis, they should get blood work done to check complete blood cell counts along with differentials to rule out the development of agranulocytosis. Liver function tests should be assessed in patients who develop a pruritic rash, abdominal pain or bloating, anorexia, nausea, vomiting,Â fatigue, jaundice, light-colored stool, or dark urine.

The most common complications following total or near-total thyroidectomy include hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism in less than 2% of cases (can be transient or permanent), recurrent or superior laryngeal nerve paralysis in less than 2% of cases (can be temporary or permanent), hemorrhage, and complications related to anesthesia.
