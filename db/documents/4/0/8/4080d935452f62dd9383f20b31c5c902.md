Diseases that merit consideration in the differential diagnosis are other neural infections. Meningitis of different bacterial etiology (i.e., meningococcal) can be mistaken for streptococcal meningitis. It is impossible to establish the etiology taking into consideration only the clinical picture. CSF culture is indispensable in making a precise diagnosis. Viral and fungal etiologies of meningitis must also be ruled out. Encephalitis is another disease that can present itself very similarly to meningitis. Although encephalitis can affect meninges as well, evidence of brain inflammation is the distinguishing feature absent in meningitis. All other causes of altered mental status and coma should be ruled out, including stroke, intoxication, hypoglycemia, and electrolyte disturbances.
