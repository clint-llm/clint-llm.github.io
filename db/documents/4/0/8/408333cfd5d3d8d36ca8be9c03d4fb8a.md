Patients with stercoral colitis typically have a history of chronic constipation. Constipation can occur secondary to a neurologic, psychiatric, or metabolic condition (diabetic neuropathy).

On exam, patients typically have diffuse abdominal tenderness to palpation and abdominal distension. In contrast to intestinal obstruction, patients with stercoral colitis will usually have stool present in the rectal vault on the digital rectal exam and may report passing small volume of stool. In severe cases, patients can present with peritonitis, septic shock, or multiorgan failure if perforation or colonic ischemia have already occurred.
