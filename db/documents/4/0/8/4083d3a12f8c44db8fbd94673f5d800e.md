Patients should be educated about cerebral and aortic aneurysms and the risk associated with them. A ruptured aneurysm is a serious and life-threatening emergency condition that needs to be treated promptly. Approximately 10% to 30% of the patients with a cerebral aneurysm bleed die even before reaching the hospital and only about 30% recover after appropriate treatment. Tobacco smoking and excessive alcohol consumption should be avoided as this can increase the risk of aneurysm progression or rupture. Better blood pressure control is recommended as this is one of the risk factors for aneurysm formation, progression, and rupture. Cardiovascular risk reduction measures should be implemented.
