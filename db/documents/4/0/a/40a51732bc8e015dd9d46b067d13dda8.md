Cardiovascular: Hypertension, arrhythmia.

Renal: Decreases glomerular filtration rate (GFR) due to an increased tone of the glomerular afferent arterioles. Serum creatinine concentration rises and decreases creatinine clearance. The undesirable effects correlate with the duration of treatment and dose.

Endocrinological and metabolic: Dyslipidemia (predisposing factors such as hypertension), hypomagnesemia, hyperkalemia, gynecomastia, hypertrichosis.

Neurotoxicity: There have been reports of convulsions, especially in combination with high dose methylprednisolone, encephalopathy, anxiety, headache, and fever.

Others: There is an increased risk of developing skin and lymphoproliferative malignancies in cyclosporine-treated psoriasis patients.

- Increase in the occurrence of malignant lymphomas.

- Increase the level of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alfa.

- Increase the infection risk.
