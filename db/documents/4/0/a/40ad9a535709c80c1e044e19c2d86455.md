The established upper limit of calcium intake is 2500 mg for adults aged 19 to 50 years and 2000 mg for adults aged 51 years and older.

Generally, calcium is not subject to routine monitoring in otherwise healthy patients. On a related note, the United States Preventative Service Task Force (USPSTF) states that current evidence is insufficient (e.g., grade I) regarding the advantages and disadvantages of vitamin D screening in asymptomatic adults. However, calcium levels are regularly monitored in patients with several other conditions, such as renal insufficiency, chronic kidney disease, recurrent nephrolithiasis, hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, certain gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., celiac disease), and vitamin D deficiency, among others. The dietary and supplemental calcium intake is adjusted accordingly based on regular monitoring for these patients.
