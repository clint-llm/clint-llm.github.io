Mortality and recovery are highly variable depending on the underlying cause of the locked-in syndrome. Locked-in syndrome generally has a high mortality rate in the acute setting. Retrospective studies and analysis models have estimated the 5-year and 10-year mortality rates of 84% and 31%, respectively.

Patterson and Grabois categorized patients into five different groups based on recovery a few months after the onset of their condition:

- No recovery: patients who exhibited no return of motor function

- Minimum recovery: patients who displayed some voluntary motor return but was fully dependent on others for care

- Moderate recovery: patients who have a noticeable return of motor function, giving them the ability to complete some but not all activates of daily living

- Full recovery: patients who regained the ability to perform all activities of daily living with slight neurological deficits

- No neurological deficit: patients who reported no neurologic deficits

The study demonstrated that more nonvascular cases had moderate to full recovery. A total of 18 out of the 34 patients who suffered from a nonvascular exhibited some return of motor function. Additionally, 12 of the 18 recovery cases experienced a full recovery during the first six months.

In contrast, only 29 of the 105 total vascular patients had developed some form of recovery after the onset of their condition. Of the patients who survived after the initial four months, 13 of 16 showed evidence of moderate to full functional recovery, with only 2 cases experiencing a full recovery.
