The cervical spine consists of seven vertebrae, which are anatomically unique from the other four regions of the spine. The cervical bifid spinous processes, transverse foramina, and triangular vertebral foramen are key structural features that enable the functionality of this region.

In contrast to C1-C2, the five vertebrae in the lower portion of the cervical spine (C3-C7), have a vertebral body and an uncinate process, a feature unique to the cervical spine that consists of a hook-shaped process on the superolateral margin designed to limit movement of the intervertebral discs during rotation. Furthermore, there are several ligaments connecting each level of the spine that include the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments, the ligamentum flavum, and the interspinous ligament. The nuchal ligament and the transverse ligament articulate at the level of the cervical spine only.

The structure of the cervical spine allows for a wide range of motion in all three planes (sagittal, transverse, and coronal). Flexion, forward bending of the neck in the sagittal plane. Extension, backward bending of the neck in the sagittal plane. Sidebending, flexion to the right or left in the coronal plane. And rotation, rotating to the left or right in the transverse plane.
