A sudden increase in arterial blood pressure and left ventricular pressure during thoracic aortic clamping may lead to acute compression of subendocardial blood vessels and ischemia, causing a decrease in myocardial contractility. Vascular autoregulation regulates subendocardial blood distribution increasing the blood flow to the affected areas, which increases the otherwise compromised contractility of the heart.

Physiologically, the Anrep effect lets the heart adapt to an abrupt increase in afterload, occurring just after the Frank-Starling mechanism. Crucial intracellular signals for the development of the Anrep effect like increased oxidative stress, sodium-hydrogen antiporter I hyperactivity, and augmented calcium concentration play critical roles in the progression of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.
