Posterolateral rotatory instability (PLRI) occurs secondary to a traumatic or iatrogenic injury to the LCL, which is the most common recurrent instability of the elbow. The radial head frequently subluxes, which creates lateral elbow pain and mechanical issues while the elbow is in flexion and supination, and a load is applied.

While conservative treatment such as physical therapy and activity modification should be trialed, nonoperative management of PLRI is typically ineffective. Surgical treatment is necessary to restabilize the joint in patients with persistent and symptomatic instability that causes pain or functional impairment. In acute, simple dislocation, closed reduction under general anesthesia is suggested. If the lateral elbow is stable past 30 degrees of extension, the patient wears a dynamic brace for six weeks. However, if after the closed reduction, the lateral elbow is still unstable before 30 degrees extension, ligament repair is necessary.

Chronic and symptomatic PLRI requires surgical intervention, as mentioned. The pivot shift test is performed on a supine patient, with the forearm hypersupinated. Valgus stress, along with an axial load, is then applied to the elbow while moving the elbow form extension to flexion. A positive-shift test on a conscious patient is with patient apprehension. In a sedated patient (under general anesthesia), this test is positive with subluxation or dislocation of the elbow, typically occurring between 30 to 45 degrees of flexion.

Low-grade PLRI (subluxation) is treated with LCL imbrication via arthroscopic or open technique. Severe PLRI (dislocation) requires LCL reconstruction with graft use. Results after reconstruction show good to excellent results in 85% of patients. Recurrent instability has been seen even after surgical intervention, in up to as many of 25% of patients after medium to long-term follow-up.

MCL injury is more common, and especially seen in overhead throwers such as pitchers. For painful, symptomatic MCL injuries, reconstruction is a reliable treatment method for correction. Surgery is indicated after nonoperative treatment has been exhausted. Surgical treatment for the MCL is one of the most well known in the sports world and is dubbed "Tommy John surgery" after pitcher Tommy John was successfully treated using the following technique. The docking technique is most commonly performed. Advantages include minimizing injury to the flexor/pronator musculature, avoidance of the ulnar nerve, providing an optimal location for graft tensioning, and minimizing the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle.

Surgical treatment utilizes autograft, most commonly from the palmaris longus. Other graft options include gracilis, semitendinosus, toe extensor, plantaris, patellar tendon, and Achilles autografts. This injury that was once deemed a career-ending injury for major league baseball pitchers now shows an astounding 83% return to sport after UCL reconstruction.
