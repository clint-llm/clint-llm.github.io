Remission in AN varies. Three-fourths of patients treated in out-patient settings remit within 5 years and the same percentage experience intermediate-good outcomes (including weight gain). Relapse is more common in patients who are older with a longer duration of disease or lower body fat/weight at the end of treatment, have co-morbid psychiatric disorders, or receive therapy outside of a specialized clinic. Patients who achieve partial remission often develop another form of eating disorder (ex. bulimia nervosa or unspecified eating disorder).

All-cause mortality is greater in AN compared to the rest of the population. It has one of the highest mortality rates of all eating disorders due to medical complications, substance abuse, and suicide. Patients with AN have increased rates of suicide and this accounts for 25% of deaths associated.
