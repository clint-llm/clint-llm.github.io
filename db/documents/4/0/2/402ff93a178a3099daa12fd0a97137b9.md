Femur immobilization is a temporary measure to bridge to definitive care. The clinical significance of immobilization is stabilizing the original injury and preventing further injury. Femur fractures produce sharp shards of bone which may lacerate vessels and nerves which course along the shaft of the femur. There is also the potential for further injury to the same structures in dislocation injury. Health care teams should make every effort to prevent these injury complications as they may be life or limb threatening. Laceration of the femoral artery by a bone shard could lead to significant bleeding in the thigh and cause injury to the distal limb including ischemia and compartment syndrome.

From the patient perspective, proper immobilization often leads to significant pain reduction and reduced need for analgesics. The patient may also experience painful muscle spasms. Treat the muscle spasm to improve patient comfort and also reduce needed analgesics.
