Contraindications for dronabinol and nabilone are hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or components of its formulation. For dronabinol, this includes sesame for the capsule formulation and alcohol for the oral solution. Care is necessary for elderly patients due to the increased risk of postural hypotension and cannabis-induced delirium. Dronabinol is listed as a pregnancy Category C drug as it has not demonstrated any teratogenic effects in animal models at 0.2Â to 5 times the maximum recommended human dose, but there have been no well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
