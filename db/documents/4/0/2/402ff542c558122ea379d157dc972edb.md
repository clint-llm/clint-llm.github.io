Thorough ocular and physical examinations are warranted on presentation. In patients with suspected ocular causes, referral to an ophthalmologist is recommended for a thorough evaluation. Radiographic imaging, usually with computed tomography of the head and orbits, is also recommended.

A unique approach involving the placement of punctal plugs has been described in the literature as well. This involves the placement of punctal plugs in the superior and inferior puncta. This helps identify retrograde flow as the cause of hemolacria. If hemolacria resolves with the placement of punctal plugs with continued or initiation of epistaxis, the anatomical source can be identified.

Dacryoendoscopy promises to be an important tool to rule out bleeding lesions within the tear drainage system, which may be undetected without this modality.
