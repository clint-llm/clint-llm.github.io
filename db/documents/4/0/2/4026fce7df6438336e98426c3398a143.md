Ross procedure was first described in 1947. It has the advantage that surgeons use viable autograft that can grow, regenerate, and has a low risk of endocarditis. These characteristics make them ideal for pediatric and young patients. Pediatric Ross procedure has lower mortality and a lower rate of reinterventions as compared to other graft procedures.
