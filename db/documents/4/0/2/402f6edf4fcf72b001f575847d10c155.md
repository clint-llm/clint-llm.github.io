Interpretation of a radionucleotide labeled leukocyte study requires knowledge of normal and abnormal variants. Normal findings at 18Â to 24 hours of the study include uptake primarily by the reticuloendothelial system of the spleen, liver, and bone marrow.

When detecting an abscess, the uptake in that pathologic area may have uptake either greater than or equal to the uptake of the liver. Up to one-half of the cases can be visualized four hours after injection, with greater than 90% uptake by 24 hours.

In cases of osteomyelitis, radiolabeled indium-111 uptake significantly increases. However, if a patient has been receiving treatment with IV antibiotics before obtaining a nuclear scan with radiolabeled indium, the results may show limited uptake in that area, producing a false negative result.

In cases of infected orthopedic hardware, the indium 111- tagged leukocyte scan shows uptake that usually increases in the area of interest. However, in the presence of orthopedic hardware or a prosthesis, it may make radiological interpretation difficult as the orthopedic device displaces bone marrow.
