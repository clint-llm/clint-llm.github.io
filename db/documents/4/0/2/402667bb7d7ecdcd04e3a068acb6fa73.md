Disopyramide is an orally administered drug in the form of capsules. There are two types of capsule formulations contrasting with their drug delivery system property: the immediate-release and extended-release disopyramide. When using the standard release capsules, 200 to 300 mg of disopyramide is given as an initial dose, and 100 to 150 mg of disopyramide is given every 6 hours. Fewer initial dose and maintenance dose are needed for extended-release capsules because of the formulation's extended half-life, and consequently, its duration of actions. However, extended-release capsules are usually avoided if the clinician wants to achieve a rapid drug peak concentration.

To promote less variation in peak and trough serum levels, disopyramide should be administered around the clock (4 times per day; 12-6-12- 6, not 9-1-5-9). The controlled release capsules should not be broken nor chewed.

Concerning its side effects, disopyramide must be started when the patient is under in-hospital treatment except for patients without heart disease who have a normal QT interval.
