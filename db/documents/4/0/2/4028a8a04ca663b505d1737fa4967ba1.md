During a parathyroidectomy or thyroidectomy (total or partial), careful attention should be given to the arteries of the thyroid as well as coursing nerves. The recurrent laryngeal nerve, a branch of CN X courses with the inferior thyroid artery, while dissecting the ITA insult to the recurrent laryngeal nerve will cause the patient to go hoarse as this nerve innervates the larynx. Often during thyroidectomies, surgeons leave one parathyroid gland as not to cause the patient to become hypocalcemic.

If a patient presents with a nodule that needs a biopsy, it requires placement of an internal jugular central line needs to be placed, an ultrasound will guide these procedures to protect local neuro-vasculature damage and increase accuracy. On either side of the thyroid lies the carotid sheath, which encompasses the common carotid artery, internal carotid artery, vagus nerve, sympathetic plexus of nerves, and the internal jugular vein.
