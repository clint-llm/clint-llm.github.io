Rocuronium is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker widely used to produce muscle relaxation to help facilitate surgery and ventilation of the lungs in elective and emergent situations. It is one of the many non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers that is used but has the distinct advantage of being fast-acting and reversible. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring, of rocuronium, so providers can direct patient therapy in anesthesia where it is indicated, as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of rocuronium.
- Summarize the indications for using rocuronium as an anesthesia agent.
- Review the adverse effects of rocuronium.
- Outline the contraindications to using rocuronium.
