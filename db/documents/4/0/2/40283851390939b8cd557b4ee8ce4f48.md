There are several areas of clinical practice where the doll's eyes reflex has significance:

- Vestibular lesions - Lesions to the vestibular nerve or vestibular nuclei have been shown to impair the ipsilateral doll's eyes reflex.

- Assessing dizziness - The doll's eyes reflex can assess dizziness in the office with rapid vestibular-ocular reflex testing. An abnormal response would show refixation saccades. Found to be 39% sensitive and 97% specific.

- Psychiatric patients - Schizophrenic and bipolar patients can show abnormal smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEMs), both vertical and horizontal. However, there is evidence that these patients should show an intact doll's eyes reflex.

- Intensive care units - The doll's eyes reflex (oculocephalic response) in critically ill intensive care patients can independently predict altered mental status (delirium, coma, confusion) after cessation of sedation.

- Neonates - Most neonates exhibit an unsuppressed doll's eyes reflex before 11.5 weeks; this can serve as a neonatal milestone in neurologic development.

- Anesthesia - There appears to be some utility in assessing the doll's eyes reflex in ophthalmologic surgery.

- Nursing - Like other reflexes, nursing staff can receive training on evaluating the doll's eyes reflex in select patients.
