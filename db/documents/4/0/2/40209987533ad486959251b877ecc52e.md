The presenilin proteins presenilin-1, and presenilin-2, are vital to the function of a protease complex called gamma-secretase. Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit complex expressed in several organs and various human brain cell types. The complex cleaves several transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein. Abnormal cleavage of amyloid precursor protein has potential implications in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Researchers have also found that presenilin proteins are essential during neural cell development and migration by regulating the Notch signaling pathway.
