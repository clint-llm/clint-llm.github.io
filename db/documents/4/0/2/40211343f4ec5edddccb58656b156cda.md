For many patients, their symptoms will start to resolve in a few months but it is not uncommon for it to take much longer. Patience is key. The best thing that one can do is to adequately control their pain with medications prescribed by their doctors. After their pain resolves, physical therapy will be crucial in addressing the weakness that will typically present after the pain subsides. Although there is no guarantee in preventing brachial neuritis, the best advice is to prevent shoulder or arm injuries since that can potentially predispose them to the condition. Otherwise, there is not much else that one can do to prevent the condition.

As with other types of peripheral neuropathies, avoiding cigarettes and alcohol, eating a healthy diet along with regular exercises can certainly help with this condition.

Not surprisingly, this condition can cause a lot of anxiety and emotional stress. Patients are encouraged to participate in relaxation techniques like yoga which can reduce their stress levels. EMG follow-up studies can also be done since these tests can show early signs of recovery before clinical signs of recovery thereby helping to relieve patient's anxieties
