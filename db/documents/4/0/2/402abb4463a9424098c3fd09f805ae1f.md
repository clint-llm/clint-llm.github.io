Patients with Fabry disease need to be managed in anÂ interprofessional team approach, with input and regular follow-up from physicians in neurology and ophthalmology, in addition to experts in managing diseases of kidney, heart, and skin.

Every year patients should be screened for new-onset symptoms with close monitoring of complete blood count and renal function panel, along with workup for proteinuria. Cardiology monitoring with imaging and electrophysical studies should be done within 1 to 2 years.

Screening for family members includes an enzymatic assay for deficient alpha-Gal A activity in both symptomatic male and female relatives. There is no supportive evidence for routine prenatal screening and enzyme replacement in infants.
