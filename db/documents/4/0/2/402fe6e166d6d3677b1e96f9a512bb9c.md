Mesenteric ischemia is a manifestation of peripheral vascular disease in which the blood supply fails to meet the metabolic demands of visceral organs. Acutely, it is a surgical emergency resulting in severe abdominal pain classically described as "pain out of proportion to physical examination." However, chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) often presents with vague abdominal pain that may be difficult to differentiate from other, more common causes of abdominal pain.
