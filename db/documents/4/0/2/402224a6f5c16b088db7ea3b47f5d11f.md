Hyperparathyroidism should be suspected if hypercalcemia is found with hypophosphatemia.

All calcium nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis patients should be checked for elevated serum calcium. If hypercalcemia is found, a parathyroid hormone level should be performed.

Primary hyperparathyroidism preferentially reduces cortical bone density and increases fracture risk at sites where cortical bone predominates, such as the distal forearm, with relative sparing of trabecular bone. For this reason, those with hyperparathyroidism should have a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry that includes the distal third of the radius, a site composed almost exclusively of cortical bone, in addition to the more common measurements at the spine and hip.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is associated with some psychological complaints, including depression, anxiety, fatigue, irritability, lassitude, and sleep disturbances. Surgical correction of hyperparathyroidism seems to help, but the relief of psychological symptoms and improvement in quality of life scores is somewhat inconsistent.

When there is a family history of hyperparathyroidism, consider the possibility of multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1, 2a, 4, or familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH). 24-hour urinary calcium excretion with calculating the calcium/creatinine excretion ratio is the best initial test to differentiate familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia from primary hyperparathyroidism.
