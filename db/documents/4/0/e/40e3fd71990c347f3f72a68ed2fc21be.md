In adults and children over eight years, 250 mg at bedtime is initiated during the first week, which is increased to 250 mg twice daily in the second week, 250 mg thrice daily in the third week, and 250 mg four times a day in the fourth week. The clinical efficacy of a dosage regimen takes several days before it can be tested.

- It is not recommended to dosage greater than 2 g daily.

In patients who are already on other anticonvulsants, the usual dosage range of primidone in adults and children eight years and older is between 125 mg and 1500 mg daily in divided doses.
