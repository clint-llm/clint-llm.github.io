Blood tests often show leukocytosis and a raised C-reactive protein (CRP).E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis. Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens have also been isolated.

The diagnosis of pyocytis can be aided by using computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound. The benefit of ultrasound is that it is more easily accessed and can be performed at the bedside. Ultrasound will show a thickened bladder wall and a heterogeneous echogenic collection.

Investigation and diagnosis of pyocytis may also include cystoscopy to aid bladder access, evacuate toxic collections, and biopsy thick-walled bladder to exclude malignancy.
