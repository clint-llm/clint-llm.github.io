Torticollis, also known as a twisted neck, is the contraction or contracture of the muscles of the neck that causes the head to tilt to one side. It is accompanied by rotation of the chin to the opposite side with flexion. Usually, torticollis is not a diagnosis but rather a manifestation of a variety of underlying conditions. It can be congenital or due to acquired causes. It can occur at any age, depending on the etiology. The congenital form of torticollis usually presents within a few weeks after birth. Most of the time, it presents as an isolated condition. The diagnostic basis is on the clinical examination findings, and the mainstay of treatment is physical therapy. Surgical management is an option only when medical and physical management does not show the desired results or for cosmetic reasons.
