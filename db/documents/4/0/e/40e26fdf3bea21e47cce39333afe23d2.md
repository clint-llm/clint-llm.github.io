Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) is a pathologic increase in muscle mass of the right ventricle in response to pressure overload, most commonly due to severe lung disease. Affected patients will present with symptoms due to pulmonary hypertension and have exertional chest pain, peripheral edema, exertional syncope, and right upper quadrant pain (due to passive hepatic congestion). Management of right ventricular hypertrophy involves the use of diuretics, oxygen, and anticoagulants. Prognosis depends on the etiology and severity of pulmonary hypertension. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of right ventricular hypertrophy and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of right ventricular hypertrophy.
- Describe the pathophysiology of right ventricular hypertrophy.
- Summarize the treatment options for right ventricular hypertrophy.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to manage patients using oxygen therapy, diuretics, and anticoagulants to enhance the delivery of care for those with right ventricular hypertrophy.
