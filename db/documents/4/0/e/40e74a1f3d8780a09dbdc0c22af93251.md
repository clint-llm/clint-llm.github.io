Treponema pertenue are spirochetes that cannot be cultured in vitro. All subspecies are morphology and serologically indistinguishable. These organisms reproduce every 30 hours and with corkscrew motility these move through connective tissue. These spirochetes are fragile outside of their host vectors and are rapidly killed by exposure to heat, oxygen, and drying.
