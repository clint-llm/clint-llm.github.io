Shellfish toxins are often associated with the presence of harmful algal blooms, when toxins can accumulate in shellfish and cause disease in humans. Shellfish poisoning syndromes are classified as paralytic, amnesic, diarrhetic, and neurotoxic. Improving healthcare professional knowledge of how to identify patients affected by different shellfish toxins and how to appropriately manage these patients will lead to better patient outcomes. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of shellfish poisoning syndromes and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the four shellfish poisoning syndromes. 
- Summarize the pathophysiology of each of the four shellfish toxins. 
- Summarize the treatment of patients affected by each of the four shellfish toxins. 
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients affected by shellfish toxins.
