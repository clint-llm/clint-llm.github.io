Patients should be counseled on the effects of hyponatremia and the severe consequences of it. Advice regarding keeping a log on the amount of water ingested will help. Feedback regarding medications being taken for psychiatric conditions to the providers should be encouraged. This will help in changing or adjusting the medicines based on how the patients were doing. Patients can be encouraged to restrict water intake by rewarding them. The family of a patient plays an important role.
