Germline inactivating mutations of the MEN1 or menin gene on chromosome 11 results in MEN1 Syndrome. MEN1 syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. In approximately 90% of cases, mutations are inherited from an affected parent, while in the remaining 10% of cases, the syndrome occurs secondary to a de novo mutation. Given this latter figure, clinical diagnostic criteria remain of utmost importance in diagnosing this syndrome.

Marini et al. published an analysis of germline MEN1 mutations in 410 patients and found 99 different mutations, 41 frameshift, 26 missense, 13 nonsense, 11 splicing site mutations, 4 in-frame small deletions, and 4 large intragenic deletions spanning over 1 exon. The study also demonstrated that gastro-entero-pancreatic tumors were more common in patients with nonsense mutations, while thoracic neuroendocrine tumors were more common in individuals bearing a splice mutation.CDKN1B have also been associated with pituitary adenomas, parathyroid adenomas, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Therefore, it is possible that mutations in this gene could potentially account for MEN1 syndromes without MEN1 gene mutation.
