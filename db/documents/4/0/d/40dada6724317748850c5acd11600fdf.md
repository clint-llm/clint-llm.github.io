Aphasia is a language disorder caused by damage in a specific brain area that controls language expression and comprehension. Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) refers to the group of neurodegenerative diseases showing gradual speech and language impairment as the primary presenting symptom without significant cognitive, physical, or behavioral components.

Regarding clinical advances, recent studies have enabled better characterization and differentiation based on linguistic and nonlinguistic profiles of PPA patients. Regarding neuroimaging, techniques such as diffusion imaging and resting-state fMRI allow us to go beyond distinct patterns of focal gray matter atrophy to a deeper understanding of the effects of his PPA on changes in structural and functional connectivity. Finally, despite significant advances in PPA, clinicopathological consensus on pathology is still far from conclusive. Nevertheless, improved characterization of PPA may positively impact patient management.

Fluent aphasia refers to deficits related to comprehension and is usually associated with Wernicke's brain area pathologies. In contrast, nonfluent aphasias produce a failure in language expression, written or verbal, and are often associated with pathologies in Broca's brain area. Although the general concept of a primary progressive language impairment disease process without cognitive effects was first described in the 1890s by Pick and Serieux, it wasn't until the 1980s that PPA was coined and was further explored by Mesulam.

Because of its close relation to Alzheimer's disease and Pick disease, the classification and diagnosis of PPA can sometimes be controversial.

The nonfluent/agrammatic and semantic variants are often grouped under the frontotemporal dementia syndromes, and the logopenic variant is frequently classified as an atypical variant of Alzheimer disease.
