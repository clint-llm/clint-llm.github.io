An individual’s environmental cues, also known as zeitgebers, drive the endogenous process of the circadian rhythm. The relationship between physiological and behavioral cues (timing of sleep, meals, work/social interactions) impact the timing of the sleep-wake cycle. Disturbances in an individual’s sleep cycle can have a significant detrimental effect on their overall health. Non-rhythmic regulations of core body temperature, cortisol levels, and melatonin secretion are all indicators of irregularities. Since fluctuations in body temperature occur systematically during the sleep/wake cycle, deviations from this cycle can indicate the onset of a disease or the nefarious presence of some external factor. Under the control of the SCN via the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, cortisol secretion is rhythmic, so the overproduction of cortisol can inhibit one’s ability to induce sleep. Likewise, the underproduction of melatonin can negatively impact one’s ability to fall asleep.
