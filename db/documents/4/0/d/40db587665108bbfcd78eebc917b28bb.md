Practitioners must take care to perform this block under a sterile technique to avoid infection. QLBs have a lower theoretical risk of infection than more central neuraxial approaches, and there are no reported cases of infectious complications from QLB. History of coagulopathy or anticoagulation use should be addressed before performing the block to avoid excessive bleeding or hematoma formation.

Any regional anesthesia procedure utilizing local anesthetic medications is associated with potential local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) due to systemic absorption of local anesthetics. The QLB is associated with lower plasma ropivacaine levels than TAP blocks, potentially making the QLB safer in that regard.
