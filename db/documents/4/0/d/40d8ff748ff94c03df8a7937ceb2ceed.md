Postoperative ileus carries a nonspecific presentation. While not a surgical or medical emergency, many other diagnoses that share symptoms with postoperative ileus can be emergent. Distinguishing between ileus and mechanical obstruction both at onset and throughout the clinical course, is key. Further, several other intra-abdominal issues can yield similar symptoms to ileus and should be ruled out. This includes ischemia, abscess, surgical complication, or inflammation of the intra-abdominal organs, such as cholecystitis or pancreatitis.
