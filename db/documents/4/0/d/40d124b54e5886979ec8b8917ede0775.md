Inner ear barotrauma in divers may be challenging to distinguish from inner ear decompression sickness and requires dive-risk stratification and careful questioning regarding diving-related ear events. The HOOYAH criteria were developed as an adjunct to history and physical exams to help determine the etiology of inner ear symptoms. These include: 1) H: hard to clear; 2) O: onset of symptoms; 3) O: otoscopic exam; 4) Y: your dive profile; 5) A: additional symptoms and 6) H: hearing.
