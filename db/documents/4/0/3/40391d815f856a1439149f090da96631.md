The differential diagnosis for hearing loss is very broad as the condition has various causes. More than 300 congenital syndromes are related to hearing loss. Also, conductive hearing loss, as well as SNHL, has multiple triggering factors mentioned in the Etiology section. Therefore, a thorough history and clinical examination are key for correct diagnosis and management. The most important step is the physical examination and comprehensive audiogram to rule out easily correctible causes such as cerumen or Eustachian tube dysfunction. This must be performed before a more advanced workup is entertained.
