If untreated, ATTR-CM can cause progressive worsening heart failure, arrhythmias, and conduction system diseases, which can cause sudden cardiac death due to fatal arrhythmias or complete heart block. In addition, the functional capacity and the quality of life deteriorates exponentially with every heart failure exacerbation and subsequent hospitalization.

Tafamidis, which is used for the treatment of ATTR-CM, is well tolerated. However, in clinical trials, the rate of adverse events was similar in tafamidis and placebo groups.
