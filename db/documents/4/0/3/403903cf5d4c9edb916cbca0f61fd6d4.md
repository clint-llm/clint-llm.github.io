Incidents involving hazardous substances are not rare. Hospitals and EMS organizations are required to participate in community planning and develop ERP to handle such events. Being prepared for these instances includes planning activities, writing protocols, training workers in proper PPE use, and decontamination processes. Appropriate PPE use is a priority in HAZMAT response since it protects workers from contamination in the field as well as in the hospital.

The decontamination process is usually performed in the field by specialized HAZMAT teams. However, individuals may be transported to the ED prior to decontamination. In these cases, the hospitals must be ready to care for victims in a timely manner without contaminating the ED, which includes the staff and other patients at the hospital. Delay in the care for victims can result in an increase in medical complications and mortality. Furthermore, education and training in appropriate HAZMAT response leads to preparedness and, therefore, better clinical outcomes for victims. Recent research has shown that educational intervention for ED staff can effectively improve knowledge, skills-based performance, and confidence in PPE and decontamination skills, which are all critical in HAZMAT events.
