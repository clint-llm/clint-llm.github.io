The blood work is usually unremarkable, but in severe cases of diarrhea, one may observe hypernatremia and hypokalemia. A stool culture is the best way to make a diagnosis of Yersinia. Precautions should be in place to avoid infection from stool contact. The gram stain may reveal 'safety'pin' like organisms.

Blood cultures are usually negative. Other studies depend on the organ system involved. Imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound or CT scan) are often required to determine if the patient has appendicitis or pseudoappendicitis. Diagnosis may also be obtained from positive cultures obtained from mesenteric lymph nodes, pharyngeal exudates, peritoneal fluid, or blood.

Serologic tests including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and immunoblotting to detect IgG, IgA and IgM are used in Japan and Europe but not veryÂ commonly used in the US. Polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence assays have been developed but not widely used.

Colonoscopy is not usually done but when performed, it may reveal aphthoid lesions and ulcers in the terminal ileum. In most cases, the right side of the bowel is involved.
