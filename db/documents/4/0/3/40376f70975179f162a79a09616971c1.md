Fertility preservation options specific to postpubertal men with a new cancer diagnosis include sperm cryopreservation before initiation of chemotherapy. Preferably two to three samples should be obtained. A male may be unable to ejaculate via masturbation for various reasons, including pubertal status, anxiety, hypogonadism, medications such as antidepressants and opioids, medical comorbidities such as diabetes, or neurologic issues, and underlying cancer.

In these circumstances, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, which are typically used to treat erectile dysfunction, may be used to help obtain a semen sample if there are no contraindications.

Men may also experience retrograde ejaculation if they have diabetes, take antidepressant and antipsychotic medications, or have had prior surgery to the prostate or a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. First-line treatment in these patients is the use of an alpha-agonist to restore antegrade ejaculation by tightening the muscles at the bladder neck and preventing semen from traveling into the bladder. If men have contraindications or fail to respond to alpha-agonists, another option is to alkalinize and collect the urine for processing viable sperm.

Additionally, there is the option for TESE with subsequent IVF or ICSI, as mentioned previously. In prepubertal boys, testicular tissue cryopreservation is still considered experimental and must be performed in the setting of a clinical trial.
