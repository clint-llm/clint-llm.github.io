Although Francois Gigot de la Peyronie first described PD over 250 years ago, PD's natural history has only recently been fully appreciated. Initially based on a small cohort study in the 1970s

There are two phases in PD, the acute phase and the chronic phase. In the first 6-18 months

**History**

A thorough history and examination is the lynchpin of formulating a correct diagnosis in PD. This can be a delicate and distressing topic for patients as PD's ramifications on a man's sex life and relationships can profound. Consequently, clinicians should be empathetic and understanding when exploring the patient's symptoms and eliciting their ideas, concerns, and expectations of their condition. The psychosocial impact of the condition may warrant input from counselors and therapists.

A comprehensive history should include a detailed presenting complaint, past medical and surgical history. The sexual history is also particularly relevant in PD. The following are considered essential in a PD history taking:

Timing: Onset and progression of symptoms. Is the patient in the acute or chronic phase?

- Deformity: How would the patient describe the penile deformity? What is the direction and degree of curvature? Is there an hourglass deformity, hinge effect, or any other concerning abnormality?

- Erection: the degree of rigidity, ability to sustain and maintain an erection, presence of nocturnal erections.

- Pain: If pain is present, is it associated with the flaccid or erect state or both?

- Trauma: History of penile trauma/fracture, urologic procedures or surgeries

- Family history: Any family history of Peyronie’s disease or Dupuytren's disease?

- Medical/Surgical history: Diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.

- Social history: Sexual history, smoking, and recreational drug use.

- Psychosocial factors: Impact of the condition on the patient’s mood, relationships, and self-esteem.

**Examination**

Accurate evaluation of penile deformity is critical for determining a baseline and planning treatment. The penis should be examined in the flaccid and erect state. This allows a better understanding of the extent of the deformity and corroboration with what the patient experiences. An objective assessment of the degree of curvature is also vital for disease monitoring and treatment progression as reliance on patient estimates is notoriously unreliable.

The penis stretch length is performed with the penis in the flaccid state. The penis is grasped at the glans and pulled gently at 90 degrees from the body. Examination in the erect state can be performed after intracavernosal injection of vasoactive substances

PD is a clinical diagnosis; there is a limited role for diagnostic laboratory testing. However, they are valuable when a hypogonadal cause is suspected. In light of the strong correlation with other diseases, no workup would be complete without screening the patient for comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other fibroproliferative conditions such as Dupuytren's disease, plantar fasciitis, and scleroderma, amongst others.
