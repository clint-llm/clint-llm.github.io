Sympathomimetic agents are used to augment the endogenous catecholamines of the sympathetic nervous system for therapeutic benefit. The body has a wide distribution of different adrenergic receptors across many organ systems. Without a thorough understanding of the adrenoreceptor subtypes involved in various tissues, the clinical effects observed can seem confusing due to overlapping receptor activities and different effects seen at different doses. Although beyond the scope of this review, the following is a summary with examples of currently FDA approved sympathomimetic indications:

- Cardiac: includes the treatment of hypotension, including those caused by hypovolemic, distributive, and neurogenic shock.

- Pulmonary: include the treatment of asthma and COPD.

- Sympathomimetic agents are used as nasal decongestants for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis.

- Ophthalmic indications: include open-angle glaucoma.

- Neurologic: can even include local anesthetic effects.

- Psychiatric: include the treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy.

- Endocrine: include the treatment for obesity.

- Genitourinary: include urinary incontinence.

These indications are currently FDA approved; however, future applications for this versatile drug class are currently under investigation.
