Harlequin syndrome is common in women. There are few sporadic case reports in the literature indicating its rarity. However, it is a common presentation among healthy newborns, and the incidence has been reported as high as 10%.

It usually occurs from day 2 to day 5 of life and rarely occurs after three weeks. It was previously thought to be more common among premature neonates, but recent studies show a similar incidence among healthy term neonates.
