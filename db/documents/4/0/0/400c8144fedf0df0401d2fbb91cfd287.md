Sertoli cells are present in the seminiferous tubules of the male gonads, the testes. They were first observed in 1865 by a young Italian physician Enrico Sertoli and named after him.sustentacular cells of Sertoli and are the nursemaid cells of the primary spermatogonia.

Sertoli cells help to facilitate the process of spermiogenesis, and thus the production of viable sperm. Sertoli cells also secrete a myriad of vital molecules, include androgen binding protein (ABP), Inhibin B, and Activin. These secretions facilitate spermatogenesis directly or indirectly via a hormonal negative feedback system. Sertoli cells also respond to pituitary hormones such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to begin the process of spermatogenesis, supplementing the adjacent spermatogonia.
