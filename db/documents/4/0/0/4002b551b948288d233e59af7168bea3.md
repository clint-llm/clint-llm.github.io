The inflammatory response may lead to granuloma formation, which are often distinctive doughnut-shaped, with a clear central space in liver and bone marrow biopsy specimens. Relapses can occur as the immunity is not lasting. In immunocompetent patients, the biopsy specimen shows an inflammatory response with few microorganisms. In immunosuppressed patients, due to the absence of cellular immune response, the biopsy specimen is mostly comprised of many microorganisms leading to chronic infection.
