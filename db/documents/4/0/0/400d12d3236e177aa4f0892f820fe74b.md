Nintedanib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that binds to a family of growth factor receptors and prevents the proliferation of fibroblasts. It reduces the ongoing fibrotic process and delays the progression to long-lasting damage. Nintedanib was initially approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2014 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

These lung volume benefits are primarily seen in the Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) patternÂ and SSc-ILD when nintedanib is used in combination with mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide.
