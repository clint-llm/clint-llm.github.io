Often in addition to a full history and physical examination, other laboratory tests are required. A complete blood panel, with differential, chemistries, and evaluation of vitamin deficiencies (vitamin B12 and folate, copper) are necessary.  If warranted, evaluation of the patient's gastrointestinal history is an essential review as many causes of anemia have links to absorption problems of the gut.  If persistent anemia, then a peripheral smear should be reviewed as well as the potential for a bone marrow biopsy.
