Various histologic studies have investigated the proprioceptive characteristics of the soft tissue elements of the glenohumeral joint. Ruffini corpuscles and Pacini corpuscles are distributed throughout the capsuloligamentous complex.

Histopathologic studies comparing biopsied static stabilizing elements during intraoperative arthroscopy were analyzed and compared to the macroscopic degree/grade of injury noted during surgery. The authors reported limited variations in cell density, matrix swelling, and collagen fiber disruptions.
