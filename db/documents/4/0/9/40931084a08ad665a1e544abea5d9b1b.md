**Patient Counseling:**

Patient education before surgery is mandatory. Counseling about the procedure and postoperative complications related to vascular compromise are priorities to understand the commitment of the postoperative measures and indications to avoid them. Typical advice for infection and scar formation is necessary. Besides, patients should be educated upon wound care for the donor site and pedicle, to avoid smoking, follow-up appointments, goals of reconstruction, and expectations of the surgeon and patient.****Informed consent is taken as in any other procedure.

**Pre-Operative Preparation:**

Design the flap according to the defect. Lenght of the flap should be higher to avoid tension or lack of coverage after insetting.

The surgical site is cleansed; a sterile field is created.

A tourniquet is tied on the arm or thigh when the flap is performed either in upper or lower extremity respectively, to provide a bloodless field for surgery.
