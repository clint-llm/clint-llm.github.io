Hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in whites, with a prevalence of 1 in 300 to 500 individuals.

In hemochromatosis, men are affected around 2-3 times as often as women. The estimated ratio between men and women is 1.8:1 to 3:1. Women with hemochromatosis become symptomatic later in life than men due to the blood loss and consequent iron excretion associated with menstruation. In men, the disease usually becomes apparent in the fifth decade; however, in women, it presents in the sixth decade often. In contrast, juvenile hemochromatosis may appear in persons aged 10-30 years.
