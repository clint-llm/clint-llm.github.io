PAD is characterized by thrombosis of the deep venous system with patency of the collateral veins and the absence of limb ischemia. PCD is a progression of PAD in which there is near-total occlusion of the major deep venous system as well as most of the microvascular collateral veins of the extremity, causing severe venous congestion. The potential window for reversibility is what differentiates PCD from venous gangrene in which there is complete obstruction of venous outflow to the limb, including extensive, irreversible capillary involvement and often full-thickness necrosis.

Increased venous hypertension due to venous outflow occlusion results in a change in the pressure differential between hydrostatic and oncotic pressure that leads to increasing interstitial edema and massive fluid sequestration into the limb. The increase in interstitial and compartment pressure ultimately leads to the collapse of the arterial system once the compartment pressure overcomes arterial wall tension. This leads to acute ischemia and venous gangrene. Because of fluid third spacing, hemodynamic instability and hypovolemia ensue, increasing patient morbidity and mortality.
