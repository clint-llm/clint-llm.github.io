HSVs are enveloped, double-stranded, DNA viruses. Two distinct HSV types exist: HSV-1 and HSV-2.

- Infections with HSV-1 usually involve the face and skin above the waist; however, an increasing number of genital herpes cases are attributable to HSV-1.

- Infections with HSV-2 usually involve the genitalia and skin below the waist in sexually active adolescents and adults.

However, either type of virus can be found in either area, and both HSV-1 and HSV-2 cause herpes disease in neonates. As with all human herpesviruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2 establish latency following primary infection, with periodic reactivation to cause recurrent symptomatic disease or asymptomatic viral shedding.
