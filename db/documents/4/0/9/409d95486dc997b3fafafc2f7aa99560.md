Advanced age and large occiput-C2 angles are predictive of the odontoid fracture angle.

The atlantoaxial joint and fractured segment all move in unison, causing unbearable pain during neck movements.

Non-operative management of odontoid fractures can result in the following:

- Solid fusion

- Unstable nonunion, or

- Fibrous nonunion.

The fusion is governed by the following:

- Pattern of injury

- Fracture subtype

- The slope of the fracture line

- Angulation (more or less than 11 degrees

- Displacement (more or less than 5 mm)

- Blood supply

- Bone quality, and

- Age of the fracture and that of the patient.
