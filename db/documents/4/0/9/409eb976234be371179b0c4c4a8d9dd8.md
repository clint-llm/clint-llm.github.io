Intervention is not always sensible or the best option. In-depth discussions about prognosis and outcomes should be discussed with family members. A specific expression that staged procedures may not be curative should be given, mentioning the possible need for cardiac transplantation in the future. If found in utero, elective termination may be necessary for the discussion of available options. Living conditions should also be discussed with patients. Families residing at altitudes higher than 1700 meters above sea level may impair long-term survival benefits.
