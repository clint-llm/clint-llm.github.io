Kratom ingestion and toxicity require an interprofessional approach. Depending on the severity of presenting symptoms, critical care, nursing, pharmacy, social work, and addiction services may be required. Nursing and pharmacy are essential for the initial resuscitation and delivery of medications. Pharmacists, in particular, need to be knowledgeable about the effects of this substance so they can inform patients and other interprofessional healthcare team membersÂ regarding kratom use. Critical care teams and psychiatry involvement is crucial for critically ill patients with possible co-ingestions and those with suicidal intent. Social work and addiction services are necessary for those motivated to control their drug addiction. Overall, kratom use, toxicity, and withdrawal require further research to develop definitive management practices.
