**Signs and Symptoms**

Patients with post-myocardial infarction ventricular septal rupture may seem comfortable early in the disease. Recurrence of angina, pulmonary edema, hypotension, and shock may later develop abruptly. Alternatively, abrupt onset of hemodynamic compromise, characterized by hypotension, biventricular failure, and a new murmur, may be the initial manifestation.

**Physical Findings**

The diagnosis should be suspected when a new pan-systolic murmur develops, especially in the setting of worsening hemodynamic profile and biventricular failure. All patients with MI must have a well-documented cardiac examination at presentation and frequent evaluations after that. The murmur of acute post-MI VSR is usually best heard at the lower left sternal border and is usuallyÂ accompanied by a thrill in 50% of the cases. In patients with a large VSR and severe heart failure or cardiogenic shock, the murmur may be of low intensity or inaudible, but the absence of a murmur does not rule out VSR.
