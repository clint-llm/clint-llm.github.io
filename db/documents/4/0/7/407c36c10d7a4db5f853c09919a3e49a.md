Umbrella cells demonstrate a characteristic ultrastructural feature;Â plaques or asymmetrical unit membranes. These are thick, focal areas of the cell membrane associated with actin filaments. Actin filaments extend from the plaques' inner surface to the umbrella cells' cytoplasm. In the non-distended bladder, the superficial cells appear to fold inwards; these folded plaques seemingly form membrane-bound, cytoplasmic fusiform vesicles. When the bladder distends during filling, these vesicles become part of a smooth surface as the cells flatten out.
