Liposarcoma is a rare entity with a variable presentation and prognosis. The clinical presentation and symptoms are not specific; therefore, a high degree of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis. Even with suggestive radiologic studies, the definitive diagnosis cannot be made without biopsy/resection. Addressing this pathology requires the efforts of an interprofessional team. Care coordination between clinical providers of different specialties, including primary care clinicians, oncologists, radiologists, and interventional radiologists or surgeons, is needed to make a timely diagnosis and provide optimal patient care. Specialty-trained nurses can help educate the patient on planned diagnostic studies and expected outcomes to alleviate patient anxiety while the diagnosis is being made. Perioperatively, surgical nurses and critical-care nurses assist the clinicians in monitoring the patients to ensure any potential postoperative complications are identified early. An integrated interprofessional team approach to diagnosing and treating patients with liposarcoma can greatly improve clinical outcomes.[Level 5]
