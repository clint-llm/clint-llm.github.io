The prognostic outcome is dependent upon the extent of local invitation, the status of surgical margins after the definitive surgery, and the presence of nodal metastasis. Node positivity is a key factor in determining the overall prognosis. The five-year survival rate range from 70% to 80% for node-negative disease compared to 20% to 50% for node-positive disease.
