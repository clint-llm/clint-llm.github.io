**Plantar Fasciitis**

The plantar fascia includes medial, central, and lateral portions. The most important is the central portion which attaches proximally to the medial tuberosity of the calcaneus. It supports the longitudinal arch, and it elongates with rising mechanical loading. Obesity, prolonged standing, flat feet, soleus-gastrocnemius complex dysfunction and ankle instability can lead to excessive stress on the fascia. Aging leads to a reduction of the elasticity of the plantar fascia. All the above-mentioned factors will lead to degeneration of the plantar fascia rather than inflammation and thickening of the fascia.

**Heel Fat Pad Atrophy**

The heel pad is composed of closely packed fat chambers surrounded by tough circular or cone-shaped collagenous septa and elastin fibers. Reduction of fat chambers is due to micro-trauma and repeated corticosteroid injections, leading to a decrease in the shock absorbing properties and development of pain.

**Calcaneal S****tress Fractures**

Normal weight-bearing stress is less than the threshold needed to cause a calcaneal fracture. Abnormal mechanical stress results in inadequate bone healing, osteoclast activation and thus stress fracture. Other relevant factors include: starting a new activity (running) and increased intensity or duration of previous activities (prolonged running and standing), obesity, inappropriate footwear, flat feet, and RA.

**Entrapment Neuropathies**

Tarsal tunnel syndrome is due to the entrapment of the tibial nerve underneath the flexor retinaculum on the medial side of the ankle. It might be idiopathic or secondary to diabetes mellitus, RA, and ganglion cysts.

Medial calcaneal nerve commonly arises from the tibial nerve above the level of the flexor retinaculum of the ankle. It carries sensory information from skin over the plantar surface of the calcaneus and subcutaneous fat. Its entrapment might be due to tight fascia, varicosities or scars of previous surgical procedures.

Baxter's nerve is the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve. It provides motor innervation to the quadratus plantae, flexor digitorum brevis, and abductor digiti minimi muscles. Also, Baxter's nerve carries sensory information from the calcaneal periosteum and the long plantar ligament. Baxter's nerve can be entrapped distally due to tight fascial planes between the abductor hallucis muscle and the quadratus plantae. Â Another entrapment site is at the anterior aspect of the medial calcaneal tuberosity (as it passes laterally) between the flexor digitorum brevis and quadratus plantae.
