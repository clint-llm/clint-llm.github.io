The management of osteitis pubis includes both conservative and surgical options. The first option remains conservative treatment.

Steroid injections have been demonstrated as a useful adjunctive therapy.

If conservative management does fail, surgical intervention may be required. The timeframe of when to consider conservative treatment as a failure ranges, and no set timetable has been established.

Those with symptomatic FAI and osteitis pubis may see a relief of their osteitis pubis when FAI is treated, supporting the notion that osteitis pubis is a result of altered joint motion elsewhere in the pelvis.
