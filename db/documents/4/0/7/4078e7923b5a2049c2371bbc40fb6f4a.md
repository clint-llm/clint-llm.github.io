Lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei (LMDF) is an idiopathic granulomatous disease affecting facial skin primarily. Nosologically, it is on a spectrum of facial granulomatous dermatoses and shares overlapping features with rosacea and sarcoidosis. In most cases, this disorder resolves spontaneously within several years but can leave potentially disfiguring scarring.

The name derives from a historic putative association with tuberculosis, as discussed below. More recent authors have proposed adopting the term facial idiopathic granulomas with regressive evolution (FIGURE) instead of the entrenched LMDF. However, it does not appear that a name change has been widely accepted.
