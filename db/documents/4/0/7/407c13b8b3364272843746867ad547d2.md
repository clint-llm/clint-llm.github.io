Patients on ixazomib require close monitoring. Specifically, liver function tests need to be carried out periodically due to the risk of hepatotoxicity. There have been reports of patients taking ixazomib who experienced hepatic steatosis, hepatitis cholestatic, hepatocellular injury, and drug-induced liver injury. Hence, liver function must be monitored, and dose reductions made if necessary. Similarly, patients on ixazomib should have their platelets and absolute neutrophil count monitored at least monthly due to the risk of thrombocytopenia.

During the first three cycles of treatment with ixazomib, the platelet count should be monitored weekly as drug levels will not be stable. If any adverse effects occur in regards to platelet or neutrophil count, dose modification can be considered. Do not start the medication unless ANC >1000, platelets > 75,000. Lastly, patients on ixazomib should be monitored for any signs of infection as reactivation of herpes zoster virus has been reported in some patients. To avoid this, patients should receive prophylactic antivirals while on ixazomib.
