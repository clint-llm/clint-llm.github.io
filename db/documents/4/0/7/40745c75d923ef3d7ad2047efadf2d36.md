The most common medications prescribed for acne vulgaris include benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, and topical/oral antibiotics. Despite their individual efficacy in treating mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris, studies have shown that the combined use of antibiotics or retinoids with benzoyl peroxide is more efficacious than either medication used alone. The combination is believed to be synergistic and has also been shown to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance.
