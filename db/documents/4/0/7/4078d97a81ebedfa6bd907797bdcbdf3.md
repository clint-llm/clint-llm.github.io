**Re-rupture**

- While newer level 1 evidence has reported no difference in re-rupture rates, prior studies have suggested a 10% to 40% re-rupture rate with nonoperative management (compared to a 1% to 2% rate of re-rupture after surgery)

- Lantto et al recently demonstrated the following in a randomized controlled trial of 60 patients from 2009 to 2013 at 18-month follow-up:

- Similar Achilles tendon performance scores
- Slightly increased calf muscle strength differences favoring the operative cohort (10% to 18% strength difference) at 18-month follow-up
- Slightly better health-related quality of life scores in the domains of physical functioning and bodily pain favored the operative cohort

**Wound Healing Complications**

- Overall, a 5-10% risk following surgery

- Risk factors for postoperative wound complications include the following:

- Smoking (most common and most significant risk factor)
- Female sex
- Steroid use
- Open technique (vs percutaneous procedures)

**Sural Nerve Injury**

- Increased rate of injury associated with the percutaneous procedure (compared to open technique)
