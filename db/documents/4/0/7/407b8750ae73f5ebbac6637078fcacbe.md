Evaluation should include noting any injury to the EAC and tympanic membrane before attempting removal of a foreign body. The patient's hearing should also be assessed, especially if there is suspicion for tympanic membrane injury/perforation or middle ear injury once the foreign body is removed. If the patient complains of hearing loss with the foreign body in place, audiometry or tuning fork testing should be used to quantify and document the loss. If a conductive hearing loss is greater than expected, or a sensorineural hearing loss is encountered, the patient should be urgently referred to an otolaryngologist for evaluation and removal of the foreign body, likely in the operating room.

Appropriate patient positioning is critical as well. Cooperative patients can either sit or lie down with the affected ear turned towards the clinician. For younger children, there are several options for positioning. The patient can sit in the parent's lap with the parent holding the patient's body with one hand and the other around the head with the head turned. The patient can also lie down, either supine or prone, on the stretcher with their head turned to improve access to the EAC.
