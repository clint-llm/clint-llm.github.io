Coronary artery fistulae are abnormal communications between the coronary arteries and adjacent structures. Â They include abnormal communications between the coronary arteries and cardiac chambers, referred to as coronary cameral fistulae or abnormal communications between the coronary arteries and other vessels referred to as coronary arteriovenous malformations.

Most coronary artery fistulae are small, asymptomatic, do not cause any complications, and resolve spontaneously. Large fistulae, however, may cause symptoms and complications.

Its site of origin and termination describes each fistula. A fistula originating from the right coronary artery draining into the right ventricle is the most common type of coronary artery fistula. Most fistulae terminate into the right ventricle or the right atrium. Rarely do they terminate into the left atrium or left ventricle.
