# Introduction

Antepartum infections are a significant contributor to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Populations in countries with developing economies bear the brunt of the burden of these infections.

# Etiology

Pregnancy results in a state of immune alteration, which is needed to prevent the destruction of the fetus by the maternal immune system.

Infections of the female urogenital tract can similarly impact birth outcomes, even though they are not always vertically-transmitted to the newborn. Such infections include bacterial vaginosis, mostly by group B streptococci (GBS). Bacterial vaginosis is an abnormal overgrowth of bacteria occurring in the setting of pH changes. GBS colonizes genitourinary tracts in many women but can cause significant fetal morbidity and mortality if left untreated; the most significant for prevalence is chorioamnionitis occurring by ascending infection. Chorioamnionitis or intraamniotic infection (IAI) is a condition wherein the fetal chorion and amnion become inflamed and infected.

# Epidemiology

Vertically transmitted infections are disproportionately prevalent in countries with developing economies.

Infections of the female urogenital tract are common worldwide. Bacterial vaginosis is estimated to affect nearly one-third of women of childbearing age in the United States, although approximately 80% of those affected were asymptomatic.

# Pathophysiology

The hormonally-mediated physiologic changes of pregnancy increase maternal risk for certain infections and may likewise increase the severity of disease in these patients.

Toxoplasma gondii causes toxoplasmosis, a protozoan that can cause human infection through ingestion of raw or undercooked meat or contaminated product, contact with cat feces or contaminated food or soil, or transfusion of infected blood products or donor organs.

Maternal rubella infection occurs following the exposure of a nonimmune individual to aerosolized viral particles.

Maternal HIV infection occurs through contact with infected bodily fluids, including through sexual contact, needle sticks, or blood transfusions.

Primary CMV is acquired through contact with infected bodily fluids, including saliva, urine, cervical or vaginal secretions, semen, blood, and breastmilk.

The Treponema pallidum causes syphilis. Maternal infection occurs through sexual contact, and congenital infection is transmitted transplacentally with increased risk in mothers with high spirochete titers, an early stage of infection at the time of pregnancy, and late or incomplete treatment.

Primary infection with parvovirus B19 occurs through exposure to respiratory droplets or infected blood products. Congenital infection is transplacental.

Primary infection with HBV is through contact with infected bodily fluids, with sexual contact being the most common cause of primary infection in the United States.

The mosquitoes spread the Zika virus in the Aedes genus, and an unknown primate reservoir is theorized to exist.

The majority of cases of chorioamnionitis occur secondary to ascending infection with maternal urogenital organisms in the setting of ruptured fetal membranes. As such, the most commonly implicated organisms in chorioamnionitis are the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, which typically colonize the urinary and genital tracts, including Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, GBS, Escherichia coli, and Gardnerella vaginalis.

A less common cause of chorioamnionitis is the hematogenous transplacental spread of infection from mother to fetus.Listeria monocytogenes, which causes chorioamnionitis in the setting of intact fetal membranes.

Bacterial vaginosis occurs secondary to an imbalance of the physiologic vaginal flora, in which Lactobacillus sp. usually are predominant.Gardnerella vaginalis, which then allows for the opportunistic growth of other aerobic and anaerobic species.

Finally, maternal colonization with GBS is an essential contributor to neonatal morbidity and mortality. Neonatal infection can occur through ascending vaginal infection or through contact during parturition.

# Histopathology

The pathology report in a placenta specimen examines the gross and microscopic findings, significatively helping providers involved in patient's care. The report has three main functions: provide information that fills the gap in the clinicopathological events that resulted in complications during pregnancy, provides information that may help for immediate therapy such as unrecognized antepartum infection, and gives information that may be precious for a future pregnancy. The placental pathology report includes a gross and microscopic description with a final diagnosis. The provider can review the pathological diagnosis with the pathologist if needed.

It is of paramount importance the recognition of the source of the inflammatory response: it can be either maternal or fetal. When the inflammatory response is fetal, there are associations with neurological impairment in the offspring. Fetal inflammation of the umbilical cord is a strong marker of fetal infection.

The location and characteristics of inflammation should be documented. The topography is essential to determine if the inflammatory response is maternal or fetal. Chorioamnionitis, deciduitis, and inflammation of the chorionic plate is a maternal inflammatory response. In contrast, choriositis and inflammation of the umbilical cord and the chorionic vessels (on the chorionic plate of the placenta) is of fetal origin. As previously said, there is evidence that fetal sequelae are associated with fetal inflammation.

The gross examination may reveal the opacification of the membranes (loss of the shiny surface of the amnion), and the color may change from transparent to off-white, yellowish, or greenish. The site of membrane rupture is the most important to check microscopically because it is where the inflammation process is usually more prominent, as well as around the site of insertion into the placental plate. White spots can suggest Candida spp. infection.

There are specific grading and staging systems for the maternal and fetal inflammatory response (Amsterdam

- Stage 1: the presence of neutrophils in the chorion or subchorionic space; 2: the presence of neutrophils in the chorionic connective tissue or amnion; 3: necrotizing chorioamnionitis and epithelial necrosis of the amnion

- Grade 1: small clusters of maternal neutrophils, found in chorion laeve, chorionic plate, subchorionic fibrin, amnion; 2: three or more confluent groups of 10-20 neutrophils (microabscesses)

**Subchorial Inflammation: It**is the earliest form of inflammation and is defined by the presence of neutrophils between the decidua and chorion levae; it does not necessarily imply the presence of chorioamnionitis. In the early phases, there is a patchy accumulation of leukocytes, accumulation of fibrin at the choriodecidual interface in the decidua. Extension of the infiltrate into the chorionic layer is called chorionitis and can be followed by the involvement of the amniotic layer (chorioamnionitis).

**Chorioamnionitis**refers to the presence of inflammation in the chorion and amnion, and it is the result of ascending microbial infection from the lower genital tract to the sterile amniotic cavity potentially endangering the fetus.

**Acute Villitis:**It is a specific gross and histologic feature of acute inflammation of the placental villi. It is diagnosed histologically with the presence of neutrophilic abscesses in the placental parenchyma, often associated with neutrophilic chorioamnionitis. Acute villitis is a typical feature of a bacterial infection, such as listeria or streptococcal infection.

**Funisitis**is the inflammatory response occurring in the umbilical cord. Acute funisitis, along with acute chorionic vasculitis, represent the fetal inflammatory response syndrome. Topographically it can present with neutrophils into the umbilical vein (or acute phlebitis), the umbilical arteries (or acute arteritis), or infiltration into the Wharton jelly. Acute funisitis usually begins with inflammation of the umbilical vein (phlebitis), followed by arteritis. The latter is evidence of an advanced inflammatory response.

Microbial colonization of the amniotic cavity can result in fetal invasion by the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, the skin, the ear through the auditory canal to the middle ear. The fetal examination can reveal severe dermatitis, pneumonitis, and encephalitis. The progression of the microbial agent to fetal circulation could lead to systemic disease. The rate of congenital neonatal sepsis is higher in preterm neonates than in term neonates, probably due to bacterial infection following a preterm rupture of membranes.

# History and Physical

In discussing the history and physical exam findings of antepartum infections, it is important to delineate between the findings in primary (in this case, maternal) infection and congenital infection. It is likewise important to note that the manifestations of congenital infection may not be present immediately following birth. Several findings are common to many congenital infections. These include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and a violaceous macular or papular rash, commonly called a "blueberry muffin rash" that results from extramedullary hematopoiesis.

Maternal primary toxoplasmosis is asymptomatic; approximately 70 to 90% of congenitally-infected infants are likewise asymptomatic at birth.

Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) can include deafness, cardiac defects, and a variety of ophthalmic and ocular findings, including microphthalmia, cataracts, and glaucoma.

Other manifestations include ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, hydrops, pericardial effusion, and placental enlargement.

Tertiary syphilis can manifest with cardiovascular complications such as aortitis and neurological abnormalities like tabes dorsalis or paresis.

Maternal infection with parvovirus can be asymptomatic or may present with a distinctive "slapped cheeks" rash preceded by a flu-like illness of fever, malaise, arthralgias, and myalgias.

Acute primary HCV infection presents similarly to HBV above. Most cases of congenital infection are asymptomatic, but, in contrast to congenital HBV infection, the majority of cases of congenital HCV result in chronic infection.

Vertical transmission has been documented but is rare.

# Evaluation

Current guidelines by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend universal screening for hepatitis B, syphilis, and chlamydia at the first prenatal visit, which should occur at 8-10 weeks of gestation.

Additional recommended screening for antepartum infections includes repeat testing for HIV and syphilis in the third trimester in populations at high-risk for the acquisition of these infections.

Hepatitis C screening should be done for patients with a history of intravenous drug use or blood transfusion or organ transplant before 1992.

Infants born to HIV positive mothers or mothers with unknown HIV status should be tested for the disease using nucleic acid tests (NATs).

Chorioamnionitis is a pathologic diagnosis made by examination of the fetal membranes for a neutrophilic infiltrate.

The United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine screening for bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women, not at risk of preterm labor.

# Treatment / Management

In toxoplasma seropositive pregnant women diagnosed before 18 weeks gestation, treatment should begin with spiramycin until ultrasonography and PCR can evaluate for the presence of congenital fetal infection.

There is no specific therapy for rubella in primary or congenital infection. The cornerstone of management is, therefore, prevention. All children and adolescents without contraindications to the MMR vaccine should receive it. MMR administration is contraindicated in pregnancy. Pregnant women found to be non-immune to rubella should be counseled on the importance of vaccination and vaccinated upon completion of the pregnancy.

The treatment of CMV infection in immunocompetent pregnant women is supportive. Ganciclovir and valganciclovir are used in the treatment of congenital CMV infection. They are associated with a reduction in hearing loss and improved weight gain and head circumference in congenital CMV.

Antiretroviral prophylaxis should be given to all infants born to HIV-positive mothers.

The only treatment of syphilis in pregnant women is intramuscular penicillin.

A primary HSV outbreak in pregnancy should be treated with acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir.

Treatment of acute and chronic HBV in pregnant women is primarily supportive. Infants born to HBV-positive mothers should receive a single-antigen HBV vaccine within 12 hours of birth combined with HBV immunoglobulin.

Treatment of primary parvovirus infection in pregnant women is supportive. Treatment of congenital infection is likewise primarily supportive, and in utero fetal transfusions have become a cornerstone of therapy in the management of the associated severe fetal anemia.

Treatment of both primary and congenital Zika virus infection is supportive, so prevention is vital. Several vaccines are in development.

Patients with preterm rupture of membranes should receive antibiotics targeting the most common organisms implicated in chorioamnionitis.

Recommended antibiotic regimens include ampicillin and gentamicin.

Diagnosed bacterial vaginosis should be treated in all pregnant women.

Pregnant patients colonized with GBS should receive intrapartum antibiotics, with penicillin G being the medication of choice in non-allergic patients.

# Differential Diagnosis

The high maternal temperature has a broad differential diagnosis that, in addition to antepartum infections, includes infections common to the general population. Following differential diagnoses should be considered in patients with prenatal infection:

- Pneumonia

- Cellulitis

- Urinary tract infections

- Pulmonary embolism

- Hyperthermic toxidromes

Genetic disorders should be considered in the differential of neonates born with suspected stigmata of congenital infections. Genetic counseling and testing should be advised to these families.

# Prognosis

With the notable exception of HEV, the antepartum infections discussed above have favorable maternal prognosis in immunocompetent individuals. Maternal sequelae from toxoplasmosis, rubella, CMV, parvovirus, and Zika virus infection are rare.

The risk of fulminant liver failure and mortality in pregnant patients with HEV ranges from 30-100%.

# Complications

The most severe fetal complication of congenital infection is fetal demise and spontaneous abortion, but the incidence of this is difficult to estimate. Congenital toxoplasmosis, rubella, CMV, and HSV can result in low birth weight, failure to thrive, and significant neurodevelopmental and motor delays in affected infants.

HEV infection is associated with a significant risk of fulminant hepatic failure and death in pregnant women compared to the general population.

Data regarding the relationship between chorioamnionitis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia or respiratory distress syndrome is mixed.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

There is a growing anti-vaccination movement that has resulted in the resurgence of diseases that were previously near-eradication. This movement is based on a paper published by Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues in 1998, which correlated MMR vaccination with the development of autism.

Consequently, many women of child-bearing age are currently unvaccinated and at increased risk for antepartum infections. Screening for vaccination concerns at appointments can help identify at-risk individuals.

HIV, HSV, and CMV can be vertically transmitted through breast milk.

Medical providers should help mothers weigh the risk of CMV transmission versus the benefits of breastfeeding in these cases. Freezing and pasteurization of breast milk can decrease the risk of transmission in these cases.

Pregnant women should also be instructed to avoid travel to locations where HEV and Zika virus are endemic and to avoid high-risk behaviors that increase the risk of contracting syphilis, HIV, HSV, HBV, and HCV.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Improved outcomes in antepartum infections may be achieved by targeting surmountable barriers to care. These include increased community education in prevention, provider education in risk minimization, and increased vaccination. Providers should seize all opportunities to provide patients with anticipatory care, including recommendations on safe sex practices and vaccination, which can help prevent antepartum infections. Congenital rubella, varicella, and hepatitis B can be prevented through maternal immunization.

Barriers to this include vaccine availability, provider failure to offer the vaccine, and vaccine skepticism. The use of standing orders for indicated vaccinations is associated with increased coverage and efficiency in vaccine administration in obstetrics and gynecology.

Unfortunately, data to support an effective communication strategy for changing patient skepticism towards vaccination and increase vaccination uptake is lacking.
