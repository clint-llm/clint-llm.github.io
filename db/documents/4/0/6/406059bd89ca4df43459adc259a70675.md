In the brainstem, the mandibular branch arises from 3 nuclei (mesencephalic, principal sensory, and spinal) which give rise to its large sensory root. The motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, located in the tegmentum of the upper area of the pons, gives rise to the motor root of the nerve

In the infratemporal fossa, near the skull base, the main trunk immediately gives off the sensory meningeal branch and motor muscular branches to the medial pterygoid, tensor tympani, and tensor veli palatini muscles. After that, the main trunk divides into two: smaller anterior and larger posterior. The smaller anterior trunk carries efferent fibers that supply the temporalis, masseter, and lateral pterygoid muscles, and afferent fibers that form the buccal nerve. The larger posterior trunk gives off the auriculotemporal nerve which wraps around the medial meningeal artery and supplies sensory innervation to the cutaneous tissue around the auricula and temporal regions. The larger posterior trunk then divides into two main splits, lingual and inferior alveolar. The lingual nerve supplies sensory innervation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue excluding taste. The inferior alveolar nerve supplies motor innervations to the mylohyoid and anterior belly of digastric muscles and sensory innervation to the teeth and mucoperiosteum of mandibular teeth, as well as sensory to the chin and lower lip.
