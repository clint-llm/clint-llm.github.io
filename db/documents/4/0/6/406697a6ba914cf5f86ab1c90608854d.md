Upon reactivation, the virus replicates in neuronal cell bodies, and virions shed from the cells which are carried down the nerve to the area of skin innervated by that ganglion. In the skin, the virus causes local inflammation and blistering. The pain caused by zoster is due to inflammation of affected nerves with the virus.

Triggers for herpes zoster include

- Emotional stress

- Use of medications (immunosuppressants)

- Acute or chronic illness

- Exposure to the virus

- Presence of a malignancy
