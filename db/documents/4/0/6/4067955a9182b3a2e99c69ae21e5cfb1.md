Histological mapping and local excision of the carcinoma is the standard form of treatment. Other treatment options prescribed by dermatologists for early lesions include the use of topical creams like imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil; these two drugs are topical immune response modifier, and topical antineoplastic agent respectively. X-ray or Grenz-ray radiation therapy also can be applied for patients with multiple lesions. Photodynamic therapy is another treatment option that has shown great success in the management of squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS) involves injecting a photosensitizing agent which is absorbed by the tumor. A light source is then used to stimulate the injected agent, and this triggers tumor destruction.
