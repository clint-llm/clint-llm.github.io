Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a class of medications most commonly prescribed to treat depression. They are often used as first-line pharmacotherapy for depression and numerous other psychiatric disorders due to their safety, efficacy, and tolerability. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with depression and other psychiatric disorders for which SSRIs are indicated.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for SSRIs.

- Describe the most common adverse effects of SSRIs.
- Review the mechanism of action of SSRIs.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients receiving SSRIs.
