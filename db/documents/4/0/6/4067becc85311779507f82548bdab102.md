Appropriate management of individuals suspected to have viral hemorrhagic fever includes early diagnosis to both increase chances of survival and prevent nosocomial infections. Patients with symptoms or travel history suggestive of these diseases should be isolated, and all staff caring for persons under investigation should wear appropriate personal protective equipment (referred to as viral hemorrhagic fever isolation precautions). Research regarding treatment is ongoing; however, the cornerstone of current treatment is supportive care. See specific management guidelines below for those diseases which have the highest overall mortality rates.

Lassa virus - Ribavirin has been shown to improve treatment outcomes when given early in the disease course; however, studies have been limited.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - Treatment largely remains supportive. Ribavarin has demonstrated an antiviral effect against this virus in vitro.

Ebola virus disease and Marburg hemorrhagic fever - Treatment involves supportive care. There are currently no vaccines available against the Marburg virus..

Dengue fever - There are currently no effective antiviral regimens available for treatment, thus management involves supportive care.
