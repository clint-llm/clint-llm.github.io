AGEP is considered a rare condition, with an estimated incidence ranging from one to five cases per million per year.

The age range of patients with AGEP is broad, as seen in a 2022 case series of 297 patients that included patients from 1 to 93 years old, with patients over 25 most heavily represented, specifically those between 40 and 64 years of age. Similar to other drug-induced SCARs, AGEP has a female predominance. Women account for approximately 65-80% of reported cases.

The onset and resolution of AGEP vary between causative medications with different pharmacokinetics; as such, the female predominance of AGEP may be partly due to differences in drug metabolism compared to men.

Other reported correlations with cases of AGEP include patients with HLA-B51, HLA-DR-11, and HLA-DQ3 genotypes associated with T-cell activation, as well as IL-36 receptor antagonist gene mutations resulting in increased IL-36 signaling.
