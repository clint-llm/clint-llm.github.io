Common adverse effects of patients taking meclizine include drowsiness, urinary retention, dry mouth, headache, fatigue, and vomiting.

Due to the potential to cause drowsiness, the prescriber should caution the patients against driving and using heavy machinery.

Patients should avoid alcoholic beverages, tranquilizers, and sedatives while taking meclizine due to an increased riskÂ of central nervous system depression.

The potential anticholinergic actions of meclizine pose a risk to patients with asthma, glaucoma, or an enlarged prostate gland. Caution is necessary with the use of the drug in such patients.
