There is no evidence that alveolar osteitis can result in additional complications. After resolution, the extraction socket heals as it does in patients who did not experience AO. There is no peer-reviewed literature correlating it with an increased risk of other complications associated with dental extractions.

Chlorhexidine usage, the prevention strategy with the most support, does have some rare but serious adverse effects. The primary concern with chlorhexidine is hypersensitivity reactions, and there have been multiple documented cases of minor adverse reactions after irrigation of an AO socket with chlorhexidine mouthwash.

There are two case reports from the United Kingdom of fatal adverse events related to chlorhexidine used in intra-alveolar irrigation secondary to hypersensitivity reactions. The dental practitioners who prescribe or administer this medication should be aware of potential hypersensitivity and educate their patients on minor and severe adverse side effects.

Another known complication of alveolar osteitis treatment is possible foreign body reactions. The delivery vehicles of the intra-socket medicaments delay healing and can cause this reaction.
