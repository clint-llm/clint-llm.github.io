Urease produced by bacteria splits urinary urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide (CO2). Further hydrolysis leads to the production of two ammonium and one bicarbonate ion (Figure1) for each urea molecule.

The highly alkaline urine also damages the glycosaminoglycans layer that normally protects the urothelial surface and cells from bacteria. This leads to the formation of bacterial biofilms in which precipitation of struvite and apatite crystals occur. As the bacteria secrete extracellular polysaccharides, the original nidus continues to grow, leading to the formation of a stone taking the shape of the renal pelvis, infundibula, and calyces, consisting of multiple layers of struvite stone material held together by biofilms.

The most accurate way to identify the specific pathogen contributing to struvite stone formation is a stone culture. If this is not available or possible, a urine culture should be done from a specimen obtained directly from the kidney at the time of surgery.

Even if the current and most recent urine cultures are negative, at least one positive culture for a urea splitting organism can usually be found by checking earlier urine cultures up to 1 year prior to struvite stone surgery.
