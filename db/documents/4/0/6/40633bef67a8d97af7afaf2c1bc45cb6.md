There are many different indications for hand splinting. Phalanx fractures have a variety of splinting options. Splints are needed to treat fractures of the distal phalanx as well as avulsion fractures at the distal phalanx. Dorsal distal phalanx and hairpin splints are designed to immobilize the distal phalanx in these situations. Dorsal and volar finger splints are used to immobilize the digit from the MCP joint to the DIP joint. Dynamic finger splinting is used to provide immobilization and support to the injured digit while allowing mobility at the MCP and PIP joint of the uninjured digit. The ulnar gutter splint is used for phalanx and metacarpal fractures that are on the medial (ulnar nerve distribution) of the hand. Radial gutter splints are used to treat phalanx and metacarpal fractures on the lateral aspect of the hand, often second and third digits. When there are multiple metacarpal or phalanx fractures, a dorsal splint with extension hood can be placed. Thumb spica splints should be used for first metacarpal and phalanx fractures as well as thumb strains and de Quervain syndrome.
