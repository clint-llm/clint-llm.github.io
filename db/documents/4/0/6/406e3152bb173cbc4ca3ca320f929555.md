One of the branches of the subclavian artery is the dorsal scapular artery. However, the latter can be a branch of the TCA. Also, the thyrocervical trunk has several possible variations. The most common variation is a short trunk from which the superficial portion of the TSA and the SSA arise. In this variation, the ITA branches from the thyrocervical trunk before the short trunk, but the deep branch of the TCA arises directly from the subclavian artery and not the thyrocervical trunk. The term for this variation is a type I configuration. The second and third most common variations are known as type II and III configurations, respectively. Other variants include branches of the thyrocervical trunk originating directly from the subclavian artery. Furthermore, the SSA can emerge from the subscapular artery instead of being a branch of the thyrocervical trunk.
