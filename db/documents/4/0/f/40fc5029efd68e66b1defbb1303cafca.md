Absolute contraindications: wounds with an active infection, active bleeding, or known cancer. Wounds with exposed bone, tendon, nerve, or blood vessel without appropriate vascular layer.

Relative contraindications: wounds over joints or key anatomic landmarks in which contraction would reduce mobility and/or aesthetics (i.e., wrist, elbow, eyelid), and previously irradiated wounds.

Clinicians should consider patient factors such as tobacco use, anti-coagulant use, bleeding disorder, chronic steroid use, or malnutrition on a case-by-case basis.
