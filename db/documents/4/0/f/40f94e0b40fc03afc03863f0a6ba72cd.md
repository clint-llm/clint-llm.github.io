In addition to a complete medical and surgical history, attention should be given to any history of pelvic neoplasia or other malignancy. The most common presenting symptom of vaginal cancer is abnormal vaginal bleeding.

Evaluation for suspected vaginal cancer requires a thorough physical exam, including a digital exam, a rectovaginal exam, a speculum exam, palpation of inguinal nodes, and colposcopy with biopsies. Visualizing the entire vagina by rotating the speculum to expose anterior and posterior surfaces is important. Applying Lugol solution (iodine) during colposcopy can help visualize vaginal neoplasia.

It is also important to determine whether or not the patient has been appropriately vaccinated, as a reduction of vaginal neoplasia after HPV DNA vaccination has been described.
