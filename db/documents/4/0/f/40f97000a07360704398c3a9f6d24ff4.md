Osteocytes are one of the four kinds of bone cells. Due to derivation from osteoblasts, these cells are highly specialized in nature and are responsible for the maintenance of the bony matrix. Specially built with innate proteins that help them to survive in hypoxic conditions, osteocytes maintain biomineralization. Not only do osteocytes contribute to bone mass via controlling osteoblast and osteoclast activity, but these cells act as main players in phosphate metabolism. Osteocytic necrosis is caused due to pathologic conditions such as osteoarthritis and osteoporosis, leading to developing skeletal fragility and dysfunctional signal repair and/or microdamage. Immobilization-induced hypoxia and glucocorticoid treatment may also lead to osteocytic necrosis or apoptosis. Osteocytes react to implant biomaterials in dynamic ways and are currently under active stem-cell research for trauma care and bone remodeling purposes.
