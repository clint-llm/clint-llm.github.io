In myopia, the image forms in front of the retinal photoreceptors.

Based on the pathogenesis, myopia can be classified as the following:

- Axial myopia- Axial myopia results from a rapid increase in the axial length. The axial length increases by 0.35 millimeters for every diopter increase in myopia.

- Curvature myopia- Curvatural myopia results from the increase in corneal curvature. As a result, the image is focused in front of the retina. Each millimeter change in the radius of curvature of the cornea causes a myopic shift by six diopters.

- Lenticular myopia- Lenticular myopia results from an increase in the refractive index of the crystalline lens.

- Positional myopia and other conditions- Myopia may result from anterior shifting of the crystalline lens.
