Hyperkalemia is by far the most common adverse effect of eplerenone. Clinical trial experience indicates an approximately 1.5 to 2.0 fold risk of hyperkalemia, with a number needed to harm ranging from 23 to 62. While serious hyperkalemia (greater than or equal to 6 mEq/L) was more common in both the EMPHASIS and EPHESUS trials, the adverse effect was usually manageable by reducing the dose or temporarily discontinuing the drug. In contrast, hypokalemia—which correlates with an increased risk of death from any cause among heart failure patients—was significantly reduced. Though serum creatinine may rise on eplerenone, the EMPHASIS-HF trial found no increased risk of renal failure.

Notably absent as a side effect is gynecomastia, which occurred in about 9% of the patients taking spironolactone in the RALES trial.
