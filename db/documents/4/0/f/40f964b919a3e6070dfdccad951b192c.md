Neutropenia is a serious life-threatening disorder with high morbidity and mortality. Thus the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes physicians, nurses, and pharmacists. A specialist in infectious diseases, internal medicine specialists, or pediatricians should recommend treatment options, including antibiotics and antifungal. A patient with severe neutropenia is considered to have a life-threatening disorder and should be monitored regularly for complete blood cell count, blood chemistry, infectious disease markers, and immunotherapy. Nurses looking after these patients should know what signs and symptoms to monitor for and when to call the specialist. They educate the patient about precautions and warning signs. Pharmacists review the prescription for dose, contraindications, and interactions. They, too, provide patient education.

Further, these patients should avoid exposure to people and wear a face mask in public. The pharmacist should assess the medications and immediately recommend discontinuation of those associated with neutropenia. Those who are undergoing chemotherapy should be educated about handwashing and symptoms to watch for.

The use of neutrophil colony-stimulating factors should be monitored by an immunologist or hematologist to treat the side effects of this cytokine efficiently.

Only through such a team approach can the morbidity of neutropenia be lowered. [Level 5]
