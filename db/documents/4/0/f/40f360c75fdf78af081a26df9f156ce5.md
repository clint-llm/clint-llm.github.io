**Arterial Blood Supply:**

The blood supply to theÂ nerves that innervate the eyes can subdivide into the intracranial and extracranial blood supply.

**Venous Blood Drainage:**

The venous blood drainage of the structures in the brain, such as the cranial nerves, drains into the dural sinuses. The dural sinuses form from the folding of the meninges. These dural sinuses are similar to veins, but they lack valves. The venous blood in the dural sinuses drains towards the internal jugular veins. Once the venous blood reaches the internal jugular veins, it will then converge with the subclavian vein to form the brachiocephalic vein. The brachiocephalic vein from both sides of the body will join into the superior vena cava. Finally, the venous blood in the superior vena cava will drain back to the heart.

**Lymphatics:**

The brain was once thought to lack a lymphatic system, but recent studies have shown that there is a lymphatic system in the brain. The lymphatic drain for the brain is embedded in the dura mater layer of the meninges. The lymph fluid from the dura mater drains into the cervical lymph nodes and then back to the central circulation via the right lymphatic duct (right side of the head) and the thoracic duct (left side of the head).
