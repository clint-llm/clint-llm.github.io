The glossopharyngeal nerve is the 9th cranial nerve (CN IX). It is one of the four cranial nerves that has sensory, motor, and parasympathetic functions. It originates from the medulla oblongata and terminates in the pharynx. This nerve is most clinically relevant in the setting of glossopharyngeal neuralgia, but an injury to it can also be a complication of carotid endarterectomy.
