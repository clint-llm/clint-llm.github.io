Complications can arise in this procedure as in any other procedure. Immediate complications may involve a hematoma formation due to poor hemostatic control. Human bites and some animal bites, particularly felines, have a very high chance of getting infecting early on. Antibiotics are imperative for such bite wounds, and these should be thoroughly cleansed. Late complications may involve scar formation due to improper technique. An unfortunate outcome in some people may be hypertrophic scars and keloid formation. Wound necrosis may also ensue in rare cases.
