OMT is beneficial for the treatment of dysfunction of the iliopsoas muscle, including manifestations of psoas syndrome. The exact prevalence of psoas syndrome is unknown, but it is more common in those with pre-existing low back or hip conditions. A study done by Adib et al. reported the incidence of iliopsoas tendonitis in total hip arthroscopy patients to be 24%.

OMT is a treatment option with fewer complications than other proposed non-surgical measures like corticosteroid injections or pharmaceutical intervention. The iliopsoas muscle connects the lumbar spine, pelvis, and leg; therefore, untreated and undertreated psoas dysfunction leads to compensatory changes alongÂ the kinetic chain and ultimately will result in pathology in other parts of the body, including the thorax, piriformis, sacrum, pelvis, and knee.
