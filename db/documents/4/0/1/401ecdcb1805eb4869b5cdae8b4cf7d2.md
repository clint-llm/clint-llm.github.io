The most common side effect of pudendal nerve block is discomfort at the injection site. The risk of bleeding and infection is less common. The more serious side effects occur rarely and include pudendal nerve damage or structural injury of the organs in the proximity of the pudendal nerve, such as the bladder and rectum. Pudendal artery puncture with the intravascular injection of local anesthetics can cause systemic local anesthetic toxicity, which is potentially fatal.
