There are many muscles within the infratemporal fossa and pterygopalatine fossa as well as many muscles which the multiple branches of the maxillary artery supply. For this review, the focus will be placed primarily on the lateral and medial pterygoid muscles because of their importance to the division of the maxillary artery.

Lateral pterygoid muscle:

The lateral pterygoid muscle contains two heads, an upper and lower head. The upper head, which is the smaller of the two parts originates from the roof of the infratemporal fossa, and the lower head originates from the lateral surface of the lateral plate of the pterygoid process. Both heads insert into the capsule of the temporomandibular joint. The fibers of the muscle run almost horizontally; thus, the action of the lateral pterygoid lies primarily with jaw protrusion as well as some side to side movement of the jaw.

Medial pterygoid muscle:

The medial pterygoid also has two heads but are named deep and superficial heads. The deep head has its origin from the medial surface of the lateral plate of the pterygoid process, and the superficial head originates from the tuberosity of the maxilla. The two heads insert into the medial surface near the angle of the mandible. The function of the muscle lies mainly with the elevation of the jaw and some side to side movement.
