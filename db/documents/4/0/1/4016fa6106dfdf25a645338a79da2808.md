Most all CRC will present by diagnostic colonoscopy for suspicious signs and symptoms (80%), asymptomatic, routine screening (11%), or incidental finding at an acute abdomen emergent admission (7%). Patients diagnosed with routine cancer screening are frequently earlier stage compared to advanced disease of incidental surgical findings. Diagnostic colonoscopy’s triggers are blood per rectum (37%), abdominal pain (34%) and anemia (23%). Most common indications of emergency surgery are an obstruction (57%), peritonitis (25%) and perforation (18%). Tumor location on clinical presentation can be separated on left-sided with more changes in bowel habits and hematochezia, and right-sided with obscured anemia impacting on late stage at diagnosis. Late presentation with metastatic disease at diagnosis will depend on the symptoms at the organ-affected by the route of spread; to the liver via the portal system, to lungs via the inferior vena cava, to supraclavicular adenopathy via lymphatic or to neighbor structures by contiguous invasion. The provider should perform a thorough physical examination for signs of ascites, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy.  A comprehensive family history is of great relevance to identify familial clusters and inherent patterns that would alter surveillance and therapy on the high-risk patient.
