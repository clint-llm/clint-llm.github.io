Most burns are small and are treated at home or by local providers as outpatients. This chapter will focus on the initial resuscitation and management of severe burns. (Also see Burns, Evaluation and Management and Burns, Thermal).

- >10% TBSA in children (<10 years old) or elderly (>50 years old)

- >20% TBSA in adults

- >  5% full thickness

- high-voltage electrical burns

- significant burns to the face, eyes, ears, joints, or genitalia

Other factors that should be considered and will increase the patient’s morbidity and mortality include associated inhalation injury, associated traumatic injury, and the patient’s baseline medical conditions like heart disease or lung disease. Several factors may predispose the specific group of patients to more complicated injuries.

Severe burns cause not only significant injury at the local burn site but also a systemic response throughout the body. Inflammatory and vasoactive mediators such as histamines, prostaglandins, and cytokines are released causing a systemic capillary leak, intravascular fluid loss, and large fluid shifts. These responses occur mostly over the first 24 hours peaking at around six to eight hours after injury. This response, along with decreased cardiac output and increased vascular resistance, can lead to marked hypovolemia and hypoperfusion called “burn shock.”  This can be managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation and close monitoring for adequate, but not excessive, IV fluids.
