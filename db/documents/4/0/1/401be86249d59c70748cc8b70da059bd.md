Psittacosis is caused by inhalation of aerosolized C. psittaciÂ from urine, feces, or other excretions from infected birds. It leads to CAP, which can be severe in some cases. Empiric treatment for CAP does not include first-line therapies for psittacosis, leading to poor outcomes in some cases. This highlights the need for increased vigilance by providers and other healthcare personnel operating as an interprofessional team in diagnosing psittacosis, especially in cases where empiric treatment for seemingly run-of-the-mill CAP is not effective. Occupational nurses and clinicians need to maintain a high degree of suspicion for psittacosis in persons who work in at-risk environments to help diagnose this condition early.

Clinical pharmacists can help recommend pharmacotherapy, especially in cases where first-line therapy may be contraindicated. A well-integrated interprofessional team of clinical providers can help bridge the gap between the perceived incidence of this disease and its true incidence. It can also help in the early diagnosis of psittacosis, greatly reducing the morbidity associated with this condition. [Level 5]
