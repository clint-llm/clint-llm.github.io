Despite the numerous guidelines on the management of ischemic heart disease, the key is prevention. Healthcare workers including nurse practitioners should educate patients on the benefits of changing their lifestyle and starting and exercise program. Patients should be told to eat healthy and discontinue smoking. Patients should be referred to a dietitian to learn about healthy foods and how to maintain a healthy body weight. There is no substitute for exercise- even walking will suffice as long as it is done on a regular basis.
