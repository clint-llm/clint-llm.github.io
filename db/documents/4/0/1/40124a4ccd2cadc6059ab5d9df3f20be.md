In modern medicine, FUO remains one of the most challenging diagnoses as it can be caused by over 200 neoplastic, infectious, inflammatory, and miscellaneous disorders. Diagnosing FUO requires a thorough history, repeated physical examinations, and selective diagnostic testing. Providers should avoid taking a “shot-gun” approach early in the FUO workup as it can be misleading. Directed diagnostic testing based on a patient's history and physical is more likely to yield a diagnosis and is more cost-effective.

An interdisciplinary approach is important while pursuing work-up for FUO. It is important to communicate the importance of monitoring fevers without treatment when appropriate with nursing staff to evaluate fever curves and guide additional testing. Primary care providers and hospitalists should work together with specialists (based on etiology, but could include infectious diseases, rheumatology, or hematology/oncology) to ensure early diagnosis and treatment. Discussing the case with the pharmacy can also be beneficial in determining whether any medications the patient is taking can be causing drug-induced fevers.
