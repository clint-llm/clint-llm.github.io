The immune-mediated response in Crohn disease involves both innate and acquired mechanisms by macrophages, neutrophils, and T-cells in the intestine which promote pro-inflammatory mediators like tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Colonic Crohn lesions were found to have high levels of cytokines like interferon-gamma, IL-2, IL-12, and IL-18. Crohn disease is primarily regulated by helper T 1 and 17 mediated processes.
