Aflibercept is intended for intravitreal administration to exert local effects in the eye. IVI allows the medication to penetrate all retinal layers, minimizing systemic effects. No cytotoxic effects have been observed in studies that exposed cultured corneal endothelial cells to varying concentrations of aflibercept.

However, there has been an interest in the potential for drug overdose with intravitreal aflibercept therapy due to a slight misalignment of the plunger in prefilled syringes. These small mismeasurements can lead to delivering double the intended volume of medication. In part, aflibercept overdose accounts for a number of intraocular pressure elevations since its launch. Unfortunately, there is no known antidote for aflibercept overdose. Proper adherence to instructions for use can minimize dosing errors and prevent toxicity of intravitreal aflibercept.
