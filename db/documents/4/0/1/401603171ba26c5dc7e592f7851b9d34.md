Congenital iris ectropion requires parent educationÂ regarding the need for long-term follow-up as glaucoma may manifest at any age. Management of refractive error, squint, and amblyopia is of paramount importance to improve visual acuity and binocular vision. Acquired ectropion of the iris may be associated with neovascular glaucoma. Urgent management with pan-retinal photocoagulation anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents is needed to prevent a painful blind eye. Multiple visits may be necessary.
