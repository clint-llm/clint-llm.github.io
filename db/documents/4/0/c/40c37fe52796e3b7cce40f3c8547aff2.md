Seromas that are minimal in volume and do not cause any pain, functional deficit, or strain on the wound closure can be managed conservatively with observation. In most cases, these will reabsorb without the need for further intervention.

Large volume seromas greater than 75Â to 100 ml are often associated with pain, infection, and reduced function of the associated area, such as shoulder movement in axillary seromas.

Open surgical drainage and debridement are rarely required and reserved for chronic cases with encapsulated pseudocyst formation or in cases where there is superimposed infection.
