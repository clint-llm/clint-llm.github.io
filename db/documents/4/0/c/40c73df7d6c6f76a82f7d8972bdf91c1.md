Skin changes during pregnancy may be physiological. However, some dermatoses are specific to pregnancy, while others are altered by pregnancy. These changes occur as a result of an interaction of multiple factors in the body during pregnancy. The dermatoses which are specific to pregnancy include:

- Gestational pemphigoid (also known as pemphigoid gestationis)

- Pruritic and urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP, also known as pruritic eruption of pregnancy and toxemic rash of pregnancy)

- Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy

- Impetigo herpetiformis

- Atopic eruption of pregnancy: encompasses atopic eczema in pregnancy, prurigo of pregnancy, as well as pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy in earlier classifications.
