Any delay in the diagnosis of cecal or sigmoid volvulus can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Mortality rates appear to be much higher for cecal volvulus compared to sigmoid volvulus. When volvulus is treated non-surgically rates of recurrence are very high approaching 40-60%. When surgery is done in unstable patients, mortality rates of 12-25% have been reported.
