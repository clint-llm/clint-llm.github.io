**Agranulocytosis**

The risk of developing agranulocytosis is around 1% in patients who take clozapine, which may be independent of dosing.

**Myocarditis**

Clozapine-induced myocarditis is a rare complication, affecting less than 3% of patients. This lethal dose-independent side effect appears more frequently during the first four weeks of treatment. In these patients, signs and symptoms of myocarditis may vary from having a flu-like illness to respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms.

**Metabolic Syndrome**

Clozapine is associated with significant weight gain, diabetes type 2, diabetic ketoacidosis, and increased lipid levels-all due to increased insulin resistance.

**Seizures**

Clozapine may lower the seizure threshold in both patients with epilepsy and normal patients. The risk is usually dose-dependent, around 1% to  6%, especially with rapid titration, and might be more prevalent in younger patients. This side effect may appear at any stage of treatment. Patients who experience a seizure while on clozapine may benefit from the addition of an anti-epileptic like valproic acid.

**Excessive Salivation**

Sialorrhea is a dose-dependent and benign condition that may be bothersome to some patients.

**Pulmonary Embolism**

A recent study comparing clozapine to several other antipsychotics showed it to be the only drug to increase platelet adhesion and aggregation.

**Constipation**

Cholinergic and serotonergic properties of clozapine may affect the gastrointestinal system and lead to constipation or even ileus. Constipation affects anywhere from 15% to 60% of all patients taking clozapine and is dose-dependent, making it one of the most common side effects. In severe cases, constipation can progress to ileus, leading to bowel obstruction and bowel ischemia.

**Other**

Other side effects may include orthostatic hypotension, sedation, tachycardia, sexual dysfunction, and urinary retention.
