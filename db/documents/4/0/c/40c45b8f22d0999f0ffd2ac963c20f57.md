Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Trastuzumab binds to an extracellular domain of this receptor and inhibits HER2 homodimerization, therebyÂ preventing HER2-mediated signaling. It is also thought to facilitate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, leading to the death of cells that express HER2.

In the U.S., a biosimilar molecule is commercially available (trastuzumab-dkst). The product ado-trastuzumab emtansine is an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of trastuzumab and emtansine, an anti-microtubule cytotoxic agent.
