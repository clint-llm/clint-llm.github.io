Transurethral resection of the prostate or TURP is a procedure where the prostate is resected from an endoscopic approach. It was the first major, minimally invasive surgery of the modern era. This procedure has been in use for many years and is still considered the surgical gold standard for bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), with only some minor changes since its modern introduction in 1943. A TURP can also be used to unroof prostatic abscesses, as well as open the ejaculatory ducts in some cases of obstructive azoospermia.
