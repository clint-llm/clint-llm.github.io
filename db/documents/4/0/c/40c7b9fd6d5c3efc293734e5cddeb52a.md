Prevention of NTM is a rather challenging task due to its ubiquitous presence in the environment. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss with the patient about disease prevention remains problematic. Also, it is unclear how to assess whether the patient is susceptible to NTM and if it would be efficacious to educate patients in the avoidance of specific environmental sources. As an example, it is a known fact that hot showers can be a vector of transmission for the disease, but it is unclear if educating the patient on avoiding hot showers will decrease the chances of infection. There is not enough data that support a solid prevention strategy for the transmission of NTM.

In terms of treatment, the patient should be advised regarding the time frame of the treatment, as this could be very lengthy. Patients must be educated with an organized care plan to achieve better outcomes. The plan must include medication regimens, side effects, preset appointments, and a timeframe of treatment completeness. Patients must be aware of potential complications. They also should be aware that only by taking the medication as prescribed can they achieve disease-free status, as this is only possible if they have negative sputum cultures for NTM after 12 months. It is necessary to build patient rapport and healthy relationships with the patients to obtain the best results.
