As mentioned above, an interprofessional team is needed in the partaking of a pancreatectomy. This team must always consist of the surgeon, an anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist, surgical assistants or surgical scrub technicians, OR nurses, and other personnel, including the ICU nurses and doctors that will manage the patient postoperatively. While the surgeon will be the one to perform the actual pancreatectomy, the anesthesia specialist is responsible for keeping the patient asleep and minimizing the pain and discomfort that may be caused by the procedure. OR nurses and surgical scrub techs are strictly in charge of assisting the surgeon with whatever he or she needs, such as handing them instruments or repositioning the patient to better their view and access to the pancreas. ICU nurses will manage the patient vital signs by administering blood, fluids, and potentially vasopressors as in OR, but also manage the patientâ€™s pain as they will be awake and especially in the case of total pancreatectomy close blood glucose monitoring is critical.
