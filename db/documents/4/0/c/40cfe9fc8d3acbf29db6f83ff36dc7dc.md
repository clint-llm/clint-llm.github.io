Myasthenia gravis (MG), a neuromuscular junction disorder, causes weakness in the voluntary muscles of the body involving eyes, mouth, throat, arms, and legs. It usually affects adults, but it can sometimes happen in children. Neonatal myasthenia gravis is a distinct type of MG. Although there are similarities in the pathophysiology and clinical feature with the adult counterpart of the disease, there are many distinct features of neonatal MG.

These considerations underscore the need to discuss the disease separately from its adult counterpart. Neonatal MG  is a temporary form of MG. Babies born to mothers with MG are susceptible to it. It’s due to the mother’s antibodies crossing over to the baby. As the name suggests, it usually lasts only a short time. The symptoms go away weeks or months after birth, as the antibodies are naturally replaced. Babies are not at greater risk of developing myasthenia gravis later in life. This is distinct from congenital MG, a very rare form of MG, which is an autosomal recessive disease and originating from rare genetic disorders. Symptoms of congenital MG usually start at birth and are lifelong. Neonatal MG is also distinct from juvenile MG, which is the most common form of MG in childhood and clinically identical to adult autoimmune MG patients. However, juvenile MG patients do not present in the neonatal age group, and the earliest presentation has been reported in late infancy.
