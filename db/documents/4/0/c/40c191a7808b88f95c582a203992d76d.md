The pleura is an impermeable membrane that surrounds the lungs and is a barrier between the lungs and the chest wall. It divides the pleura into two parts. The innermost layer, the layer directly in contact with the lung parenchyma, is called the visceral pleura. The layer between the visceral pleura and the chest wall is the parietal pleura. A pneumothorax develops when air enters the potential space between the two layers of pleura.
