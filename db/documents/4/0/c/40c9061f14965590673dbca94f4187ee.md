If the disorder is promptly diagnosed and treated, the prognosis for most patients is good. However, even though the physical deficits can be overcome, most patients have lifelong emotional issues that stem from ambiguous genitalia. Other problems that can occur in these patients include:

- Infertility

- Short stature

- Female gender identity issues

- Virilization issues in women

- Premature death when patients are not administered stress doses of corticosteroids/glucocorticoids during major surgery, trauma, or illness
