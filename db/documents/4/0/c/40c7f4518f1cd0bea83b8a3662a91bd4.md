Patients with hypercalcemia are often encountered by the nurse practitioner, primary care provider, endocrinologist, and internist. Sometimes these patients present with a family history and hence FHH should be suspected. In general, FHH is a benign disorder, is not progressive, and rarely associated with complications. The calcium/PTH levels are usually stable over the years. The key is to educate the patient that surgery is not necessary or required. This communication avoids unnecessary and expensive monitoring and unneces­sary parathyroid exploration in the patient and relatives. Rarely, in a patient with atypical features, such as pancreatitis, total parathyroidec­tomy may be indicated to reduce the risk of further attacks of pancreatitis. The CaSR rep­resents a potentially important therapeutic target for disorders in which the receptor is hypoactive, such as FHH. Calcimimetics and calcilytics (CaSR antagonists) can play a pharmacological role in improving defective calcium sensing in inherited or acquired disorders of the CaSR

The outcomes in most patients with FHH are good to excellent.
