Management of cheiralgia paresthetica is mainly nonoperative therapy. Attention should first focus on removing sources of external compression that could be leading to the neuropathy. The patient should be encouraged to rest, avoid any provocative maneuvers, and alter any work activities that may exacerbate the symptoms. Also, NSAIDs and nerve medications can be used to augment therapy.

Surgery is only for failure of nonoperative treatment. Treatment should be attempted for 6 months before one proceeds with surgical intervention. Clinicians require caution when treating patients with painless paresthesias as surgical complications may create painful neurologic symptoms.

Surgical decompression: To approach the superficial branch of the radial nerve, palpate the radial styloid process and follow the border of the brachioradialis proximal 10 cm. Draw a line connecting the two. Identify the area with the most pronounced Tinel response, tenderness, and allodynia. Then center your incision over this. Carefully elevate skin flaps to identify the brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus tendons. The superficial branch of the radial nerve generally appears between the two tendons with brachioradialis located above and extensor carpi radialis longus located below.

Postoperative care should consist of early range of motion at directed by physical therapy with all restrictions lifted by 2 weeks after surgery. Occupational therapy should reinforce this early range of motion protocol and incorporate nerve gliding techniques to minimize adhesion formation, desensitization, and scar massage. Patients generally receive 4 to 6 weeks of therapy and achieve maximum medical improvement at 60 to 90 days after surgery.
