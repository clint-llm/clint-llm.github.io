Patients with suspected or diagnosed peroneal tendon injuries may experience chronic lateral foot/ankle pain and instability with a lack of treatment or after the failure of conservative therapies. Delays in diagnosis are not uncommon, with one study reporting the duration of symptoms persisting from 7 to 48 months before the correct diagnosis was made.

An untreated os peroneus fracture can result in degeneration and tearing of the peroneus longus tendon related to chronic frictional forces.

Intraoperative findings during repair of a primary peroneus longus tendon injury and associated os peroneum abnormality often include the discovery of additional tendinous and/or osseous pathologies, such as peroneus brevis tear, hypertrophied peroneal tubercle of the calcaneus, and subluxation or dislocating peroneal tendons.

Insufficient data exist regarding the efficacy of surgical treatments. However, reported postoperative complications of repair of peroneal tendon rupture include superficial wound infection, wound dehiscence, repair failure, sural neuritis, adhesive tendinitis, and chronic regional pain syndrome.
