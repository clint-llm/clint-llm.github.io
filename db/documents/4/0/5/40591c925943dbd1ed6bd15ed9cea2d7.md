Much of the structures in the ear develop very early in gestation. The internal auditory canal develops in the petrous portion of the temporal bone in the posterior fossa. The internal auditory canal continues to lengthen as the cranium increases up until about age ten, whereas the diameter of the medial opening to the canal increases only slightly in the first year of life.
