The muscle and tendons of the long flexors of the hand may become inflamed, hypertrophied, or affected by fibrosis.

A condition called "Golfer's elbow" (medial epicondylitis) is a condition where the origins of the hand and wrist flexors are affected by inflammation. The origin of these flexors muscles is irritated by repetitive flexion of the hand and wrist. There will be localized pain upon palpation of the medial epicondyle. This condition commonly gets treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and rest.

The tendons of the long flexor muscles of the hand can become thicken or affected by fibrosis. These alterations in the tendons tend to remain localized in the palmar region of the hand. A condition called "Dupuytren contracture" is caused by progressive fibrosis of the flexor tendons in the hand. The tendons are affected by fibrosis resulting in flexion of the digits. The pathological flexion of the fingers will be irreversible. This condition typically affects the third and fourth digits.

The tendon sheath can also be affected by fibrosis or inflammation. When fibrosis and inflammation of the tendons occur to the flexors in the hand. Individuals will present with "trigger finger." Trigger finger is a result of fibrosis or inflammation limiting the movement of the fingers. The fingers will classically present in rigid flexion at rest. The fingers stay in flexion when the person tries to extend the fingers.
