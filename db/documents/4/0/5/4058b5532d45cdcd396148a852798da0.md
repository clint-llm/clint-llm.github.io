The cornea consists of several layers. From superficial to deep, the layers are squamous epithelium, anterior basement layer (Bowman’s), a stroma comprised of keratocytes and collagen, a posterior basement membrane (Descemet’s), and an endothelial layer. The major function of the cornea is to provide a medium in which light may be refracted and focused on the retina for visual acuity.

Defining corneal dystrophies depends on which layers of the cornea are affected. Alterations in proteins cause deposits within the cells of the cornea, leading to abnormal vision examination findings.

The squamous epithelium is highly innervated by unmyelinated nerves, which function to increase tear production and to signal the blink reflex.

The primary function of Descemet’s membrane and the endothelial cells is to pump ions against a gradient to maintain corneal dehydration or deturgescence.

Amyloidosis is a disease of abnormal protein deposition in tissues.
