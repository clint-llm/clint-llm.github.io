Clinical presentation depends on the severity of infection, patient comorbidities, and site of the aneurysm.

The most common manifestations are fever, pulsatile mass, local pain, and inflammation in the arterial site (back pain in the aorta, headaches in intracranial vessels).

Local expansion of the infection may result in psoas abscess formation (flank pain, limping and fever), vertebral osteomyelitis, dysphagia, and hoarseness due to the impingement of laryngeal nerve, and hemoptysis.

Formation of the fistula may result in high output heart failure or expanding hematoma formation.

Physical exam shows signs of local inflammation resulting in tender indurated mass and bruit on examination (50% of cases).
