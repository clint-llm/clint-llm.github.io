With advances in cardiovascular healthcare and new strategies and therapies in the management of coronary heart disease and heart failure, the overall life expectancy of patients has increased andÂ has led to an ever-growing population of patients with LV systolic dysfunction and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. This has opened up avenues for device therapy not only to save but also to improve life.

The National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) also has setup device registry which helps physicians and hospitals to pool their data, share their experiences and help each other out which, not only, is translating into better outcomes for these patients but also reassuring patients that there is hope, and there are health professionals for them, working for them.

There remains a taboo, a psychological component with these devices, the fear of not returning to their previous lives, and the fear of getting shocked during treatment. However, this could be readily overcome by adequate support and proper patient counseling by the physicians, electrophysiologists, cardiac rehab staff, and the heart failure staff that are involved in the management of such patients.

Effective communication and timely referral are essential amongst physicians, cardiologists, electrophysiologists as well as rehab and cardiac staff and patient caretakers as these patients require a lot of medical and psychosocial support to return to and maintain an adequate quality of life.

All in all, these devices have become a valuable tool for the heart failure team.
