Identification and treatment of fibroepithelial tumors of Pinkus are best done by an interprofessional team consisting of primary care, dermatology, pathologist, and specialty trained nurses. Dermatology nurses provide patient education, arrange follow up, and supply updates to the team. Evidence related to diagnosis and management of fibroepithelial tumors of Pinkus is limited to class 3, 4, and 5Â evidence, due to the rarity of the condition.
