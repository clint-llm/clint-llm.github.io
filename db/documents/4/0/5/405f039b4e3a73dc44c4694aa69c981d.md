The overall incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is decreasing, and the incidence of adenocarcinomas is rising rapidly, likely as an effect of lifestyle changes. Curative surgery or endoscopic resection could be offered to selected patients. Tri-modality therapy (chemoradiation followed by surgery) is the standard treatment for locally advanced resectable esophageal cancer. Adjuvant therapy after neoadjuvant therapy is not standard of care but is routinely offered to high-risk patients. In non-surgical candidates, definitive chemoradiation therapy can be a valid treatment option, in particular for patients with squamous cell cancers of the esophagus. All patients with metastatic esophageal cancer who are candidates for palliative chemotherapy should have their tumor assayed for HER2 overexpression. If positive, trastuzumab should be added to a cytotoxic doublet fluoropyrimidine plus platinum backbone. Novel therapies on selected populations are available for refractory-chemotherapy esophageal cancer, and early clinical trials should be offered to those patients.
