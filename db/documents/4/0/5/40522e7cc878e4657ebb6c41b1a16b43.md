Lenvatinib is FDA approved for the treatment of radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), unresectable or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). It is a multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that demonstrates potent antiangiogenic properties. The inhibition of the VEGF receptors prevents tumor angiogenesis, and the inhibition of FGFR, RET, PDGFRa, and KIT prevents the further proliferation of malignant cells. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors pertinent to members of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), unresectable or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of lenvatinib.
- Describe the adverse effects of lenvatinib.
- Review the appropriate monitoring of lenvatinib.
- Outline how interprofessional coordination and communication can improve therapy with lenvatinib for patients where it is indicated.
