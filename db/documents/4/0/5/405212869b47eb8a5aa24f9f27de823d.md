There is a growing clinical consensus to lower the diagnosis threshold of sinus bradycardia to less than 50 bpm as there is a significant population size with a resting heart rate between 50 to 60 bpm. At present, the diagnostic consensus remains at a rate lower than 60 bpm with only the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/American College of Physicians–American Society of Internal Medicine (ACC/AHA/ACP–ASIM) Task Force recommending that it be diagnosed at 50 bpm.
