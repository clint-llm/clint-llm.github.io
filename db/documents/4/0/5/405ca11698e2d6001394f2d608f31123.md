Sertoli cells are the biggest, non-uniformly shaped cells of the germinal epithelium in the seminiferous tubules. They are most reliably identified by always being the largest columnar cell that is still attached to the basal lamina of the basement membrane, and span to the apical lumen of the cross-sectioned seminiferous tubule. They are often irregular, or pyramidal-shaped, but will always be towards the basolateral side, as opposed to the secondary spermatogonia and spermatids towards the lumen. The Sertoli cells can be differentiated from the nearby primary spermatogonia. Primary spermatogonia often have darker distinct nuclei in a small circular uniform cell, as opposed to Sertoli cells having more paler nuclei in a larger, irregularly shaped cell.

It is important to note that the Sertoli cell structure forms tight junctions and connective adhesion molecules with neighboring Sertoli cells so that there can be local sequestering of testosterone. This junction is the basis of the blood-testes-barrier, which provides many necessary conditions for appropriate spermatogenesis, including ion regulation, testosterone concentration, immune system evasion, and barrier protection. The Sertoli cells form the inner perimeter of the cross-sectioned seminiferous tubule, with the germ cell epithelium being the only other most exterior cellular structures, resulting in mature spermatogonia and spermatids being interior to the Sertoli cell blood-testes-barrier.
