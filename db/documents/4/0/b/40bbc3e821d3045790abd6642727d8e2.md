The prognosis of primary bone cancer is dependent on multiple factors, and there has been no significant improvement in 5-year survival over the past 25 years. In the United States, the National Cancer Institute shows overall 5-year survival is 66%, with studies suggesting rates are lower in the UK.

When the disease is localized, osteosarcoma has a 10-year survival of 60% to 78%. This number falls to 20% to 30% in patients with metastatic disease at presentation, with other negative prognostic factors including axial or proximal extremity tumor location, increased tumor size, raised ALP or LDH, increased age, pathological fracture, and poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

The most potent prognostic factor in chondrosarcoma is histological grade. Other identified factors are metastatic disease at presentation, increased age, and pelvic tumor location. 5-year survival in grade I chondrosarcoma is 83%, with only 53% of patients surviving to 5 years with grade I and II disease.

Ewing sarcoma has a 5-year survival of 70% to 80% when the disease is localized. This number falls to 50% in patients with isolated pulmonary metastases and less than 30% in patients with any other metastatic disease at diagnosis. Other negative prognostic factors include pelvic tumor location, increased tumor size, and poor response to neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy treatment.
