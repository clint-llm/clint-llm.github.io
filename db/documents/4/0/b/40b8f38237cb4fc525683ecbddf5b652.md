Breach rhythm is due to bone abnormality and not due to brain pathology. Breach rhythm can be mistaken for epileptiform activity. An important distinction between the breach rhythm and epileptiform abnormality is the absence of after coming slow-wave and lack of spread to other areas of the brain. Breach rhythm occurs over the area of the skull defect and abruptly disappears at the margin of the skull defect. EEG technicians should always ask the patient about any history of brain surgery or head injury before performing the EEG.
