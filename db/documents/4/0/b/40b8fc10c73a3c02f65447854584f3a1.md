The first-line therapy for MTLE includes the initiation of appropriately chosen antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. For patients with MTLE, the most effective AEDs are those used to treat focal epilepsies such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and topiramate.

Surgical approaches for MTLE include open resection and other minimally invasive techniques. Standard open resective surgery is considered to be the most effective and safe treatment option for TLE with superiority to prolonged medical therapy in terms of long-term outcomes.

Advances in our understanding of epileptic networks have improved our ability to define the epileptogenic zone in patients with epilepsy better. The aim of disrupting epileptic networks with the smallest possible surgical lesion has led to the development of minimally invasive surgical techniques for epilepsy.

Neurostimulation for the treatment of epilepsy includes vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) responsive neurostimulation (RNS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS).

Apart from seizure management, patients with MTLE may have cognitive problems, psychiatric comorbidities, and psychosocial issues. A comprehensive approach to manage an individual with MTLE must take into account the cognitive and psychiatric comorbidities that often accompany this condition.
