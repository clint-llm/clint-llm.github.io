Because these types of injuries have an array of mechanisms, it is difficult to provide patient education to prevent. Perhaps, the focus in avoiding these types of injuries should be on overall injury prevention in the most common TDI presentations. For penetrating wounds, this would include education and prevention on knife and gun violence. For blunt TDIs, this would including decreasing the risk of internal injury in the use of motor vehicles by utilizing restraints properly, following traffic regulations, and participating in defensive driving courses.

There is certainly literature supporting the approach of non-operative management in a hemodynamically stable patient with thoracoabdominal trauma. When this is the case, patients should be educated on the risks of missed or undiagnosed injury as well as signs or symptoms that would suggest a need for immediate evaluation. In these patients, where TDI was not definitively ruled out, close follow-up is important. Repeat imaging is suggested at a 6 to 12-month interval to rule out or identify a missed TDI.
