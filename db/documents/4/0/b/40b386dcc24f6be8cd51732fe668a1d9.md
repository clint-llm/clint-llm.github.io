Osteoprogenitor cells are often referred to as preosteoblasts. They can be present within the endosteum, the cellular layer of the periosteum, and the lining of the osteogenic cells. In matured bones that no longer display active bone remodeling or formation, osteoprogenitor cells exist as flattened spindle-shaped structures. They attach to the bone surface and are referred to as inactive osteoblasts during this period. In maturing bones, however, these cells appear in their largest form. During fetal development or high turnover periods in adult osteogenesis, numerous osteoprogenitor cells function to give rise to osteoblasts. These structures display plump oval nuclei and emboldened abundant spindle-shaped cytoplasm at this stage, later converting to characteristic cuboidal active osteoblasts.
