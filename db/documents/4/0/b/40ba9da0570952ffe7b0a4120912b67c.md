The medulla oblongata, the brainstem region location of the nucleus ambiguus, receives its blood supply from the vertebrobasilar system. The dorsolateral region of the medulla receives its blood supply from the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), a branch of the vertebral artery. The medial medulla gets supplied by the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA), which branches from the basilar artery.
