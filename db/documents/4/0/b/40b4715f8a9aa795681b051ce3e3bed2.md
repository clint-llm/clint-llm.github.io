Local anesthetics are widely used in most healthcare facilities. These agents can be injected at the bedside for a minor procedure, in the operating room, or in the emergency department. In almost all cases where local anesthetics are used, nurses are often present for monitoring of the patient. The nurse should not only monitor the vital signs but also maintain verbal contact with the patient when the local anesthetic is injected. Once an adverse reaction occurs, the key is supportive care with close monitoring. In addition, the patient should be advised to wear a medical alert bracelet if the reaction was due to an allergy. However, if the patient developed a seizure, then the risk of a repeat event is unlikely.

**Outcomes**

Patients who develop an adverse reaction or a seizure can be managed with supportive care that includes oxygenation and hydration. Most patients recover without any sequelae. Without treatment, the patient is at risk for hypotension, cardiac arrest, and seizures. Data from the poison control centers reveals that in 2016, there were only four deaths from local anesthetics.
