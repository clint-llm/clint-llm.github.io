Renal transplantation destroys fibers of the renal plexus, thus eliminating the sympathetic activity of the kidney. Without sympathetic activity, the Beta-1 adrenergic receptors of juxtaglomerular cells are unable to activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system. The organ maintains the ability to regulate systemic blood pressure through autoregulatory mechanisms such as the myogenic response and feedback of sodium concentration by the macula densa.
