Other nerves that originate from the same plexus are; superior gluteal nerve, inferior gluteal nerve, common fibular, tibial, posterior femoral cutaneous, pudendal, and sciatic. The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve out of these and will have multiple branches before its termination. The sciatic nerve shadows not only the other nerves in terms of size but also pathology.Â Injury to the sciatic nerve often presents with hamstring motor deficits in conjunction with a sensory deficit of the posterior thigh. A more complex manifestation of sciatic nerve involvement can occur in cauda equina syndrome when its nerve roots are affected.
