The diagnosis of ACC can typically be made solely from clinical examination. Many providers withhold performing a lesional biopsy given the patient's age demographics and typical scalp involvement. When a biopsy is necessary to aid in the diagnosis, proper workup, including imaging of the lesion with ultrasound (US) or MRI, is important to ensure there are no underlying malformations that can be damaged during the biopsy procedure.
