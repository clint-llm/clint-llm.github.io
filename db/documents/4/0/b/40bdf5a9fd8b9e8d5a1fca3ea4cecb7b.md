When discussing managed care, the overriding concern is the intermingling of the provider's finances with the amount and type of care they offer to the patient.

Another concern that emerges with managed care is the perception of lack of professional autonomy and the obligate burden or hassle factor that arises for the provider who must function in a more structured monitored environment and receive, analyze and act upon utilization and quality reports sent to them from the teams at the managed care plan.

As experience with managed care becomes established in the health care setting, a concern arises around the risk that patient access may be limited by providers gaming the system and cherry-picking or seeking to serve only patients in oneâ€™s practice that are likely to be healthier, more likely to need less care and service and thus who would make it easier to meet the utilization and quality targets.

This gaming or cherry-picking would then leave patients with chronic conditions or those with some level of medical complexity with less access to care because fewer providers would be available willing to see them in their practices. If this gaming occurs, those providers who are motivated to care for these patients with chronic conditions or with medical complexity would be at a financial disadvantage by merely doing the right thing and making themselves available to those most in need of healthcare. Recognizing this potential disincentive, managed care plans mitigate this potential by risk adjusting their measures and targets so that expected higher utilization that reflects appropriate care for a patient with a chronic condition is factored into the target setting. This risk adjustment provides accommodation to providers who take on the added responsibilities of caring for a more chronically affected patient population.
