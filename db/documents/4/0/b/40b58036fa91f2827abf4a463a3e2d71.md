The first step to treat facet arthritis is patient education of proper posture during daily living, relative rest, pain relief, and exercise.Â After physical therapy, if the pain persists, facet blocks can be done to help further understand if the pain is really from the facet joint itself, which helps the practitioner arrange further treatment if needed.
