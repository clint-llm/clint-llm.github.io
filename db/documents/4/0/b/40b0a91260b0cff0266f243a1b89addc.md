No treatment is needed due to the self-limiting nature of the condition. If, however, a patient seeks treatment, emollients can be used, low-dose systemic corticosteroids, a short course of acitretin, as well as, topical steroids to treat the dryness or pruritus. Other therapies include photodynamic treatment using aminolevulinic methyl acid. Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus can also be used to treat persistent and pruritic lesions on the face and arms and legs. Nail abnormalities can be treated with tacrolimus.
