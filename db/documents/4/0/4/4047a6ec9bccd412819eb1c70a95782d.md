In most studies related to bowel injury, similar factors predispose to the relative risk for infectious morbidity and primary repair or anastomotic failure. These relative risks include fecal contamination, extensive blood loss, and hemodynamic instability or shock state. Further severe concern complications from direct rectal injury include wound infection, abdominal and or pelvic/retroperitoneal abscess, fistulous tract formation, fascial dehiscence, bacteremia, and necrotizing fasciitis.

Despite increasing literature against and need to increase selectivity, proximal diversion, and ostomy creation in multi-institute studies examining rectal trauma are as high as 76%. Ostomy complications include parastomal hernias, stenosis, retraction, and metabolic imbalance. With the reversal of an ostomy, there is a risk for local wound infections between 3 to 20%.
