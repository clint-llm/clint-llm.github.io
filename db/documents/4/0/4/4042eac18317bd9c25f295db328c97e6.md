- Meconium plug syndrome is a functional disorder of the colon, which is a separate entity from neonatal small left colon syndrome.

- It requires differentiation from other causes of non-passage of meconium to ensure swift treatment.

- Treatment is conservative and relatively successful in a large majority of the cases.

- There is an association with Hirschsprung disease, which should be pursued with suction rectal biopsy if there is no passage of stool following contrast enemaÂ or return of bowel function.
