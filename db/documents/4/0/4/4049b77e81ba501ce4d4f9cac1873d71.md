As mentioned at the beginning of this article, infertility is a devastating diagnosis and should be considered a disease process by all healthcare team members. The author believes the best way to improve the physical, emotional, social, and interpersonal stressors of infertility for the patient is to complete an immediate and thorough investigation into both partners.  The evaluation is straightforward and can be completed before referral to a fertility subspecialist. This will expedite and enhance the specialist's ability to initiate follow-up studies and treatments. The use of either clomiphene or letrozole with timed intercourse alone can be used to correct a known cause of anovulation but should not prolong the referral to a subspecialist. All primary care providers need to set realistic expectations of the chances of pregnancy and the possibility of complications when counseling couples suffering from infertility. Lastly, this manuscript is not all-encompassing but provides a basic foundation of knowledge to feel comfortable discussing a patient's family planning goals, initiating an evaluation, and reviewing available treatments.
