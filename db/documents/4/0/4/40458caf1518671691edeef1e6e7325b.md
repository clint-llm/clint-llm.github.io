The pathology often shows changes in the upper midbrain, substantia nigra, basal ganglia, pons, thalamus, and medulla that correlate with the illness's clinical features. Perivascular lymphocyte infiltration, especially plasma cells, activated astrocytes, and macrophages were usually seen. No viral inclusion bodies, presence of amyloid or complement in basal ganglia were found.

In a large percentage of patients, oligoclonal bands, and antibodies against the basal ganglia were detected. In 65% of patients, antibodies against beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected.
