The development of simulation has been evolving in technology and utilization over the last several centuries, with the increased application over the past 2 to 3 decades in the field of pediatrics. Today, simulation-based medical education (SBME) is widely used by a majority of pediatric training programs and is marked by a large variety of technologies and continued interest and availability of research in the field.

The history of simulation in medicine has its origins in fields such as the military, commercial aviation, and NASA.

Today, there are numerous simulation centers and hospitals that utilize a variety of human patient simulators that range from low to high fidelity mannequins, the most sophisticated of which are capable of responding to learner stimuli such as drug administration, compressions, voice, physical exam, and even procedural interventions.
