A bursa is a potential space containing fluid that is present between the skin and tendon or tendon and bone. It functions to reduce friction between the skin and tendon or tendon and bone. This activity will highlight the identification and management of the condition when the prepatellar bursa becomes inflamed/infected, termed bursitis, and will review the role of the healthcare professional in understanding and appropriately treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of prepatellar bursitis. 
- Identify and describe an appropriate history and physical examination of prepatellar bursitis. 
- Outline the treatment and management options available for prepatellar bursitis.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of prepatellar bursitis and improve outcomes.
