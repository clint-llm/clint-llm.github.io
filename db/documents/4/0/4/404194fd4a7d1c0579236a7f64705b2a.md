Lactose intolerance is a clinical syndrome that manifests with characteristic signs and symptoms upon consuming food substances containing lactose, a disaccharide. Normally upon lactose consumption, it is hydrolyzed into glucose and galactose by the lactase enzyme, which is found in the small intestinal brush border. Deficiency of lactase due to primary or secondary causes results in clinical symptoms. This activity describes the pathophysiology of lactose intolerance and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of lactose intolerance.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with lactose intolerance.
- Summarize the management options for lactose intolerance.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by lactose intolerance.
