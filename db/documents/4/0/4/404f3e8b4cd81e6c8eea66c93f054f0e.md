Pancreatic panniculitis is more commonly seen in middle-aged men with a history of chronic alcoholism and who also suffer from acute or chronic pancreatitis.

Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma can also be associated with pancreatic,Â panniculitis, and polyarthritis (PPP) syndrome.

Pancreatic pseudocysts, posttraumatic pancreatitis, pancreas divisum, and hemophagocytic syndrome have also been reported with this panniculitis.

Idiopathic pancreatic panniculitis has also been reported, where no pancreatic disease was found after appropriate investigation. The skin biopsies in these cases confirmed histopathological features consistent with pancreatic panniculitis.
