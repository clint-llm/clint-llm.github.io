Most cases of EBV positive mucocutaneous ulcers have a benign course and respond well to conservative management. In these cases, the patients are reported to have complete remission either spontaneously or in response to the reduction of their immunosuppressive therapies. However, there are reports of more persistent and debilitating cases that required more aggressive treatment. Some case reports have indicated excellent response to CD20 or CD30 directed antibody therapy, local radiation, surgical excision, chemotherapy, or a combination of these treatments.
