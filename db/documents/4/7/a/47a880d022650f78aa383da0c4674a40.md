Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the predominant form of thyroid cancer, accounting for 80 to 85% of all thyroid cancer cases. In a report based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 1975 to 2012, the incidence of PTC increased from 4.8 to 14.9 per 100,000.

The overdiagnosis is usually due to frequent incidental finding of microcancers of the thyroid gland in routine imaging studies, and the overtreatment is due to the slow-changing mentality of the medical force that is still using aggressive surgical therapy as definite treatment of thyroid cancer versus the newest more conservative approach of observation or more limited surgical intervention.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma occurs predominantly in middle-aged adults with a 3 to 1 female-to-male ratio, and the median age at presentation is 50 years. Even though rare in children, PTC is still the most common pediatric thyroid malignancy. It affects Whites more commonly than Blacks.
