Every urologist seems to have his own unique and personal procedure for double J stent placement as there is no single, universally accepted, or recommended technique. Some practitioners will immediately cut the dangler/safety thread which gets the thread out of the way early in the placement procedure but may cause difficulties later in adjusting or manipulating the stent. Some will choose to use the same length stent for every patient or adjust the length based on estimates from retrograde pyelograms using x-ray, CT scans, or patient height which seems less than ideal if the placement of an optimal length stent is the goal. This activity describes the indications, technique, and potential complications of double J stent placement.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the basic features of a double J stent placement.
- Review the indications for double J stent placement.
- Summarize the side effects of double J stent placement.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients undergoing double J stent placement.
