Patients with acute sinusitis present with symptoms that have been present for fewer than four weeks. Specific symptoms may include anterior or posterior nasal purulence, obstruction, hyposmia, anosmia, fever, facial pain or pressure, dental pain, fatigue, halitosis, and headache, among other complaints

On physical exam, the healthcare provider may notice anterior or posterior purulent rhinorrhea, turbinate hypertrophy, mucosal congestion, or erythema on anterior rhinoscopy. There may be external tenderness to palpation of the frontal, ethmoid, or maxillary sinuses. The patient may be febrile or even tachycardic due to generalized facial pain. Although rare, some patients with acute sinusitis may present with complications such as orbital cellulitis, preseptal cellulitis, or cavernous sinus thrombosis.

Patients suffering from recurrent acute rhinosinusitis tend to manifest symptoms similar to acute sinusitis. An episode of acute sinusitis should be presumed to have a viral etiology if the patient reports fewer than ten days of symptoms.
