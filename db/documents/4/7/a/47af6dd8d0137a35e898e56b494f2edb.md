Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase are commonly seen. CSF analysis in most patients showed elevated WBC count or protein level, or both.

Typical MRI findings were multiple 2 to 7 mm lesions best visualized in the T2-weighted images in the subcortical & deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, periventricular areas, and the corpus callosum, without associated cerebral edema or mass effect. Few patients have leptomeningeal enhancement or parenchymal lesion enhancement.
