Quantitative prognostic indicators currently used for peritoneal carcinomatosis are the following:

- Tumor histology

- Intraoperative assessment of the extent of carcinomatosis at the time of surgical exploration, which can be determined by different scoring systems as described earlier, and they include:

- Gilly staging
- PCI scoring system
- Staging by Japanese cancer society for gastric cancer
- Dutch simplified peritoneal carcinomatosis index (SPCI)

- Completeness of cytoreduction (CC)

- Patient's clinical symptoms

The primary outcome parameters such as overall survival, disease-free survival, and 5-year survival rate depend on the type of primary cancer, the achievement of cytoreduction (based on CC scoring), HIPEC treatment, and/or biological activity of cancer.

Peritoneal metastasis from an unknown primary tumor (UPT) has a poor prognosis, reaching as low as three months survival duration. Although specific histologic subtypes have shown favorable survival, efforts should focus on detecting and identifying the primary tumor, potentially increasing the prognostic benefits from treatment.
