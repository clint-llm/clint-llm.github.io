The saphenous artery typically branches from the descending genicular artery which originates from the medial wall of the femoral artery in the adductor canal. The saphenous artery, along with the saphenous nerve, travel under the sartorius muscle.

The great saphenous vein is a subcutaneous vein that serves as the superficial vein of the leg. It initiates from the dorsal venous arch of the foot and runs anterior to the medial malleolus up to the medial aspect of the leg. It continues past the medial epicondyle of the femur to enter the saphenous opening where it drains into the femoral vein.
