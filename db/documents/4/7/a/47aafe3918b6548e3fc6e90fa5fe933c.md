There are seven subtypes of serotonin receptors present in the body.

The 5-HT receptor is unique in that it involves a ligand-gated Na/K ion channel similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid.

5-HT1 and 5-HT5 receptors negatively couple with adenylyl cyclase; the activation of these receptors downregulates cyclic AMP. 5-HT receptor upregulates the inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol pathways, resulting in intracellular Ca release. A combination of 5-HT4, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors activate adenylyl cyclase, increasing cAMP activity.

The Na/K cation channel associates with 5-HT results in plasma membrane depolarization. The termination of serotonergic activity is facilitated by the reuptake of 5-HT from the cellular synapse.
