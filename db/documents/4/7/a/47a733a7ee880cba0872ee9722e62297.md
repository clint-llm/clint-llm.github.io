The dosing of tetracyclines is different in adults and children. Adults may receive 1g total of tetracyclines daily, which can be broken up into 500 mg twice a day or 250 mg four times a day. Higher doses may be given for more severe infections, such as 500 mg four times a day. Pediatric patients above eight years old can receive a daily dose of 25 mg/kg up to 50 mg/kg, divided into four equal doses.

Normal levels of tetracyclines achieved in the serum after oral dosing range from 2 to 5 mcg/ml. The majority of tetracyclines require dosing two to four times daily to maintain therapeutic concentrations in the serum. That said, doxycycline and minocycline have longer elimination half-lives and permit once or twice daily dosing.

Achieving adequate serum concentrations of tetracyclines may be impaired by antacids that contain aluminum, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, or sodium bicarbonate. Thus, certain foods high in these cations, as well as some dairy products, may interfere with absorption.

Tetracyclines may render oral contraceptive pills less effective. Therefore clinicians should strongly encourage the use of some form of barrier protection in sexually active females.
