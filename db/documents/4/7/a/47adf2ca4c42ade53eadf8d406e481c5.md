Medical conditions that can compromise the skin envelope for the breast implant include scleroderma, history of radiation, and history of smoking. The previously irradiated breast can lead to implant infection and extrusion; therefore, for these patients, autologous tissue reconstruction is preferred. If a patient needs adjuvant radiation therapy after mastectomy, immediate implant-based reconstruction is advised against until radiation is completed.

For pre-pectoral (subcutaneous) implant placement, high body mass index, history of smoking, and pre-operative radiation are absolute contraindications due to the high risk of implant extrusion.
