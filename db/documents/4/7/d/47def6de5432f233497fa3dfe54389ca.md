Symptoms and physical signs are dependent on the stage of lung cancer.Â  The earliest stages are often asymptomatic, with nodules found incidentally on radiographic images testing for other disease processes. Later stage disease may present with nonspecific symptoms such as a cough, hemoptysis, or unintentional weight loss. If the patient presents with a pleural effusion, he or she may have shortness of breath with decreased breath sounds. The vast majority of patients will have a smoking history and may have other associated diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or a family history of lung cancer.

A significant number of patients with lung adenocarcinoma will present with a locoregional spread that may include symptoms from:

- Superior vena cava obstruction

- Phrenic nerve palsy

- Horner syndrome

- Compression of brachial plexus

- Pericardial effusion

Paraneoplastic syndromes are rare with adenocarcinoma but may include:

- Cushing syndrome

- Eaton Lambert syndrome

- Hypercalcemia

- SIADH

- Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy
