The discovery, development, and use of ionizing radiation as a means for medical imaging, such as fluoroscopy, has proved to be pivotal in the advancement of modern medicine. Advanced imaging techniques have completely revolutionized patient care, and with such accessibility, their use to guide medical procedures has become widespread, with broad application in the medical community. However, with such use comes the hazardous risk of exposure to radiation and its subsequent potentially detrimental biologic effects towards patients and caregivers alike, most significantly carcinogenesis. Hence, the need for radiation safety awareness and implementation among caregivers is paramount to decrease the risk of radiation exposure and the potential negative biologic effects.

Improving healthcare team membersâ€™ understanding of radiation exposure and proper techniques for radiation safety will help lead to decreased negative outcomes, both chronic and acute in nature, among patients and caregivers. This includes several techniques such as collimation, barriers, shielding, positioning, proper image acquisition settings, and utilization of effective communication among team members. This article will explain the protective measures against radiation exposure, briefly explain radiation basics during the use of fluoroscopy and highlight the role of the healthcare team in the facilitation and promotion of radiation safety.
