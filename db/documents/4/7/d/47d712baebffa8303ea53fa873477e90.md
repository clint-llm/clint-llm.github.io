The maxilla is comprised of paired maxillary bones fused at the midline. It articulates with the frontal bone superiorly, the alveolar process inferiorly, bilateral zygomatic bones laterally, posteriorly with the palatine bone, and posterolaterally with the pterygoid plates of the sphenoid bone.

Blood supply to the LeFort I segment is provided by the ascending palatine artery, a branch of the facial artery, and the anterior branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery, which arises directly from the external carotid artery.

Innervation to the maxilla is via the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (V2), which originates in the trigeminal ganglion, exits through the foramen rotundum to enter the pterygopalatine fossa, where it gives off multiple branches. The infra-orbital nerve, a terminal extension of V2, exits through the infraorbital foramen and provides sensory innervation to the soft tissue of the midface: lower lid, cheek/malar region, nose, upper lip, and anterior maxillary dentition. The infraorbital nerve is encountered in the dissection for the LeFort I osteotomy and should be identified and protected.
