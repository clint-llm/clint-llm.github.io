# Introduction

To maintain a stable perception of the world around us while we engage in normal movements throughout our day, such as walking, we have something known as the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). This reflex keeps us steady and balanced even though our eyes and head are continuously moving when we perform most actions. When we make a head movement, our eye muscles are triggered instantly to create an eye movement opposite to that of our head movement at the exact same speed to readjust the visual world, which, in turn, stabilizes our retinal image by keeping the eye still in space and focused on an object, despite the head motion.

# Structure and Function

The vestibulo-ocular reflex involves three parts

- A peripheral sensory apparatus (which consists of a set of motion sensors: the semicircular canals and the otolith organs (saccule and utricle)

- A central processing mechanism

- A motor output (which are the eye muscles)

Otolith organs are sensitive to linear acceleration and therefore detect the position of the head relative to gravity and head translation. Semicircular canals, however, are responsible for detecting head rotation since these are sensitive to angular acceleration. These organize in a push-pull structure consisting of one coplanar canal on the left side and another coplanar canal on the right side, which work by coordinating with each other. Humans have a total of six canals arranged in three main planes (anterior, posterior, horizontal) on both sides; each plane has a pair of canals. A canal will get stimulated by head motion towards that canal.

The central nervous system (CNS) is the central processing mechanism, which sends its outputs to the spinal cord and ocular muscles to generate the VOR. Each SSC has excitatory projections to a pair of extraocular muscles in each eye and inhibitory projections to an antagonistic pair of muscles.

# Embryology

Research done on mice and rats shows that vestibular afferents and central neurons have some functionality very early in life. This research suggests that neural network connections between vestibular afferents, central neurons, oculomotor neurons, and extraocular eye muscles are initiated and set up to some extent by birth. Much of this maturation process was shown to be dependent on the growth of the animal and its vestibular organs. Although the development and maturation of the VOR did not seem to be influenced by the presence or absence of visual inputs initially, this was noted to be crucial for the fine-tuning and enhancement of the VOR.

# Blood Supply and Lymphatics

The primary blood supply for the peripheral vestibular system is the labyrinthine artery, which comes from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. The utricle, small part of the saccule, and superior and horizontal semicircular canals receive supply by the superior vestibular artery, which bifurcates with the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. The cochlea, rest of the saccule, and most of the posterior semicircular canal get supplied by bifurcation of the common cochlear artery. The superior vein drains the horizontal and superior semicircular canal and utricle. The inferior vein is responsible for draining the posterior semicircular canals and saccule.

# Nerves

Vestibular information comes into the brainstem via the cranial nerve VIII. Signals enter the vestibular nuclear complex, located in the medulla and pons. Four main nuclei comprise the vestibular nuclear complex (superior, inferior, medial, and lateral).

# Muscles

As mentioned earlier, the VOR works by activating our eye muscles to create eye movements in the exact speed but opposite direction of our head movements to stabilize our retinal images.

# Surgical Considerations

Surgery is not the first-line of treatment for VOR malfunction. The ability to restore the VOR function varies. Due to neuroplasticity, it usually improves spontaneously with time, and no intervention is needed. There are a few suggested interventions for those who do not recover with time. One is an adaptation, and another is exercise-based treatment programs (vestibular rehabilitation therapy). However, it is challenging to restore the VOR function at high velocities in severe cases of vestibular loss.

# Clinical Significance

The implications of a disrupted vestibulo-ocular reflex include oscillopsia and abnormal nystagmus.

# Other Issues

Assessment of the vestibulo-ocular reflex takes place using the Halmagyi-Curthoys test, also known as the rapid impulse test. To perform this, the physician will rapidly move the patient’s head in one direction (left or right), and the eyes should remain in place focused on a particular object in front of them despite the head movement. If a patient’s VOR has damage on one side when their head turns to that direction with force, their eyes will follow the direction of the head movement before coming back to their focal point; this would imply some issue in the vestibulo-ocular reflex arc.
