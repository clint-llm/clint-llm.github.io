Although amyloid beta plaques are pathognomonic of Alzheimer disease pathology, there is no strong correlation of amyloid beta plaque burden, spatiotemporal distribution, and Alzheimer disease severity. It is possible, however, that the total amyloid plaque burden increases as Alzheimer disease progresses. In contrast, the spatiotemporal distribution of tau neurofibrillary tangles follows a predictable pattern, with neurofibrillary tangles seen in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus and gradually spreading to involve other areas, with primary motor, sensory and visual areas involved in the last stages of Alzheimer disease.
