The current gold standard of cardiac surgical myocardial protection is the administration of cardioplegia. Administration of potassium-rich cardioplegia solution leads to elective reversible diastolic cardiac arrest and results in decreased myocardial metabolic demand. It provides intraoperative myocardial protection by matching myocardial oxygen demand during intraoperative periods of decreased oxygen supply. The goal of cardioplegia is to provide a motionless (non-beating) operative field along with the protection of myocardial function. Early cardioplegic methods used cold crystalloid solutions to induce and maintain cardiac arrest during heart surgery. Since the 1950s, cold crystalloid cardioplegia (CCC) was the cornerstone of cardiac surgical practice.

In the 1970s, blood was introduced as a medium of cardioplegia delivery because of its increased oxygen-carrying capacity, innate buffering capacity (from histidine), and superior osmotic properties.
