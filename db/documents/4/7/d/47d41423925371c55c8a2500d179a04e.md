Life-threatening emergent complications of NHL should be considered during the initial workup and evaluation. Early recognition and prompt therapy are critical for these situations, which may interfere with and delay treatment of the underlying NHL. These can include:

- Febrile neutropenia

- Hyperuricemia and tumor lysis syndrome - Presents with fatigue, nausea, vomiting, decreased urination, numbness, tingling of legs, and joint pain. Laboratory findings include an increase in uric acid, potassium, creatinine, and phosphate and a decrease in calcium levels. This can be prevented with vigorous hydration and allopurinol.

- Spinal cord or brain compression

- Focal compression depending on the location and type of NHL - airway obstruction (mediastinal lymphoma), intestinal obstruction and intussusception, ureteral obstruction

- Superior or inferior vena cava obstruction

- Hyperleukocytosis

- Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma can cause hypercalcemia.

- Pericardial tamponade

- Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia can cause hyperviscosity syndrome.

- Hepatic dysfunction

- Venous thromboembolic disease

- Autoimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia - can be observed with small lymphocytic lymphoma
