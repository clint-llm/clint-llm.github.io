Most newborns with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) have no or few clinical manifestations at birth. This is due to partial maternal thyroxine hormone transfer (~25-50%). The classic clinical features of CH appear gradually over approximately six weeks, but early signs may appear within the first few weeks of life in more severe cases of CH. The early manifestations include lethargy, hypotonia, large anterior and posterior fontanels, feeding difficulty, prolonged jaundice, poor or hoarse cry, constipation, and hypothermia. The classic late manifestations of CH usually occur after about six weeks of life. These include coarse facies with depressed nasal bridge, puffy eyelids, large tongue, coarse hair, thick, dry and cold mottled skin, abdominal distension, umbilical hernia, hyporeflexia, bradycardia, hypotension, and anemia. The respiratory distress may develop due to myxedema of the airway and is characterized by noisy breathing, nasal stuffiness, and intermittent perioral cyanosis.
