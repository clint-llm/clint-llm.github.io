Kupffer cells contain the SR-AI/II scavenger receptor, which is involved in recognizing and binding the lipid A domain of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid.

Kupffer cells have been identified to play a key role in developing alcohol-induced liver disease. The intestinal tract of humans contains numerous bacteria, which can lead to the production of gut-derived endotoxin. The gut-derived endotoxins make their way to the liver, then cleared by the Kupffer cells. Studies suggest that these endotoxins activate Kupffer cells.

Kupffer cells activation results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide, leading to oxidative stress in the liver. TLR4 activates interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK-1), which leads to the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB).

Kupffer cells have Fc, C3, and scavenger receptors involved in the phagocytosis of opsonized and nonopsonized materials.
