Cutaneous lesions initially appear as small (2.0 to 5.0 mm) erythematous papules on the trunk or extremities. Over 2 to 4 weeks, the center of the lesion depresses, and lesions evolve into the pathognomonic large papules (0.5 to 1.0 cm) with an atrophic porcelain-white center and an erythematous, telangiectatic rim. The palms, soles, scalp, and face are rarely involved.

In those who develop extracutaneous involvement, the systemic disease can develop suddenly or many years after cutaneous manifestations. Patients may report upper or lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding, abdominal pain, numbness and tingling, vision changes, and respiratory or cardiac symptoms depending on the organs involved.
