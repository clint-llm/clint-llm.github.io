Dental fluorosis is caused by the excessive ingestion of fluoride during tooth development. The severity of dental fluorosis is dose-dependent and influenced by the extent of time an individual is exposed to excessive fluoride within the critical window of development and genetic factors.

The critical window for dental fluorosis to develop in response toÂ excessive fluoride intake ranges from birth to eight years of age.

Artificially fluoridated water has a target fluoride concentration of 1 ppm, which is thought to optimize the anti-cariogenic properties of fluoride while minimizing the risk of adverse effects, including dental fluorosis.
