Often, the specific pathophysiology for how HLA antigens are associated with a disease is not well known. However, HLA antigens play a role in autoimmunity. For example, in type I diabetes mellitus, the DR3-DQ2 haplotype is seen at an increased percent compared to the general population. The same haplotype is also associated with juvenile autoimmune thyroiditis. Other haplotypes can be protective for diseases, such as DRB1*14:01, which has protective effects against type I diabetes.
