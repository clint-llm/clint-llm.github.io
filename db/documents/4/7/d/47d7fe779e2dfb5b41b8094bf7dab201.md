Shock and right ventricular dysfunction confer a poor prognosis and predict mortality in patients diagnosed with PE.

Original and simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index

- Male sex- +10 points/ –

- Cancer- +30 points/1 point

- Chronic heart failure- +10 points/1 point

- Chronic pulmonary disease- +10 points/1 point

- Pulse rate ≥110 b.p.m- +20 points/1 point

- Systolic BP <100 mmHg- +30 points/1 point

Risk stratification in PESI

- Class I: Points less than or equal to 65; low 30-day risk of mortality from 1 to 6 percent.

- Class II: Points 66–85; low mortality risk from 1.7 to 3.5%

- Class III: Points 86–105; moderate mortality risk from 3.2 to 7.1 percent.

- Class IV: Points 106–125; high mortality risk from 4.0 to 11.4%.

- Class V: Points more than 125; very high mortality risk from 10.0 to 24.5%.

Risk stratification in sPESI

If 0 points then 30-day mortality risk 1.0%

If one or more than one point(s) then 30-day mortality risk 10.9%
