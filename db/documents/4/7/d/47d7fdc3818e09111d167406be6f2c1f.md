While there is a set window during which menarche should begin, there is variation within that window with many causes. As previously discussed, socioeconomic status, diet, activity, and genetics can play a role in the initiation of puberty and menarche.

It is crucial to educate prepubertal patients and their guardians on the progression of puberty and the development of the menstrual cycle. It is essential to talk openly about the subject and dispel any fears or misinformation the child may have. Clinicians should convey that females will begin to menstruate approximately 2 to 3 years after breast development begins and that menstruation is a normal part of development. Patients should be instructed on using feminine products and what is considered normal menstrual flow. This should be a collaborative educational effort between the patient, guardian, and clinician.

Several menstrual abnormalities require further evaluation.

- Absence of menarche within three years of thelarche

- Absence of menarche by 14 years of age with signs of hirsutism

- Absence of menarche by 14 years of age with a history or physical examination suggestive of excessive exercise or eating disorder

- Absence of menarche by 15 years of age in the presence of normal growth and development

Anatomical problems leading to amenorrhea can typically be diagnosed by a thorough history, a careful visual exam of the external genitalia, and a manual exam of the reproductive organs of the adolescent female patient. Clinicians should take a history in private and maintain confidentiality whenever possible. It is also essential to explain the physical examination in detail; chaperones should be provided.

Clinically, it is essential to know that both sexual abuse and childhood physical abuse can trigger early menarche. Screening for sexual abuse is a crucial aspect of general practice, but many providers lack a consistent approach to patient evaluation. Menarche may provide clinicians with an opportunity to discuss the topic of sexual initiation and screen for past abuse. As a healthcare provider, noting the presence of early menarche in combination with other physical or behavioral signs and symptoms should prompt a more detailed history.
