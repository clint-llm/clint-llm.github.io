The majority of ganglion cysts are asymptomatic, but patients may seek treatment because of their unsightly cosmetic appearance. Patients may present with pain, tenderness, or weakness that is exacerbated by wrist motion. Ganglion cysts usually present as firm, well circumscribed, freely mobile masses approximately 1 cm to 3 cm in size. They are often fixed to deep tissue and not to the overlying skin. Patients with volar wrist ganglion cysts less commonly may present with carpal tunnel syndrome or a trigger finger secondary to compression of the median nerve or intrusion on the flexor tendon sheath. Volar wrist ganglion cysts can also cause ulnar nerve neuropraxia and compression of the radial artery leading to ischemia. Ganglion cysts will usually transilluminate on the exam.
