Nursing interventions related to the appendicitis patient include:

- Assessing and relieving pain through medication administration as well as nonpharmacologic interventions.

- IMPORTANT: DO NOT APPLY HEAT TO THE APPENDICITIS PATIENT'S ABDOMEN AS THIS COULD LEAD TO RUPTURE.

- Prevent fluid volume deficit. If tolerated and the patient is not NPO, oral fluid intake should be encouraged, and intake and output recorded.

- Prevent infection. Maintain a clean environment, provide wound care to the postoperative patient, and assess incision frequently for signs of infection. Monitor patient temperature and heart rate for signs of potential infection. Administer antibiotics as prescribed by the provider.

- Reduce patient anxiety by keeping the patient informed of the plan of care and ensure the patient is aware of diagnosis and treatment options.

- Encourage patients to walk as able/ permitted to maintain circulation. If the patient is immobile, the use of serial compression devices (SCD) and TED hose should be implemented to avoid DVT/clots.

- Monitor for adequate bowel movements. Opioids can be necessary for pain control, but they often lead to constipation. Encourage adequate water intake andÂ use of a stool softener.
