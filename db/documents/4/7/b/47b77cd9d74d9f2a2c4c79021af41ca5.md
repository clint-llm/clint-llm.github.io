Rivastigmine is a medication used to manage and treat neurodegenerative disease, specifically dementia, in patients with Alzheimer and Parkinson disease. It is in the cholinesterase inhibitor class of drugs. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for rivastigmine as a valuable agent in managing dementia (and other disorders when applicable). This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the healthcare team in the management of patients with dementia and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of rivastigmine.
- Describe the adverse effects and contraindications of rivastigmine.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for potential toxicity of rivastigmine.
- Summarize some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance rivastigmine and improve outcomes.
