Esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula is a complex surgical entity that requires skilled maternal-fetal medicine specialists to counsel the parents about prognosis and outcomes during pregnancy. Neonatologists and pediatric surgeons are often part of such discussions during antenatal visits. Neonates born with TEF and EA require specialized care in a neonatal ICU (NICU).

Critical care is provided based on the evidence-based approach by an interprofessional team of skilled healthcare team of neonatologists, pediatric surgeons, pediatric cardiologists, radiologists, and nurses. Parents are counseled and empowered for shared decision making throughout the NICU course. Surgery will correct the atresia, but the road to recovery can have complications such as anastomotic leaks, strictures, and esophageal reflux. The importance of timely and detailed communication between all healthcare teams cannot be stressed enough, as neonates typically do well with EA/TEF and have a good prognosis if managed well in the postnatal period.
