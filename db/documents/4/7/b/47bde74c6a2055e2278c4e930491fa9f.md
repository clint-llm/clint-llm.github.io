Although the MBTI was not designed for clinical use, it has had application to some patient populations. In psychology and psychiatry, the MBTI may help understand specific patient populations such as those suffering from suicidality and unipolar depression. In both populations, greater tendencies have been identified towards introversion energy and perception orientation compared to the normative population. The researchers suggest that with more confirmatory samples, these correlations may be usefulÂ in identifying vulnerability in patients with affective disorder.

Most significantly, the MBTI may have applications to fostering communication between health care professionals and patients. It is important to consider possible communication differences between the provider and the patient. For example, some research suggests that there are significantly more introverts, intuitive perceivers, thinking deciders, and judging-oriented individuals among a doctor population compared to a general adult population, which consists of more extroverts, sensing perceivers, feeling deciders, and perceiving orientated persons.
