Multiple organ systems are involved in cellular communication. Some of these organ systems are listed here

- Endocrine organs: Examples of endocrine organs include the thyroid gland, adrenal glands, pancreas, and pituitary gland; these organs use a hematogenous spread of hormones to transmit signals to target cells far away.

- Nervous system: The synapsis between neurons or in the neuromuscular junction is a type of paracrine signaling. A neuron releases a neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft, and nearby cells (other neurons or muscle cells) receive signals through receptors to neurotransmitters.

- Immune cells: Some immune cells release ATP during activation. ATP interacts with purinergic receptors in the same cell that secrete it via autocrine signaling. Immune cells also use juxtacrine signaling for antigen presentation and hemostasis. Cytokines are short-lived signaling molecules involved in immune system regulation. They can function in an endocrine, paracrine, or autocrine fashion.
