Young's Rule is an equation used to calculate pediatric medication dosage based on patient age and the known recommended adult dose. The definition of Young's Rule is the age of the patient divided by the age added to twelve, all multiplied by the recommended adult dose. This formula appears below:

**[Age / (Age + 12)] x Recommended Adult Dose = Pediatric Dose**

Young's Rule can be applied quickly in situations where the current weight of the patient is unknown. Other approaches to pediatric dosing using age include the Webster and Fried rules.

The Clark Rule or the Body Surface Area Rule can be implemented if the weight of the patient is known.
