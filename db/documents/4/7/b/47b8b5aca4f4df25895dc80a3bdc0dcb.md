It is important to realize that chronic inflammation is not a specific disease but a mechanisticÂ process. The diseases associated with chronic inflammation are multiple and include CVD, diabetes, malignancy, auto-immune disease, chronic hepatic and renal disease, etc. A good history, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests (glucose, creatinine, liver function, serum protein electrophoresis, rheumatoid factor, complete blood count, antinuclear antibodies) can confirm or rule out most of the differential diagnoses. Pertinent diagnostic and imaging studies can be helpful in certain circumstances, e.g., colonoscopy in suspected inflammatory bowel disease.
