Clotrimazole is not for systemic administration; it is administered via oral/transmucosal lozenges (troches), either topically or intravaginally. Small quantities absorbed are metabolized in the liver and excreted in the bile.

**Oral Route**

Transmucosal Route - clotrimazole oral lozenges are used for local treatment and are not significantly bioavailable. Concentrations persisting in saliva appear to be due to clotrimazole binding to the oral mucosa.

**Topical Route**

There is minimal systemic absorption following topical application of clotrimazole.

**Other Routes**

Intravaginal Route - roughly 5Â to 10% of clotrimazole undergoes absorption following vaginal use. Therefore, fungicidal concentrations can persist in the vagina for up to 3 days after application.
