The skin biopsy is not required to confirm the diagnosis, but it is useful to exclude other scleroderma-like disorders. Histologic examination of the mid and the reticular dermis shows marked thickening of the collagen bundles, separated from one another by prominent, clear mucin-filled spaces. A mild mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates surrounding capillaries are observable. The subcutaneous fat shows invasions with enlarged collagen fibers. No abnormalities of the epidermis, the sweat glands or the pilosebaceous glands are present. Mucin deposits are observed in most cases, using Alcian blue or toluidine blue stains.
