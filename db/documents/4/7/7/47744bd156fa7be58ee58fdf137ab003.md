Itching, an irritating sensation that evokes the impulse to scratch, is the predominant complaint in pruritus gravidarum. The itching begins in the late second to the early third trimester; itching onset as early as eight weeks of gestation has been described.

Itching is usually intermittent at the outset and goes on to become constant. Pruritus begins first in the abdomen and spreads to involve the entire trunk and the palms and soles. The itching ranges from mild to severe and bothers the patients most in the night.

The examination does not show any primary lesions in pruritus gravidarum. In fact, the diagnosis of pruritus gravidarum is rejected if any primary lesions are present.
