The mitral valve has an important function in pressure and volume homeostasis for the heart. Mitral valve disease can be detrimental and lead to complications like heart failure or atrial fibrillation from left atrial enlargement. Advances in cardiac imaging with three-dimensional echocardiography have allowed for better visualization of the mitral valve to be able to better classify mitral valve pathology.

The most common mitral valve pathologies are mitral stenosis (MS) and mitral regurgitation. Mitral stenosis is caused by an abnormal thickening of the mitral valve that is most commonly due to rheumatic heart disease.

Secondary MR is also known as ‘functional MR’ and is defined as an imbalance between closing and tethering forces on the mitral valve secondary to structural heart changes with a structurally normal mitral valve apparatus.
