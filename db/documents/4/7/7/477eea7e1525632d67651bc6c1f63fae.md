Etiopathogenesis of strabismus is unclear. The physiology of ocular motility involves extraocular muscles, cranial nerves, supranuclear pathways, and their cerebral controls. All of these have been implicated in the development of strabismus. Following two theories are popular:

- Claude Worth theory states that an inherent absence of cortical fusional potential is the cause of strabismus.

- Chavasse theory states that motor alignment leads to a poor sensory status, which, if left untreated, leads to strabismus. This theory justifies early treatment for squint, which leads to sustained improvement in binocular single vision (BSV). Hence many surgeons justify doing early surgery in conditions like infantile esotropia.

In relation to muscle innervation and action, the following two laws of ocular motility govern the extraocular motility:

- Sherrington law of reciprocal innervation: Increased innervation to a muscle is accompanied by decreased innervation to its antagonist. Exception: Duane retraction syndrome.

- Herring law of equal innervation: Equal and simultaneous innervation flows through synergistic muscles during any conjugate eye movement. Exception: Dissociated vertical deviation.
