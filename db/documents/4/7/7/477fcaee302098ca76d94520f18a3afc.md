The most definitive form of evaluation for an acute P. mirabilis infection is a culture. Proteus species are gram-negative, rod-shaped, and facultatively anaerobic. The majority of strains are lactose negative with characteristic swarming motility that will become evident on agar plates. One must always correlate positive culture results with the clinical presentation of the patient to form an accurate diagnosis.

Additional evaluations include urine sample analysis to evaluate for pyuria and leukocyte esterase. Pyuria is generally present in the case of bacterial urinary tract infection, such that lack of pyuria may indicate an alternate cause of symptoms. Leukocyte esterase dipstick provides a good alternative to microscopy but is a less sensitive test than microscopic examination. Gram staining of urine may help reveal microscopic bacteriuria which would confirm infection, although the absence of bacteriuria does not exclude it.

A patient with a history of chronically alkaline urine in combination with a positive Proteus culture should be evaluated for renal stones (struvite stones).

If resolution is not seen with antibiotic therapy alone, an ultrasound of the kidneys or a CT abdomen may be warranted to rule out renal stones or a perinephric abscess.
