The etiology of dizziness is vast and varied. Broadly, it can be separated into central/neurologic, peripheral/vestibular, or cardiovascular causes. Central causes of dizziness include cerebellar or brainstem strokes or posterior circulation TIAs.

Peripheral causes can include vestibular schwannomas, vestibular migraines, Meniere disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), bilateral vestibulopathy, or superior canal dehiscence syndrome. Cardiovascular causes include orthostatic hypotension, presyncope, vertebral artery dissection, or dysrhythmias.
