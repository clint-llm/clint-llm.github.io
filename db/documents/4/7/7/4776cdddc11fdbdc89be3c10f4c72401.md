Management of choroid plexus papilloma requires an interprofessional team that includes the neurosurgeon, various specialists (e.g., anesthetist, pediatrician, ophthalmologist, neurologist), and neuroscience specialty-trained nurses. It is vital to educate the parents that even though these lesions are benign, complications can occur during surgery. A thorough discussion between the neurosurgeon and family should take place on the optimal procedure for the child. With adequate preparation of the child, the outcomes are excellent.
