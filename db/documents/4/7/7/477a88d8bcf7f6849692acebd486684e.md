Arachnoiditis is a persistent inflammation of the arachnoid mater as well as subarachnoid space due to many possible causes such as prior spinal surgery, infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, lumbar epidural injections, oil-based myelographic contrast agents, chemical irritation, or idiopathic. This condition involves membrane thickening, dural adhesions, scar tissue formation, and often clumping of nerve roots. As the disease progresses, scar tissue can encapsulate the nerve roots, impeding CSF flow, and leads to a condition called chronic adhesive arachnoiditis. Another late-stage complication called arachnoiditis ossificans can also occur when the arachnoid mater becomes ossified due to prolonged inflammation, resulting in progressive neurological debility. Spinal cord swelling and syringomyelia formation can also be a manifestation of advanced arachnoiditis.
