Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is one of the most commonly diagnosed cardiac lesions on routine screening with fetal ultrasound.

Parents who choose to proceed with a three-stage repair after birth need to be closely followed with serial fetal cardiac exams and receive obstetrical care close to a pediatric cardiac center. Obstetricians, cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, neonatologists, and anesthesiologists all have toÂ coordinate as an interprofessional team to have a plan ready before the birth of a neonate with HLHS. Emergent atrial septostomy or ECMO (extracorporal membrane oxygenation) cannulation may be necessary to save these patients shortly after birth. In general, neonates with HLHS are at a higher risk for premature birth.

These patients are critically ill before and after each stage of surgical repair and require open communication and specialized care from neonatal and ICU nurses, intensivists, cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, nutritionists, respiratory therapists, anesthesiologists, and pharmacists. Knowledge of the cardiac lesions, surgical repair, and the physiologic changes associated with each stage of the repair are important to the survival of these infants. Each discipline will perform the function pertinent to their specialty but must chart and keep the entire team informed so that all members of the interprofessional team operate from the same, most current information available on the patient, leading to better outcomes.
