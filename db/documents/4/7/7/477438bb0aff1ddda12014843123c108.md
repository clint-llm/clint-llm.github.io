Anifrolumab is one of three anti-type-1 interferon agents currentlyÂ under investigation as a potential treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Initial in vivo studies observed higher levels of serum interferon (IFN) in patients with autoimmune disease as opposed to those of healthy controls.

Anifrolumab has gained traction as a promising drug for SLE, as demonstrated in the MUSE study (phase IIb), TULIP-1 (phase III), and TULIP-2 (phase III).

The U.S Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved anifrolumab. As of this writing (July 2021), the drug is still in process with the regulators.
