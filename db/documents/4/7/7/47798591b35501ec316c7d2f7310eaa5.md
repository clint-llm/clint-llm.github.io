**Arterial Supply**

The blood supply to the DRG is via two interconnected superficial and deep arterial plexuses. These plexuses arise from arteries descending from the radicular branches of the segmental arteries.

**Venous Supply**

Peri-ganglionic venous plexuses drain predominantly from the dorsal side of DRG into intervertebral veins.
