Alpha-synuclein has several roles in synaptic firing, as determined by experimentation over the last decade. It can alter neurotransmitter release, is involved with vesicular trafficking, and works with cysteine string protein-alpha as a chaperone protein in the assembly of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes.

In experiments on bovine neural tissue, beta-synuclein has functioned as a constitutive inhibitor of phospholipase D2. Phospholipase D2 is involved in cytoskeleton reorganization and endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Researchers have also suggested beta-synuclein to be a natural negative regulator of alpha-synuclein aggregation – leading to anti-amyloidogenic properties.

Lastly, gamma-synuclein was identified as a marker for breast cancer via cDNA sequencing. The cellular function of gamma-synuclein is unknown.

The alpha-synuclein protein was discovered within the electric organ of the stingray Torpedo californica in 1988, in the presynaptic area and the nucleus envelope. From these areas derives the name of the protein: synaptic vesicles ("syn") and nuclear envelope ("nuclein"). Although decades have passed since its discovery, its functions remain not fully elucidated, especially in a physiological environment.

Beta-synuclein protein was identified in two animal model studies (1990 and 1992), in the brain area, at the presynaptic level of nerve endings.

Gamma-synuclein was identified in breast cancer in 1997.
