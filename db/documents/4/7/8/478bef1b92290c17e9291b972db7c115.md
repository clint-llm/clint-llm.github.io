The epidemiology of lymphocytosis varies by age and particular etiologies. Below is some demographic data for the most common causes.

- EBV: EBV infection is widespread worldwide among all age groups, and around 90% of adults will eventually become seropositive. IM though traditionally peaks in young adults at age 15 to 24 years, but can happen later in life.

- Pertussis and cat-scratch disease: pertussis predominantly affects children less than ten years of age, but could occur in adults where it might portend a more severe course in the elderly.

- CLL: CLL is the most common leukemia in adult patients in the US, especially in older adults with a median age of diagnosis of 70 years. It is more common in men (male to female ratio of around 1.5 to 1) and more common among the White population.

- NHL: The frequency of peripheral blood lymphocytosis varies by the type of lymphoma and ranges from 20 to 80%.

- MBL: The prevalence of MBL is very high compared to CLL and reaches 5 to 9% in the population over 60 years of age. MBL is also more common in males than in females.

- Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS): Lymphocytosis in DRESS can occur in around 30 to 70% of cases.
