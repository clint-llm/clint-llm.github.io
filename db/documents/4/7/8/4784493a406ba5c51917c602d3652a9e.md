Recurrence of hernias is the biggest concern with this surgical technique. Most commonly, the hernia will recur at the pubic tubercle, and without proper technique, this recurrence is more likely. Patient compliance with avoidance of heavy lifting or strenuous activity is also vital to reduce the rate of recurrence. In children, the recurrence of inguinal hernia is noticed in those having poor tissue healing capacity, for e.g. connective tissue disorders, Mucopolysaccharidosis, etc. Chronic pain has been described by many patients and is the main driving point of the great debate between preservation and sacrifice of nerves during dissection.
