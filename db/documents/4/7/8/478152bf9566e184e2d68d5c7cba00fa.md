Caffeine is a naturally occurring central nervous system (CNS)Â stimulant of the methylxanthine class and is the most widely taken psychoactive stimulant globally. This drug is most commonly sourced from the coffee bean but can also be found naturally occurring in certain types of tea and cacao beans. It is also an additive to soda and energy drinks. The primary goal of caffeine consumption is to combat fatigue and drowsiness, but there are many additional uses.

The FDA has approved caffeine for use in the treatment of apnea of prematurity and prevention and treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia of premature infants.
