Histopathological examination of the tissue reveals focal hyperkeratosis and an acanthotic epidermis with minimal spongiotic change. Inflammatory infiltration is present in a perivascular distribution with a non-specific collection of plasma cells, eosinophils, Langerhans cells, lymphocytes, and Th2 cells. These findings are not pathognomonic; however, they do aid in the diagnosis and evaluation of PEO.
