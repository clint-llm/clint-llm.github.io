Treatment is varied depending on the etiology and severity of symptoms. However, conservative management of symptoms is generally considered the first line. Medications are used to manage pain symptoms, including NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and in severe cases, opiates. Radicular symptoms are often treated with neuroleptic agents. Systemic steroids are often prescribed for acute low back pain, although there is limited evidence to support their use. Nonpharmacologic interventions are often utilizedÂ as well. Physical therapy, acupuncture, chiropractic manipulation, and traction are all commonly used in the treatment of lumbosacral radiculopathy. Of note, the data supporting the use of these treatment modalities is equivocal. Interventional techniques are also commonly used and include epidural steroid injections and percutaneous disc decompression. In refractory cases, surgical decompression and spinal fusion can be performed.
