Several case reports for Caplan syndrome, pulmonary function tests typically have shown mild airway obstruction. Constantinides et al. had a retrospective study and compared 24 patients with Caplan syndrome and 36 patients with progressive massive fibrosis, suggesting an overlap in pulmonary function tests. Caplan syndrome had less airflow obstruction compared to progressive massive fibrosis patients, without differences with respect to lung volumes and diffusion capacity. This study was adjusted for age, mining exposure, and smoking.
