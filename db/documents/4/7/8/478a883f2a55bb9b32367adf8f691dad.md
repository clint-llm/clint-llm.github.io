Lab findings for these patients are nonspecific. Patients may have mild leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein. Blood cultures are positive in SEA but not so in IEA. Conventional radiography of the spine may not be helpful in SEA because osseous destruction can be absent. Bone and gallium scans and even computed tomography are equivocal and can delay definitive diagnostic testing. The gold standard for diagnosis of SEA is myelography which has mostly replaced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is as sensitive and specific as computed tomogram (CT)-myelogram.

For IEA, CT or MRIÂ are diagnostic with the latter showing more details. Nowadays, CT-guided needle aspiration is more frequently used in both entities all across the world.
