Apraxia may develop acutely after a neurological insult like a cerebrovascular accident or traumatic brain injury or be insidious, as in cases of dementia or multiple sclerosis. Often patients are unaware of their shortcomings concerning certain previously learned activities/skills. A thorough history and physical examination are crucial in the diagnosis of apraxia. A healthcare provider must assess the patient's ability by talking to them and their family members and physically evaluating their ability to perform tasks.

Radiological and laboratory evaluation of apraxia primarily involves identifying various etiological causes like cerebrovascular disease, dementia, neurodegenerative disorders, traumatic brain injury, tumors, multiple sclerosis, and schizophrenia. Radiological imaging in the form of MRI or PET is one of the best tools to identify lesions in the brain that can potentially cause apraxia.
