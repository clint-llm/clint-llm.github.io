Serious reactions following routine immunizations are rare but include hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, and seizures. The rate of allergic reaction to routine vaccines is 1 per million doses administered. More commonly, the recipient may experience a local vaccine reaction, including erythema or soreness at the injection site. Other uncommon reported minor adverse reactions include irritability, fatigue, anorexia, fever, and vomiting.

Vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) presents a small risk in regions where immunization rates are low and the oral polio vaccine is administered. The live attenuated virus may acquire virulence, thus posing an infectious threat. It is not known to be a complication of the IPV, the only polio vaccine used in the United States for routine childhood vaccinations since 2000.
