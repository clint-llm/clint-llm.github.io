Inflammation of the prostate gland is the earliest sign of prostate cancer. Many genetic mutations cause this.

Telomeres at the ends of chromosomes shorten as a result of oxidative damage brought on by inflammation of the prostate gland. It ultimately leads to the initiation of prostate cancer.

Several genes, including MYC, PTEN, NKX3.1, and the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion, have been identified in the initiation and development of prostate cancer, even though no single tumor suppressor gene is primarily responsible.

The ERG oncogenic pathway, linked to the emergence of illness, is activated by the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion.

The reactivation of cell cycle pathways causes unchecked cell proliferation, promoting the tumor's metastatic spread.

Gene expression profiling of metastatic illness identifies overexpression in EZH2 mRNA and proteins. Due to its role in apoptosis and proliferation, EZH2 is currently under research as a new prostate cancer target.
