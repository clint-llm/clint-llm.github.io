Prognosis mainly depends on the type of azoospermia. In obstructive azoospermia, the prognosis for a successful biological pregnancy using sperm retrieval procedures and intracytoplasmic sperm injectionsÂ is better than in non-obstructive azoospermia, where spermatogenesis may be so disrupted that no viable sperm can be collected. Advancements in surgical techniques and procedures over the last 20 years have greatly improved the chances of a successful pregnancy with advanced assisted reproductive techniques.
