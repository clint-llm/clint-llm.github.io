Preventive measures are based on the timely vaccination of the susceptible population and public health actions before the appearance of suspicious cases within the first 72 hours. While balancing the need for preventive immunization, the healthcare provider must maintain communication and achieve the trust of the population to achieve a high likelihood of vaccination acceptance.

There are several measles vaccines made with live attenuated viruses - these can be in the form of single-antigen vaccines or combination with rubella or mumps and rubella vaccines. The measles vaccine is usually given by subcutaneous injection, but intramuscular administration is also effective. WHO guidelines state that two doses of measles vaccination should be applied with variations in the timing of the first dose depending on endemic situations and settings.  The first dose of the vaccine is usually at nine months of age in endemic settings, but from six months of age in some circumstances, including during outbreaks, for displaced populations and refugees, for children infected and exposed to HIV, and children at high risk of contracting measles.  There is also some flexibility, according to local epidemiology. Administering the first dose of the vaccine at 12 to 15 months results in a higher proportion of protected children, but can only be done in settings where the risk is low.  The second dose of the vaccine is given at four to five years of life.
