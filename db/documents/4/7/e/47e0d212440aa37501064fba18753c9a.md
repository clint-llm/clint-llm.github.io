Iodine is an essential micronutrient that has a crucial role in metabolism.  It is oxidized to produce iodine-containing thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones are necessary for controlling growth, metabolism, and many other body functions. They are crucial for fetal and neonatal brain development.

Iodine deficiency has long been a recognized global problem and remains a leading cause of preventable fetal brain damage.

Although the consequences of iodine deficiency have been recognized for years, there was not much much emphasis on the prevalence or the consequences of iodine excess. Iodine is not synthesized in the human body and must be obtained from food, dietary supplements, medications, and iodinated contrast media. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for adults is 150 micrograms/day, 220 to 250 micrograms/day for pregnant women, and 250 to 290 micrograms/day for breastfeeding women.

Iodine excess can cause subclinical or overt thyroid dysfunction in patients with specific risk factors, including those with pre-existing thyroid disease, the elderly, fetuses, and neonates. The effects of excess iodine are variable among individuals and relate to the individuals underlying thyroid function.
