Addisonian crisis refers to an acute status of severe cortisol and aldosterone deficiency.  As a response to an environmental stressor, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). CRH stimulates the anterior pituitary to release adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), which travels through the bloodstream to the adrenal cortex and upregulates cortisol production. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone synthesized from cholesterol by enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family in the zona fasciculate, the middle area of the adrenal cortex

Cortisol is the primary hormone involved in the human stress response and has multiple effects throughout the body such as causing vasoconstriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It helps regulate the supply of glucose in the body by triggering gluconeogenesis or stimulating glycogen synthesis in the liver as well as the production and release of amino acids from free fatty acids. It weakens the immune response by preventing T-cell proliferation and preventing T-cells from recognizing interleukin signals
