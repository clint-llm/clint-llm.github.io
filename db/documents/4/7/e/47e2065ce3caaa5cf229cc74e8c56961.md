Meperidine is contraindicated in patients that are actively receiving or have been exposed during the past 14 days to monoamineÂ oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) because of unpredictable severe, and occasionally fatal reactions such as coma, severe respiratory depression, hypotension, cyanosis, and acute narcotic overdose. Also, convulsion, hyper-excitability, tachycardia, hyperpyrexia, and hypertension have been reported. Intravenous hydrocortisone or prednisone have been used to treat severe reactions. In those cases exhibiting hypertension and hyperpyrexia, intravenous chlorpromazine is added.

Meperidine has respiratory depressant effects and capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure especially in patients with head injury or other intracranial lesions. In this group of patients using Meperidine should be with extreme caution. Like other narcotics, using meperidine in patients having an acute asthma attack and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should be with caution, and these patients should be monitored for any signs of increased airway resistance or apnea.

Meperidine has several Black Box warnings:

- The potential risk of opioid addiction which can cause overdose and death. Physicians should evaluate their patients continuously for developing these conditions.

- Life-threatening respiratory failure may occur, therefore monitoring for respiratory depression during the initiation and following dose increase should be considered.

- Parallel use with cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors or discontinuation of P450 inducers causes the increase of the meperidine concentration that can result in a fatal overdose.

- Concomitant use of meperidine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) can cause coma, severe respiratory failure, cyanosis, and hypotension.

- Chronic use of meperidine during pregnancy can cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which needs to be diagnosed and managed by guidelines of neonatology, which otherwise can be fatal.

- Concomitant use of another central nervous system (CNS) depressant like benzodiazepines or alcohol with meperidine may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death.

- There is a risk of medication errors, which can be prevented by ensuring accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administrating. This is especially important as confusing mg and ml when dosing can result in an accidental fatal overdose.
