**Cardiovascular Disease Assessment**Cardiovascular disease is categorized into four groups: coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, aortic atherosclerosis, and thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysms. There are several established risk factors that can be further categorized into non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors. The importance of understanding the significance of risk assessment lies in the epidemiology of CVD. Cardiovascular disease is the number 1 cause of death globally and is projected to remain the world’s major disease burden, accounting for more than 23.6 million deaths per year by 2030.

**Cardiovascular Risk Factors**

Risk factors for cardiovascular disease can be separated into non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors. These risk factors have been shown to have a cumulative effect over time, in that the progression of CVD is related to not only the number of risk factors present but also their persistence over a period of time.  More simply, the risk of developing CVD increases with the number of risk factors acquired and the length of time they have been present.

Non-modifiable risk factors are as follows: age, gender, and family history. Specifically, these risk factors are permanent, and there is very little that can be done to decrease an established risk from these factors. Several studies have been shown that the prevalence of CVD increases with age, where each decade of life above the age of 40 showed a significant increase in the prevalence of any vascular disease.

The remaining risk factors are modifiable and can be further categorized into include health conditions and lifestyle factors. Health conditions include hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Lifestyle factors include cigarette smoking, diet and exercise, obesity, and psychosocial factors. Hypertension has an abundant amount of evidence to support its role as a risk factor in developing CVD. A meta-analysis published in 2002 shows that blood pressure is “strongly and directly related to vascular (and overall) mortality,” showing that a difference of 20 mmHg of systolic or 10 mm Hg of diastolic pressure is associated with a nearly twofold difference in cardiovascular disease death rate.

**Cardiovascular Risk Assessment and Reduction**

Cardiovascular risk can be assessed through several different risk models accounting for separate risk factors, some overlapping with other risk models. No single risk model is the supreme choice, although the ACC/AHA published guidelines in 2013 recommending the use of the ACC/AHA pooled cohort hard CVD risk score in the United States. Regardless of the risk model that is chosen, patients are categorized in a low, intermediate, and high estimated 10-year risk for developing CVD. Based on the patient’s category, further therapy for primary prevention can be warranted, or lifestyle changes and reassessment is done. Primary medical prophylaxis usually involves aspirin or statin initiation but can involve medical therapy to reduce other risk factors, e.g., smoking cessation, depression, hypertensive medication, etc.

**Perioperative Risk Assessment**

Perioperative risk assessment is used to evaluate a patient’s risk of perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality in noncardiac surgeries. It helps facilitate a patient's informed decision by providing a risk/benefit illustration of the surgical intervention. Any patient planned for a noncardiac surgery should be risk-stratified as it forces clinicians to perform a thorough evaluation.

**Perioperative Risk Clinical Markers**

The independent clinical markers used in large studies as risk predictors are coronary artery disease (CAD), prior heart failure, diabetes, and renal failure. Each of these predictors carries with it a relative risk of approximately 2.0 to 5.0

Diagnosed coronary artery disease (CAD) carries a relative risk of 2.9 for major cardiac complications in the perioperative setting.

Functional capacity is quantified and characterized by metabolic equivalents (METs), where "excellent" is greater than 10 METs, "good" is 7 to 10 METs, "moderate" is 4 to 6 METs, and poor is less than 4 METs.

Different types of surgeries carry separate risks. By definition, a low-risk procedure is where the combined surgical and patient characteristics predict the risk of cardiac complications less than 1%; whereas, a high-risk procedure predicts a risk of greater than 1%. Generally, high-risk surgeries include any intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular procedure carrying a relative risk of 2.1 for major cardiac complications.

Additional conditions that should warrant evaluation and consideration are any severe symptomatic valvular disease, known pulmonary vascular disease, or any unexplained dyspnea. Both conditions cause a significant increase in the risk of perioperative major cardiac complications.

All these predictors of risk are used to calculate a patient’s percentage of major cardiac complications. There are several risk calculators, such as the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) or National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, among others, that are useful to establish a baseline clinical risk to dictate further whether perioperative testing is necessary. Most commonly, RCRI is used to calculate the risk of a major cardiac complication. This tool was based on the works of Goldman et al. in 1977 and first published in 1999 by Lee et al. using the following six clinical markers, risk is calculated:

- History of ischemic heart disease

- History of congestive heart failure

- History of cerebrovascular disease (including transient ischemic attacks)

- History of diabetes requiring preoperative insulin use

- Chronic kidney disease with creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL

- A planned procedure that is by definition a high-risk surgery

Each parameter is given a point is met, and the patient is given a risk of major cardiac complications based on a relative RCRI score of 0 to 6. The rates of major cardiac complications with 0, 1, 2, or greater than or equal to 3 clinical markers were 0.4%, 0.9%, 6.6%, and 11% respectively.

Furthermore, the differences between emergency, urgent, and elective surgeries should be defined, as emergency surgery does not allow for and/or require a preoperative assessment, unlike urgent and elective surgeries. Emergency surgery is defined as a procedure in which life or limb is threatened if the patient is not taken to the operating room in less than 6 hours. In contrast to urgent surgery, where life or limb are threatened if not in the operating room within 6 to 24 hours. Elective surgery is any procedure that can be delayed safely for up to 1 year.

**Perioperative Cardiac Testing**

Who should be tested? Simply, the answer depends on whether the results change management. In 2014, the American College of Cardiology published a stepwise algorithm for assessment regarding perioperative testing.

Prophylactic percutaneous coronary intervention was once done to patients with stable CAD undergoing elective vascular surgery with the thought that these patients have a significant hospital and 30-day cardiac mortality rate.

**Perioperative Management**

Perioperative medical management has had several criticisms, especially surrounding the use of beta-blockers and statins in the perioperative setting. The controversy surrounding DECREASE trials and subsequent results of the Perioperative Ischemic Evaluation (POISE) trial brought into question the role of beta-blockers in the perioperative setting.

Beta-blockers were initially shown to reduce mortality and incidence of cardiovascular complications for up to 2 years after surgery in a 1996 study.

Statin therapy was also under criticism, however far much less than beta-blockers. This was secondary to, again, DECREASE III and IV trials, reporting an exaggerated benefit of statin therapy and combined beta-blocker/statin therapy, respectively.

Alpha agonists (for example, clonidine) have no benefit in the perioperative setting to reduce major cardiac complications

Anticoagulants must be determined considering the clinical history and the surgical procedure to be done. Surgical procedures with a low risk of bleeding may have anticoagulation continued. For patients with a high risk of thromboembolic disease (for example, patients with mechanical valves), it may be reasonable to continue anticoagulation if there is a low risk of bleeding. In general, therapeutic anticoagulants are discouraged because of their harmful effect on the ability to control and contain surgical blood loss

The role of antiplatelet agents is focused on patients who are already on long-term antiplatelet therapy, usually in the context of prior cardiac stent placement. However, one study showed that even in patients with an elevated operative risk, aspirin in the perioperative setting does not reduce the rate of all-cause mortality or non-fatal myocardial infarction and is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding.
