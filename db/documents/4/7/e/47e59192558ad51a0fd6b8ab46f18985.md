The main blood supply to the ankle comes from the anterior tibial artery, the posterior tibial artery, and the peroneal artery.

The anterior tibial artery subdivides into the anterior medial malleolar artery (supplies the medial malleoli), anterior lateral malleolar artery (supplies the lateral malleoli) and the dorsalis pedisÂ artery (supplies the dorsum of the foot).

The posterior tibial artery subdivides into the posterior medial malleolar artery (supplies the medial malleolus) and the medial calcaneal artery (supplies the heel). The terminal branches of the posterior tibial artery are the lateral plantar artery and medial plantar arteries. The larger of the terminal branches is the lateral plantar artery, which completes the deep plantar arch. The deep plantar arch is an arterial anastomosis found on the sole of the foot that is made up of the deep plantar artery (branch of dorsalis pedis) and the lateral plantar artery. The medial plantar artery runs in the medial foot and terminates as the superficial plantar arch (an inconstant anastomosis between the medial and lateral plantar arteries).

The peroneal artery subdivides into the perforating artery, the posterior lateral malleolar artery, and the lateral calcaneal artery. The perforating artery joins with the anterior lateral malleolus artery and supplies the posterior talus. The posterior lateral malleolar artery supplies the lateral malleolus, and the lateral calcaneal artery supplies the heel.
