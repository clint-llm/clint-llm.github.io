When developing a simulation-based curriculum, assessing the staffing that would be present and necessary for the scenario provided is important. In the case of ECMO, one would anticipate that there would be a need for multiple disciplinary teams during each step. At one center, the teams that were recognized as essential in developing an ECPR simulation-based curriculum included 1) the ICU team (nurses, respiratory therapists, intensive care physicians, and support staff), 2) a surgical team (cardiovascular or general surgeon, assistants, and nurses), and 3) ECMO team (that consisted of personnel that had specialized in preparing and maintaining the ECMO circuit).
