Amlodipine is primarily administered orally and is available in 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg tablets. In addition, suspensions created from oral tablets are available for pediatric and elderly patients with difficulty swallowing. Compared to nifedipine and other medications in the dihydropyridine class, amlodipine has the longest half-life at 30 to 50 hours. The benefit of such a long half-life is the ability to have once-daily dosing.

**Recommended Dosages**

**Hypertension**

- Adults: initial dose 5 mg once daily; maximum dose of 10 mg per day

- Geriatric and Debilitated Patients: reduce initial dose to 2.5 mg once daily; maximum dose of 10 mg per day

- Adolescents and Children 6 years of age or older: 2.5 to 5 mg once daily; maximum dose of 5 mg per day

- Children 6 years of age or younger: 0.05 to 0.2 mg/kg per day; maximum dose 0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg per day (up to 5 mg per day)

**CAD, Chronic Stable Angina, Prinzmental Angina, CAD Documented by Angiography and Without Heart Failure or Ejection Fraction Less than 40%**

- Adults: initial dose 5 to 10 mg once daily

- Elderly and debilitated patients: initial dose 5 mg once daily; usual dose is 10 mg once daily

Amlodipine can be used as monotherapy or in combination with several different medications to manage hypertension or CAD in patients. Common combinations include:

- Amlodipine/atorvastatin: Atorvastatin is a lipid-lowering agent that blocks cholesterol synthesis and is administered to reduce cardiovascular events.

- Amlodipine/aliskiren or amlodipine/aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide: Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor that binds renin and prevents activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that leads to a reduction in blood volume. Both combinations lower blood pressure.

- Amlodipine/benazepril or amlodipine/perindopril: Benazepril and perindopril are ACE inhibitors that block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the RAAS.

- Amlodipine/olmesartan or amlodipine/telmisartan or amlodipine/valsartan: Olmesartan, telmisartan, and valsartan are angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) that inhibit the activity of angiotensin II in the RAAS.

**Use in Specific Patient Population**

Patients with Hepatic Impairment:  Amlodipine is primarily metabolized by the liver, and the plasma elimination half-life is prolonged with impaired hepatic function; gradual titration of the dose is recommended. The initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily for hypertension or 5 mg once daily for angina. Adjust the dosage based on clinical response.

Patients with Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine is not significantly influenced by renal impairment. Consequently, patients with renal impairment don't require dose adjustment.

Pregnancy Considerations: Untreated hypertension in pregnancy increases the risk for pre-eclampsia, premature delivery, intrauterine growth restriction(IUGR), and intrauterine death. Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy (CHAP) results indicate that in pregnant women with mild chronic hypertension, an approach of target blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg was associated with better pregnancy outcomes than a strategy of reserving treatment only for severe hypertension.

Breastfeeding Considerations: Human milk levels of amlodipine are low, and plasma levels in breastfed infants are undetectable. Maternal use of amlodipine during breastfeeding has not caused any adverse effects in breastfed infants. Consequently, amlodipine is acceptable in nursing mothers.
