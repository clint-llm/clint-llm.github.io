Simulation-based training offers a unique opportunity for healthcare teams to practice and assess CRM behaviors while managing realistic clinical scenarios in a controlled setting without posing a threat to the safety of real patients.

When planning a CRM curriculum, it is essential to note that one size does not fit all. Each training program may have different goals for and constraints on implementing a CRM course for its learners. Thus, it is essential first to perform a needs assessment to identify the most critical teamwork competencies for a particular learner group and clinical environment.

After identifying learner needs, instructors should develop a simulation-based curriculum that systematically addresses each of the targeted CRM principles. It may be tempting to create scenarios that incorporate many or all CRM competencies at once, especially if simulation time and resources are limited. However, teamwork training is such a dynamic process that the curriculum will likely have a more significant impact if specific scenarios are dedicated to addressing a defined subset of CRM concepts.

The next step is to define specific and measurable learning objectives for each of the targeted CRM principles.

When crafting a CRM simulation scenario, it is crucial to select an appropriate clinical context for learners to engage in teamwork training.

Structured debriefing is a critical component of simulation-based CRM training.

Several behavioral rating scales have been developed to assess healthcare teams on various CRM competencies. Some of the most well-known rating systems include the Anesthetistsâ€™ Non-Technical Skills System,
