Differential diagnosis of haemolacria includes:

- Red-colored tears may be noted in patients on therapy with rifampicin.

- Occult haemolacria is the term used for apparently clear tears if microscopic or chemical evidence of red blood corpuscles is present in tears. Microscopy showed erythrocytes in the tear of 10% of the normal population, and chemically blood was detected by the chemical stix method in 3% of normal persons.

- False bloody tears - Malingerers may feign red-colored liquids and may claim that tear is bloodstained. Animal studies have shown that rats treated with muscarinic agents may secrete reddish-brown tears (chromodacryorrhea) due to protoporphyrin and coproporphyrin secreted from Harderian glands. Melanodacryorrhea or black tears may be a feature in conjunctival argyrosis or necrotic uveal melanoma.
