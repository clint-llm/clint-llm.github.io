- The brachial plexus originates from the ventral rami of spinal nerves C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1 but may occasionally receive contributions from C4 and T2.

- Root avulsions may present with rhomboid/paraspinal muscle paralysis, medial scapular winging, Horner syndrome, and hemidiaphragm paralysis.

- Evaluation of latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major motor function helps to localize the lesion as supraclavicular or infraclavicular (proximal or distal to the cord level).
