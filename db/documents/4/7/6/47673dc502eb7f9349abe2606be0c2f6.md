Even though there is no toxic dose noted in the literature, patients should not take excessive amounts of vitamin K. Instead, patients should be urged to eat a healthy balanced diet with green leafy vegetables rather than to supplement this vitamin.

Using vitamin K therapeutically requires the effort of an interprofessional healthcare team that includes clinicians, nursing staff, dieticians, and pharmacists, especially as it pertains to the treatment of coagulopathies. Patients on warfarin need to maintain a steady intake level of vitamin K in their diet to optimize warfarin dosing. Conversely, it serves as the antidote to warfarin toxicity. Pharmacists need to counsel patients regarding this topic and dispel the notion that because they are on warfarin, they should no longer eat green leafy vegetables but instead emphasize a consistent intake is the key. Nursing can perform follow-up with patients and also reinforce the points about dietary intake, and ensure that INR and other values remain in range. Any concerns should be reported to the prescriber of warfarin or vitamin K promptly so that dose and/or regimen adjustments can take place immediately if necessary. The dietician can examine the patient's diet and recommend changes to ensure consistent intake from dietary sources. This interprofessional approach ensures optimal patient outcomes from using vitamin K when needed. [Level 5]
