Early diagnosis, treatment and careful monitoring of neurotrophic keratitis patients are mandatory to achieve epithelial healing and prevent progression of corneal damage.

The use of preservative-free artificial tears may help improve the corneal surface at all stages of disease severity.

In the event of stromal melting, use of topical collagenase inhibitors, such as N-acetylcysteine, and systemic administration of tetracycline or medroxyprogesterone may be considered. Use of topical antibiotic eye drops to prevent infection in eyes with neurotrophic keratitis at stages 2 and three are recommended. Topical nerve growth factor (NGF) and autologous serum eye drops are considered as promising treatments of neurotrophic keratopathy.

Surgical treatments are reserved for refractory cases. They include partial or total tarsorrhaphy, amniotic membrane transplantation, conjunctival flap, and Botulinum A toxin injection of the eyelid elevator muscle.

- Stage 1 neurotrophic keratitis is mainly managed with preservative-free artificial tears.

- Stage 2 with conjunctival flap and partial tarsorrhaphy for the persistent epithelial defects.

- Stage 3 with therapeutic contact lenses and amniotic membrane transplantation.Corneal perforations may be managed with cyanoacrylate glue application, conjunctival flap or lamellar/penetrating keratoplasty.

Neurotization surgery with direct transfer of the supratrochlear or supraorbital nerves to the subconjunctival space has shown promise.
