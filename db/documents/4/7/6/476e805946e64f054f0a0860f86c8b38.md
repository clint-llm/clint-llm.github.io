The myometrium has two layers. The circular layer is thinner and present at the innermost aspect of muscle fibers and is derived from the paramesonephric/Mullerian ducts. It is called sub-endometrial or junctional endometrium. The outer longitudinal layer is made of intertwined muscle bundles embedded in an extracellular matrix made of collagen fibers, which is highly vascular. This helps build the intense pressure needed for contractions. The longitudinal layer originates from non-Mullerian tissue.Â Both layers work together to expel the fetus from the uterine cavity. Some studies have suggested that myometrial cells exhibit "pace-maker" capabilities, such as those present in the gut and urethra, that facilitate synchronous uterine contractions, although the evidence for this is inconsistent.
