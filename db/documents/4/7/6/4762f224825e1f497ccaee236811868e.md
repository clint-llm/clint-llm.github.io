There are four main types of vessels in the body and have a specific role in blood flow. Arteries are thick-walled vessels that perfuse organs. Capillaries connect arteries to veins and are the main sites of nutrient/waste exchange. Capillaries have the largest total cross-sectional and surface area. Veins are thin-walled blood vessels that return deoxygenated blood to the heart. Sinusoids are substitutes for capillaries in some organs such as the spleen, liver, red bone marrow, etc. and their primary function is to elicit an immune response to foreign antigens. Each vessel plays a specific role in blood flow and is regulated by several different factors that alter flow physiology.

Arterioles are branches of arteries that are innervated by autonomic nerve fibers. There are alpha-1-adrenergic receptors on arterioles of the skin, splanchnic and renal circulations, and beta-2-adrenergic receptors on skeletal muscle. Alpha1-adrenergic receptor activation results in vasoconstriction, and beta2-adrenergic receptor activation results in vasodilation.
