Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a rare clinical problem in which abnormal communications develop between a pulmonary artery and a pulmonary vein, bypassing the pulmonary capillary bed. The patient presentation can vary from little or no symptoms to severe dyspnea and platypnea-orthodeoxia, depending on the degree of right-to-left shunting of blood. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of pulmonary AVM and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations.
- Review the management options available for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations.
- Explain the importance of the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by pulmonary arteriovenous malformations.
