Peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) formation between the peripheral iris and trabecular meshwork of the iridocorneal angle is the main etiologic factor in chronic angle closure.

Risk factors for angle-closure include:

- Race: Asian ethnicity

- Age: above 40 years

- Sex: 2-3 times more common in females

- Ocular biometry: shallow anterior chamber depth, short axial length, increased lens thickness, increased anterior curvature of the lens, small corneal radius of curvature.

- Family history of angle-closure

- Refractive error: hyperopia.

- Recurrent intraocular inflammation.

- Cataract with an intumescent lens.

- Plateau iris

In susceptible individuals, some systemic drugs can induce angle-closure:

- Nebulized bronchodilator (such as salbutamol, ipratropium bromide)

- Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

- Tricyclic antidepressant

- Some cold and flu medications

- Muscle relaxant

- Anti-epileptic

- Parasympatholytic

- Sympathomimetics
