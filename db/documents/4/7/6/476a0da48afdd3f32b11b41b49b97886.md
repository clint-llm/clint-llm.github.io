If venous reflux is suspected based on symptomatology and clinical evaluation, the practitioner should obtain a color duplex venous ultrasound exam. This study is an objective assessment of the anatomy of the veins as well as valvular function. During the ultrasound, evaluation for deep vein thrombosis should also be performed to confirm that DVT/obstruction is not contributing to the clinical scenario.

Several Duplex sonography markers have been proposed to identify the preferred index for varicose vein grading study. Accordingly, the peak reflux velocity and reflux time in cases of varicose veins and non-varicose veins were compared. The results demonstrated that quantifying peak reflux velocity is more consistent than reflux time in cases of superficial venous reflux. Moreover, an optimal peak reflux velocity cut-off point of 27.4 cm/sec had the discriminatory power to differentiate the diseased limbs.

Contrast venography is rarely done today. Pulsed-wave Doppler images of varicose veins in axial projection will demonstrate retrograde blood flow after the release of manual calf compression. In the varicose vein with reflux, the reflux can be easily quantified with an ultrasound probe angled steeply upward while imaging in axial projection.
