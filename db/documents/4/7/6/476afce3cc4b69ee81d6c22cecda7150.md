Five Plasmodium species possess the ability to infect humans: P. falciparum, P. ovale, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi.Anopheles mosquito ingests gametes during a blood meal, which form sporozoites that replicate in the gut.Plasmodia consume hemoglobin and develop from immature trophozoites (ring stage) to either mature trophozoites or gametocytes (CDC Malaria 2019). Mature trophozoites replicate, forming schizonts, disrupting erythrocyte cell membrane integrity, and leading to capillary endothelial adherence and cell lysis.

Free heme is released into the peripheral blood, which stimulates endothelial activation.P. vivax and P. ovale infections may display "dormant schizogony," where inactive intrahepatic parasites (hypnozoites) remain until reactivation months to years in the future.P. falciparum and P. malariae infection, there are few reports of resurgent P. falciparum infection years after initial exposure.

Pathogenesis stems from toxin-induced IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha secretion.

Low arginine, low nitric oxide, and elevated arginase activity have been observed in severe malaria in peripheral blood.

Parasitemia dictates symptom onset and severity: symptoms typically develop with 0.002% parasitemia in naïve patients and 0.2% parasitemia in previously exposed patients.
