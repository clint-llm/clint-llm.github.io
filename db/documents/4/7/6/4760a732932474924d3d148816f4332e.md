The term Retinal macroaneurysm was coined by Robertson.

The patient is usually asymptomatic, and a decline in visual acuity occurs due to macular edema, end-arteriole occlusion due to thrombosis, or hemorrhage caused by rupture of the aneurysm.

Identifying RAM is pivotal for proper management and requires a precise approach to control the underlying systemic condition. The diagnostic modalities for identification and management include FFA (fundus fluorescein angiography), ICG-A (indocyanine green angiography), OCT (optical coherence tomography), OCT-A (optical coherence tomography angiography), and USG (ultrasonogram) B scan (brightness scan). Procedures like laser photocoagulation, intravitreal Anti VEGF (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor) agents, YAG (yttrium-aluminum-garnet) hyaloidotomy, pneumatic displacement, and pars plana vitrectomy can be used to treat complicated RAMs.
