Bleomycin belongs to a subfamily of glycopeptide antibiotics and is utilized primarily as an antineoplastic agent. Glycopeptide antibiotics, a drug class that includes vancomycin, are derived from bacterial species and contain glycosylated peptide cores which are thought to contribute to their mechanism of action in disrupting cellular functions. Bleomycin is part of combination cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens, including ABVD ([adriamycin], doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) and BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, oncovin, procarbazine, prednisone).
