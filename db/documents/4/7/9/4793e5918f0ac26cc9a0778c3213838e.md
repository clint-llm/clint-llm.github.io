Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. Although significant advancements in early detection and treatments have reduced the overall mortality rate, not all racial groups have benefitted equally. Significant health disparities still exist, which leads to higher breast cancer mortality rates and poorer outcomes among certain groups of minority women. This activity reviews the issues regarding health disparities in breast cancer and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the health disparities that exist between certain racial/ethnic groups with breast cancer at every step along the breast cancer care continuum.
- Describe the multifactorial etiology of these health disparities.
- Explain biologic differences in tumor morphology that increase the racial gaps seen in breast cancer outcomes
