A thorough history and physical examination are required to diagnose milk-alkali syndrome. Elevated serum calcium levels are usually an incidental discovery. Arterial blood gas analysis reveals metabolic alkalosis. Serum albumin levels should be checked in all patients with hypercalcemia, and corrected calcium levels must be calculated in patients with hypoalbuminemia. Ionized calcium levels can also be considered. With hypercalcemia, the next step in diagnosis is measuring serum parathyroid hormone levels, which are low in patients with the milk-alkali syndrome.

Various other tests can be done to exclude other causes of hypercalcemia, particularly with low serum parathyroid hormone levels. For example, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine levels can be measured to eliminate hyperthyroidism as a cause of hypercalcemia, and serum protein or urine protein electrophoresis can help exclude multiple myeloma. In addition, normal serum parathyroid-related peptide levels can help exclude malignancy, and normal 1,25 hydroxyvitamin D levels decrease the likelihood of sarcoidosis, which are common causes of hypercalcemia.

Radiological investigations include chest X-rays, which can help exclude malignancy and sarcoidosis in the diagnostic evaluation of hypercalcemia. It may also be needed in patients with severe renal impairment. In hypercalcemic patients, QT interval shorteningÂ and ventricular arrhythmias may be seen on an electrocardiogram.
