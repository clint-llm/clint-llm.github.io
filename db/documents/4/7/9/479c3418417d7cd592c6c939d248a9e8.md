Rufinamide (1-[(2,6-difluorophenyl] methyl))-1hydro-1,2,3-triazole-4 carboxamide) has a tri-azole group within its structure, which has a structural resemblance to anti-fungal and fungicidal drugs; however, rufinamide has no structural similarity to any of the anti-seizure medications.

The exact mechanism of action of rufinamide is unknown. In vitro, it stabilizes the inactive state of the sodium channel, limiting the sustained bursts of high-frequency action potentials and preventing sodium channels from returning to an activated state, therefore decreasing the neuronal hyperexcitability and action potential propagation.
