Most patients present in their thirties and forties. While CCSST commonly appears in the legs or thighs as a small tender spot or swelling, some patients may present involvement of the subcutaneous tissue and adjacent dermis and may present with ulceration of the overlying skin.

Rare presentations of CCSST have also been documented in other sites, including the lumbar region, parapharyngeal tissue, penis, and neck.
