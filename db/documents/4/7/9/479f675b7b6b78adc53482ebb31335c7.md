The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American Society for Addiction Medicine recommend that all pregnant women be screened for drug use, including marijuana. Universal screening for substance use disorder should be accomplished with a validated questionnaire. Women, once identified with drug use, should be counseled further and referred for treatment. ACOG advises against recommending medical marijuana during preconception, pregnancy, and lactation.

Patient self-report and laboratory testing are used to assess maternal marijuana use. Urine testing is the most commonly used laboratory test and can be used for both recent and chronic use. In addition, cord blood or meconium testing can detect THC exposure from the second trimester onwards.

There are legal ramifications of positive drug testing. Every effort should be made to obtain informed consent from a patient before the testing. Health care providers must report to child protective services for newborns exposed to illicit substances, including marijuana, to concern child abuse and neglect. However, individual state requirements may vary widely, and hence all health care providers should be aware of their stateâ€™s legal requirements for reporting.

There are clear long-term effects of neonatal exposure.
