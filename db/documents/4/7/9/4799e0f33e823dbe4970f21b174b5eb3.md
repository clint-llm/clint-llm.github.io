Therapeutic serum concentrations of valproate usually range from 50 to 100 mg/L. valproic acid concentrations should be obtained at regular intervals (every 2 to 4 hours) until the serum valproate level starts declining. When there is a steady decline in the level, it suggests that a peak serum level has been reached. Patients with serum concentrations greater than 180 mg/dl have a central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction.

**Laboratory testing**— Routine laboratory evaluation of the poisoned patient should include the following:

A complete blood count (CBC) with differential - thrombocytopenia and decreased in granulocyte counts may be noted.

For women of childbearing age, pregnancy testing is indicated.

Random blood glucose levels are necessary to rule out hypoglycemia as the cause of altered mental status.

Serum AST and ALT levels can assess for hepatotoxicity.

Plasma ammonia levels are necessary for the patient with a risk of encephalopathy.

Serum electrolytes and arterial blood gas analysis may show hypernatremia, metabolic acidosis, and hypocalcemia.

Screening for other anticonvulsants, aspirin, and acetaminophen should be done as patients may frequently take these drugs with valproate.

**Electrocardiography**

12 lead EKG should be obtained, and it can show AV conduction block.

**Imaging Studies**

Head CT is necessary when the patient presents with signs of focal neurological deficits, profound CNS depression, and suspicion of cerebral edema.
