Patients should receive appropriate education about Jarisch Herxheimer reaction (JHR), including its transient and benign nature in most instances. However, the patient should be properly instructed to seek evaluation as soon as features of JHR such as fever and rash flares are seen, in case emergent measures, including fluid and inotropic support are needed. There should be proper discussions with the patient about any known drug allergies. High-risk patients, such as those suffering from neurosyphilis and pregnant females, should be advised to obtain treatment in an inpatient setting for timely management of potential adverse outcomes.
