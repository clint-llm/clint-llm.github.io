Opioids come in a number of forms and can be administered orally, rectally, topically (transdermal patches), intravenously,Â in the epidural space, and into the dura. The mode of administration and duration of action depends on the lipophilicity and hydrophilicity of the opioid. For example, codeine can be administered via oral, intramuscular, and rectal routes. In most adults, oral codeine absorbs rapidly and reaches a peak concentration within one hour.

Opioids are frequently misused. Most commonly, individuals misuse these agents in tablets or capsule dose forms. However, some abusers alter the route of administration, inhaling or injecting crushed tablets to achieve a heightened or more rapid psychoactive effect and attenuate the rewarding effect of the drug. For this reason, the Food and Drug Administration has approved abuse-deterrent formulations of opioid prescriptions to prevent the tablets from being crushed.
