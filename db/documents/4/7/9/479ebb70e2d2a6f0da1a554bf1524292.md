As mentioned earlier, many bacterial and viral pathogens can cause identical presentations to those infections caused by GAS. Each infection must be evaluated with the previously mentioned bacterial cultures and/or swabs to evaluate for GAS versus other bacterial or viral infections. Additionally, several non-infectious conditions can closely resemble GAS infections. Cellulitis, in particular, has a very similar presentation to both venous stasis changes and the same findings noted with an acute DVT, especially when symptoms are present in the lower extremities. Therefore, when evaluating a patient with lower extremity pain, redness, and/or swelling, it is essential to keep these conditions in mind. In many cases, venous stasis changes are found bilaterally, which is much less commonly found in cellulitis, which could point toward the appropriate diagnosis. Conversely, unilateral redness, swelling, and/or pain could represent either an acute deep vein thrombosis or cellulitis; therefore, ultrasonography is often needed to make the correct diagnosis.
