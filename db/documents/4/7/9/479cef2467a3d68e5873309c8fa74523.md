Earlier studies suggested that lacunar stroke has a better prognosis compared to other strokes. It has a high survival rate, a low recurrence rate, and a relatively good functional recovery. In general, lacunar infarcts have a relatively favorable prognosis.

However, recent studies showed that in the earlier stages of the disease, the prognosis of lacunar stroke appears to be benign. Still, long-term prognosis with lacunar stroke constitutes an increased risk of death, mainly from cardiovascular causes. The risk of stroke recurrence is similar to any other type of stroke. Patients with recurrent small vessel disease are at increased risk of developing cognitive decline and dementia.
