Preparation for the airway is paramount in the anesthetic management of hemifacial microsomia patients.

Reviewing of the difficult airway algorithm and discussions about plans and backup plans must be done prior to the case to maximize success and patient safety.

Nasal dilation equipment should be prepared with either serial nasopharyngeal airways as dilators or a red robin catheter placed on the end of the ET tube, then removed through the mouth. This author recommends a video laryngoscope for tube placement for two reasons; it allows a most consistent placement without using a McGill forceps which reduces the chances of puncturing the cuff balloon, and it allows the entire team and surgeons to visualize the tube placement. If severe retrognathia or neck deformities are present, consider an awake nasal fiberoptic intubation with adjunctive anesthesia and blocks (numbing the airway with inhaled 4% lidocaine, lidocaine-soaked gauze placed in the tonsillar pillars, trans-tracheal lidocaine, glossopharyngeal, and/or superior laryngeal nerve blocks.

The team and setup should anticipate and be ready to handle a difficult airway up to and including a cannot intubate cannot ventilate situation with surgical instrumentation laid out and a surgeon scrubbed in ready to assist.

Other preparation includes a standard operating room set up with machine checks, ventilation equipment, airway equipment including backups, and all drugs and emergency drugs available.

Preparation for the intra-op portion should include a workup as dictated by the institution and preference, but likely include a basic metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and possibly a coagulation panel. Depending on the surgery, estimated blood loss, and time, a type and screen or type and cross should be considered.

Another paramount consideration is what will be done after the case regarding extubation or leaving the patient intubated.

Finally, the anesthesia team must discuss with the surgical team whether the patient will be wired shut into maxillomandibular fixation at the end of the case. Though this is less common currently due to the advancement of bone hardware and bony fixation techniques, it is still possible and sometimes is necessitated by unpredictable surgical outcomes; therefore, it may become necessary during a case.
