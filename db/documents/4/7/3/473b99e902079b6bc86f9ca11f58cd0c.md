Aortic valve repair is performed because severe aortic valvular disease uncorrected mortality rates are dismal. Half of the patients presenting with aortic stenosis may be dead within two years. Surgical and non-surgical catheter-based approaches are utilized for aortic valve repair. Main repair indications for both stenosis and insufficiency include severe symptomatic disease and severe asymptomatic disease if the patient's ejection fraction is less than 50% or if the patient has a concomitant indication for cardiac surgery. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of aortic valve disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures relevant to bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement.
- Describe the standard operative technique for performing a safe, durable bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement.
- Summarize potential complications of bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement. 
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance identify indications for bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement and improve outcomes.
