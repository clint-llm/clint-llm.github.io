**Tuning Fork Test**

The tuning fork test shows a negative Rinne test. Webers test is lateralized to the ear with severe conductive loss.

**Audiometry and Tympanometry**

Pure tone audiometry shows lower frequency loss of air conduction. However, bone conduction is normal. A bone conduction dip in thresholds of 20-30 dB and more pronounced at 2000 Hz is called Carhart notch. After stapedectomy, Carhart notch disappears. A Carhart notch may also be present in cases of incus or malleus fixation and incudostapedial joint detachment.

**High-Resolution Computed Tomography (CT)**

High-resolution computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bones is the standard choice to diagnose otosclerosis.
