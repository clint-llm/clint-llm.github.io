In general, the workup for a supraclavicular fossa cystic mass should involve imaging with ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) to determine the vascularity of the lesion. If the lesion is not vascular, a fine needle aspiration (FNA) is generally the recommendation, after which the quality of the fluid and cytology will inform the next best steps in surgical approach.
