Frotteurism and frotteuristic disorder is frequently under-diagnosed and rarely self-reported, leading to a low level of evidence available. Additionally, these may present with various alternative presentations such as anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, etc. as noted above. The physician needs to be prudent about identifying these rarely reported symptoms. Since the first contact of many individuals with mental health presentations can be primary care physicians, therapists, nurses, or social workers, making these clinicians aware of the triggering complaints is important. Any questionable or confusing symptomatology must be referred to the specialist physician, i.e., a psychiatrist.

The psychiatrist should be well versed and knowledgeable with appropriate medical interventions to improve outcomes and decrease recidivism on the whole. A forensic psychiatrist (a physician trained in psychiatry and sub-specializes in medico-legal aspects of mental health) may see these individuals more than the regular psychiatrist. Thus, a forensic psychiatrist is in a unique position to evaluate, diagnose, and manage the treatment of individuals with frotteuristic disorder, thus improving outcomes for them by hopefully reducing future sexual offenses.
