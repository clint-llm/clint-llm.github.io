Successful outcomes when performing procedures such as dental implant placement, soft tissue grafting, bone harvesting, and grafting are dependent on the clinician's knowledge and familiarity with the basic suturing materials and techniques discussed in this paper. Post-surgical complications and infections have dramatically reduced with the innovations in suturing materials. Our responsibility as clinicians is to remain knowledgeable regarding suture innovation to continue providing the highest quality of care.
