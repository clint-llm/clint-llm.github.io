IVUS catheters transmit an image to a dedicated console for image analysis.  Ancillary catheterization laboratory staff can prepare the IVUS catheter.  An interventional cardiologist or vascular surgeon manipulates the catheter inside of the body. Online assessment can be performed to characterize plaque morphology and assess minimal lumen area (MLA), determine plaque burden, and identify segments of normal artery.
