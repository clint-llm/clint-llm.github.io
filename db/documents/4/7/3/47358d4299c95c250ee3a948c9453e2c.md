A detailed and schematic approach is required in the evaluation of a newborn with head lag. This approach starts with a comprehensive clinical examination and history. Isolated infant head lag before 3 to 4 months, in the absence of other features of hypotonia or syndromic face, can be observed with little concern for further investigations. However, persistent head lag or severe head lag with or without other generalized hypotonia features needs to be worked extensively.

A study in Israel found that a simple clinical test, a "feeding test,” could differentiate physiological from pathological infant head lag. In that study, healthy newborns were fed with a follow-up post-prandial reassessment of their head lag. Fifteen minutes after feeding, about 92% showed improvement or complete disappearance of head lag with a rise in serum glucose, and the remaining infants with persistent head lag were later diagnosed with pathological causes (Soto syndrome, hypothyroidism, and cerebral palsy).

Investigations to consider based on the suspected differential diagnosis for pathological head lag include TSH, free T4, electrolytes (including calcium), septic screen, and more specific tests like CT/MRI head/neck, EEG, karyotype, urine and serum amino acids, urine organic acids, blood gas, serum ammonia, liver function tests, aldolase, creatine kinase and appropriate referral to a neurologist.
