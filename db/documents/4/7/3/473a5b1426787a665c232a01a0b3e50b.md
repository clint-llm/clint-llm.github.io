The incidence of C2 fractures increased 135% from 2000 to 2011 in the Medicare population. C2 fractures are associated with a 20% and 40% increased risk of mortality within 3 months and 2 years, respectively. The majority of C2 fracture types are type-II dens fractures. This is troublesome because these have a pseudoarthrosis (non-union) rate that exceeds 50%.
