Either inhibition or stimulation can treat several different diseases and disorders of muscarinic receptors in the affected area. Identifying muscarinic receptors involved in specific pathologies can allow for the development of antagonists and agonists to help decrease symptoms.Â In asthma and some COPD cases, a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) is used to upregulate sympathetic control in the airways and decrease constriction. Several add-on treatments for asthma have come onto the market throughout the years, and several of these include muscarinic receptor antagonists, also known as long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs). One of the most recently developed LAMA is tiotropium, which acts on M3 receptors. Tiotropium inhibits smooth muscle cells of the airways and submucosal glands to decrease airway constriction and mucus secretion.

Muscarinic antagonists are frequently used in the treatment of overactive bladder. Antagonists work to reduce the spastic contraction of the detrusor muscle.

One of the most clinically relevant muscarinic antagonists is atropine. It is an anticholinergic drug that utilizes competitive inhibition to block acetylcholine from binding to muscarinic receptors. In the SA node of the heart, atropine works to block acetylcholine from binding to M2 receptors, which helps downregulate the parasympathetic response and upregulate the sympathetic response in the SA node to increase heart rate and cardiac contractility.
