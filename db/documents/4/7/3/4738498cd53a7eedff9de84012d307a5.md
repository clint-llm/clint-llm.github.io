VUR leads to high-pressure sterile urine reflux which stunts the normal growth of the kidneys and is often exacerbated by recurrent childhood infections. Not all urinary tract infections with VUR lead to RN because of the architecture of the renal pyramids. Renal pyramids are of two types, simple and compound. Compound pyramids promote intrarenal reflux combined with VUR which leads to RN, given transmission of high-pressure urine and infection to gain access to the renal parenchyma.

VUR ultimately results in chronic interstitial nephritis, tubular atrophy, and renal scarring along with glomerular hypertrophy and secondary FSGS.
