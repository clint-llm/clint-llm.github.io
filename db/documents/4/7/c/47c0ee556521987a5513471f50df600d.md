Gliomas were previously regarded to be benign hamartomas with limited growth. However, we now know that the rate of growth is variable with a rare occurrence of malignant change. Furthermore, the tumors have a tendency to invade the leptomeninges. Therefore, gliomas are now regarded as true neoplasms with the ability to invade locally. Gliomas arise from astrocytes of the optic nerve and visual pathway. These proliferating astrocytes extend through the pia mater and into the arachnoid and subarachnoid space, where fibrovascular and meningeal cell proliferation, which is reactive, may occur. This has been termed arachnoidal hyperplasia. When exuberant, there will be an appearance of tumor growth. Tumor enlargement is caused by proliferation of the neoplastic cells by the reactive arachnoidal cell proliferation or by the accumulation of mucosubstance, which is secreted by astrocytes and is PAS-positive.

- Usually, WHO grade I pilocytic astrocytoma with immature astrocytes

- Tumor cells have spindle-shaped nuclei and appear pilocytic or hair-like

- Biphasic pattern with varying proportions of piloid areas alternating with spongy areas

- Intracytoplasmic Rosenthal fibers and eosinophilic granular bodies

- Microcystic areas

- Focal calcification may also be seen

- Rosenthal fibers (tapered corkscrew-shaped, brightly eosinophilic, hyaline masses
