In summation, the benefits of US guidance for vascular access are seen in both adult and pediatric patients. A primary benefit is to increase success rate, which has been shown multiple times in both pre-identified subgroups of difficult patients and non-selected outpatients. With this success rate, the use of ultrasound for vascular access has been shown to decrease the need for central line placement. US guidance leads to an increased rate of first attempt success, a faster time to IV access, and higher patient satisfaction.
