Essential or idiopathic glossopharyngeal neuralgia is where etiology is unknown.

Secondary causes of glossopharyngeal neuralgia include:

- Vascular compression, mainly at the nerve root: the most common cause

- Demyelinating diseases: e.g., multiple sclerosis

- Inflammatory and autoimmune diseases: e.g., Sjogren disease

- Intraoral and peritonsillar infections

- Intracranial space-occupying lesions, especially medullary tumors or tumors originating from CP angle

- Posterior fossa and cervical malformations

- Eagle syndrome or stylalgia: If the styloid process is over 25mm or the stylohyoid ligament is calcified, they can cause compression of the glossopharyngeal nerve

- Oropharyngeal cancers include carcinoma of the tongue and benign tumors like schwannomas
