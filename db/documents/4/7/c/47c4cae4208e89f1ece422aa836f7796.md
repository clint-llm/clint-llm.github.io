Patients with advanced-stage CKD must be followed closely by nephrologists in the outpatient setting. The eGFR should be monitored at regular intervals, so dialysis can be initiated before uremic encephalopathy develops. To avoid malnutrition in end-stage renal disease, patients should maintain sufficient protein intake (1.2 g/kg/day) and initiate renal replacement therapy (despite the presence of encephalopathy).
