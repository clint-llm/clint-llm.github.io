The prognosis of thyroid cancerÂ varies greatly, depending on its type, tumor size, the extent of metastasis, patient's age, and amenability to resection. The prognosis is generally good, with up to 95% 5-year survival rate for patients of all ages and races. Poor prognostic factors include large tumor size, the presence of extra-thyroidal extensions or metastases, older age, or unfavorable tumor types such as undifferentiated cancer.
