Chronic bronchitis is thought to be caused by overproduction and hypersecretion of mucus by goblet cells. Epithelial cells lining the airway respond to toxic, infectious stimuli by releasing inflammatory mediators such as interleukin 8, colony-stimulating factor, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. There is also an associated decrease in the release of regulatory substances such as angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase. The alveolar epithelium is both the target as well as the initiator of the inflammatory process in chronic bronchitis. During an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, the bronchial mucous membrane becomes hyperemic and edematous with diminished bronchial mucociliary function. This, in turn, leads to airflow impediment because of luminal obstruction to small airways. The airways become clogged by debris, and this further increases the irritation. The characteristic cough of bronchitis is caused by the copious secretion of mucus in chronic bronchitis.
