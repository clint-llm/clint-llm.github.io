Tacrolimus can administration can be by oral, sublingual, topical, or intravenous (IV) route. Oral tacrolimus is available in immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (ER: XR and XL) formulations. The various formulations have different pharmacokinetic parameters and are not interchangeable. Doses should be titrated to target trough concentrations.

**Prevention of Post-Organ Transplant Rejection (Adult Dosing)**

**Liver Transplant:**

- Oral
- IR: Initially 0.1 to 0.15 mg/kg/day in two divided doses in combination
- ER: 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg once daily in combination with corticosteroid. Please note that the XL formulation is not approved for liver transplants in the US due to increased mortality in female liver transplants receiving the XL formulation.

- IV: Initially 0.03 to 0.05 mg/kg/day as a continuous infusion

**Heart Transplant:**In combination with an antimetabolite

- Oral: IR: Initially 0.075 mg/kg/day in two divided doses, given every 12 hours

- IV:  Initially 0.01 mg/kg/day as a continuous infusion

**Kidney Transplant:**Use in combination with an antimetabolite agent

- Oral:

- IR: Initially, 0.2 mg/kg/day in combination with azathioprine or 0.1 mg/kg/day combined with mycophenolate mofetil.
- ER:

- XL: 0.15 to 0.2 mg/kg/day with basiliximab induction; 0.2mg/kg/day without basiliximab induction.
- XR:  Initially 0.14 mg/kg/day

- IV: 0.03 to 0.05 mg/kg/day as a continuous infusion

IV tacrolimus use is not common due to increased nephrotoxic adverse effects.

Tacrolimus can be administered with or without food but may occur with food in the presence of GI intolerance. IR doses should be 12 hours apart. Dose rounding should be to a whole number that is feasible with the available strengths. For example, IR tacrolimus comes in 0.5 mg, 1mg, and 5 mg strengths.

When converting from IR to ER formulations, utilize the following factors

- IR to XL: 1 to 1

- IR to XR: 1 to 0.8

Sublingual to oral conversion rates have varied from 1 to 1 to 1 to 3, but 1 to 2 has recently been the most commonly suggested in studies. There has been no optimally established dosing.
