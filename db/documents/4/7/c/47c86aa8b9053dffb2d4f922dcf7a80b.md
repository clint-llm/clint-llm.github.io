The understanding of the pathophysiology of endometriosis remains incomplete in many aspects, and there is not a coherent suggested theory to explain all different types of endometriosis, integrating the epigenetic, genetic, immunological, and environmental data. From the proposed pathogenic theories, the most plausible is Sampsonâ€™s theory, suggesting that with retrograde menstruation, viable cells and menstrual fragments can migrate through the Fallopian tubes, infiltrate into the peritoneal cavity, and then proliferate and cause chronic inflammation.
