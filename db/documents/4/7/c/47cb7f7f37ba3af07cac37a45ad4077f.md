**Post Biopsy Considerations**

Patient factors: The patient is usually kept in the right decubitus position. The duration of observation varies across centers ranging from 1 hour to 6 hours. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines recommends observation for 2 to 4 hours. The vital signs are monitored every 15 minutes for the first hour, every 30 minutes for the next hour and hourly till discharge. Most complications of liver biopsy usually occur within the first 1 to 3 hours after biopsy or within 24 hours. Hence the patient should have a dependent individual to stay overnight after the procedure. The patient should be hospitalized if there are any complications associated with the procedure, including pain that requires more than one dose of analgesia within the first 4 hours of observation following the procedure.

Adequacy of specimen:  Liver diseases can be patchy; therefore, biopsy specimens may not be representative of the underlying pathology. It is important that the liver biopsy specimen be adequate to allow detailed interpretation. This means that the biopsy should be big enough to view a representative amount of parenchyma and number of portal tracts. The number of portal tracts is proportional to biopsy size. Obtaining more than one core increases the diagnostic yield, but at the cost of increased complications. Biopsies taken with a 16-gauge needle result in larger specimen sizes. Most experts agree that a specimen with 11 portal tracts and about 3 cm long is adequate for evaluation. If an adequate specimen is not obtained after two passes, an alternative approach should be considered. Thus, long and wide (ideal size is 3 cm long after formalin fixation obtained with a 16-gauge needle) biopsies are desirable. A cutting needle is preferable to a suction needle if the physician suspects cirrhosis.

Although several noninvasive markers are now available, histological evaluation of the liver will continue to remain an important tool in assessing disease. It is a safe procedure in the hands of skilled operators with relatively few complications.
