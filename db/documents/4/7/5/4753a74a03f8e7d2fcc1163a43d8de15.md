The four most commonly prescribed MAOIs are selegiline, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, and tranylcypromine. Their administration is discussed below:

Selegiline’s now preferred method of administration is through a transdermal patch. The drug’s extensive “first pass” metabolism through the liver results in a low bioavailability when taken orally; this necessitates the administration of a relatively large oral dose which predisposes patients for the “cheese reaction” side effect of MAOIs (discussed later) through the inhibition of MAO-A in the intestines. The transdermal patch avoids the “first pass” metabolism, eliminating the need for a large bolus dose and decreasing the chances of developing the “cheese reaction” side effect.

As with other antidepressants, MAOIs require few weeks; usually, 4 weeks, before a clinically apparent response. Also, certain considerations are necessary when switching antidepressants to and from MAOIs. The current antidepressant dose should be tapered off over 2 to 4 weeks then completely discontinued before switching to another antidepressant. Next, two weeks should elapse from the last dose of antidepressant and the first dose of an MAOI. A five-week gap should be allowed for fluoxetine, especially due to its relatively long half-life.
