The prognosis of duodenal ulcers is variable depending on the severity of the initial presentation. Duodenal ulcers primarily caused by NSAID use are addressable through discontinuation of the drug and therapy for symptoms with high rates of resolution. Individuals who have developed ulcers due to H. pylori infection will require treatment of the infection, and rates of resolution will vary based on the eradication of infection. Patients who present with severe ulceration or perforation will have higher mortality rates and will be at risk for complications associated with surgical intervention.
