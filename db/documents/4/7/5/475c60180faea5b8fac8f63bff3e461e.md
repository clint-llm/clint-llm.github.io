Central pontine myelinolysis is a rare neurologic condition most frequently caused by the rapid correction of hyponatremia. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of central pontine myelinolysis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the conditions that can cause central pontine myelinolysis such as alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, liver transplant, or severe burns. 
- Outline the pathophysiology and clinical finding of central pontine myelinolysis including the damage to the descending motor tracts, the biphasic course, initially with seizures or deteriorating mental status.
- Explain the prevention of central pontine myelinolysis by adjusting the rate at which sodium should be corrected. The current recommendations are a range from 8-12 mEq/L per 24 hours. 
- Describe how the interprofessional team can work together to prevent and treat central pontine myelinolysis to improve outcomes.
