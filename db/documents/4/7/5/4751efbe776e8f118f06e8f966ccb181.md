Rhinocerebral mucormycosis, also called zygomycosis, is a rare disease caused by filamentous fungi involving the nose, paranasal sinuses, and brain. It is an opportunistic pathogen commonly found in immunocompromised individuals. Because of its involvement with already immunocompromised patients, the fungus grows rapidly and aggressively, causing a well-defined fulminant and life-threatening disease. Early intervention is a must to save lives and prevent permanent neurological complications. It is an acute fungal infection in most cases, but chronic presentations have also been described, which is indolent and slowly progressive, occurring over several weeks.

Commonly associated diseases include diabetic ketoacidosis, severe burns, steroid therapy, solid organ transplantation, prolonged corticosteroid therapy, hemochromatosis, patients with HIV, neutropenia, malnutrition, hematologic malignancies, etc.
