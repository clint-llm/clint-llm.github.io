LPS is a potent endotoxin that binds to cell surface receptors such as TLR4/CD14/MD2 that induces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide, and eicosanoids. The presence of LPS in the blood or interstitial fluid can lead to endotoxemia through Lipid A moiety, which can cause septic shock under exaggerated immune response. Septic shock includes tachycardia, tachypnea, temperature modulations, and coagulation cascade activation, leading to arterial and venous dilation.Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia complex bacteria, Helicobacter pylori, and Salmonella enterica can adapt through LPS structure-function changes to develop a chronic infection in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract.

Recently, research has demonstrated that LPS induces membrane lipid disturbances, which affect cholesterol interacting proteins, lipoprotein metabolism, and membrane apo E/amyloid-beta interactions. These alterations predispose to hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
