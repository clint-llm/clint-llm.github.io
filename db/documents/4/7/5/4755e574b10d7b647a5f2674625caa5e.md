The essential function of the BBB is the maintenance of brain homeostasis. This is achieved via tightly regulated ion and solute transport between the intravascular plasma and the CNS through molecular exchange pathways that transport molecules from the blood to the brain and vice-versa. However, not all molecules require transport mechanisms across the BBB. Gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen, and lipophilic molecules with a molecular weight under 400 Da can freely diffuse across the BBB. While astrocytes play a significant role in stabilizing and maintaining BBB integrity, the capillary ECs and pericytes contain the most critical BBB transport mechanisms and pathways.
