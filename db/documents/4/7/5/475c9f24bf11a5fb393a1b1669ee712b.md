Catecholamines are compounds that function as neurotransmitters and hormones in various physiological processes. The class of endogenous catecholamines includes dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. These molecules have key roles in mediating the sympathetic nervous response and several neurologic pathways. Additionally, excess or deficient amounts of free catecholamines are associated with several psychiatric and medical conditions. Therefore, the mechanism of catecholamine degradation, and conditions that result in such dysfunction of that system, are of interest in the study of medicine. This article provides an overview of catecholamine degradation mechanisms as well as their clinical correlations.
