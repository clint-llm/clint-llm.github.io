Absolute contraindications to this procedure include:

- bleeding diathesis where bleeding would be catastrophic

- infection at the site

- patient refusal

Relative contraindications include:

- locations on the face or highly visible locations as there is a risk of hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation at the ablation site.

- Alopecia may also occur at the cryoablation site, which can be a concern for the eyebrow during supraorbital lesions.

- Postprocedural pain and damage to adjacent structures can occur

- Skin frostbite can occur if the lesion is too superficial.

- There are reports of moderate to severe neuralgia for intercostal cryoanalgesia for thoracotomy, making this a relative contraindication.

In the case of pneumothorax, patients should be placed on 100% oxygen to de-nitrogenate the pneumothorax (if nitrogen was used as the expansion gas).
