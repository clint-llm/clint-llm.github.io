Brachioplasty is also referred to as an 'upper arm lift procedure.' Nearly 20,000 upper arm lifts were performed in 2019, an increase of 20% from 2015.

Other patient groups that may request brachioplasty include patients presenting following pregnancy and aging (senile) brachial laxity. Excess skin and ptosis can result in functional problems such as intertrigo, poor hygiene, infections, and psychosocial morbidity.

Brachioplasty entails the excision of excess skin and lipodystrophy of the upper arm, which can extend onto the lateral chest wall. Patient assessment and classification of the degree of skin and subcutaneous fat excess are crucial to identify the most appropriate procedure for each patient. This is because alternatives to brachioplasty can include liposuction and liposuction combined with brachioplasty; additionally, there are variations of brachioplasty depending on the scar length and placement. Several classification systems exist, which can guide the surgeon in selecting the most appropriate procedure.
