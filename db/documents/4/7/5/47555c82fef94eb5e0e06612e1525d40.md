Atracurium is indicated as an addition to general anesthesia to facilitate endotracheal intubation and provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. Atracurium is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug of the benzylisoquinolinium class. It competes with acetylcholine for binding sites. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, safe administration, adverse effects, contraindications, toxicology, and monitoring of atracurium.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for using atracurium.
- Identify potential contraindications to atracurium use.
- Outline the appropriate monitoring of atracurium.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance appropriate clinical outcomes with atracurium leading to optimal patient outcomes.
