Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are important outer membrane components of gram-negative bacteria. They are large amphipathic glycoconjugates that typically consist of a lipid domain (hydrophobic) attached to a core oligosaccharide and a distal polysaccharide. These molecules are also known as lipogylcans due to the presence of lipid and sugar molecules. The lipopolysaccharides are composed of:

- Lipid A: the hydrophobic domain, which is an endotoxin and the main virulence factor

- O-antigen, the repeating hydrophilic distal oligosaccharide

- The hydrophilic core polysaccharide

The lipid A component varies from one organism to another and is essential in imparting specific pathogenic attributes to the bacteria.
