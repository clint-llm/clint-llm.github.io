Tests used in the evaluation of patients with HF include:

- Electrocardiogram (ECG): Important for identifying evidence of acute or prior myocardial infarction or acute ischemia, rhythm abnormalities, such as atrial fibrillation.

- Chest x-ray: Characteristic findings are cardiac-to-thoracic width ratio above 50%, cephalization of the pulmonary vessels, Kerley B-lines, and pleural effusions.

- Blood test: Cardiac troponin (T or I), complete blood count, serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function test, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). BNP (or NT-proBNP) level adds greater diagnostic value to the history and physical examination than other initial tests mentioned above.

- Transthoracic echocardiogram: To determine ventricular function and hemodynamics.
