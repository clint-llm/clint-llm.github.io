Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) is a crystal deposition arthropathy involving the synovial and periarticular tissues. Its clinical presentation may range from being asymptomatic to acute or chronic inflammatory arthritis. Chronic CPP deposition arthritis informally referred to as pseudo-rheumatoid arthritis may present with a waxing and waning clinical course that may last for several months and resemble rheumatoid arthritis involving the wrists and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. The crystals involved in calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease are composed of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate and commonly affect larger and weight-bearing joints, including the hips, knees, or shoulders. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease.
- Summarize the diagnostic approach for a patient presenting with potential calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease.
- Review the therapeutic options available for the management and treatment of calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease.
