The most frequent cause of onychomycosis is Trichophyton rubrum, but other dermatophytes, including Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton floccosum, can be caused as well. The dermatophytes are identified in 90% of the toenail and 50% of fingernail onychomycosis. Candida albicans accounts for 2% of onychomycosis, occurring especially in fingernails. Nondermatophytic mold onychomycosis is primarily cultured from toenails. Examples of these saprophytic molds include Fusarium, Aspergillus, Acremonium, Scytalidium, and Scopulariopsis brevicaulis. They account for about 8% of nail infections.
