Screening aims to reduce prostate cancer-specific morbidity and mortality by early detection of localized, high-risk cancers that can be successfully treated. Screening has been shown to potentially reduce the chance of dying from prostate cancer in some men.

Studies from randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that in men aged 55Â to 69, PSA-based screening can prevent one prostate cancer-related death for over ten years per 1,000 men screened.

Other studies have refuted these findings. They show persistent reductions of about 50% in prostate cancer-specific mortality from PSA-screened groups followed for ten years or more compared to identical but unscreened populations.

While the controversy continues, virtually all medical professional societies and organizations recommend prostate cancer screening or, at a minimum, discussing such screenings with men of suitable age and life expectancy. They also recommend shared decision-making with patients at each critical management point in the screening process.
