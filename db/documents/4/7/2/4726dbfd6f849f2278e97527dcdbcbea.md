The aortopulmonary septum forms at nine weeks during embryonic life.

The physiology of AP window resembles that of a large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) or ventricular septal defect (VSD), and the degree of shunting is dependent on the size of the defect and the ratio of systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances. Postnatally, once the pulmonary vascular resistance falls, there is increased pulmonary blood flow and early onset of pulmonary over circulation. Chronic volume overload may cause pulmonary vascular changes early; hence it is imperative that these lesions are recognized early and treated early in life. Moreover, aortic arch obstruction, when present, further increases the left to right shunt. In this case, ductal closure will further decrease perfusion to the lower body and increase pulmonary overcirculation.
