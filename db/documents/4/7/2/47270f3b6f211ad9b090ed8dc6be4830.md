Interprofessional rounds in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting allow for scheduled discussions among various healthcare providers to review and discuss clinical information and develop concise care plans for critically ill patients. Rounding as a unit allows for each discipline of the healthcare team to address their goals, issues, and concerns. In addition, they give specialized input to the daily care plan. This specialty-specific input may not be readily apparent to another specialty. The primary value of this design for team-focused rounding allows for efficient and transparent lines of direct communication between team members. Consequently, this reduces the negative impact of delays or misunderstandings in communication. Communication failure among health care providers is one of the most frequently cited causes of preventable harm to patients.
