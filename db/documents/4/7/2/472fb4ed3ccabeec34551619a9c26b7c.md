Considering that most cases of mycoplasma infections involve a single organ infection with few systemic symptoms, the overall prognosis is favorable with full recovery following treatment; however, re-infection may occur shortly after the completion of therapy. In rare instances, there have been fulminant or fatal cases of Mycoplasma pneumoniae often related to complications or severe systemic involvement leading to multi-organ failure. Fulminant cases of M. pneumoniae may account forÂ 0.5 to 0.2% of all cases.
