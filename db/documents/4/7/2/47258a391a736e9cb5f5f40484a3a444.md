If suspected clinically, the diagnosis of Bloom syndrome is confirmed by cytogenetic analysis showing increased numbers of sister chromatid exchanges or quadriradial configurations in lymphocytes or fibroblasts. The targeted mutational analysis may also be performed. Genetic and prenatal testing is recommended for high-risk carrier populations.

Laboratory studies include a complete blood count with differential showing low normal lymphocytes. These patients often have higher effector memory T cells but reduced memory B cells. Plasma serum IgM, IgA, and occasionally, IgG levels are decreased.
