It is important for a provider to inform the patient about the symptoms that he may suffer from if he is diagnosed with the disorder. If a patient is not aware of these symptoms it is probable that he would fear his condition more and would tend to get frequent attacks. Pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy should be discussed with the patients so that they can understand the treatment options for the condition that they have.
