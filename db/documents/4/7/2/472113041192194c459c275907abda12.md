There are no recognized treatment options for pseudopapilledema caused by ODD. A case series described six patients with severe visual field loss who underwent radial optic neurotomy and found improvement or stabilization of visual function.

There is no treatment necessary for pseudopapilledema if it is related to a congenital variant. If the pseudopapilledema appearance is due to a peripapillary tumor, the direction of treatment should be at the tumor as appropriate. In the case of vitreopapillary traction, the traction may spontaneously resolve with the completion of the posterior vitreous detachment, or if symptomatic, pars plana vitrectomy could be a therapeutic consideration.
