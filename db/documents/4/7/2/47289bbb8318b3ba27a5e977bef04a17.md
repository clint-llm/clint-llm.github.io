Antidepressants are frequently associated with overdose, given their use in patients with underlying depression. However, intentional misuse of bupropion has also been reported, given its similar structure to amphetamines and synthetic cathinones, including misuse via insufflation.

The American Association of Poison Control Centers reported 16,926 bupropion overdoses in 2020. Only about half of these exposures (8,668) were single exposures, including eight fatalities.
