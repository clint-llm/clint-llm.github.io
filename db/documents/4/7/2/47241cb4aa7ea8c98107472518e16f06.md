Most patients with LHON will develop optic atrophy at the end of one year. Whatever visual recovery has to occur it will occur before this period and is usually minimal. These patients suffer from marked visual impairment in their productive years of life that is irreversible.

The extent of final visual recovery depends greatly on the patient's mutational status, with G11778A carrying the worst overall prognosis (table 2). There is also some evidence that patients with the T14484C mutation are more likely to show improvement if the visual loss occurs before the age of 20.
