Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) is an invasive diagnostic procedure. It helps to assess the anatomy, physiology, and pathology of retinal and choroidal circulation. It aids in the diagnosis of various ocular pathologies. It contributes to decision-making when planning the management of ocular pathology. It is also useful as a teaching tool. Although it is a safe procedure, there are adverse effects associated with it. This activity outlines the basic principles, techniques, and interpretation of FFA. It also describes the adverse effects associated with the diagnostic procedure and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing the adverse events and improving care for patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the underlying anatomy and physiology pertinent to fundus fluorescein angiography.
- Review the equipment, personnel, preparation, technique, and potential complications of fundus fluorescein angiography.
- Describe the characteristics of various diseases on fundus fluorescein angiography.
- Explain the importance of the interprofessional team for monitoring and managing a patient during fundus fluorescein angiography.
