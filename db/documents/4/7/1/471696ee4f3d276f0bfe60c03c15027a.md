The most commonly used staging system for the majority of small bowel cancers is the TNM staging system. Adenocarcinoma, in particular, includes a prognostic stage grouping that is utilized as a part of the staging process. Small bowel lymphoma is further staged using the Ann Arbor staging system, which considers the number of tumor sites and locations.

AJCC has defined the lymph node involvement classification in the small bowel cancers as follows; N0 (without evidence of regional lymph node metastasis), N1 ( involvement of 1 to 2 regional lymph nodes), and N2: involvement of equal or greater than 3 lymph nodes. Moreover, in the presence of distant organ involvement with the metastatic disease in the small bowel, adenocarcinoma would be classified as M1. Accordingly, limited tumoral involvement with stage I or II of the small intestine adenocarcinoma is attributed to any size of tumoral presence without evidence of nodal or metastatic involvement (any T, N0, M0). Stage III and stage IV  of intestinal adenocarcinoma refers to the locoregional disease without metastatic involvement and distant metastatic disease, respectively.
