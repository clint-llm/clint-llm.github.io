Leuprolide acetate is a GnRH receptor agonist, also called a GnRH analog. Initially, the administration of leuprolide causes stimulation of pituitary gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which leads to an increase in steroidogenesis in ovaries and testes; thus resulting in increasedÂ estrogen in females and increased testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males.
