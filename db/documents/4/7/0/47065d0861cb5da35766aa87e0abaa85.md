Complications following above-the-knee amputation include muscle atrophy, surgical site wound infections, dehiscence, and wounds from prosthetic wear. One can minimize the complications from skin breakdown when they are caught early by checking the skin daily, especially in patients who have an insensate stump. Additionally, certain pre-operative measures may be used to predict a patient's ability to heal an amputation. Albumin over 3.0g/dL, total lymphocyte count greater than 1500/mm^3,Â and ankle-brachial index greater than 0.45 have been shown to improve wound healing.

Abduction and flexion contractures may also occur as a complication. One study found that 4 of 8 patients who did not have their iliotibial band fixed to the femur to avoid developing an abduction contracture ended up developing a hip flexion contracture; this is believed to have occurred because the gluteus maximus, a hip extensor, inserts in part onto the iliotibial band.
