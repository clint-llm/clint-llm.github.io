As stated earlier, the barium esophagram is a quickly performed, readily available study that is useful in the diagnosis and surveillance of a vast range esophageal diseases. In many cases, it is the first and only imaging study that needs to be performed. Additionally, the study may be used to plan surgical intervention by localizing lesions seen in other modalities, such as on endoscopy. The following list of esophageal pathologies (categorized roughly by type) that may benefit from esophagram in workup is not fully inclusive, but it serves to highlight the diversity of clinical situations where it may play some role.

**Structural**

- Esophageal diverticula (Zenker's, mid-esophageal, and epiphrenic)

- Strictures

- Ulcerations

- Hiatal hernia

**Neoplastic, Benign**

- Fibrovascular polyps

- Lipomas

- Leiomyomas

**Neoplastic, Malignant**

- Adenocarcinoma

- Small cell carcinoma

- Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (potentially)

- Leiomyosarcoma

**Mobility**

- Achalasia

- Hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter

- Diffuse esophageal spasm

- Ineffective esophageal motility/hypotensive peristalsis

**Traumatic**

- Iatrogenic injury - endoscopy, laryngoscopy

- Perforation - blunt/penetrating trauma

- Perforation - effort (Boerhaave's Syndrome)

- Post-caustic injury stricture

**Pediatric**

- Esophageal atresia/stricture

- Tracheoesophageal fistula

It is important to note that, regardless of the appearance of a lesion discovered on esophagram, all masses, strictures, and complaints of dysphagia require consideration of endoscopy for a complete workup.
