Montelukast and zafirlukast are cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists.

Montelukast monotherapy is not recommended for first-line therapy for allergic rhinitis.

Parents of asthmatic children prefer montelukast because the once-a-day oral dosage is more convenient than inhaler use. It also avoids the clinical concerns regarding the side effects of long-term use of corticosteroids, such as growth retardation and metabolic abnormalities.

Zafirlukast indications include the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in children five years and older and adults. It is used off-label for allergic rhinitis and the prophylaxis of exercise-induced bronchospasm.

The first-line therapy for the prophylaxis of exercise-induced bronchospasm is inhaled short-acting beta-agonist such as albuterol. Daily use of inhaled corticosteroid or leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast and zafirlukast, is recommended in patients with exercise-induced bronchospasm who inhaled preventative short-acting beta-agonist but continue to have symptoms or who develop tolerance to continued usage of short-acting beta-agonist.

Both montelukast and zafirlukast have no role as rescue medication during an acute asthmatic attack.
