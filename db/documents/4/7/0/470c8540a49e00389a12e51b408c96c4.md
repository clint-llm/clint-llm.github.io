A mild to moderate overdose of felodipine can result in hypotension secondary to peripheral vasodilation and reflex tachycardia. However, a severe overdose of felodipine can cause life-threatening profound hypotension and bradycardia.Â Case fatality due to profound, refractory circulatory collapse overdose has been reported in the literature.

The first step in managing felodipine overdose is maintaining a patent airway. Patients who have consumed an excess of felodipine ER tablets but have not yet developed any symptoms should be started on gastrointestinal decontamination with whole bowel irrigation if they present within 6 to 8 hours of drug ingestion. Patients with hypotension should undergo resuscitation with intravenous fluids. However, caution is necessary for individuals with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. Vasopressor therapy with dopamine or norepinephrine is an as-need option for hypotension. Intravenous calcium gluconate or calcium chloride (given via central line) are also options in treating felodipine overdose.

In patients with severe overdose, atropine should be administered intravenously for bradycardia. The vital signs, serum electrolytes, especially potassium, blood glucose, urine output, and ECG, should be monitored regularly. Hyperinsulinemia-euglycemia (HIE) therapy is also an established treatment for calcium channel blocker overdose.
