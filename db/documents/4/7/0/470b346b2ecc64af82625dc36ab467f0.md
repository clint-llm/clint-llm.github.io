To date, there are no well-designed randomized control trials studying treatment therapies for Kyrle disease. Treatment recommendations are currently based on anecdotal reports or small case series. Keratolytics such as salicylic acid or urea are considered first-line therapy. Emollients and oral antihistamines have been used to relieve pruritus. Electrocautery, cryotherapy, CO2 laser, topical retinoids, isotretinoin, and psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation are alternative therapies. Oral clindamycin 300 mg three 3 a day for one month has also shown beneficial results.
