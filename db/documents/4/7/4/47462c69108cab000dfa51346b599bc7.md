The majority of colloid cysts are found incidentally on imaging of the brain occurring for other reasons. When a colloid cyst is symptomatic, it most commonly causes non-communicating hydrocephalus. Symptoms of hydrocephalus can include headaches, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, coma, and death. If the hydrocephalus is slowly progressive, the patient can have more subtle findings, including urinary incontinence, trouble with walking, falls, altered mentation, and memory deficits.

For asymptomatic colloid cysts, the physical exam should be normal. If the patient has hydrocephalus from the colloid cyst, physical exam findings may include lethargy, failure of upward gaze, unsteady gait, ataxia, increased reflexes, and, if the hydrocephalus is chronic, papilledema and/or frontal release signs.
