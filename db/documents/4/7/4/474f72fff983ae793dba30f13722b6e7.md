Craniopharyngiomas are slow-growing tumors thus are usually diagnosed late when the patient develops symptoms from intracranial pressure including headaches and vision changes. Endocrinopathy may be reported for several years. On initial presentation,  most children will be found to have sub-normal growth, obesity, and delayed puberty.

- Headaches: Headaches are reported in approximately 50% of patients. Headaches may be due to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) with associated nausea and vomiting or meningeal irritation from the cystic fluid.

- Visual Symptoms:  62% to 84% of craniopharyngiomas patients will present with visual symptoms. The most common visual disturbance encountered is temporal hemianopsia due to optic chiasm compression. The dysfunction of the optic pathway is present in 50-75% of patients. Unfortunately, children rarely are aware of the vision changes, and consequently, they develop permanent loss of vision. Severe cases may manifest with optic nerve atrophy, papilledema, and visual field deficits.

- Behavioral and Cognitive Dysfunction: Visual and olfactory hallucination has been reported in children with craniopharyngioma. Monoplegia and hemiplegia have been observed in some cases. Seizures and unsteady gait have been reported in about 10% of cases.

- Hormonal Deficiency: Approximately 80-90% of patients present with at least one hormonal deficit on the initial presentation. However, only 15% of children will present with endocrine symptoms leading to the evaluation of craniopharyngioma.

- Growth Hormone (GH) Deficiency: Short stature is the common reason for the evaluation of the pituitary axis in children. It is present in 75% of pediatric craniopharyngioma.

- Gonadotropin Deficiency: 85 % of children will have gonadotropin deficiency leading to delayed puberty. Delayed puberty is the lack of sexual development at a certain time, which is the absence of breast development by age 12 years in girls and the absence of testicular growth in 14 years old boys.

- Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) Deficiency: It is present in 2-25% of pediatric craniopharyngioma. The symptoms of hypothyroidism include weight gain, fatigue, dry skin, cold intolerance, constipation, and failure to thrive.

- Adrenocortical Hormone (ACTH) Deficiency: This is present in 25-70% of patients on the initial presentation. The symptoms may be subtle, but weight loss, fatigue, dizziness, anorexia, and hypoglycemia may be present.

- Vasopressin deficiency, also known as diabetes insipidus (DI), is reported in approximately 9-38% of patients presenting with symptoms of increased thirst and urination.
