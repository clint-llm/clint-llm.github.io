Patients with Kaposi varicelliform eruption present with a sudden skin eruption of painful clusters of umbilicated vesicles and pustules. Vesiculopustules often evolve into crusted, hemorrhagic, and punched-out skin erosions that may enlarge and coalesce to form extensive denuded areas which are more likely to get a bacterial infection.

The distribution of affected skin reflects the crucial role of skin barrier impairment since Kaposi varicelliform eruption begins in areas of underlying dermatosis. This inaugural topographic distribution may lead to a delayed diagnosis because the eruption is often confused with the pre-existing condition.

Kaposi varicelliform eruption may be associated with systemic symptoms such as malaise, high temperature, and swollen lymph nodes. In addition, the disease can be complicated by multiple organ involvements, mainly of the central nervous system, liver, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and adrenal glands.
