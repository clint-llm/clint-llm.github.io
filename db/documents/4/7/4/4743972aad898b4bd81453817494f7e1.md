In the animal model, the tunica media of the pulmonary veins is constituted by cross-striated muscle tissue, which fibers are identical to the portion left atrial epicardial, posteriorly.

The atrium muscle fibers in the atrium venous junction have a non-linear orientation, probably to improve the junctional relationship with the different mechanical stimulations.
