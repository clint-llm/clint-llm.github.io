Glucagonoma syndrome also goes by the acronym 4D syndrome, consisting of dermatosis, diabetes, deep vein thrombosis, and depression

- The dermatoses associated with glucagonoma syndrome is called necrolytic migratory erythema (NME). It was first described by Wilkinson

- Weight loss occurs in about 90% of the patients with glucagonoma syndrome and is also one of the presenting features.

- Diabetes mellitus is present in nearly 80% of the patients. It is mostly mild as beta cell function of the pancreas is preserved and hence the production of insulin-mitigating ketoacidosis.

- Deep vein thrombosis is noted in nearly 50% of the patients. Patients with the unexplained thromboembolic disease should undergo a thorough history, physical and evaluation for the possibility of glucagonoma. It can occasionally present as pulmonary embolism which can be fatal.

- Depression, occurring in about 50% of the patients, may be related to the chronic dermatosis. Other neuropsychiatric manifestations include dementia, psychosis, agitation, hyperreflexia, ataxia, paranoid delusions, and proximal muscle weakness.

- Chronic diarrhea is seen in about 30% of the patients with glucagonoma syndrome.
