Eczematous cheilitis most common form of cheilitis and is more prevalent in people with a history of allergies.

Angular cheilitis/infective cheilitis may present at any age with an equal male to female ratio but is especially likely in older individuals wearing dentures. Children suffering from these forms have a history of recurrent infections or immune defects.

Actinic cheilitis is more prevalent in geographic areas with high ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, and in fair-skinned men who work outdoors (e.g., fishermen, farmers) in their fourth to the eighth decade of life. Certain genetic conditions associated with increased susceptibility to solar damage may predispose individuals to acquire actinic cheilitis at an early age (e.g., xeroderma pigmentosum, oculocutaneous albinism).

Glandular cheilitis is a rare form of cheilitis, more prevalent in older males, but individuals in younger age and women also may be affected. The cause is unknown, but several factors have been identified, including atopy, infection, chronic exposure to the sun, repeated licking, and use of tobacco.

Cheilitis granulomatosis is rare. It primarily affects young adults but can occur at any age, with equal ration in male to female. It is idiopathic. However, there are several predisposing factors, including food allergy, genetics, infection, and atopy.
