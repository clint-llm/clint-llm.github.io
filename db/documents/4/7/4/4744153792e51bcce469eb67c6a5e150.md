Parents or caretakers of the patient need to be counseled about the self-limiting nature of the condition. If ASD is started for MEI, the risk-benefits of ASD should be discussed. Despite MEI being self-limiting and benign, MEI patients need careful follow-up to look for neuropsychological deficits, educational difficulties, and resurgence of seizures in the long run.

Counseling about potential side effects and complications is important, with emphasis on specific safety profiles of the anti-seizure drugs.
