Posterior epistaxis is more challenging to control, and generally, treatment with anterior packing (which can control anterior epistaxis) is inadequate. Often posterior epistaxis can stop spontaneously, however for patients whose bleeding cannot be controlled with balloon tamponade or for recurrent symptoms surgical endovascular embolization of the sphenopalatine artery and anterior ethmoid artery can lead to resolution of the problem.

In recent years extracranial to intracranial bypass using the maxillary artery has gained traction mainly for the treatment of skull base tumors and complex cerebral aneurysms. This procedure requires a zygomatic osteotomy to allow proper exposure of the vessel. However, recent studies are showing a new and novel technique to reach the maxillary artery without the need for zygomatic osteotomy; this involves reaching the artery through the deep temporal vessels upon reflection of the temporalis muscle.
