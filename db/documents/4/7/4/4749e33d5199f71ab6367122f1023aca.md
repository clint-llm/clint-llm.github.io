Radial nerve entrapment is an uncommon diagnosis that is prone to under-recognition. Compression or entrapment can occur at any location within the course of the nerve distribution, but the most frequent location of entrapment occurs in the proximal forearm. This most common location is typically in proximity to the supinator and often will involve the posterior interosseous nerve branch. The radial nerve arises from C5 to C8 and provides a motor function to the extensors of the forearm, wrist, fingers, and thumb. This activity reviews the anatomy of the radial nerve, sites of entrapment and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of radial nerve entrapment.
- Review the presentation of a patient with radial nerve entrapment
- Outline the treatment and management options available for radial nerve entrapment.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with radial nerve entrapment.
