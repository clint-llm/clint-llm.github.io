This activity reviews vestibular rehabilitation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, treating, and managing the care of patients with vestibular hypofunction.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of vestibular hypofunction.
- Outline the common types of vestibular hypofunction.
- Review the most definitive tests for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.
- Summarize the management considerations by interprofessional for patients with vestibular hypofunction.
