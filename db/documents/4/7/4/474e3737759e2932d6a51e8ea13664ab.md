**Chemotherapy**

Early sarcoma regimens suffered from a high frequency of hematological toxicity and even patient deaths.

Dexrazoxane is the only FDA-approved drug for cardioprotection against anthracycline cardiotoxicity, but its use is restricted to patients with metastatic breast cancer who have received at least 300mg/m of doxorubicin and planned ongoing therapy. It was the only drug in a large meta-analysis to reduce the risk of heart failure in this patient population.

Mesna is typically delivered with ifosfamide to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis. With other first-line regimens such as gemcitabine/docetaxel, patients typically experience myelosuppression, fluid retention, acral erythema, nail bed separation, elevated liver enzymes, proteinuria, dyspnea, and neuropathy. Oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as pazopanib and sunitinib can cause diarrhea, dysgeusia, hand-foot syndrome, hypertension, elevation in liver enzymes, bone marrow suppression, and edema. The side effects are common in multi-targeted tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor inhibitors.

**Radiotherapy**

External beam radiotherapy is generally well tolerated. The frequency of certain complications depends on the timing and also the dose of radiation delivered. Wound complications are more common with pre-operative radiotherapy (35% vs. 17%).
