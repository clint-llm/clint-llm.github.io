Motivational interviewing is a skill that can benefit all members of the interprofessional healthcare team. Despite medical providers taking the bulk of interactions with patients, the MI spirit and skills can be utilized by everyone in the medical field to assist in tackling harmful patient behaviors. Nurses trained in MI techniques can utilize their skills to educate patients on their disease and work towards positive goals.

Pharmacists can tackle medication hesitance and non-compliance by investigating underlying reasons for these behaviors using MI skills. Even technicians and front desk staff, who tend to have the least amount of time to interact with patients, can utilize empathy and other aspects of the MI spirit to make the patient feel welcomed and able to open up while in the clinic.

By training everyone in the medical field in MI techniques, every individual can positively affect patients. Education in MI can be established during training programs for health professionals. Studies indicate that a 3-day seminar is sufficient in teaching MI skills and spirit to allied health professionals, giving them the confidence to utilize their skills effectively.
