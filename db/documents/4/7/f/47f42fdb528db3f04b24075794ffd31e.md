In most cases, the management of problems related to alterations of the STM requires an interprofessional approach. The target is to design a patient-centered treatment through the involvement of several health professionals. Many clinical conditions associated with memory disorders have very complex clinical pictures requiring a care response aimed at improving several outcomes, including cognition, functioning, mood, and, in turn, quality of life. The team must consist of professional figures able to: 1) perform a careful neuropsychological assessment; 2) collect information to make different diagnoses; 3) select the appropriate strategy (behavioral/non-behavioral); 4) manage communication for improving patient compliance and treatment adherence; 5) support patient and family; 6) adoptÂ the more appropriate psychological strategy (e.g., group cognitive-behavioral therapy) 6) perform behavioral programs focused on wellness education (e.g., sleep hygiene); 7) manage pharmacological approaches; 8) design programs of physical activity;****9) evaluate outcomes.

Specialty-trained psychological nurses can be of great assistance to the physicians in these cases. They will take basic histories, verify medication compliance, and monitor for overall treatment effectiveness before the clinicians investigate the patient's status or change of status. While early STM impairment does not fall into pharmaceutical therapy, as the decline continues and concerns about Alzheimer disease or Parkinson disease appear, the pharmacist will assume a much more significant role, including agent and dose verification, medication reconciliation, and working directly with the nursing and physician staff to optimize therapy and minimize adverse effects. This type of interprofessional team approach is necessary for optimal patient results in managing STM impairment. [Level V]
