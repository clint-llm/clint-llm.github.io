Lead encephalopathy results as a late-stage complication of lead intoxication. Lead intoxication occurs via environmental exposure to lead, which may be absorbed through the skin or mucosal surfaces, ingestion, or inhalation of lead-containing fumes.

Encephalopathy generally occurs late in chronic exposures with escalating whole blood lead levels and may be preceded by a prodrome of other lead toxicity related syndromes such as neuropathy or GI distress. A single large dose lead exposure may also present with lead encephalopathy, although this is less common.
