It is essential that the clinician knows and understands a detailed workup of a case of suspected alpha-thalassemia. Every step in diagnosis requires joint efforts by various personnel who are a part of an interprofessional healthcare team forÂ these patients and their families.

Good communication and coordination are the responsibility of the staff involved. Each team member needs to remain updated about diagnostic criteria, laboratory techniques, and interpretations of results obtained. It is also mandatory to follow the proper procedures and protocols right from the entry of a suspected patient of alpha-thalassemia in a clinic to its lifelong management. All laboratory team members must be aware of the universal safety precautions required in the lab.

The interprofessional team approach to diagnosis and management will result in the best patient outcomes. [Level 5]
