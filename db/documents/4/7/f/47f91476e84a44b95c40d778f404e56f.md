Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a pooled antibody, and a biological agent used to manage various immunodeficiency states and a plethora of other conditions, including autoimmune, infectious, and inflammatory states. The ultimate goal of this therapy is to normalize a compromised immune system. This activity reviews the indications, mechanism of action, contraindications, adverse effects, and monitoring of IVIG in the treatment of several immune deregulated states. It also highlights the key information pertinent to the healthcare teams managing patients with conditions affecting the immune system and other immune-related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of intravenous immunoglobulin.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of intravenous immunoglobulin.
- Review the appropriate monitoring during therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin.
- Explain the inter-professional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and improve outcomes.
