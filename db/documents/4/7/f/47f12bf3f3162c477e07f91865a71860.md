Minimal preparation is required for this procedure. The procedure should be discussed with the patient in detail to include the procedure's risks and benefits. While written consent is not always required, informed consent must be obtained before starting the procedure. Anxiety and situational discomfort are common before and during the procedure. Pelvic exams and subsequent endometrial biopsies are among the most common anxiety-provoking medical procedures.

The procedure can evoke negative physical and emotional symptoms, especially in patients with a history of sexual abuse or assault. This may cause the examination to be nearly unbearable and may deter the patient from seeking appropriate health care. If the performing provider or chaperone recognizes any patient discomfort, the provider should stop the procedure and address the patient's concerns. It is reasonable to elicit help from a therapist or social worker if it is apparent the provider must delay the procedure due to a patient's anxiety or discomfort.

Any woman of reproductive age or with the potential for pregnancy should have a documented negative pregnancy test prior to the procedure.

The patient can take an NSAID 30 to 60 minutes before the procedure to reduce the pain associated with cramping.

Prophylactic antibiotics are not necessary during endometrial sampling for the prevention of surgical site infection or bacterial endocarditis.
