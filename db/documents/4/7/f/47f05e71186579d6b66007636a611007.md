The medial pterygoid muscle along with masseter muscle forms a 'pterygomassetric sling' that suspends the mandible. After orthognathic surgery to treat mandibular prognathism, this sling greatly affects the stability of the two segments of the mandible. Also, the healing process of bone between the two segments (distal and proximal) is subject to influence by the magnitude of force applied by the sling.

Infection in the mandibular teeth more frequently involves the lower compartment of the masticatory space, which contains medial pterygoid muscle; this could result in pterygoid muscle abscess. Since both masticator space and infratemporal fossa share the medial pterygoid muscle, there are chances of the potential spread of infection from this space to the infratemporal fossa.

Sometimes, an occlusal interference may occur due to movement of the accessory medial pterygoid muscle, which is clinically evident on the buccal cusps of the third molar. This occlusion abnormality may act as a trigger point for spasm of the muscle, which can be clinically checked by fixing the mandible under pressure in the most posterior and centric position to make the interfering occlusal contacts evident.

During vertical jaw movements, lateral pterygoid muscle act as a primary muscle that generates horizontal forces. However, the medial pterygoid muscle may also play a role in controlling horizontal jaw positions.
