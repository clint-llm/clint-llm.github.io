Smokeless tobacco keratosis can be diagnosed with clinical examination and patient interview. If a corrugated buccal mucosa is noted, the patient should be questioned regarding the use of smokeless tobacco. In addition, the clinician should determine if the location where the patient places the tobacco correlates with the lesion identified.

Leukoplakia should be evaluated closely, as more than 33% of oral carcinomas exhibit leukoplakia before becoming a true malignancy. As a clinically diagnostic term, an effort to identify any clinical source or cause of the lesion should be explored.

Erythroplakia may have a similar presentation to other lesions, which may range from benign to malignant. The red color is due to atrophy of the epithelium, which exposes the microvasculature of the underlying tissue. These lesions should be biopsied after ruling out all clinically possible causes to determine whether epithelial dysplasia or malignancy is present.

Verrucous carcinoma should be evaluated closely, as it is a low-grade variant of squamous cell carcinoma and may be easily overlooked and/or misdiagnosed.

Squamous cell carcinoma, with its varied clinical presentations, should be evaluated closely. In addition, patients must be interviewed in-depth about their habits to determine if they are at high risk for developing oral cancer.
