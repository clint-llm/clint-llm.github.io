Histologic diagnosis of adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial stroma and glandular tissue within the smooth muscle of the myometrium. Different definitions of the required depth of invasion exist, some using an absolute measurement between 2.5 to 8 mm while others use a percentage. Additionally, several histologic grading classifications attempt to characterize the burden of disease.
