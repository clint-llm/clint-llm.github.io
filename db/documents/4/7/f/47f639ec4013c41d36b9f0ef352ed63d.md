Here are important treatment goals:

- The goal is to quickly supplement potassium along with the reduction of thyroid hormones. We need to monitor for the risk of rebound hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia during the recovery phase.

- Intravenous potassium replacement is preferred, especially when patients present with severe symptoms, especially arrhythmias. Acute treatment suggestion is with 30 mEq of potassium given orally, every two hours until recovery begins, with a maximum oral dose of 90 mEq in 24 hours. Some suggestions include replacing at a rate of less than 10 mEq orally.

- Prophylactic potassium supplementation between attacks has not shown to be beneficial.

- Non-selective beta-blockers have been shown to improve neuromuscular symptoms by reducing the intracellular shift of phosphate and potassium.

- Medications that induce hypokalemia like glucocorticoids should be carefully monitored and should be avoided if possible in these patients. The ultimate goal is to reduce thyroid hormone levels and restore euthyroid status.

- Antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and or surgery might be necessary based on the etiology of hyperthyroidism.

- Precipitating factors like strenuous exercise and high carbohydrate meals should be avoided.
