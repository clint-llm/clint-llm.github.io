Benediction sign (or Benediction posture) is a clinical sign of ulnar neuropathy of the hand. It results in the functional impairment of the intrinsic muscles of the hand that act on the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints.

This sign has also been referred to by other names in literature, such as the Preacher’s hand and “main-en-griffe.” The papal benediction sign was first recognized in the historical artwork of Saint Peter, who presumably suffered from ulnar neuropathy. After him, other popes imitated his hand gesture in preaching.
