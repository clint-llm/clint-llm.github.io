NCS remains underdiagnosed, and a  proper understanding of NCS or NCP is essential to keep it in mind when seeing a patient with clinical symptoms and signs of hematuria, pelvic pain, pelvic varicosities, and varicoceles. Lack of knowledge of the natural history of this condition leads to improper diagnostic criteria and treatment. Patients who are in their adolescence with a benign course require a more conservative approach as they will outgrow their symptoms with physical development. Those with severe symptoms require vascular intervention or surgery to treat the condition.
