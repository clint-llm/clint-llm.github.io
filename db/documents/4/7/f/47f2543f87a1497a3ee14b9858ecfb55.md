Perinatal asphyxia is a lack of blood flow or gas exchange to or from the fetus in the period immediately before, during, or after the birth process. Perinatal asphyxia can result in profound systemic and neurologic sequelae due decreased blood flow and/or oxygen to a fetus or infant during the peripartum period. When placental (prenatal) or pulmonary (immediate post-natal) gas exchange is compromised or ceases altogether, there is partial (hypoxia) or complete (anoxia) lack of oxygen to the vital organs. This results in progressive hypoxemia and hypercapnia. If the hypoxemia is severe enough, the tissues and vital organs (muscle, liver, heart, and ultimately the brain) will develop an oxygen debt. Anaerobic glycolysis and lactic acidosis will result. Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy refers specifically to the neurologic sequelae of perinatal asphyxia. This activity reviews the causes of birth asphyxia, its pathophysiology and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of birth asphyxia.
- Review the presentation of a patient with birth asphyxia.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for birth asphyxia.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with birth asphyxia.
