Consider other dysmyelinating diseases such as:

- Adrenoleukodystrophy: typically spares subcortical U-fibers, has a characteristic occipitoparietal periventricular white matter distribution

- Alexander disease: anterior dominance, diffuse late in the disease course, normal NAA on MRS levels

- Metachromatic leukodystrophy: spares subcortical U-fibers, will have a characteristic 'butterfly' pattern

- Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease: associated with cerebellar atrophy, tigroid pattern of hyperintensity, typically spares subcortical U-fibers
