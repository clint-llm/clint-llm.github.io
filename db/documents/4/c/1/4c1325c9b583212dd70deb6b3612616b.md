The data is lacking regarding the incidence of acute vestibular neuritis, but it is known to be the third most common cause of peripheral vertigo following BPPV and Meniere disease. Estimates are that acute vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis gets diagnosed in 6% of patients who present to emergency departments in the USA the complaint of dizziness. This stat is likely an under-representation of its true incidence as another 22% of the patients complaining of dizziness are discharged without anything more specific than “dizziness” or “vertigo.” A portion of these non-specific diagnoses likely includes actual cases of acute vestibular neuritis.
