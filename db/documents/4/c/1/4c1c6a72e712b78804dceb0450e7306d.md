There are clear problems with gustatory testing. The lack of objectivity amongst the various testing methods means that we cannot apply the tests to individuals without capacity or use them to discern true pathology from psychogenic phenomena or malingering.

The complex nature of gustation also creates interfering factors, forcing the clinician to consider the integration of olfaction, somatosensory, visual, and emotional factors. Tests must be able to localize pathology, whereas whole-mouth testing methods do not, instead of giving a less refined interpretation of gustation. Some methods do not directly measure gustation but rather provide a proxy measurement; for example, imaging cannot diagnose ageusia, but reporting the anatomical location of a lesion can assume a gustatory involvement. Other proxy tests such as salivary testing have not been mentioned here, as again they do not directly measure gustation, but saliva creates the optimal environment for taste, and therefore disorders of salivation may alter gustation. It has been suggested that ‘without moisture, there is no taste,’ although analysis of salivary flow rates has failed to prove a correlation to taste perception.
