Cervical insufficiency is the inability of the cervix to retain fetus, in the absence of uterine contractions or labor (painless cervical dilatation), owing to a functional or structural defect. It is cervical ripening that occurs far from the term. Cervical insufficiency is rarely a distinct and well defined clinical entity but only part of a large and more complex spontaneous preterm birth syndrome. This activity reviews the cause and presentation of cervical incompetence and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of cervical incompetence.
- Describe the evaluation of cervical incompetence.
- Summarize the treatment of cervical incompetence.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by cervical incompetence.
