Labial adhesion is the fusion of the labia minora or majora, and it is mostly located near the clitoris. It also may be known as synechia vulvae or labial agglutination. The exact cause for labial adhesions remains unknown. However, it is believed that a state of low estrogen may be a contributing cause. Therefore, these patients are typically managed with estrogen cream when symptomatic.
