There are many medications used during endotracheal intubation. While the procedure is performed by nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologists, emergency department physicians, intensivists, and many others, everyone on the interprofessional team (clinicians, nursing staff, surgical assistants, pharmacists) must know about the potential adverse effects of these medications. In addition, before the procedure, it is important to have resuscitative equipment in the room. During an emergency intubation, a dedicated nurse must be assigned to monitoring the vital signs. With appropriate collaborative teamwork, vigilant monitoring, and open communication, using appropriate medications for endotracheal administration can successfully help the patient achieve better outcomes.
