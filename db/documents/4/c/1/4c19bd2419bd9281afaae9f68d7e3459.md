Patients undergoing lymph node dissection require an inter-professional team approach. General surgeons and other specialized surgeons conduct these surgeries. Pathologists will then look for cancerous cells within thatÂ lymph node. Medical and radiation oncologists, anesthesiologists, radiologists, and other healthcare professionals are also part of this interdisciplinary team who help diagnose, treat, and follow these cancers.
