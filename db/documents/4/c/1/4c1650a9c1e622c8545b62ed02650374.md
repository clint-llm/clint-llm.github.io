Arteriovenous fistulas can be surgically created for hemodialysis access, can occur as a result of a congenital anomaly, or be secondary to iatrogenic injury or trauma. Penetration of any mixed-type vasculature can ultimately result in the healing of arteries and veins together, bypassing downstream arteriole and capillary systems.

**Iatrogenic Fistulas**

These are most commonly reported as a result of percutaneous access of the femoral vein and femoral artery during cardiac catheterization; although, subclavian and carotid fistulas have been reported in association with the placement of central lines.

**Traumatic Fistulas**

These are often associated with direct arterial trauma and long bone fractures, especially where an artery and vein are in close communication. Ninety percent of traumatic AVFs are due to penetrating trauma, the majority of which are gunshot wounds.

**Congenital Fistulas**

These are not well-understood. Congenital AVFs of the central nervous system can be dural or carotid cavernous. AVFs of the neck are mostly due to trauma; however, fibromuscular dysplasia, neurofibromatosis, and other types of collagen disorders have been associated. Pulmonary vascular malformations are typically simple and more similar to AVFs than to a true malformation.
