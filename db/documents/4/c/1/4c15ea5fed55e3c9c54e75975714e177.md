Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is a rare disease defined as compression of the third portion of the duodenum between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. Other names for SMA syndrome have included chronic duodenal ileus, Wilkie syndrome, arterio-mesenteric duodenal compression syndrome and cast syndrome. The disease was first reported as a case report in 1842 by Carl Von Rokitansky, and in 1927, Wilkie further detailed the pathophysiology and diagnostic findings of the disease.
