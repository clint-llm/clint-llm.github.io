According to the World Health Organization (WHO), marijuana is the world's most widely cultivated, trafficked, and abused illicit substance. Approximately 2.5% of the world's population (147 million people) uses it. Its use is more prevalent among men than women—a gender gap that widened in the years 2007 to 2014.  Use is widespread in the adolescent and young adult population. According to the Monitoring the Future survey, an annual survey of drug use in America’s middle and high school students, rates of use within one year ranged from approximately 9% in 8 graders to 35% in 12 graders.  In the United States, cannabis is still a Schedule 1, meaning it is not scheduled for federal medical use and has a high potential for abuse.
