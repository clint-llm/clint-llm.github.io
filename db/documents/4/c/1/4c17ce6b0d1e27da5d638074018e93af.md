The exact cause of necrolytic migratory erythema remains unknown. However, it is almost ubiquitous with glucagonoma, where it can be the presenting symptom of the neoplasm in roughly 70% of cases.

NME also occurs outside the context of a glucagonoma; in these cases, it is termed “pseudoglucagonoma syndrome.” Pseudoglucagonoma syndrome has been seen to occur with a variety of different disease states, such as intestinal malabsorption (celiac disease), liver cirrhosis, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease), chronic pancreatitis, and other malignancies (small cell lung cancer, duodenal neoplasms).
