Lung parenchymal inflammation in HP is a combination of type-III and type-IV hypersensitivity reactions. The offending antigen or chemical agent initially triggers an immune complex-mediated (type III) hypersensitivity reaction after initial sensitization. Hence, in acute HP, high titers of specific IgG antibodies (precipitins) can be detected in serum. Continued exposure to the antigen shifts it to a delayed (type IV) hypersensitivity reaction. This activates CD8 cytotoxic T cells releasing chemokines that result in macrophage activation and granuloma formation. As the disease progresses to subacute and chronic HP, an exaggerated T-cell-mediated immune response is noted. This results in increased T-cell migration and proliferation. The mechanism behind progression to fibrosis is not clearly understood. There is thought to be a shift to the increased TH2 response that promotes collagen deposition and fibrosis. The individual differences in susceptibility to HP suggests a genetic link likely through major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II namely HLA-DR and DQ. Cigarette smoking seems to protect from developing clinically significant HP likely due to nicotine inhibiting macrophage activation and lymphocyte proliferation.
