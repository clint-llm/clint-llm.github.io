Acetylcholinesterase is known to be distributed in nervous tissue such as the brainstem, cerebellum, and peripheral and autonomic nervous systems. Skeletal muscle also contains AChE with distribution patterns seemingly related to the type of muscle (fast versus slow twitch) and their specific function.

The presence and function of AChE on red blood cells are less commonly known. Blood group antigens reside on the outer lipid bilayer of red blood cells for convenient antibody recognition. In the same regard, AChE is also present on red blood cell membranes.
