The healthcare professional should conduct a thorough history and physical examination of any patient with suspected choriocarcinoma. In women, clinicians should pay particular attention to reproductive history because spontaneous abortions and molar pregnancies increase the risk for choriocarcinoma. One should consider post-menopausal bleeding suspicious. Choriocarcinoma tends to metastasize, and clinicians should note symptoms that arise from other organ systems, for example, hemoptysis or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

Due to elevations in human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels, patients can present with abnormal uterine bleeding, gynecomastia (in men), or hyperthyroidism.

Males will present can present with symptoms of metastatic disease, often hemoptysis, but the liver, GI tract, and brain are also frequently involved.
