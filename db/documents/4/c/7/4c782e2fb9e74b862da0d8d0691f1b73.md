Tobacco smoking is the practice of burning tobacco with the smoke inhaled to be tasted and absorbed into the bloodstream. Around 23 percent of the world's population smokes cigarettes. Several studies have linked tobacco smoking to a range of devastating illnesses including coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancers in every human organ system, and decreased reproductive health.
