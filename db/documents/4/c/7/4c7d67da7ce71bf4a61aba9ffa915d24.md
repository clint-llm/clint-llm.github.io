Broad indications exist for the use of retrobulbar blockade. Any intraocular surgery that requires anesthesia and akinesia for less than two hours can be an indication to do this block. The most common uses are in cataract surgery, corneal transplant, keratoplasty, vitrectomy, tube shunt placement, enucleation or evisceration of the eyeball, and cyclodestructive procedures.
