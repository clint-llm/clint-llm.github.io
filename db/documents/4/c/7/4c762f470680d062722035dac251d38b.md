Often, a feeding jejunostomy may be the only option for enteral access for a patient. It then becomes a potentially life-saving procedure, eliminating the need for parenteral nutrition and its associated risks. The only absolute contraindication to a feeding jejunostomy is bowel obstruction distal to the site of tube implantation. Relative contraindications can be classified as follows.

Local

- Abdominal wall infection at the placement site

- Severe ascites

- Peritonitis

- History of bowel necrosis from the previous jejunostomy

Systemic

- Severe coagulopathy (INR greater than 1.5, aPTT greater than 50 seconds, PLT less than 50,000/mm3)

- Hemodynamic instability requiring the use of vasopressors

- Ventilatory dependence preventing transport to the operating room
