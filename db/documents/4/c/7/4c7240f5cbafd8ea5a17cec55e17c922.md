Radical cystectomy with urinary diversion is the most effective treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancers, with 5-year cancer-specific survival using this treatment reported up to 76%.

Patient-unique and disease-specific factors are important to ensure appropriate diversion is chosen. Patients desiring orthotopic neobladder must be motivated to complete a timed voiding regimen postoperatively and should possess the ability to perform clean intermittent catheterization if needed. These patients should also be advised of the difference in voiding technique with Valsalva voiding. Similarly, patients should understand the potential for daytime or nighttime incontinence after neobladder creation. Patients undergoing an ileal conduit should understand and be capable of caring for their ostomy and appliance. Those considering continent cutaneous urinary diversions must understand that urinary drainage is dependent upon regular, clean intermittent self-catheterization 4 to 6 times each day.
