Following investigations guide not only in determining the potential cause but also in assessing the extent of the damage:

****Blood****

- Complete blood count - A decreased hematocrit may suggest a dilutional type of anemia. In the background of an infectious cause, pleocytosis may be apparent.

- Serum electrolytes - Potassium levels may be raised in patients with severe renal impairment.

- Renal function tests - BUN and creatinine levels are raised, demonstrating a degree of renal impairment. In addition, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may be low.

- Liver function tests - May point towards the underlying etiology.

- Immunoglobulins

- C-reactive protein (CRP)

- Electrophoresis

- Complement (C3, C4 levels) - Differentiation may allow the provider to narrow the differentials. Low complement levels indicate the following diseases: cryoglobulinemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, infective (bacterial) endocarditis, and shunt nephritis. Certain renal disorders may also be considered, such as membranoproliferative GN or post-streptococcal GN. Normal complement levels suggest an underlying abscess, polyarteritis nodosa, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, Goodpasture syndrome, idiopathic rapidly progressive GN, immune complex disease, and immunoglobulin G or immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Chauvet et al. reported that in patients with new-onset nephritis and low C3 levels, anti-factor B autoantibodies might help distinguish new-onset post-streptococcal GN from hypocomplementemic C3 glomerulonephritis.

- Autoantibodies, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and anti-ds-DNA, anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) to rule out collagenopathy as the underlying cause of GN.

- Blood culture - Blood culture is indicated when there is a fever, immunosuppression, intravenous drug abuse, indwelling catheters, or shunts.

- Antistreptolysin O titer (ASOT) increases in 60 to 80% of cases. The rise begins in one to three weeks, peaks in three to five weeks, and returns to baseline in six months. It is unrelated to the severity, duration, and prognosis of renal disease.

- Hepatitis serology - As infectious hepatitis can lead to glomerulonephritis of various types

****Urine****

The urine is usually dark, and the specific gravity is more than 1.020 with RBCs and RBC casts. The 24-hour urinary protein excretion and creatinine clearance may help establish the degree of renal impairment and proteinuria.

- Microscopy, culture, and sensitivity

- Bence Jones protein

- Albumin to creatinine or protein to creatinine ratio

- RBC casts

**Imaging**

- Chest X-ray (helps to see for evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage, if any)

- Renal ultrasound (helps in assessing the size and anatomy for biopsy)

**Renal Biopsy**

The examination of glomerular lesions via a renal biopsy provides the diagnosis of glomerulonephritis by answering the following queries:

- Approximate proportion of involved glomeruli (focal vs. diffuse)

- Approximate involvement of each glomerulus (segmental vs. global)

- Presence of hypercellularity

- Any evident sclerosis

- Any deposits on immunohistology (immunoglobulins, light chains, complement)

- Electron microscopy findings - precise localization of deposits. Exact ultrastructural appearance. Podocyte appearance

- Presence of tubulointerstitial inflammation, atrophy, or fibrosis

- Evident vessel-related pathology

In addition to establishing the etiology, the biopsy also helps determine the severity of the disease and the underlying etiology.
