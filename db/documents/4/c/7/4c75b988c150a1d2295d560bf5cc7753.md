Specimen collection by means of clean-catch midstream technique poses no risk to the patient. Despite the longstanding belief that pre-cleansing yields an uncontaminated specimen, several studies have shown that pre-cleansing has no significant effect on test results. Prevention of UTI is worthy of discussion and has been traditionally under-researched in the past. Patients should be educated on correct wiping methods, adequate hydration, frequent urination, avoiding feminine products, precoital bathing, and postcoital voiding, and avoid the use of a number of certain birth control products. With these increased measures aimed at improving hygiene, health behaviors, and sexual practices, UTI-related morbidity, and the use of antibiotics for these infections would invariably decrease.
