The most common causes of apraxia are CVA, dementia, and traumatic brain injury. Apraxia is generally a symptom of an underlying and complex neurological disease, where the management can become challenging. Regarding apraxia resulting from CVA, education about modifiable risk factors should be provided. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological management of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, underlying sleep apnea, atrial fibrillation, cessation of smoking, and alcohol consumption can lead to better outcomes.

Regardless of the etiology of apraxia, the inability to perform specific tasks can sometimes be frustrating,Â leading to loss of capacity, lack of motivation, depression, or loss of function. Providing educational resources, discussions with caretakers, and counseling family members can be crucial in setting expectations and understanding care goals and the challenges in recovery. Resources and education should be disseminated in various forms like audio-visual, written instructions, or interactive handouts. Active participation by patients, caregivers, and family members in the management plan can significantly aid recovery.
