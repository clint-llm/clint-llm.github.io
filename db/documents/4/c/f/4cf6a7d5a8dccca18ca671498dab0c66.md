Most adductor strains are managed conservatively. Initial management will include relative rest from sports, ice, compression, analgesia, and physical therapy. Analgesia typically includes acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. The rehabilitation program should include stretching the range of motion and strengthening of the affected leg and core accompanied by a gradual return to sport. Acute injuries may return as quickly as 4 to 8 weeks while chronic strains may take many months to achieve desired results.

In addition, other treatment modalities may be available for refractory cases. This includes corticosteroid injection into the adductor complex and needle tenotomy, both of which are at the discretion of the consulting clinician and typically performed under ultrasound guidance.

Occasionally, surgical management is indicated. There are no clear guidelines on which injuries require surgical management. Potential indications include poor recovery with conservative management with full-thickness tears or avulsion injuries with the persistent weakness of the affected limb.
