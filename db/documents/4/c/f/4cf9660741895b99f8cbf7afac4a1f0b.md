A carbuncle develops over several days to several weeks, reaching a diameter of 2 to 10 cm. After approximately one week, multiple pustules develop and protrude from the surface. The lesion drains a serosanguinous fluid. Healing occurs over several weeks and will result in a scar. Rarely, if left untreated, mortality can occur from sepsis or diabetic ketoacidosis in those with comorbid conditions or immunosuppression. With proper treatment, carbuncles are cured, and the prognosis is excellent, resulting in only a cosmetic scar.
