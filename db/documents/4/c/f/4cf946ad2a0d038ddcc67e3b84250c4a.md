Clavulanic acid, when administered with amoxicillin, can cause some mild gastrointestinal adverse effects. These include vomiting, nausea, loose stools, and discomfort. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea due to amoxicillin-clavulanic acidÂ treatment is the most common adverse effect. There is a higher incidence of diarrhea when clavulanic acid is added to amoxicillin compared to amoxicillin alone. Diarrhea is more common in those taking a high dose of the extended-release form of clavulanic acid and amoxicillin.

When used for the treatment of urinary tract infections, this drug combination can cause candida vaginitis.
