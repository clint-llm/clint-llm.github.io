The exact cause of TTH is not fully understood. However, there are links to various factors, including nutritional, muscular, environmental, and genetics.

There have been numerous correlational studies that have vitamin deficiencies as implicating factors in TTH. A possible vitamin B-12 correlation has been studied in Turkish kids. In this study, nearly a quarter of the 75 children in the control group from ages 11 to 15 had headaches and serum B-12 levels < 200. Some had what researchers defined as severe B-12 deficiency, with a vitamin B-12 level of <160. Upon vitamin supplementation, all 18 of these kids no longer had headaches.

Environmental and muscular factors are also possible etiology of tension headaches. Stress and posture appear to be the two significant factors.
