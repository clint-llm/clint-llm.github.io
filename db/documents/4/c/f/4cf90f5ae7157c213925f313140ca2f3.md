Twin studies indicate a polygenic model may explain familial clustering. Sunburn reaction in patients affected by polymorphous light eruption is normal.

Current theories involve two steps that lead to a polymorphous light eruption. An unknown photoantigen is rendered immunogenic on exposure to UV. This does not cause a problem in unaffected individuals because of UV-induced suppression. In patients with a polymorphic light eruption, T–cell function is not suppressed by UV radiation until photo-hardening has taken place. The putative antigen induced by UV radiation leads to a predominance of CD4+ T cells and the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 1. Vitamin D insufficiency, the role of estrogen in preventing UV-induced immune suppression, and dysregulated antimicrobial factors may be relevant.

The hardening effect, where further exposure to UV prevents the eruption, is not fully understood and could involve tanning, hyperkeratosis, and acanthosis of the epidermis, and/or the development of immunological tolerance.
