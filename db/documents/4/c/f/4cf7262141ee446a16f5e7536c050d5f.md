Pudendal blocks are considered very low risk with few contraindications. These include:

- Known allergic reactions to the specific local anesthetic used

- Skin and soft tissue infections at the site of injection are absolute contraindications to undergoing a pudendal nerve block

- Uncorrected coagulopathies and prior surgery in the area with altered local anatomy are relative contraindications to receiving a pudendal nerve block

- Active infection
