Follicular lymphoma is believed to originate from germinal center B-cells, including both centrocytes and centroblasts.

Early mutations in genes encoding chromatin-modifying proteins are a significant discovery made in the last few years.N-methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D), histone acetylases, CREBBP, enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), and E1A binding protein P300 (EP300).

These mutations accelerate the proliferation of the germinal center, inhibit cellular differentiation, and restrict immunological invasion. These mutations, together with the BCL2 translocation, are early events happening in a common progenitor cell.
