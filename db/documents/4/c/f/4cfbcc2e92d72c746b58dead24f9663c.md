Patients present commonly with cardinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, upper abdominal pain, bloating and weight loss. The gastroparesisÂ cardinal symptom index (GCSI) is a validated clinical instrument that be can be used to assess symptoms in patients suffering from gastroparesis. This instrument has three subscales: (fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, and bloating) and rates of symptom intensities from zero (none) to five (very severe) and the total is used for severity of the disease. The GCSI is used to assess response to therapy and not primarily as a diagnostic tool. In addition to gastric symptoms, the slow and unpredictable gastric emptying can cause wide fluctuations in blood sugar levels especially so in diabetic patients. In addition, this may cause weight loss, fatigue, calorie deficit, gastric bezoar formation.
