The appropriate personnel plays a critical role in methacholine challenge testing, as patient breathing maneuvers must be coached properly to obtain reliable and accurate results when performing spirometry and measuring FEV1. The patient must be able to reproduce the spirometric maneuvers, otherwise, the quality of the test will not be useful to interpret. Staff trained in the treatment of acute bronchospasm as well as resuscitation equipment should be present with emergency resuscitation equipment and bronchodilators.
