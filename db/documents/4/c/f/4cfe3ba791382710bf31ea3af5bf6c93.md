The ovary has dual blood supply from both the ovarian artery and the uterine artery. The ovarian artery is a paired structure that originates from the abdominal aorta below the renal artery or around L2. The artery runs through the suspensory ligament of the ovary, which then enters the mesovarium. The ovarian artery may make an anastomosis with the uterine artery within the broad ligament.

The ovarian vein which travels to the ovary by the suspensory ligament provides drainage to the parametrium, cervix, mesosalpinx, and pampiniform plexus as well. It can be found to have anastomoses with the para-ovarian, uterine, vesical, rectal, and vulvar venous plexuses. The left ovarian vein voids its contents into the left renal vein, while the right ovarian vein empties directly into the inferior vena cava. The ovarian vein has a diameter of 5 mm on average.

The ovaries drain the majority of their lymph into the paraaortic lymph nodes, which arise around the level of L2. The lymph travels along with the ovarian vessel to the paraaortic nodes near the bifurcation of the renal arteries and the aorta. However, researchers have noted two other pathways. The first is lymph that travels via lateral vessels to hypogastric nodes, which will then drain into the paraaortic nodes. The second is lymph that follows vessels close to the round ligament, leading to the external iliac and inguinal lymph nodes.
