Clinically, symptoms of cholestasis include pruritus, dark urine, pale stools, and steatorrhea. Like bilirubin, other substances that are normally excreted in bile, such as gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and cholesterol, accumulate in the blood. Fat malabsorption may lead to deficiencies of vitamin A, D, E, and K. On examination, non-tender hepatomegaly and scratch marks on the skin due to pruritus may be present. A careful history and exam with appropriate diagnostic testing are necessary to narrow the differential diagnosis of cholestasis and create the proper treatment plan

The principal therapeutic options for symptomatic management of cholestasis are with ursodeoxycholic acid, a hydrophilic bile acid, and cholestyramine, a bile acid sequestrant
