Many patients with renal failure will not respond to erythropoietin, which is crucial as it is an important predictor of adverse cardiac events. Two factors that lead to unresponsiveness include iron deficiency and inflammation. High levels of CRP predict resistance to erythropoietin in dialysis patients. Therefore, to enhance responsiveness to erythropoietin, iron supplements are recommended.

Anemia of chronic renal disease is associated with cardiorenal anemia syndrome. Foley et al. observed that for every 1-g decrease in hemoglobin concentration, a 42% increase in left ventricular dilatation is seen in patients with stage 5 CKD.

The Dialysis Outcomes Practice Pattern Study (DOPPS), involving countries, reported that with the decrease in hemoglobin to less than 11 g/dL, there was an increase in hospitalization and mortality in CKD patients.
