Patients with HIV are best managed by an interprofessional team because of multiple organ involvement. When the eye is involved, the ophthalmologist should be consulted immediately. The infectious disease consultant, internist, and the primary care provider should educate the patient on the importance of HAART. It is important for the primary caregivers and nurse practitioners to know that visual loss in HIV cannot only be from medications but from opportunistic infections like herpes, treponema, toxoplasma, and herpes.

The outcomes for these patients are guarded. If treatment is delayed, permanent visual loss is common.
