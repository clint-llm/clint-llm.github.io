The Bier block, also known as intravenous local anesthesia (IVRA), is a safe, effective, and cost-efficient way to provide short-term anesthesia and analgesia during surgery on an extremity. This technique requires minimal additional equipment and can be performed in a variety of clinical environments. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and potential complications of the Bier block, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients requiring it.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pertinent anatomy involved in a Bier block. 
- Outline the indications for a Bier block.
- Review the most-feared complication of the Bier block.
- Explain a structured, interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients undergoing a Bier block.
