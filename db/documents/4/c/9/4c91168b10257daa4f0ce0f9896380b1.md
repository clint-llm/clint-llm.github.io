Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder. It is most often due to germ-line mutations in the STK11 (LKB1) on chromosome 19p13.3. STK11 is a tumor suppressor gene that regulates cell polarity. The gene encodes serine/threonine kinase 11, which plays an important role in regulating the cell cycle. Mutations in STK11 are detected in 50% to 80% of families with PJS; for the remaining patients, PJS likely resulted from de novo mutations.
