Unstable angina deals with blood flow obstacles causing a lack of perfusion to the myocardium. Initial perfusion starts directly from the heart into the aorta and subsequently into the coronary arteries, which supply their respective portions of the heart. The left coronary artery will divide into the circumflex and the left anterior descending artery.  Subsequently, this will divide into much smaller branches. The right coronary will divide into smaller branches as well. Unstable angina results when the blood flow is impeded to the myocardium. Most commonly, this block can be from intraluminal plaque formation, intraluminal thrombosis, vasospasm, and elevated blood pressure.  Often a combination of these is the provoking factor.

Factors that increase myocardial oxygen demand:

- Arrhythmias

- Fever

- Hypertension

- Cocaine use

- Aortic stenosis

- AV shunts

- Anemia

- Thyrotoxicosis

- Pheochromocytoma

- CHF
