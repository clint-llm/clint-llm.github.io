There are multiple therapeutic options for the management of groove pancreatitis. These include conservative medical management, endoscopic therapy, and surgical interventions.

Conservative management includes a healthy balanced diet, analgesics, pancreatic rest, and abstinence from alcohol and smoking.

Endoscopic treatment options include dilation of the duodenal and pancreatic ductal stenosis and drainage of the pancreatic duct and symptomatic pseudocysts.

Isayama reported endoscopic treatment of groove pancreatitis by stenting the minor papilla, but the long-term course was unclear.

Surgery is the preferred therapeutic option for symptomatic patients refractory to conservative therapy and in patients with a doubtful clinical diagnosis with lesions that are highly suspicious for being malignant. The treatment of choice is pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple's procedure). Casetti et al. reported complete resolution of pain in 76% of the patients.

Pancreaticoduodenectomy has effectively managed the main symptoms of groove pancreatitis, pain, and weight loss. In 2007, Rahman et al. reported an increase in body weight and relief of chronic abdominal pain in all patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy.

However, preserving the pylorus and duodenum is not always achievable because of the extensive fibrosis around the duodenal region.
