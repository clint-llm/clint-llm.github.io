The ciliary ganglion can get injured during surgical management of trauma of lateral wall of the orbit, space-occupying lesions of orbit, cavernous sinus angiomas like conditions. Due to its proximity, it can easily get affected by optic or nasociliary neuromas.

During eye surgeries, the clinician gives a peribulbar block above and below the orbit. In this block, ciliary nerves, oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve get blocked, but the optic nerve is not affected.
