One person may place someÂ splints, but traction splints require 2 or more people. One person should hold manual traction while the other person places the splint. Analgesia and sedation are needed to place transfemoral/transtibial skeletal traction pins, and this will require potentially other physicians, nursing support, and possibly respiratory therapy or other support staff where available.
