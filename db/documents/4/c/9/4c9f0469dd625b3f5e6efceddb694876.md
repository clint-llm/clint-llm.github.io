Current guidelines with which to be familiar (as presented by the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome) include:

- IAH is diagnosed by sustained or repeated elevation in IAP of 12 mm Hg

- ACS is diagnosed when the IAP is >20 mm Hg, and is associated with organ dysfunction/failure

- IAH grade I: IAP 12-15 mm Hg; grade II: IAP 16-20 mm Hg; grade III: IAP 21-25 mm Hg; grade IV: IAP >25 mm Hg

- A trialÂ of neuromuscular blockade can be used to alleviate compressive symptoms in ACS to while awaiting surgical decompression
