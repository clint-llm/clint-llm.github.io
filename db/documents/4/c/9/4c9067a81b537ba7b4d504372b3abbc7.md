Potential indications for radical orchidectomy include both clinical and biochemical suspicion of testicular tumors. Testicular cancers are common in males aged 15 to 35years. They present as a painless enlarging, usually unilateral intra-scrotal mass arising from the testis. Pain or discomfort in the testis, dull ache in the groin or lower abdomen, breast tenderness, or gynecomastia may also be presenting symptoms of testicular cancer. Late symptoms may include weight loss, low back pain, abdominal mass, chest pain, cough, or hemoptysis due to retroperitoneal lymph node metastases or lung metastases.

Biochemical investigations include tumor markers, which are alpha-fetoprotein, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, and lactate dehydrogenase. Ultrasonography reveals vascular hypoechoic testicular lesions. Ultrasonography is very sensitive in the early detection of testicular tumors, with over 95% of testicular parenchymal abnormalities identifiable on routine ultrasound scans. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen and pelvis help with the preoperative staging.

Radical orchidectomy is both diagnostic and therapeutic in the management of suspected testicular cancer. This procedure is the mainstay for confirming the diagnosis of testicular cancer and achieving a cure. However, it is essential to exclude other conditions involving the testes and scrotum, which may mimic testicular neoplasms, including testicular torsion, epididymo-orchitis, hydrocoele, and inguinal hernias. Any other testicular pathology with no malignant suspicion is accessible via a scrotal incision with no concern over metastatic seeding to inguinal lymph nodes. However, these classify as simple orchidectomies rather than radical.

Clinical history and examination are vital in the assessment of testicular tumors.
