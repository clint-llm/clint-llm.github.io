Apocrine glands can be examined using a variety of histochemical and immunohistochemical stains. Hematoxylin and eosin staining reveal eosinophilic cytoplasm within the secretory cells of apocrine glands. Staining with Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) allows for visualization of distinct PAS-positive, diastase-resistant mitochondria-like granules within the secretory portion of the gland. The granules also contain epidermal growth factor (EGF), which allows for an additional staining technique. These granules frequently also contain iron and can be visualized with acid-fast stains. Other targets for specific stains to visualize apocrine glands include luminal cell membranes with sialidase-sensitive anionic sites and antibodies that react with apocrine sweat glands but not with eccrine sweat glands (HMFG-1 1.10.F3 monoclonal antibody and antibody raised against purified 70 kD glycoprotein in human milk fat globule membranes). An additional marker for staining is Keratin AE1. Common markers of both eccrine and apocrine sweat glands include GCDFP-15, carcinoembryonic antigen, and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) detected by anti-EMA monoclonal antibody (E29).
