The current gold standard of cardiac surgical myocardial protection is the administration of cardioplegia. The optimal temperature of the cardioplegia solution is a topic of debate. Early cardioplegic methods used cold crystalloid solutions to induce and maintain cardiac arrest during heart surgery. Although hypothermia has the advantage of decreasing myocardial oxygen demand, it has been criticized for impairing the homeostatic processes of the myocardium. Normothermic or warm-blood cardioplegia provides a metabolically balanced milieu for the myocardium and helps in the resuscitation of energy-depleted myocardium. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, outlines the role of warm blood cardioplegia, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for warm blood cardioplegia.
- Describe the preparation and technique in regards to warm blood cardioplegia.
- Review the potential complications with warm blood cardioplegia.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to understand warm blood cardioplegia and improve outcomes.
