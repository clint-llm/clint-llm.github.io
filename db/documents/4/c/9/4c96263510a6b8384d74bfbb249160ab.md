The rectum is the most distal portion of the large intestine, bound by the sigmoid colon proximally and converging into the anal canal distally. This segment of the intestine derives its name from Latin intestinum rectum meaning “straight intestine,” describing its course compared to the tortuous appearance of the rest of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Coursing within the pelvis, the rectum is the most posterior visceral organ in the pelvic cavity with differing anatomical relationships to male and female structures.
