Osteopathic manipulative medicine involves an assortment of manual techniques and is utilized by many osteopathic physicians to treat a wide range of conditions. Low back pain is a common complaint encountered by many clinicians and proves to be challenging to diagnose and treat.

These techniques were initially developed by Dr. Fred Mitchell, Sr. and later refined by Dr. Fred Mitchell, Jr., both osteopathic physicians. MET maneuvers employ an isotonic contraction produced by the patient to engage the dysfunction and is restricted by the physician with a counterforce. Each contraction is repeated three to five times with a relaxation and stretch phase in between as the physician moves the patient in a controlled motion until meeting the next barrier. The isometric contraction creates a reciprocal inhibition and relaxation of the antagonistic muscle, effectively treating soft tissue restrictive barriers and mobilizing joints. This process, in turn, reduces pain and improves circulation.
