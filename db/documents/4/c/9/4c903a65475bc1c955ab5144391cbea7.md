Two databases exist which provide a systematic exclusion of the population of people that are not “normal”: NHANES-III (the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) database and the Scripps-Kaiser database.

Through these databases, one can see there is no difference in hemoglobin values of men from 20 to 59 or women 20 to 49. This assists in studying patient populations whose values do fall out of the norm from these ranges.

African Americans are found to have a lower limit of normal hemoglobin concentration, lower serum transferrin saturation, higher serum ferritin levels, lower bilirubin levels, and lower leukocyte counts. This is thought to be due to the higher frequency of alpha-thalassemia and G6PD deficiency in the black population. G6PD deficiency is known to affect millions of people worldwide.

Although it can be seen worldwide, HE is most predominantly seen in malaria-endemic regions of West Africa.

Overall hemolytic anemias cover a broad range of age groups, races, and both genders as several subcategories can be acquired or inherited.
