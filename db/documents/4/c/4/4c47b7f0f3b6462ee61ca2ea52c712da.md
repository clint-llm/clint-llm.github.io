Despite the decrease in mortality, neonatal meningitis continues to have high morbidity. Global mortality estimates are approximately 190,000 cases per year.

A study from Tunisia revealed a neurologic complication rate of 21.6%. Respiratory distress, low birth weight, shock, and pleocytosis of fewer than 500 cells/mm3 were indicators of a worse prognosis. Adding ofloxacin to the antibiotic regimen was associated with decreased neurological sequelae in survivors.

Most reviews report that infection severity correlates with outcomes, but there is no difference in outcome by pathogens.

Seizures, irritability, bulging anterior fontanelle, and nuchal rigidity have been associated with poor outcomes. Other predictors of poor outcomes in survivors of neonatal bacterial meningitis include somnolence/coma, hypotension, and leukopenia.

The prognosis for neonates with enteroviral and parechovirus meningitis appears favorable. One study indicated that despite abnormal MRIs in 35% of neonates, all had normal neurodevelopmental, visual, and hearing exams at 12 months of life.
