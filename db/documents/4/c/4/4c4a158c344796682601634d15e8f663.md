The management of obesity involves a multidisciplinary approach that starts with behavioral/lifestyle modification, pharmacological therapy, and surgical methods if all of the above fails. In addition, physicians, nurses, nutritionists, and other allied health care professional services are required to achieve realistic goals.

**Behavioural/Lifestyle Changes**

- Weight loss of >5% significantly reduces cardiovascular risk factors, e.g., elevated blood pressure, blood glucose, and lipids. Aim for 5 to 10% of weight loss or 0.5 to 1 kg (1 to 2 lb) per week for six months

- Engage healthcare team for advising lifestyle modification, and arrange group as well as individual sessions

- Reduce energy intake by 500 to 1000 kcal/day

- Moderate intensity exercises initially for 30 min 3 to 5 times/week, eventually >60 min on most days of the week. Clinical evaluation is essential before beginning an activity program.

- Cognitive-behavioral therapy also plays a part.

- Regular monitoring with advice on weight maintenance, reinforcing healthy eating habits, and promoting physical activity

- Weight monitoring every three months.

- Calculate BMI and WC every 1 to 2 years.

**Pharmacological Interventions**

Consider pharmacologic intervention if the patient has not lost 0.5 to 1 kg (1 to 2 lb) per week for 3 to 6 months after lifestyle modifications. Medications are used as an adjunct to lifestyle changes. Although the recommendations are against using medications for weight loss, some patients prefer them and can be good candidates for pharmacologic management. There is better evidence of benefit from behavioral modification alone, and NNH (number needed to harm) is as low as 10 with drugs, primarily due to gastrointestinal (GI) side effects.

Pharmacotherapy options for weight loss have considerably evolved over the last ten years.

By 2012, only two weight loss drugs were approved to be used in the US, phentermine, and orlistat. In contrast, only orlistat is approved for use in Europe. Four new drugs showed good efficacies and responder success rates in clinical trials and were approved by FDA after 2012. Lorcaserin and liraglutide are single therapy agents that act on 5-HT2c receptors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), respectively. Fixed-dose combinations include extended-release phentermine HCl/topiramate and naltrexone HCl/bupropion, and they have complex polypharmacology.

Only two of them, liraglutide and naltrexone/bupropion, are approved for weight loss by the EMEA. Interestingly, the placebo-adjusted weight loss of drug combinations such as phentermine/topiramate is remarkably greater than other approved drugs and provided a basis for new combination approaches in treating obesity.

Start drug therapy if BMI > 27 kg/m^2 with risk factors or BMI ≥ 30 kg/m^2 alone. Orlistat is a favored drug, and it decreases fat absorption by inhibiting gastrointestinal lipase, particularly pancreatic lipase. However, this medication is associated with several adverse effects and is not approved to use for more than two years. It is also avoided in patients with GI diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease or chronic bowel disorders.

**Surgical Treatment**

Consider when lifestyle, medications, and other weight loss attempts fail to obtain desired goals. Bariatric surgery is a term used collectively for various procedures that change the digestive tract and help lose weight. The main procedures are biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS), gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y), and sleeve gastrectomy. Bariatric surgery is not without risks. It has the potential for post-operative and long-term complications and requires lifelong monitoring.  The candidates for surgery are those having BMI ≥ 40 kg/m^2 or BMI ≥ 35 kg/m^2 and at least one or more comorbidities like type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sleep apnea, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, osteoarthritis, lipid metabolism disorders, gastrointestinal diseases, and heart diseases.
