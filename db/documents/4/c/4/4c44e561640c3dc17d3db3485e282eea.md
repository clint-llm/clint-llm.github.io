Cervical discogenic pain syndrome can be caused by degenerative changes in the intervertebral discs. These changes are usually caused by mechanical influences. Predisposing factors include sitting with prolonged neck flexion or with a protruded head posture, frequent flexion, sudden unexpected movements, and trauma. Sports-related spine injuries may also predispose individuals to CDPS.
