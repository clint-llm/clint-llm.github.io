Due to the short-term, periodic nature of calcium carbonate/antacid use and the small dose of calcium carbonate used for supplementation, most adverse effects are minor. However, if large doses are taken for an extended time or abused, overdose can occur. The patient can experience moderate to severe side effects of an overdose.

- Coma

- Confusion

- Irregular heart rhythms

- Muscle twitching

- Bone pain

- Abdominal pain

- Pancreatitis

- Acute renal failure

- Kidney stones

- Headache

- Milk-alkali syndrome

- Gall stones

Milk-alkali syndrome was historically a much more common severe side effect.

Common Side Effects

- High calcium levels

- Low phosphate levels

- Vomiting

- Nausea

- Constipation

- Gas

- Loss of appetite/anorexia

- Irritability

- Xerostomia

- Acid rebound

Additional side-effects occur in individuals taking calcium carbonate as a phosphate binder to treat hyperphosphatemia, including calcification of vascular tissues and death.
