The patient is visually asymptomatic and lipemia retinalis is most often detected during a routine ophthalmic workup or workup of a referral case related to lipid abnormalities. Neonates and infants have been diagnosed as LR during screening and treatment for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP ).

The physical examination should be done to look for evaluation of the cardiovascular system, the integumentary system, the abdomen, and the eye. Examination of the cardiovascular system includes the examination of heart sounds, carotid or renal bruits, and peripheral pulses. Characteristic skin lesions include xanthomas which are small yellowish papules, with an erythematous base, appearing predominantly on the buttocks and elbows due to deposition of large amounts of chylomicron triglycerides in cutaneous histiocytes.

- Examination of the periorbital area may reveal:

- Xanthelasma,
- Tuberous palpebral xanthomas

- Anterior segment findings, though rare, include:

- Conjunctival xanthomas,
- Corneal arcus senilis, and arcus juvenilis,
- Lipid keratopathy,
- Anterior chamber lipemia
- Iris xanthomas

- The dilated fundoscopic exam is needed for the diagnosis and staging of LR.

- Additional rare posterior segment findings of hyperlipoproteinemia include:

- retinal xanthomas
- choroidal xanthomas
- Adult-onset Coat disease
