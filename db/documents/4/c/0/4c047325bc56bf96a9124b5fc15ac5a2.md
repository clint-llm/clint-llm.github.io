Measles is a helical symmetry virus, with non-segmented negative polarity RNA, a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, and the morbillivirus genus. It contains approximately 15,894 nucleotides, encoding eight viral proteins within six genes [nucleoprotein (H), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), the fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin (H), and the polymerase (L)] as well as having an RNA-bound RNA polymerase. The HN glycoprotein has neuraminidase and hemagglutinating activities in different places of the same molecule, which explains the absorption and lysis of the host receptors. The fusion glycoprotein is responsible for viral penetration into the host cell, as it stimulates the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. The matrix forms the basis of the lipid coat. The gene of P encodes the mRNAs for the C and V proteins, and these proteins have involvement in the regulation of host cell immune response.
