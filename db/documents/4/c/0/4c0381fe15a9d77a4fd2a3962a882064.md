"I need that like I need a hole in the head" is a colloquialism used to emphasize the fact that someone does not need something. If one examines this saying from an anatomical standpoint, a hole in the skull is referred to as a foramen (pl. foramina). The skull is a crucial osseous structure that houses a network of neurovascular and lymphatic vessels. For these networks to traverse and communicate with the entire body, the foramina must provide passage through the skull. The morphology of theÂ foramina creates a protective enclosure for these neurovascular and lymphatic bundles.
