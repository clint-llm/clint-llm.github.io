Proper stent size is important to prevent adverse events can from stent migration.  Several venous-dedicated stents have been withdrawn due to issues with stent deployment and migration. If the cross-sectional view of the vein in the area of compression is not accurately measured and the stent is undersized, migration of the stent may occur. Stent migration to the right atrium and intraspinal canal has also been described.

The landing zones of stent placement are usually in areas without the involvement of the disease.  Significant inflow disease of the CFV is commonly the primary anatomic cause of stent failure. Thus, adequate inflow is important to obtain before the placement of a venous stent. Avoidance of stent placement at the pelvic curvature or flexion points such as the inguinal ligament can prevent straightening or kinking of the vein leading to possible stent thrombosis. PTO scar extending from the popliteal vein or common femoral vein to the CIV or inferior vena cava requiring multiple stents may be a prognosis for early stent graft failure. Jailing of the contralateral CIV may lead to subsequent contralateral DVT with recurrent ulcers.
