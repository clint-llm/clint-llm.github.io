Absolute contraindications to the radiotracer are very few and rare. History of severe anaphylactic reaction to the radiotracer is the only absolute contraindication.

Relative contraindications mainly concern patient preparation.

Various drugs may modulate the biliary system and therefore should be screened for before commencing the exam. The most commonly encountered interfering medications are the opiates, given that they are frequently used to treat patients' acute or chronic pain. Opiates, particularly morphine, cause increased tone in the sphincter of Oddi which results in a functional obstruction at the ampulla of Vater that can mimic a true anatomic obstruction. Thus, if there is clinical concern for biliary obstruction, opiates should be withheld for at least 6 hours prior to the exam to avoid a potential false-positive result. Similarly, opiates may decrease contractility of the gallbladder and thus should be withheld prior to the assessment for chronic gallbladder disease to avoid a spuriously low measured gallbladder ejection fraction.

Other medications associated with poor gallbladder contractility require an evaluation of the risk of medication modification or cessation before assessment for chronic gallbladder disease. These medications include

- Atropine

- Benzodiazepines

- Ethanol

- Indomethacin

- Nicotine

- Nifedipine

- Oral contraceptives

- Octreotide

- Theophylline
