Information on toxicity with ofloxacin is limited. One case report of accidental overdosage has been described in which an adult female received 3 grams of ofloxacin intravenously over 45 minutes. The patient developed dizziness, hot and cold flushes, drowsiness, nausea, slurring of speech, and mild to moderate disorientation during the infusion. Laboratory testing detected no clinically significant changes in routine parameters in this patient.

In overdose cases, gastric lavage and sufficient hydration are the recommended interventions. Unfortunately, no antidotes exist, and dialysis treatments are ineffective in reversing toxicity.
