Arteriovenous malformations are composed of a central vascular nidus which is a conglomerate of arteries and veins. There is no intervening capillary bed, and the feeding arteries drain directly into the draining veins by one or multiple fistulae. These arteries lack the normal muscularis layer and the draining veins often appear dilated due to the shunted high-velocity arterial blood flow entering through the fistulae.

AVMs cause neurological dysfunction through the following three possible pathophysiological mechanisms. Firstly, the abnormal blood vessels have a propensity to bleed resulting in hemorrhage occurring in the subarachnoid space, the intraventricular space, or, more commonly in the brain parenchyma. Secondly, in the absence of hemorrhage, seizures may occur as a consequence of the mass effect of AVM or venous hypertension in draining veins. The third important cause of slowly progressive neurological deficits is attributed to the"steal phenomenon" which is thought to be related to normal brain parenchyma deprivation from nutrients and oxygen, as blood bypasses the normal capillary bed to the malformed arteriovenous channels.
