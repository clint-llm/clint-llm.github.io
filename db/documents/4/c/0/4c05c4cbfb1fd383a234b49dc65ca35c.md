As an ocular disclosing agent, fluorescein sodium dissolves readily in aqueous alkaline solutions, responds to 465 to 490 nm at cobalt blue light, and fluoresces at 520 to 530 nm as bright green. The compound contains a conjugated system that illuminates when electrons spend a prolonged time in an excited state. It is often administered in combination with a local anesthetic such as proparacaine or benzoxinate, which inhibits sodium ion channels to stabilize nerve cell membranes to inhibit nerve impulse conduction.

When using fluorescein to stain cells, its charged ends become attracted to the hydrophilic ends in the cell membrane to form a strong electrostatic bond. One or more of the charged ends of fluorescein may then be modified for greater interaction.
