Team-based practices are necessary for performing a successful craniotomy procedure. Interaction between the neurosurgeon and the anesthesiologist usually happens even before the patient is in the operating room by discussing the case and the desired approach. Discussing the necessary equipment with the operating room head nurse is essential. A discussion of non-anesthetic agents to be administered by the anesthetist takes place before commencing the incision. Once the patient is under general anesthesia, effective communication between the anesthesia team and the neurosurgeon during the procedure minimizes complications and unexpected events.

Postoperative care for a patient who has undergone a craniotomy also involves an interprofessional team including intensive care unit nursing personnel, and in some cases, speech pathologists, physical medicine and rehabilitation physician, practical nurses, physical therapists, respiratory therapists, and even discharge planning team and social work team personnel.
