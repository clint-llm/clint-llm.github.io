Knowledge of post-operative complications is required due to the complexity and range of cardiopulmonary symptoms. Post-operative imaging includes chest X-rays and MRI/CT during early post-operative care. Long-term, MR phase-contrast imaging and nuclear lung perfusion canÂ demonstrate differences in lung flow. Bronchoscopy will need to be employed to evaluate granulation tissue development and possibly balloon dilatation.

With a variety of surgical strategies, children benefit from a multidisciplinary, team-based approach, and surveillance for improved surgical outcomes.
