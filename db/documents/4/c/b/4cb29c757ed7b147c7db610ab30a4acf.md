Codeine is the most commonly taken opioid medication. It is at the center of the opioid addiction problem in the United States and thus is highly regulated. Codeine's main indications are pain and dry cough.

**FDA-approved Indication**

**Pain**

Codeine plays a role in the treatment of mild to moderate pain. Its use is recognized in chronic pain due to ongoing cancer and palliative care. However, the use of codeine to treat other types of chronic pain remains controversial. Chronic pain, defined by the "international association for the study of pain," is pain persisting beyond the standard tissue healing time of three months.

Care must be taken with the prescription of codeine as follows

- Before initiating codeine therapy, clinicians must perform a history, physical examination, and essential testing, including assessing the risk of substance addiction, misuse, or abuse.

- Clinicians must consider codeine as an option if the pain has a deleterious effect on the quality of life and the benefits of the therapy outweigh potential risks.

- Initial treatment with codeine must be discussed by the health care providers and the patients as a therapeutic trial to determine whether the therapy is appropriate.

- A risk-benefit evaluation is necessary on an ongoing basis with the therapy.

**Non-FDA-approved Indications**

**Cough**

Codeine is useful in the treatment of various etiologies producing chronic cough. Also, 46% of patients with chronic cough do not have a distinct etiology despite a proper diagnostic evaluation.

**Restless Leg Syndrome**

Codeine is effective in treating refractory restless leg syndrome when given at night. However, the dose prescribed should be low, and patients should be non-responders to all other standard treatment protocols for RLS.

**Persistent Diarrhea (Palliative)**

Codeine and loperamide are equally effective, and the choice between them has its basis in assessing the physician evaluating the small but undoubted addictive potential of codeine versus the higher cost of loperamide and an individual difference in patient's vulnerability to adverse effects.
