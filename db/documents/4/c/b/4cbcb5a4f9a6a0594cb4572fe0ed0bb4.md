Contraindications for using fibric acids include a history of hypersensitivity to the drugs in the class, patients with active liver disease, severe renal dysfunction, and preexisting gallbladder disease. Fibric acids are excreted in breast milk and may interfere with infant lipid metabolism. Therefore, fibric acids are contraindicated in women who are breastfeeding.Â Fibric acids, as a class, are pregnancy category C. There is a documented case of a 30-year-old female who received fenofibrate for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. The patient was on fenofibrate therapy for one year. Afterward, it was discovered during a gynecologic visit that this patient had an unplanned pregnancy at eight weeks gestation, and abruptly, fenofibrate therapy was discontinued. It is worth noting that the patient delivered a healthy male infant without congenital malformation.

Fibric acids may also interact with other drugs and require dose or frequency adjustments. Monitoring and/or selection of a new therapy should also be considered in such cases. Rhabdomyolysis and myopathy have been reported when fibric acids are administered in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or colchicine and patients with hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, or renal failure. The only fibric acid with FDA approval for use in combination with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) is fenofibric acid.
