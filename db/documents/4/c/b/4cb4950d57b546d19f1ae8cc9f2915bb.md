Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a common fungal infection in uncontrolled asthmatics, cystic fibrosis patients, and immunocompromised patients. Early diagnosis and rapid implementation of proper management are critical to prevent complications and/or disease progression. Diagnosis centers around classic clinical manifestations, radiographic findings, and immunological findings. This activity describes the etiology, evaluation, and management of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.
- Describe the clinical and imaging modalities used to diagnose allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.
- Explain how to educate high-risk patients on the prevention of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.
