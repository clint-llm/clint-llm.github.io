Both the lesions in LS can be congenital or acquired. The incidence rate of congenital ASD in patients with MS is 0.6% to 0.7%. As the number of patients having MS undergoing trans-catheter BMV is increasing, the incidence of residual ASD is increasing resulting in a greater number of patients with iatrogenic LS. Congenital MS is a very rare entity accounting for only 0.6% of congenital heart disease. Mitral stenosis in LS is invariably due to RHD. Assuming a relatively uniform incidence of ASD worldwide, the incidence of co-existing rheumatic MS depends on the geographic prevalence of RHD.
