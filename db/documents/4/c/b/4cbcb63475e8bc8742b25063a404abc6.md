While primary peritoneal mesothelioma rarely occurs, peritoneal carcinomatosis: PC (tumor infiltration of the peritoneum) is most commonly seen in abdominopelvic malignancies. It is a common manifestation in gastrointestinal and gynecological tumors during tumor disease because several gastrointestinal and gynecological malignancies have the potential to progress into the peritoneal cavity.

Several risk factors can be cited: locally advanced carcinoma, mucosal tumors, tumor perforation, and tumor opening during resection.

In colorectal cancer, the peritoneum is the second most common metastatic site and has a poor prognosis with a median survival of 6 to 9 months without treatment.

According to population-based studies, colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis prevalence varies between 5% to 10% in patients with colorectal cancer.

Globally and each year, 240,000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and epithelial carcinomas account for about 90% of all cases. Due to its clinical presentation often and unfortunately in advanced stages, ovarian cancer is classified as a malignancy of the peritoneal surface.

Primary forms, such as peritoneal mesothelioma and peritoneal carcinoma, must be differentiated from the peritoneal spread of malignant tumors, either gastrointestinal tract or ovarian; a median survival of 6 months for colorectal cancer and 3 months for gastric cancer shows a clearly limited prognosis. Results for peritoneal mesothelioma with systemic chemotherapy are similar. The probability of survival is better for advanced ovarian cancer, for which a median survival of up to 2 years is possible.

Treatment should be multimodal and include preoperative systemic chemotherapy, complete cytoreductive surgery, and intraabdominal hyperthermia combined with intraoperative chemotherapy.

Thus the complete surgical cytoreduction possible is decisive for the prognosis, which requires multiple organ resections in addition to a partial to subtotal parietal peritonectomy.

To quantify the extent of peritoneal metastases and determine the feasibility of tumor reduction, a surgical variable is used (index of peritoneal carcinomatosis: PCI). Indeed, depending on the pathologies, there is a threshold value beyond which the procedure does not improve survival**.**

In addition to an excessively high PCI, the invasion of certain sites also contraindicates cytoreduction surgery. These are the root of the mesentery, the hepatic pedicle, the retroperitoneum, and the bladder. Major damage to the small bowel, which potentially could induce short bowel syndrome, is also a contraindication.

Complete macroscopic cytoreduction is the basis for successful multimodal therapy.

First described by Spratt in 1980 in animal experiments and known as a thermal transfusion infiltration system, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy represents a concept of multimodal therapy increasingly used in the management of peritoneal carcinoma and more in the following decades and is now an integral part of the treatment of primary and secondary peritoneal tumors. This involves administering cytotoxic agents into the peritoneal cavity at an elevated temperature (41 to 43 degrees C) to promote their absorption by neoplastic nodules.

Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has become the treatment of choice for treating peritoneal metastases from ovarian, stomach, or colorectal cancers.

Nowadays, surgical cytoreduction combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS / HIPEC) has radically changed the approach of patients with malignant tumors of the peritoneum, which has improved the prognosis of appendicular, colorectal, and ovarian tumors, as well as peritoneal mesothelioma.

This topic explains and describes the principles and importance of HIPEC in the concept of multimodal therapy for patients with malignant tumors of the peritoneum.
