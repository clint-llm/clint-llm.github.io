Prolactin contributes to hundreds of physiologic functions, but the two primary responsibilities are milk production and the development of mammary glands within breast tissues. Prolactin promotes the growth of mammary alveoli, which are the components of the mammary gland, where the actual production of milk occurs. Prolactin stimulates the breast alveolar epithelial cells to synthesize milk components, including lactose (i.e., the carbohydrate of milk), casein (i.e., the protein of milk), and lipids. The prolactin receptors are down-regulated on mammary glandular tissue during periods of elevated progesterone levels (i.e., during pregnancy).

After delivery, the serum progesterone level drops, allowing for the up-regulation of prolactin receptors on the mammary alveolar cells, therefore enabling lactogenesis. Even after delivery, prolactin levels will not continuously remain at elevated levels. Prolactin levels will only spike during periods of nipple stimulation allowing for control over milk production. As long as suckling is maintained, prolactin levels stay elevated. During periods when the mother is not breastfeeding, the prolactin levels decline to a basal level, and mammary gland milk production reduces.Â If the mother does not nurse her baby, prolactin levels fall to non-pregnant levels after 1 to 2 weeks.
