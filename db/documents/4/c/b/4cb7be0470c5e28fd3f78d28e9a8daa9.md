Ketoconazole is available in tablet form and as a topical agent in creams, foams, and shampoos.

Topical ketoconazole is only for external use. It should not be ingested or used intravaginally. The eyes and mucous membranes should also be avoided. Patients should apply the cream and gel only to the affected area and the areas immediately surrounding it. The foam should be applied directly to the infected area to avoid melting in the hands. Handwashing is necessary after the application of the cream and gel to prevent any adverse reactions from the medication. The shampoo application should be slathered onto the scalp and rinsed thoroughly.
