Toric IOLs are ideal for candidates with preexisting corneal astigmatism greater than 1 D.

- Age-related cataracts with corneal astigmatism: Toric IOLs are indicated in patients with preexisting corneal astigmatism of >1.00 D and a significant grade of cataract planned for cataract surgery.

- Corneal ectatic disorders: Patients with mild-to-moderate grades of keratoconus and other ectasias with regular astigmatism, which has been stable over time, are also suitable candidates. Off-label use of customized IOLs may also benefit patients with irregular astigmatism but should be prescribed only after assessing patient expectations.

- In patients who have undergone penetrating keratoplasty and who have high levels of irregular astigmatism and stable keratometry post-suture removal, customized or conventional toric IOLs can be implanted.

- They may also be used in patients with stable astigmatism due to corneal scars following healed corneal ulcers, pterygium excision, and corneal tear repairs.
