A discussion of fluid movement across membranes would be incomplete without a discussion of Starling forces. Blood pressure within a capillary (approximately 36 mmHg), referred to as the capillary hydrostatic pressure(P), constitutes an outward filtration force from the plasma space to the interstitium.

Net flow of fluid across a capillary wall = (K) * [filtration forces - reabsorptive forces]

or

Net flow = (K) * [(P + π) - (P + π)]

P = blood pressure, π = colloid osmotic pressure; and the subscripts: c = capillary, i = interstitial fluid

These forces change along the length of the capillary, with the greatest changes occurring with blood pressure. At the arteriolar end of the capillary, the blood pressure is roughly 36 mmHg and falls to about 15 mm Hg at the venous end of the capillary. The colloid osmotic pressure at the arteriolar end remains relatively constant at about 25 mmHg

Importantly, the Starling forces only describe the movement of water across membranes in the vascular system and the mechanism behind constancy in vascular volume.
