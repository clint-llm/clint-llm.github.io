The Sylvian fissure is the most consistent and distinct landmark of the lateral hemispheric surface of the brain.

The first depiction of the lateral fissure of the brain is attributed to Girolamo Fabrici dâ€™Acquapendente, in one of the plates of his Tabulae Pictae, from 1600. Forty-one years later, in 1641, Thomas Bartholin published the first description and graphic representation of the fissure in the book Casp. Bartolini Institutiones Anatomicae.
