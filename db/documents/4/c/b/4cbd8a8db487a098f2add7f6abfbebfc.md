The deltoid muscle is primarily responsible for the abduction of the arm. It contributes to lateral rotation and extension of the posterior fibers, as well as medial rotation and flexion of the anterior fibers. It originates from the lateral third of the clavicle, the acromion, and the spine of the scapula, and inserts at the deltoid tuberosity of the lateral humerus. Teres minor is one of the muscles which stabilize the glenohumeral joint. It acts by laterally rotating the arm and helps to keep the head of the humerus in the shoulder capsule.
