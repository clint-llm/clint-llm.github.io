Unlike synthetic substances and alcohol, cannabis is a more complex drug. Consumption or inhalation of the botanical exposes the user to hundreds of compounds, including cannabinoids (e.g., THC and cannabidiol) and non-cannabinoids (e.g., terpenes and flavonoids), many of which are bioactive compounds.

**Absorption, Distribution, and Metabolism**

THC, the principal psychoactive and addictive component is most commonly smoked. It is rapidly absorbed by the lungs and distributed systemically via perfusion. The rapid influence on the brain contributes to its pleasure and abuse potential.

Chronic daily smokers can produce detectable levels of THC and its metabolites one month after their last intake.

It isÂ worth noting that the pharmacokinetics of THC is further complicated with multiple factors such as its physical/chemical form, route of administration, genetics, and concurrent consumption of alcohol.
