Prognosis is excellent for complete recovery with the notable exceptions of complicated ocular exposures and persistent systemic symptoms.  With appropriate ophthalmologic or other specialty care in a tertiary referral hospital, full recovery is the expectation.  There are rare reports of deaths due to caterpillar exposure/envenomation but these are usually the result of inadequate medical resources/care or in austere locations.
