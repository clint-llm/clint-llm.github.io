Acute attacks of acute intermittent porphyria are more frequent in women, especially in the post-pubertal age group. The acute attacks of AIP are typically triggered by certain factors, which include several drugs, infection, fasting, alcohol, steroid hormones, as stated above.

In acute intermittent porphyria, the neurologic damage occurs due to the accumulation of the porphyrin precursors, porphobilinogen, and aminolevulinic acid (ALA). The AIP-associated neurological damage manifests as peripheral and autonomic neuropathies and psychiatric manifestations.

The exact mechanism by which elevated levels of porphobilinogen and ALA lead to symptomatic disease remains enigmatic because most patients with the genetic defect do not present with symptoms despite excessive porphyrin secretion.

A recent (2017) case-control study in 50 patients reported the association of acute intermittent porphyria with systemic inflammation. Storjord et al. found that the levels of insulin, C-peptide, prealbumin, and markers of kidney function, were decreased in symptomatic patients only, sparing the asymptomatic ones. They postulated that in symptomatic patients of AIP, reduced insulin release is associated with enhanced disease activity and compromised kidney function.
