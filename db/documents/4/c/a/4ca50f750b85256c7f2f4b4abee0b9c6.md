Patients with neurosyphilis should be admitted for the initiation of antibiotics as they would require inpatient treatment.

Treatment of neurosyphilis currently includes two regimens recommended by the CDC.

- Penicillin G 3 to 4 million units is given intravenously every 4 hours for 10 to 14 days, or Penicillin G 24 million units as a continuous infusion for 10 to 14 days

- Procaine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly daily plus probenecid 500mg PO four times a day for 10 to 14 days

Both are options after penicillin desensitization in those with a penicillin allergy.

Ceftriaxone is another therapeutic option with the regimen being 2g IV or IM daily for 10 to 14 days.

Patients with a high titer of secondary syphilis can develop Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which is an immune-mediated self-limited reaction that occurs within 2 to 24 hours of treatment and is characterized by high fever, headache, myalgias, and rash.

Patients need to be followed post-treatment at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months with serial non-treponemal tests. AÂ 4-fold decline in these tests indicates successful treatment.

The CDC recommends a follow-up CSF exam every six months until the abnormalities resolve; if CSF continues to be abnormal after two years, retreatment should be considered.
