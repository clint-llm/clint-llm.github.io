Alternative diagnoses on the differential of aortic dissection include the following life-threatening conditions: myocardial infarction, aortic aneurysm, cardiac tamponade (from another cause), esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome),Â  spontaneous pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, and stroke / transient ischemic attack. If a patient presents with abdominal pain, renal or biliary colic, bowel obstruction/perforation, non-dissection-related mesenteric ischemia should be considered. Pulse deficit can be a sign of non-dissection-related embolic phenomena or arterial occlusion.
