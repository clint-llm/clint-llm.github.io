In the United States, hip dislocations are responsible for significant morbidity and potentially mortality with deleterious consequences to the surrounding anatomy, neighboring joints, and an individual's functional ability. In the evaluation of posterior hip (femur) dislocation, whether the patient has a native hip versus a prosthetic hip joint is the first question any examiner should answer as the clinical approach varies significantly. Additionally, it is paramount to evaluate for associated injuries such as fractures, as this will also drastically alter management. Due to the traumatic nature and force required to dislocate a native hip joint, it is not surprising that 95% of patients who present with a hip dislocation after a motor vehicle collision had an associated injury requiring inpatient management. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of posterior hip dislocations and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanisms of injury and pathophysiology of posterior hip dislocation injuries.
- Summarize the diagnostic procedure for evaluating posterior hip dislocations, including any imaging needed.
- Review the treatment and rehabilitative options for posterior hip dislocation injuries.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by posterior hip dislocation.
