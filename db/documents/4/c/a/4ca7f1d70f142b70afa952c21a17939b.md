The diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors require coordination by physicians across numerous specialties. This care often involves a primary care provider who may help in the initial work-up of the disease as well as treatment compliance, an endoscopist who may be needed to visualize the disease or obtain biopsies, a skilled pathologist with experience in the diagnosis of GISTs, a surgeon to resect the disease when possible, a medical oncologist to conduct therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and a radiologist to evaluate the tumor before therapy as well as during treatment.
