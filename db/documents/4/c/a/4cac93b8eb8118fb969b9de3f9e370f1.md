A basic diabetic foot exam requires minimal specialty instruments and is performable by most primary care, podiatric, or other physicians.

The neurological evaluation requires a Semmes-Weinstein monofilament for neuropathy and protective-sensation testing. A 128Hz-tuning fork can test vibratory sensation, and cotton wool can test tactile sensation.

Vascular testing may require a Doppler ultrasound to assess blood flow.

During diabetic foot care, the caregiver may encounter ulcerations. If ulceration is present and requires debridement or offloading, scalpels, tissue nippers, and offloading padding (e.g., felt pads, foam pads, cushions) should be readily available.

For advanced wound care settings, an array of products should be available: gauze, cleaning solutions (e.g., saline, hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid), topical antimicrobials (e.g., povidone-iodine, cadexomer iodine, silver, medical-grade honey, moisture-retentive dressings (e.g., films, foams, alginates, hydrogels, hydrocolloids), vacuum-assisted closure devices, and bioengineered dressings.
