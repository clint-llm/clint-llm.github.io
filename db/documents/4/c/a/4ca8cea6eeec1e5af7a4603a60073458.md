The synthetic form of supplemental vitamin B12 has long been available as cyanocobalamin for oral and injectable use.

Vitamin B12 is a cofactor for two vital enzymes in the body: methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthase. These methylation reactions are responsible for annealing Okazaki fragments during DNA synthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**According to the manufacturer's product labeling, cyanocobalamin is rapidly absorbed from injection sites; and reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection.

**Distribution:**Absorbed vitamin B12 is transported via B12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II.

**Metabolism:**As described above, cyanocobalamin is converted in tissues into a cofactor for various metabolic processes.

**Excretion:**Cynocobaline is primarily excreted through the kidney. Approximately 50 to 98% of the injected cyanocobalamin is present in the urine. A significant portion is excreted within the first eight hours. About 3-8 mcg of cyanocobalamin is secreted into the GI tract daily via the bile, and a majority is absorbed back.
