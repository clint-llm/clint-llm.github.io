The etiology and pathogenesis ofÂ chronic lymphocytic leukemia involve a multi-step pathway that leads to a clonal expansion and proliferation of abnormal or malignant mature B lymphocytes. This clonal expansion of malignant B cells extends to the bone marrow, blood, and lymph nodes. Multiple influencing factors can lead to this clonal expansion, including antigenic triggers, cytogenetic abnormalities, and molecular abnormalities such as dysregulated mRNAs and B-cell receptor mutations.

Inherited genetic abnormalities and environmental factors play a role in the pathogenesis of CLL.

Family members of patients with CLL also have a high likelihood of developing monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis. Epigenetics has been shown to play a role in CLL, for example, histone modifications, such as those associated with active enhancer and promoter elements, and regions of the genome that were actively transcribed. Over-expression of transcription factor binding has also been found in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), which carry an increased risk of CLL.

Environmental factors associated with CLL include exposure to Agent Orange and insecticides. The U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs allows veterans access to benefits if they were exposed to Agent Orange while serving in the military.
