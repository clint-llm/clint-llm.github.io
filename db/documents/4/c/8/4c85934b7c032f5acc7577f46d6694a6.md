- Assess for possible iodine excess (including intravenous iodinated contrast study, medications containing iodine) before the procedure, and instruct a low iodine diet at least for 2 weeks. Some cases may need urine iodine testing to ensure optimum iodine level for I-131 scan and therapy.

- Discontinue certain medications (like amiodarone, thyroid hormones, thioamides) in a timely manner prior to the scan.

- Always interpret the scan results in correlation with patient clinical history, physical exam, and other biochemical findings.
