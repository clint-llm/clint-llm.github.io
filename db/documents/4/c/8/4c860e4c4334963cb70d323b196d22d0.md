Clinicians performing intercostal nerve block need to be well trained in recognizing the thoracic anatomy using the ultrasound and be familiar with anatomic variations as well. Besides that, to provide a safe technique, all the necessary equipment should be readily available, and good communication with the assistant during the procedure is crucial. Complications like hemopneumothorax, intravascular damage, or severe toxicity anesthetics-related should be minimized, and early recognition and urgent management by the providers of the regional block is mandatory. Multiple randomized trials found that a well organized interprofessional team of health workers from different specialties decreases the risk of severe adverse events while performing successful regional anesthesia.
