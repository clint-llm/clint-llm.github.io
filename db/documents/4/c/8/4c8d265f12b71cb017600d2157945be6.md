The diagnosis ofÂ vernal keratoconjunctivitis is based on clinical examination. The typical history and clinical signs lead to a straightforward diagnosis in most cases. Different staining techniques and associated scoring systems have been described to grade the severity of VKC. The fluorescein stain, lissamine green stain, and confocal microscopy are a few evaluation techniques that help score the severity and grade of involvement. Studies have proven that Oxford scores and Van Bijsterveld scores for evaluating epithelial damage are useful in patients with VKC. Further, the VKC-Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Keratoconus Study (VKC-CLEK) was found to be useful in assessing both limbal and tarsal epithelial damage in VKC patients.

Corneal topography is an additional investigation that should be considered in VKC patients. The use of videokeratography based on the Placido disc-based system has been proven useful in the early detection and prevention of severe forms of keratoconus. These investigations not only help detect subclinical keratoconus but also provide an opportunity for timely management of these cases and prevent further progression.
