There are a variety of hyperpigmentation disorders that appear in the flexural areas that must be differentiated from DDD. They include the following:

- Reticulate acropigmentation of Kitamura

- Manifests as atrophic hyperpigmented papules that coalesce into a reticulated pattern. It is differentiated from DDD by its initial distribution on acral surfaces and onset in childhood.

- Haber syndrome

- Initially presents as a photosensitive rosacea-like facial eruption during adolescence that is followed by keratotic papules, comedone-like lesions, pitted scars, and reticulate hyperpigmentation on the trunk, proximal extremities, and axillae. The initial facial eruption supports the classification of Haber's disease as a separate entity from DDD.

- Neurofibromatosis type 1

- Exhibits axillary and inguinal freckling that mirrors the reticulated hyperpigmentation of DDD but becomes easily distinguishable from DDD with the development of multiple neurofibromas and other cutaneous manifestations.

- Acanthosis nigricans

- Presents with velvety plaques that can be distinguished histologically from DDD by less elongation of the rete ridges and no follicular involvement.
