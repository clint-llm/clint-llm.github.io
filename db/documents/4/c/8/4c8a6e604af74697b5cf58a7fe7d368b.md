Sinus tachycardia is a regular cardiac rhythm in which the heart beats faster than normal and results in an increase in cardiac output. While it is common to have sinus tachycardia as a compensatory response to exercise or stress, it becomes concerning when it occurs at rest.

The presence of tachycardia at rest could be the earliest sign of serious pathology. Thus, it is crucial for the clinician to rapidly identify the underlying cause of tachycardia and determine if it indicates urgent evaluation and/or treatment.
