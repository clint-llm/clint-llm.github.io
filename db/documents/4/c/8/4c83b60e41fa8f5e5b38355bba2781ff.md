Education is mandatory for PCS patients, as well as their family members, relatives, and caretakers. Patients may experience anxiety about the symptoms and their long-term health-related consequences. Reassurance that symptoms are often worse in the first week or two after the injury, but typically improve over a few weeks and resolve within a few months, is a critical point to be stressed. Other physicians, members of the healthcare team, nurses, therapists, employers, attorneys, and representatives of medical insurance companies are to be educated in PCS.

Education will be the best tool for the treatment of the patient. This can be provided in a follow-up appointment or session with the patient, providing an information booklet, scheduled-up phone call addressing education, as well as follow-up multidisciplinary evaluations.
