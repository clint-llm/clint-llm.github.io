Clinicians should be aware that the tilt table is not 100% sensitive in making a diagnosis of syncope; other methods of evaluating the patient should also be undertaken.

The VASIS classification may be used when a neurocardiogenic reflex is provoked. In this case, mixed reaction, cardioinhibitory (asystole at least 3 seconds or bradycardia lower than 40/min lasting at least 10 seconds), and a vaso-depressive form may be recognized. However, other forms of hemodynamic instability may be present, including initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed orthostatic hypotension, or postural orthostatic tachycardia (increase in heart rate greater than 30/min or above 130/min). The neurocardiogenic reflex may be provoked by orthostatic hypotension or delayed orthostatic hypotension.
