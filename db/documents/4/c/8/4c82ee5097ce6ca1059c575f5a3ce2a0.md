The pathophysiology of age-related fertility decline in females is multifactorial. A decrease in the number of gametes and the integrity of those gametes is affected by age due to oocyte atresia over time and changes in the meiotic spindle, which can lead to aneuploidy.Â Other contributing factors include changes in ovulation patterns with age, aging of the uterus, and increased risk for complications.
