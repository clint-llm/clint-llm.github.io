During the second trimester, suspected prune belly syndrome may be detectable during the prenatal ultrasound screening.

In patients with severe renal dysplasia, pulmonary hypoplasia is a common finding. These patients are either stillborn or die in the early neonatal period. If alive at birth, these babies with pulmonary hypoplasia usually require aggressive neonatal resuscitation with various mechanical ventilation strategies. A chest radiograph is helpful to evaluate the pulmonary status, whichÂ generally shows small underdeveloped low volume lungs. A renal function panel should be ordered to assess renal status.

Once the neonate is stable, a renal and bladder ultrasound can take place, which helps evaluate the nature and severity of the urinary tract dysmorphism. Enlarged bladder with significant residual urine may be present due to weak bladder contraction.
