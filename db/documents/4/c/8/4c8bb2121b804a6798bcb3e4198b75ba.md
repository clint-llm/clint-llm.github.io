Cisatracurium besylate is an intermediate-acting, non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug (NMBD). Cisatracurium has a benzylisoquinolinium structure and is the 1R cis-1-prime R cis isomer of atracurium. As an NMBD, it has found use as an adjunct to general anesthesia facilitating tracheal intubation and providing skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery. It may also be used to provide skeletal muscle relaxation to facilitate mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit setting, but must be used with sedation. This activity reviews indications, mechanism of action, administration, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity associated with cisatracurium, and the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients who have received cisatracurium.

**Objectives:**
- Identify indications for use of cisatracurium.
- Describe the potential side effects of cisatracurium.
- Outline the recommended doses and recommended reversal medications for cisatracurium.
- Explain the importance of detailed handoffs and interpersonal communication with other professionals involved in the management of the patient that received cisatracurium.
