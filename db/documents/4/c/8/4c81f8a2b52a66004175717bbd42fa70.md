Dental caries occur when the demineralization of the enamel exceeds its demineralization capacity. Dental caries is a dynamic process that involves susceptible tooth surfaces, cariogenic bacteria, mainly Streptococcus mutans, and a fermentable carbohydrate source. Sucrose is the most common dietary sugar and is considered the most cariogenic carbohydrate. Frequent consumption of carbohydrates in the form of simple sugars increases the risk of dental caries. This article discusses the role of sugar in developing dental caries, provides concise dietary guidelines for expecting mothers, children, and adults, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in preventing dental caries through dietary education.

**Objectives:**
- Explain how sugars are classified and summarize the types of sweeteners available.
- Review the role of sugar in developing dental caries, including the impact of the amount and frequency of intake.
- Describe the dietary recommendations to prevent dental caries according to age.
- Outline the role of an interdisciplinary health care team in providing dietary advice to prevent dental caries.
