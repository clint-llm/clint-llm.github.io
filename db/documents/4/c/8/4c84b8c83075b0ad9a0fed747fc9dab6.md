A retropharyngeal abscess is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening diagnosis. This disease is most common in children under the age of five but also occurs in adults. Typically patients under the age of fiveÂ have an antecedent upper respiratory tract infection leading to suppurative cervical lymphadenitis and eventually retropharyngeal abscess. In older children and adults, a retropharyngeal abscess can be caused by trauma to the posterior pharynx, which leads to inoculation of the retropharyngeal space and results in abscess formation. Primary infections of the tonsils and of the dentition can also evolve into retropharyngeal abscesses, though more commonly into peritonsillar (Quinsy) or parapharyngeal abscesses, respectively. Direct expansion from spinal discitis or osteomyelitis is a rare cause of a retropharyngeal abscess as well. As a retropharyngeal abscess grows in size, it can lead to upper airway obstruction and asphyxiation. Treatment of retropharyngeal abscess ranges from prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics to surgical incision and drainage.
