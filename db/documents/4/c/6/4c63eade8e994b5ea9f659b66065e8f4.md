Computed tomographic (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are essential to rule out central causes of Tapia syndrome. CT scan remains the initial imaging modality of choice, despite being inferior to MRI, as it is readily available.

Neurology input and electromyography may also provide some additional information but is unlikely to alter the diagnosis or management.

Visual confirmation of nerve paralysis can also be obtained usingÂ airway endoscopy on swallowing tests, in which saliva will be seen pooling in the piriform sinus.
