Patient and caregiver education should be focused on the role of physical therapy and orthosis wear for more mild conditions with the understanding that these nonoperative modalities may not be able to prevent progression of the cavovarus deformity definitively and that subsequent procedures may be necessary to allow for a plantigrade foot.

As with many orthopedic conditions, the first line of treatment can be nonoperative management, but shared decision making with the patient and caregiver must occur when and if the deformity worsens regarding that operative intervention.
