Patients should be asked whether they have a history of allergies or prior reactions to suture materials. Observe the proximity of the patient's symptoms to previously operated sites. The list of relevant clinical entities includes, but is not limited to, erythema, swelling, nodular mass, extrusion of the suture through an incision, pruritus, edema, pain, and seroma accumulation. Other possible findings are surgical adhesions, wound dehiscence, infection, and intestinal obstruction along the line of suture material and granuloma formation. When a patient is presented with wound infection or leakage, a suture reaction should be kept in mind.
