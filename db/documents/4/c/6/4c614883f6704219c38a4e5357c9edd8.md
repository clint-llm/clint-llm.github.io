In women with breast cancer, several types of surgical procedures are done including a lumpectomy and modified mastectomy.Â Unlike in the past, total or radical mastectomy is done less frequently. Several studies have shown that skin-sparing or modified radical mastectomies are effective in the treatment of breast cancer. However, there is a small risk of breast cancer recurrence.
