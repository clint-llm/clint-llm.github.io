Successful organ procurement in traumatic patients requires extensive coordination and teamwork between many groups. Many factors can influence the number of organ donations performed. Early detection protocols with referral to an organ procurement organization (OPO) in the emergency department can lead to an increased likelihood of successful organ procurement.

Notification of the OPO is particularly important, as they have significant responsibility in the procurement process. OPOs are responsible for increasing the number of available donors and coordinating the donation process for these potential donors. Trained and experienced professionals can counsel families on brain death, the importance of organ donation, and can obtain consent from the family if needed.

The acquisition of donor organs also requires extensive teamwork, primarily due to the number of teams involved. The treatment team and procurement teams are separated to avoid conflicts of interest. Therefore, the treatment team must work independently to withdraw care but also keep the transplant team informed for prompt organ retrieval. Often, there are several procurement teams to retrieve different organs for transplantation, so they must coordinate amongst themselves. Lastly, in cases of heart/lung transplantation, the initial organ implantation is often done in the same operating room (to limit ischemic time), and that adds further complexity. Extensive coordination and cooperation between the trauma team, OPO, treatment team, procurement teams, and supporting staff are crucial to maximizing the number of organs procured and achieving the best outcomes for patients.
