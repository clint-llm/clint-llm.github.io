Asthma is a chronic disease process, which can lead to respiratory failure and death if it is not well controlled. Non-adherence to medication regimens and exposure to triggers can significantly increase the risk of morbidity and mortality. Proper education to both pediatric patients and their families can ensure understanding of the disease and provide an incentive for better control, which is achievable by using an interprofessional approach aimed at education. Nurses and respiratory therapists can help the team by engaging patients in teaching how to use inhalers, avoid triggers, and how to follow asthma action plans. The pharmacist has to review all medications, their appropriate dosing, and check for interactions, as well as educate the patient on the importance of medication compliance. Education and treatment can extend to the school system to assist in the management of asthma. Social workers can ensure that the patient can obtain medications and any equipment necessary to continue treatment. To prevent the high morbidity and mortality of pediatric asthma, close communication between the interprofessional team members is vital.
