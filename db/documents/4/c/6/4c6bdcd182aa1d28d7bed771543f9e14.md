Oxygen is measured in the blood in three ways: partial pressure of dissolved oxygen, oxygen concentration, and hemoglobin saturation. Dissolved oxygen is obtained from arterial blood gas (ABG) measurements and is reported as partial pressure. Henry's law dictates that the amount of dissolved oxygen in plasma water equals the PO times the solubility constant of oxygen in the blood, which is determined to be 0.003 mL / mmHg O / dL blood. This PO is 40 mmHg in the venous and 100 mmHg in the arterial blood. Oxygen first has to dissolve in blood before it can bind to hemoglobin. The amount of dissolved O2 depends on the oxygen gradient between the alveoli and blood and the ease at which oxygen can move through the alveolar lung tissue itself, also known as the parameters involved in Fick's law of diffusion.

The most critical clinical test in assessing the efficacy of oxygen transportation is the concentration of oxygen (CaO). Most oxygen in the blood is bound to hemoglobin, while a minimal amount dissolves in plasma water.  Furthermore, the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin is empirically determined to be 1.34 mL O2 / g Hbg.

- CaO = 1.34 * [Hgb] * (SaO / 100) + 0.003 * PaO2.

The saturation of hemoglobin (SaO2) is another measure of the efficacy of oxygen transport and is the ratio of oxygen bound to hemoglobin divided by the total hemoglobin. Saturation can be determined noninvasively in a clinical setting through the use of pulse oximetry, which measures differences in absorption of specific wavelengths o flight by oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood. Normal levels should be about 80-100% oxygen saturation of Hb. This technique's limitations are that it is a ratio tied to total hemoglobin and thus cannot detect anemia or polycythemia. Additionally, pulse oximetry cannot detect anemia or that oxygenated hemoglobin is indistinguishable from hemoglobin bound to carbon monoxide. Therefore, a person who has suffered exposure to high levels of carbon monoxide may have a normal oxygen saturation as indicated by pulse oximetry, despite lower levels of oxygen bound to hemoglobin.
