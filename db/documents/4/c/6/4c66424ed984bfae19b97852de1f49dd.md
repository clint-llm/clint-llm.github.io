The patient with acute urinary retention needs to be educated about catheter care and monitoring urinary output. If the patient is performing clean intermittent catheterization, they need to be taught proper techniques to avoid complications. Those with suprapubic catheters need to be shown proper care of these catheters and keeping the suprapubic site clean and free of the urinary leak to prevent dermatitis.Â  Patients may need followup home care and education if they have complications. The patient with benign prostatic hyperplasia requires education about the trial without catheterization and follow-up care. The surgical options and the risk and complications of surgical treatment should be shared with the patient. If the etiology of the acute urinary retention is medication-based, the patient should understand the side effects of the medication and the need to find an alternative.
