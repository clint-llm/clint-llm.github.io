As discussed previously, a healthy diet is recommended in the treatment of low HDL. The Mediterranean diet in observational studies has shown a decrease in cardiovascular and overall mortality.

Further counseling on weight loss and exercise is warranted as well. Amongst the saturated fatty acids, the carbon chain length affects the change in serum cholesterol. For instance, those with carbon chain lengths of 14 (myristic) and 16 (palmitic) increase LDL and HDL cholesterol while decreasing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. These smaller saturated fats can be found mostly in dairy products and red meats. On the other hand, stearic acid (18 carbons) has less of an effect on LDL and HDL cholesterol and can be found in beef and cocoa butter.

While there is no consensus on monounsaturated fats effect on HDL replacing polyunsaturated fats with monounsaturated fats in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus reduces insulin resistance. Insulin resistance and diabetes are important causes of low HDL and should be addressed during patient education.
