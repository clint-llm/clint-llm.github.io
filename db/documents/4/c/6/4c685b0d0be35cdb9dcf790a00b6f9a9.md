Differential diagnosis:

- PTLD: Infectious complications streptococcal pharyngitis and Infectious mononucleosis in an immunosuppressed individual presenting with fever, pharyngitis, and cervical lymphadenopathy closely mimic PTLD. Solid-organ recipients with opportunistic pulmonary infections such as aspergillosis and acute graft-versus-host disease may develop multiple lung parenchymal nodules and alveolar opacities that mimic PTLD on imaging studies.

- Melanoma: Mucosal fungal lesions closely mimic mucosal melanoma, so the progression of lesion and cytology may be necessary to treat.

- Skin cancers: keratoacanthoma and solar (actinic) keratosis closely mimic squamous cell carcinoma; an excisional biopsy can differentiate between the two.

- CNS Lymphoma: CMV or Toxoplasma are common viral and parasitic infections in an immunosuppressed individual, they present as ring-enhancing lesions in the brain and may be mistaken for primary or secondary CNS lymphoma.

- Benign conditions of the transplanted kidney, liver, and lungs can manifest as space-occupying lesions and mimic posttransplant malignancies. Renal pathologic conditions such as transplant-related fibrosis, acute pyelonephritis, and subcapsular hematoma may mimic malignancies un ultrasound and CT.

- Ischemia and reperfusion injury to the liver transplant may cause biliary necrosis and hepatic infarcts or micro-abscesses that may mimic recurrent HCCs at imaging studies.
