Necrotizing fasciitis is typically an acute process occurring rapidly over several days. It is a direct sequela of bacterial infection introduced through a break in the skinâ€™s integrity in approximately 80% of all cases. Gram-positive cocci specifically strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococci, are responsible for the majority of these single-site source infections. Polymicrobial infections occur as well because of a combination of gram-negative and anaerobic involvement.

The majority of patients have diabetes and a history of alcoholism. Patients with liver cirrhosis are also prone to necrotizing fasciitis.
