**Idiopathic generalized epilepsy**is a group of epilepsies accounting for about 20Â to 40% of all epilepsies. This group of epilepsies is clinically characterized by the presence of absence seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and myoclonic seizures with an electroencephalographic pattern of generalized epileptiform spike and wave or polyspike and wave discharge, at times with a shifting predominance on a normal background.

Based on the latest International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification, idiopathic generalized epilepsies include childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone.

**Juvenile absence epilepsy**is an idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome that is recognized by the ILAE (International League Against Epilepsy) that typically starts in adolescence around puberty and is characterized by absence seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. In some patients, there may be additional myoclonic jerks as well.
