BNP and NT-proBNP levelsÂ increase in patients with cardiac disease due to myocardial stress and volume overload.

Other situations in which natriuretic peptides are elevated include any disease that increases blood volume and thus wall stress, such as sepsis, anemia, renal dysfunction, Cushing syndrome, hyperaldosteronism, hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy, and cirrhosis.

Circulating levels of natriuretic peptides increase after acute myocardial infarction; the extent of the increase is related to the size of the infarct.

A value of less than 100 pg/mL for BNP and less than 300 pg/mL for NT-proBNP makes the diagnosis of heart failure less likely in an acutely dyspneic patient.
