Being diagnosed with dementia can be stressful and overwhelming for the affected person as well as their loved ones.

It is important for people with early dementia to care for their health which means regular checkups, compliance with medicines if needed, eating a healthy diet, regularly exercising, getting good sleep, and avoiding activities that can be risky.

It is also helpful to talk to others through support groups or social workers to discuss any issues such as anxiety, frustration, anger, loneliness, or depression.
