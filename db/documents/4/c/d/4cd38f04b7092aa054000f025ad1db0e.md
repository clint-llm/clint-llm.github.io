Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) imaging is utilized to identify the superior vena cava (SVC) and the anastomoses to the right pulmonary artery (PA). Pulsed Doppler and color-flow imaging are used to evaluate for a thrombus or stenosis at the anastomosis site. Pulmonary arteriovenous fistula is excludedÂ via the use of agitated saline solution injected peripherally. Expected findings at the shunt include low-velocity, laminar or biphasic flow with an inspiratory increase in flow velocity during spontaneous ventilation. Turbulent flow at the level of the anastomosis may indicate an obstruction.
