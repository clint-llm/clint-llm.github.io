The nerves of the pelvis perform both voluntary and involuntary functions. The parasympathetic nerves control opening and closing of sphincters, regulate emptying of the bladder, influence sexual functions such as achieving and maintaining erections, and influence bowel motility. The distal one-third of the transverse colon receives its parasympathetic innervation from the pelvic splanchnic nerves. Parasympathetic fibers are also responsible for transmitting the sensation of pain. Sacral splanchnic nerves supply efferent information to pelvic vessels and organs. Their origin is outside the pelvis and so must be reached via the hypogastric plexuses. Somatic nerves of the pelvis supply purely motor, purely sensory, or both motor and sensory information. The superior and inferior gluteal nerves supply motor information to the gluteal muscles and the tensor fascia lata. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve provides sensation to the anterior and lateral aspects of the thigh through an anterior and posterior branch. The femoral nerve supplies the anterior compartment and a few medial compartment muscles with motor information. The femoral nerve also supplies the anterior and medial aspects of the thigh with cutaneous sensation. It then continues as the saphenous nerve to provide cutaneous sensation to the lower extremity which will be discussed in more detail later. The obturator nerve sends motor information to the medial compartment of the thigh through posterior and anterior branches. The genitofemoral nerve is composed of 2 separate branches; the genital branch and the femoral branch. The genital branch runs within the spermatic cord and supplies motor information to the scrotum, specifically the cremasteric muscle. The femoral branch supplies cutaneous sensation to the inner aspect of the upper thigh. The ilioinguinal nerve travels through the inguinal canal outside of the spermatic cord and provides sensation to the scrotum, labia, and the upper anterior-medial thigh.

The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body and arises from L4 through S3 nerve roots. It provides motor innervation to all muscles of the posterior thigh as well as the leg via its continuation as the tibial nerve. The sciatic nerve terminates after it bifurcates into the tibial and common fibular nerve. The common fibular nerve bifurcates in superficial and deep fibular nerve. The superficial fibular nerve supplies the lateral compartment of the leg with motor innervation and the deep fibular supplies the anterior compartment. The superficial fibular nerve supplies sensory information to the dorsal aspect of the foot and the deep provides sensation to the area of skin between the first and second metatarsals. The tibial nerve supplies all motor information to the posterior compartment muscles of the leg. The tibial nerve also gives off a branch known as the sural nerve which provides sensation to the posterior-lateral aspect of the leg.
