Pegfilgrastim is a pegylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor that is FDA-approved to decrease the risk of patients developing febrile neutropenia when receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens. For primary prophylaxis, the risk of developing febrile neutropenia should be 20% or higher, and there should be no other safer regimen that is equally effective available to the patient. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of pegfilgrastim, so interprofessional team members can direct patient therapy in treating conditions for which it is indicated.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of pegfilgrastim.
- Summarize the indications for using pegfilgrastim.
- Review the adverse event profile of pegfilgrastim.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who can benefit from therapy with pegfilgrastim.
