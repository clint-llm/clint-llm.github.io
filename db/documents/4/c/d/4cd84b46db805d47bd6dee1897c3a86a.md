Prognosis depends on the severity of pulmonary regurgitation. Most patients with PR secondary to repair for tetralogy of Fallot do well, but there could be delayed mortality, which is related to right ventricular dysfunction. If PR is mild to moderate, there is no significant reduction in survival. However, severe PR and persistently elevated RV volume may lead to RV failure and propensity for arrhythmias, and increased risk of cardiac death.

In PR secondary to pulmonary hypertension, the time of diagnosis and duration of pulmonary hypertension play a significant role in the prognosis.  Early diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension and the presence of a reversible cause for PAH carries a good prognosis.
