Gently point the focal light into one eye, this is known as the direct pupillary light reflex. Then, withdraw the light for few seconds, followed by stimulating the same eye again but this time observe the indirect, or consensual, PLR in the opposite eye. It may be helpful to have the nurse control the light stimulus while you observe the unstimulated eye.
