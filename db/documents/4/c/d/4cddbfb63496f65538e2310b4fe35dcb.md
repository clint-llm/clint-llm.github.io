Before performing any diagnostic study, a comprehensive review of the patientâ€™s history and clinical course, as well as a complete physical exam, must be performed. The diagnostician will inform the patient bedside of the indications and overview of the studies needed to diagnose AIDP with proper electrodiagnostic testing.

The diagnostician must thoroughly explain the risks and benefits of the exam to the patient and also get consent from the patient. One should ideally examine at least three extremities, performing both sensory and motor nerve conduction studies, as well as EMG needle testing in both proximal and distal muscles for comparison. A notch filter should be used to minimize the electrical interference, which can occur while doing the study bedside, and, if possible, all unnecessary machines turned off, including unplugging the clinic/hospital bed.
