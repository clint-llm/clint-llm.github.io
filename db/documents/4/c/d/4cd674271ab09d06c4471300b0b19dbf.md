The patients undergoing renal scanning should be well hydrated so as to minimize the radiation dose to the bladder wall which would be increased with a collapsed bladder. Dehydration can delay renal excretion and interfere with the study results.

Most renal scintigraphy requires no premedication or dietary restriction.

Some specialized renal scans however have preparation.

In diuretic renography, which is performed for evaluation of obstructive uropathy prostaglandins act as vasodilators of the afferent arterioles of glomeruli and help to maintain glomerular filtration rates by regulating renal blood flow. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as diclofenac decrease prostaglandin synthesis and result in decreased renal perfusion as well as glomerular filtration which thereby affects glomerular filtration rate. A study on experimental animals proved that intravenous administration of diclofenac delays renal excretion, especially in renography using radiotracers primarily filtering through glomeruli. NSAID also affects ureteric contraction and delays excretion.

In angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) renography which is used to evaluate renal hypertension, captopril is given orally before the study. The presence of food in the gastro-intestinal tract can delay the absorption of the drug. Fasting at least 4 hours before this study is recommended. If the patient is already taking ACEI, it should be stopped before the study. Captopril should be stopped at least 48 hours before and lisinopril or enalapril stopped at least 1 week before ACEI renography examination. Long term usage of ACEI reduces the sensitivity of the test.
