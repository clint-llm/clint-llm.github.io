Pediatric spleen trauma management is similar to that in adults. To reduce potential care delays, the emergency care provider is advised to clarify ahead of time if there are any age cutoffs for trauma patient management in general and spleen injury cases in particular at their specific facility. Antipneumococcal vaccination is typically given around 2 to 3 weeks after splenectomy to decrease the risk of catastrophic sepsis events. Historically, the most feared organisms in this setting have been Streptococcus, Neisseria meningitis, and Haemophilus influenzae type B. Fortunately, as of the 2010s in the developed world, there are effective vaccines for the latter two, which are usually given to children prior to entering elementary school (H. influenzae) or around age 18 (N. meningitis). Anti-streptococcal vaccination is evolving, and polyvalent vaccines are becoming more used and, over time, have been developed against a wider spectrum of subspecies. As of 2017, a 13-valent anti-streptococcal vaccination has become available in some markets. Infectious disease issues affecting trauma patients in the developing world and of completely unimmunized patients are discussed elsewhere. The vast majority of children in developed nations (as of 2017) receive a series of polyvalent anti-streptococcal vaccinations, but to date, this has not changed the post-splenectomy vaccination recommendation. The persistence of an unimmunized minority in developed nations despite the near-unanimous recommendations of the medical community for the immunization of children will likely prevent changes in this recommendation for the foreseeable future.
