The laryngeal muscles receive innervation from two nerves, the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve and the recurrent laryngeal nerve. These nerves both arise from the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) and provide both motor and sensory innervation to the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, excluding the interarytenoid muscles. The cricothyroid muscle is innervated solely by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve while the recurrent laryngeal provides motor innervates to the other intrinsic laryngeal muscles. The internal branch of superior laryngeal nerve supplies sensory to the mucosa of the larynx. The nucleus ambiguous within the brain stem provides the motoneurons to the intrinsic laryngeal muscles while the hypoglossal nucleus provides the motoneurons to extrinsic muscles.
