As the possible causes of Muehrcke’s nails grow, a complete and detailed history is important to elicit an etiology. Questions about patients’ underlying medical conditions, exposures, medication, and occupation should be included. The chronology of nail findings in relation to history should be understood. A review of systems should also be probed, although this condition is typically benign.

On physical examination, the transverse white bands run parallel to the lunula and are separated by areas of normal pink nailbed color. These white bands are only different in color and have no other palpable difference compared to the rest of the nail. Muehrcke’s nails are often present on the second, third, and fourth fingernails, whereas the thumbnail is rarely involved. The white lines disappear with pressure (hence the term ‘apparent’ leukonychia).
