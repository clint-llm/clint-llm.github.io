Given the incidence of concomitant venous thromboembolic disease and the possibility of extension, it is paramount for health care team members to recognize that superficial thrombophlebitis is no longer considered a benign entity.

It is also importantÂ for the interprofessional health care team, comprised of clinicians, nurses, mid-level practitioners, and pharmacists, to recognize that migratory thrombophlebitis requires a team evaluation as it can be a rare presentation of visceral malignancy and for the best outcomes, a coordinated team effort to treat the patient.
