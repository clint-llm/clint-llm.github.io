Because infection with avian influenza can be particularly deadly in comparison to other viruses, providers may not be aware of the extra caution required when evaluating possible cases of infection. This article will impress on providers the severity of the disease and the need for high suspicion in specific scenarios as well as the need for early escalation of care. Avian influenza is an umbrella term describing the disease caused by various strains of influenza A virus known to infect birds that occasionally cause outbreaks of viral illness in humans.

Influenza A viruses are part of the Orthomyxoviridae family.

The influenza A virus splits into subtypes based on the antigen present on two of the virusâ€™s surface glycoproteins, haemagglutinin (with 16 known possible antigens), and neuraminidase (with nine known possible antigens).

Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) occur in most bird species, both wild and domestic. Generally, domestic birds are responsible for human disease outbreaks as they have more human contact. Some diseases spread, though, may be implicated in migratory birds that could carry disease to different locations where subsequent infection of domestic birds leads to human transmission.
