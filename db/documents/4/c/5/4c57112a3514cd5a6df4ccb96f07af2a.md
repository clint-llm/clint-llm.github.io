Through anatomical research, multiple variations of the tendons of the anatomical snuffbox have been discovered. Both the extensor pollicis longus and the abductor pollicis longus have been shown to have numerous tendon slips and different areas of insertion. This is clinically significant because it may predispose an individual patient to the development of tendinopathy of either of these two muscles. Surgical management, if needed, would also be affected because of these numerous variations in tendon location.

Through similar cadaveric research, multiple variations have been noted in the location of the cephalic vein and the radial artery. Clinically this is important because intravenous access can be obtained in the anatomical snuffbox, and inadvertent arterial puncture may cause a pseudo-aneurysm, arterial occlusion, or hematoma.
