Because of the many causes of bleeding in the first trimester, when a subchorionic hematoma would normally present, this must be managed by an interprofessional healthcare team that encourages close follow-up with the patient. This team can include primary care, emergency providers, obstetricians, midwives, and specialty trained nurses in obstetrics. In cases where patients present with heavy vaginal bleeding and pelvic cramping, it is important to stabilize the patient if needed, followed by evaluating the pregnancy. In most cases, a subchorionic hematoma is managed by an obstetrician and gynecologist, who follows up with serial ultrasounds and monitoring patient symptoms.
