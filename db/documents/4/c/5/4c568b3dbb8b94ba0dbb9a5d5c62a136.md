In humans, the perception and ability to distinguish different colors is mediated by a variety of mechanisms in the retina as well as the brain. Understanding the physiologic basis of color vision is essential to detecting abnormalities and devising treatments. In this article, we will review the cellular and genetic mechanisms that underlie color perception and apply these mechanisms to characterizing defects in color vision and avenues for treatment.
