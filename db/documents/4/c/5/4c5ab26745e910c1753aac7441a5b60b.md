Diagnosis of yolk sac tumors depends on history, physical examination, imaging studies, and blood chemistry.

Yolk sac tumors were shown as an enhancing large solid cystic mass with intertumoral hemorrhage on CT and MR studies.

Immunohistochemical staining can support the diagnosis of yolk sac tumors because almost all cases stain positive for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is specific in the yolk sac tumor, but it is not sensitive (overall sensitivity as low as 60%) because it can be seen in other cancers like hepatocellular carcinoma.

In mixed germ cell tumors with small foci of the yolk sac tumors, the biopsy findings may be negative for yolk sac tumors, because yolk sac tumors are usually limited in small malignant foci within a larger tumor, staining positive for AFP will confirm the presence of yolk sac tumors within other germ cell tumors, (e.g., in teratoma the biopsy of cancer may reveal teratoma alone, whereas elevated AFP reveals that yolk sac tumor is also present.)

Alpha-fetoprotein can be measured in tumor tissue, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, as well as amniotic fluid.

When yolk sac tumor arises in a small focus only, it may be hard to detect AFP in immunohistochemical staining because staining for alpha-fetoprotein is unequable and often varying throughout the tissue; strong staining is not seen in every tumor, in this situation, yolk sac tumors may be marked with cytokeratin or glypican-3, cytokeratin is present in almost all cases, another immunostaining which is frequently positive in yolk sac tumors is placental alkaline phosphatase.
