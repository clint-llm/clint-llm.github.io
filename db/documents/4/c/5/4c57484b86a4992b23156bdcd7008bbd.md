While the actual mortality of inhalational anthrax is unknown, mortality is believed to be 50% or higher after disease onset. Untreated gastrointestinal anthrax also carries a mortality rate of 50%, but with appropriateÂ treatment mortality rates decrease to less than 40%. Of all forms, cutaneous anthrax carries the best prognosis with a mortality estimated to be below 20%.
