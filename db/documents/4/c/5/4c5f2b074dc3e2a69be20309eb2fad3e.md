Organizations must develop proactive programs toÂ educate students, trainees, and providers about the impact of adverse patient events. These educational programs should make all providers aware of the post-event process and provide several free and easily accessible routes for help. Additionally, systems must work to identify high-risk events and individually support providers in order to ensure appropriate follow-up and support. Automatic referrals and trained peer support contact are recommended in all cases where the provider is challenged with a legal malpractice action, and there is an unexpected patient death and cases that are referred for quality review.
