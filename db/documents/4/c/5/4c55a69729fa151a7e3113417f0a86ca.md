The presentation of the bicuspid valve is variable and varies depending on the degree of stenosis and/or insufficiency of the valve. The most benign pediatric presentation is without symptoms or features of valve dysfunction.  In this case, the physical examination may show a low-pitched systolic ejection murmur and ejection click. The young population often has an early ejection sound followed by a systolic ejection murmur. The ejection sound depends on the mobility of the valve so as the valve cusps become more immobile the ejection sounds diminish. The examination also depends on the severity of the valvular insufficiency. In mild to moderate aortic regurgitation ejection sound is definitely there but in severe aortic regurgitation the ejection sound usually absent.
