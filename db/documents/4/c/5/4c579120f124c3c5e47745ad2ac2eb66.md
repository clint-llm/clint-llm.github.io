The differential diagnosis for thymomas and thymic carcinomas include thymic carcinoid tumors (that are often seen in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 1), thymic cysts (that can be differentiated from solid tumors by MRI of the chest), non-Hodgkins lymphomas, germ cell tumors (especially in young males with prior testicular masses), ectopic parathyroid glands (that can be identified by a sestamibi scan), thyroid goiters, and rarely paragangliomas.

In order to narrow down the differential, one must order appropriate laboratory studies [including germ cell markers (AFP and hCG) and lymphoma markers (LDH and CBC with differential)]. Imaging studies can help to differentiate between these various masses, e.g., an MRI differentiates between a cystic and solid mass, a sestamibi scan can detect ectopic parathyroid tissue, and a thyroid scan can detect a mediastinal thyroid goiter.
