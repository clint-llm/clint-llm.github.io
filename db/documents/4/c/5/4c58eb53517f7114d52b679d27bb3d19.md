A herniated disc is a condition affecting the spine in which the annulus fibrosus is damaged enabling the nucleus pulposus (which is normally located within the center of the disc) to herniate. This can compress the nerves or spinal cord causing pain and spinal cord dysfunction. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of disc herniation and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the degeneration of the nucleus pulposus in the etiology of disc herniation.
- Describe the pathophysiology of disc herniation.
- Outline the straight leg raise test and the contralateral (crossed) straight leg raise test in the physical examination of those with disc herniation.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients affected by a disc herniation.
