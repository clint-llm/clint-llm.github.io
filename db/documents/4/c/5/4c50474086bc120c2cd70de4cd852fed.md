After identification of a spell that is concerning for infantile spasms, a patient should undergo an EEG evaluation to assess for the classic background of hypsarrhythmia. An EEG which captures the spells of concern, as well as the time between the spells of concern, is ideal. If by history, physical exam, and EEG evaluation, the patient is felt to have a diagnosis of infantile spasms, additional testing is necessary to investigate underlying etiologies. MRI brain scans should be completed first as this is the highest yield tool in identifying an underlying etiology of infantile spasms. If MRI is normal, additional genetic and metabolic screening tests are needed for further evaluation. Typically, these are performed on the blood, urine, and spinal fluid.
