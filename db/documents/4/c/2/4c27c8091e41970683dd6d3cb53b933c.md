A thorough history and physical exam are essential in the evaluation of suspected serum sickness. The history should focus on identification of an offending agent within the two weeks before the onset of symptoms, or, in the case of potential repeat exposure, within the few days before presentation. Also, a complete review of systems, with a focus on each organ system and severity of symptoms, should be performed to evaluate for other potential causes of the patient's presentation.

The physical exam should be carefully undertaken to determine the severity of symptoms and signs of systemic illness. A close inspection of the rash may reveal an urticarial, maculopapular or vasculitic (purpuric) eruption. Importantly, the mucous membranes are not involved and can be helpful in distinguishing serum sickness from Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. If associated with subcutaneous injection, the rash may first appear around the site of the injection. The rash typically takes days to weeks to resolve once the offending agent is discontinued. Arthralgias are more common than frank arthritis, but either may occur. The hands, feet, ankles, knees, and shoulders are most commonly affected. Less common findings on the physical exam include edema (i.e., of the hands, feet, and face), lymphadenopathy, headache or blurry vision, splenomegaly, anterior uveitis, peripheral neuropathy, nephropathy, and vasculitis.
