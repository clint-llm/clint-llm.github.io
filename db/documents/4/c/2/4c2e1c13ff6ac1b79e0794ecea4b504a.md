In males, the most common misdiagnosis of pudendal neuralgia is prostatitis. The National Institutes of Health attempted to clarify this issue by developing four categories of prostatitis, including "Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome" (CPPS), as one of the categories.****It is likely that at least some patients diagnosed with chronic pelvic pain syndrome actually have pudendal neuralgia. Providers should rule out inflammation in the prostate by examining prostatic secretions or seminal fluid for white blood cells. Patients originally diagnosed with prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome who fail to improve on treatment should be re-evaluated for possible pudendal neuralgia, and consideration should be given to a pudendal nerve block in such individuals.

The European Association of Urology lists 23 syndromes that present with chronic pelvic pain.

Careful examination of the male genitalia will identify pathology in the vas deferens, epididymis, and testis.

In females, morphologic disease of the uterus or ovaries should be considered. For example, a diagnosis of" endometriosis" is sometimes made even without laparoscopic confirmation. Anorectal pathology can often be diagnosed by physical examination.

Several other abdominal and pelvic neuropathies that overlap with the pudendal region or can be referred to as that area should be considered.

The "Nantes" criteria have been published to guide the diagnosis of pudendal neuropathy (especially when all the criteria are met).
