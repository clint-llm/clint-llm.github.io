The most frequent presentation of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)Â is a hemorrhage. Other forms of presentation include headache, seizures, bruit, and neurologic deficits (related to local mass effect or ischemia from steal phenomenon).

Following the identification of an AVM, a thorough history and neurologic exam are imperative to determine further workup and treatment for these patients. Age, medical comorbidities, and use of any antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications are essential parts of determining surgical candidacy. In patients presenting with hemorrhage, it is important to also assess for risk factors of related aneurysms (smoking history, family history). History and physical exam may also provide insight as to associated syndromes such as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome.
