Patient education is imperative in improving a patient's health literacy. By helping the patient understand the condition, the risks/benefits of treatment, and complications, they can make more informed decisions regarding their care. In addition, physicians and the healthcare team can implement the teach-back method, avoiding medical jargon, actively engaging in patient questions, and explaining the diagnosis to achieve this. Thus it is prudent to inform any patient considering peritoneal dialysis of the benefits/risk, especially concerning an increased risk in encapsulating peritoneal dialysis.

By effectively educating a patient on this complication from dialysis, a patient will be more aware of the signs and symptoms to look out for to catch EPS earlier. Patient education could decrease the risk of delayed diagnosis and ensure proper treatment. This method applies not only to the disease in question but to management options as well. There are numerous risks/benefits to using steroids, tamoxifen, and surgical intervention. A better understanding of these interventions can ensure a more informed decision is made.
