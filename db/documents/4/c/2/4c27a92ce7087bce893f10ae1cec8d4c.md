The management of trauma patients is usually with an interprofessional team including trauma nurses. While FAST is useful in trauma patients, it has limitations. Clinicians should be aware that the point of care ultrasound image acquisition and interpretation is limited by the provider’s experience; the patient’s body habitus; and the presence of bowel gas, pneumoperitoneum, or pneumomediastinum. Serial eFAST exams and advanced imaging are warranted in these situations based on the patient’s hemodynamic status. A radiologist should be consulted if one is not able to interpret the images; unfortunately this may not always be possible in the middle of the night.
