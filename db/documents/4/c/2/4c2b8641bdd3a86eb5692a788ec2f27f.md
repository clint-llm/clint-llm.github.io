The differential diagnosis should include any substance or condition that may alter mentation, result in tachycardia, urinary retention, seizures, or other anticholinergic effects. Other organic processes should also be included, such as meningitis or sepsis. To help with ruling out causes, the time of onset of delirium is important. Toxin-induced delirium occurs more rapidly and abruptly than organic causes. In patients with altered mental status, hyperthermia, and agitation, salicylate toxicity should also be ruled out.
