The use of thiazolidinediones, also called "glitazones," in managing type 2 diabetes can help with glycemic control and insulin resistance. There are two thiazolidinediones, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone, currently approved by the FDA as monotherapy or combined with metformin or sulfonylureas to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus. These medications should be in conjunction with lifestyle modifications such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction. Thiazolidinediones may also be used to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome, as these may lead to improved endothelial function, improved ovulation, and reduction of insulin resistance.
