There are three classification systems for SCFE: Loder Classification, Southwick Slip Angle Classification, and Temporal Classification.

**The Loder Classification**was introduced in 1993 based on the ability to bear weight and helps to predict osteonecrosis. Cases can be classified as stable if the patient is able to bear weight with or without crutches. And those cases would have less than a 10% risk of osteonecrosis. Or unstable if the patient is unable to bear weight. And these cases carry a higher risk of osteonecrosis (24 to 47%).

**The Southwick Slip Angle Classification**grades the severity of SCFE based on the difference in the epiphyseal diaphyseal angle between the affected hip and the unaffected/contralateral hip, both in anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the hip. Mild cases < 30 degrees, moderate cases 30-50 degrees, and severe cases with more than 50 degrees of difference. In bilateral cases, a set reference is used for comparison; 145 degrees on the anteroposterior radiographs and 10 degrees on the lateral radiographs.

**Temporal Classification**is based on the duration of symptoms. It is seldom used as it has no bearing on prognosis. SCFE is considered acute if symptoms are present for less than three weeks, chronic if symptoms have persisted for more than three weeks, or acute on chronic if a patient has worsening symptoms for more than three weeks.

SCFE can also be graded based on the percentage of slippage. Grade I up to 33%, Grade II 34 to 50 %, and Grade III over 50%.
