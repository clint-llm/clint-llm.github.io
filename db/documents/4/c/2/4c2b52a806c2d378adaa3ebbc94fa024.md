Coronary artery disease is a common heart condition that involves atherosclerotic plaque formation in the vessel lumen. This leads to impairment in blood flow and thus oxygen delivery to the myocardium. It is a cause of major morbidity and mortality in the US and worldwide. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity illustrates the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of coronary artery disease and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of coronary artery disease.
- Outline the evaluation of coronary artery disease. 
- Discuss the management options available for coronary artery disease.
