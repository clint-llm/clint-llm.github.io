Q fever, an acute zoonotic febrile illness with a worldwide distribution, was discovered first in Queensland, Australia, in 1935 among meat workers. As a cause could not be identified, it was labeled “Q (query) fever.” This disease has occurred as outbreaks among livestock and farm workers handling ungulates. Clinical presentation is often a self-limited febrile illness, but severe manifestations can occur. C. burnetii, is considered a potential bioterrorism agent.
