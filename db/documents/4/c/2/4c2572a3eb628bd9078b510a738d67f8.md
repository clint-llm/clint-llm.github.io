Contact lenses have revolutionized the optical industry. Many patients now prefer contact lenses over spectacles for cosmetic and aesthetic purposes. Young patients favor contact lenses due to workplace demand, cosmesis, and independence from spectacles.

In elderly patients, the significant indications are treatment secondary to trauma, corneal perforation, pain relief in pseudophakic bullous keratopathy, and unilateral corneal scars. The major limitations are cost, patient compliance, and complication associated with contact lenses. Contact lenses are also avoided in the pediatric age group at some centers due to the risk of contact lens-induced keratitis and compliance to treatment.
