Equipment required for balloon sinuplasty includes but is not limited to:

- Straight or angled rigid nasal endoscope for viewing sinonasal anatomy.

- Guide catheter - directs the tip of the device towards the intended ostia.

- Guidewires are used to guide catheter entry into the correct sinus. It can be radiopaque when used with fluoroscopic imaging, or it can transilluminate the sinuses for external guidance.

- Balloon catheters are used to dilate the ostia physically and are inflatedÂ to certain pressures within the range of 8 to 12 atmospheres.

- The balloon inflation device is a high-pressure system used for inflation of the balloon itself.

- An irrigation catheter serves to wash purulence or other material out of the sinus in question.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only approved two balloon sinuplasty devices to date. One device is indicated for frontal and sphenoid sinus disease in patients over 18, and maxillary sinus disease in patients under 17. The other device is indicated for the maxillary sinuses in patients two years and older, and for frontal and sphenoid sinuses in patients over 12 years old.
