The coronary angiographic appearance of spontaneous coronary artery dissection has been classified into three types:

- Type 1: refers to the classic appearance of multiple radiolucent lumens or arterial wall contrast staining.

- Type 2: refers to the presence of diffuse stenosis that can be of varying severity and length (usually >20 mm;  Variant 2A is diffuse arterial narrowing bordered by normal segments proximal and distal to the IMH, and variant 2B is diffuse narrowing that extends to the distal tip of the artery.

- Type 3: Mimics atherosclerosis with focal or tubular stenosis  usually <20 mm in length,  and requiring optical coherence tomography (OCT) or intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to differentiate the cause
