Patients with sickle cell are commonly followed by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, hematologist and the internist. The renal function in these patients needs to be monitored by an interprofessional team because it can lead to end-stage renal disease and a shortened life expectancy. As soon as the renal function starts to decline, a nephrology consult should be made. Many of these patients do require dialysis and some may benefit from a kidney transplant. Without any treatment, the life span is severely limited.
