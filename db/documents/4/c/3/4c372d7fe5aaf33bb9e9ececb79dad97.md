Meyerdingâ€™s classification of spondylolisthesis is the most commonly used grading method. Its basis is on the percentage of anterior translation relative to the adjacent level. Grade I spondylolisthesis is 1 to 25% slippage, grade II is up to 50% slippage, grade III is up to 75% slippage, and grade IV is 76-100% slippage. If there is more than 100% slippage, it is known as spondyloptosis or grade V spondylolisthesis.

Subclasses of isthmic spondylolisthesis are subtype A (stress fractures of the pars), subtype B (elongation of the pars without overt fracture), subtype C (acute fracture of the pars).

Subclasses of pathologic spondylolisthesis are subtype A (systemic causes) and subtype B (focal processes).
