The physiologic response to cutaneous injury is the formation of a scar, a process which involves inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling or maturation. Keloids form due to pathological wound healing and excess dermal fibrosis. Abnormal prolongation of the inflammatory phase of wound healing can lead to an imbalance in the destruction and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), which results in accumulation of collagen and other ECM matrix components. The overabundance of ECM components in the dermis and surrounding subcutaneous tissue leads to excessive scarring and keloid formation.

Numerous genetic and environmental factors are involved in the complex pathophysiology of keloids. Given that fibroblasts deposit the majority of collagen and ECM, they are thought to be the key cellular component in the fibrotic process. Other cellular players include myofibroblasts, keratinocytes, melanocytes, and mast cells. Regulatory molecules (e.g., TGF-beta, PDGF, VEGF, proteolytic enzymes) and fibrotic signaling cascades (e.g., SMAD signaling, toll-like receptor signaling, fibronectin) have also been shown to have an important role in the sequence of events leading to keloid formation.
