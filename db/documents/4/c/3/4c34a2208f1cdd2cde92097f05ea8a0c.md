In healthy humans, the body is continually making a small number of ketones to be used by the body for energy. In times of fasting, even overnight while sleeping, the level of ketone bodies in the blood increases. The normal pathways to create energy involve either stored carbohydrate or non-carbohydrate substances. When ample carbohydrate stores are available, the main pathway used is glycogenolysis. This involves the breakdown of glycogen stores in muscle and liver. Gluconeogenesis, the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources such as lactate, is often utilized as well, especially in situations involving exercise.

When carbohydrate stores are significantly decreased or fatty acid concentration increases, there is an upregulation of the ketogenic pathway and an increased production of ketone bodies. This can be seen in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, alcoholism, and starvation. Most organs and tissues can use ketone bodies as an alternative source of energy. The brain uses them as a major source of energy during periods where glucose is not readily available. This is because, unlike other organs in the body, the brain has an absolute minimum glucose requirement. The heart typically uses fatty acids as its source of energy but also can use ketones. Although it is the primary site that produces ketone bodies, the liver does not use ketone bodies because it lacks the necessary enzyme beta ketoacyl-CoA transferase.
