Cranial nerves VII, IX, and X are known to carry functional modalities that are gustatory and non-gustatory. This duality in function results from a subsequent duality in embryonic origin. The non-gustatory functions of these nerves are derived from the cranial neural crest, whereas the gustatory function is exclusively derived from epibranchial placodes and project centrally to the nucleus gustatory.
