Due to the lack of worldwide assessment data on acute ischemic stroke (AIS) reperfusion injury after thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, it is hard to predict the epidemiology of I/R injury. However, the term hemorrhagic transformation (HT) can be considered an expression of reperfusion injury. In the historic NINDS trial, HT occurred in 6.4% of r-tPA-treated patients compared to patients treated with a placebo where it was only 0.3%. Of note, this represents the symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation (sHT).

In the large SITS-MOST observational study, sHT was seen in 7.3% of ischemic stroke patients undergoing thrombolysis.
