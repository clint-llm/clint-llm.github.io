There are certain predictors of embolic stroke prognosis in the acute phase including the patient age and associated comorbidities, in addition to the stroke size and location on neuroimaging. However, the clinical assessment remains the most important predictor of long term outcome. Large embolic strokes with altered mentation, severe motor, language, and visual deficits are associated with poor prognosis.

There is evidence that the early regaining of finger extension, shoulder abduction, and grasp release are associated with good clinical outcomes after 6 months.

Data suggests excessive corticospinal tract damage is a poor predictor of recovery and associated with poor prognosis.
