**Weaning Off Bypass**

The steps of weaning could be described as the reverse of conducting bypass in the following manner:

**Step 1**

The surgeon resumes electrical and mechanical activity of the heart and allows blood flow to the lungs, allowing both organs to function partially while the pump still running. Restarting the heart is performed by rewarming, de-airing, and placing epicardial pacing (discussed in a separate chapter). Reperfusion of the lungs occurs simply by re-ventilating.

**Step 2**

The surgeon must be able to confirm the function of both the heart and the lungs by looking at specific parameters (e.g., arterial blood gas, cardiac output).

**Step 3**

If all is well, the surgeon instructs the perfusionist to gradually slow down the pump until fully off the machine. The arterial and venous lines are clamped, and both the lung and heart functions are monitored for a few more minutes.

**Step 4**

The surgeon dismantles the circuit step by step, but only if the heart and lung function is back to normal.

- Restarting the heart: Rewarming

The process of rewarming is essential to re-establish metabolism of the cardiac myocytes. This process takes longer (0.3-0.5 C /min) than the cooling process (0.5-1.5 C /min) due to the physical properties of body fluids. Cooling is achieved systemically via the heat exchanger and topical application of cold crystalloid/ice slush on the myocardium. Similarly, rewarming is achieved systemically via the heat exchanger and the use of the ”bear hugger” to warm the lower extremities. Caution is required during rewarming; one should not rewarm too quickly to avoid the creation of microbubbles (Boyle law) and also should not overheat as this can lead to denaturation of some plasma proteins.

- Restarting the heart: De-Airing

This is a vast topic and a crucial step in the process of weaning (to be explained in detail in another chapter). Nevertheless, in short, de-airing aims at expelling all air out of the heart and great vessels before allowing the heart to take over circulation independently. Residual air in the heart and aorta can embolize to any organ and cause severe damage. A major concern, however, is air embolizing to the coronary or carotid arteries because they are the first two branches of the aorta. The right coronary artery, in particular, is vulnerable due to its higher position anteriorly, making it more susceptible to air embolism via the coronary ostium. If air does embolize down the right coronary, this will be evident in the form of right ventricle distension. The CPB pump provides means to deal with any “air particles" via simple maneuvers such as escalating pump flow and increasing pressure to expel air down the system where it is less serious, or one may require more drastic maneuvers such as going back on bypass and/or conducting antegrade/retrograde cerebral perfusion. Therefore, it is essential to ensure satisfactory de-airing before dismantling the circuit.

When the heart is fully decompressed, the distance between the venous cannula to the cross-clamp, including the right heart, pulmonary arteries, lung parenchyma, pulmonary veins, and left heart, is supposed to be empty of blood. However, it will contain some air. This air will be exaggerated with any breach created by the surgeon (even as simple as CABG) since it will suck ambient air into this space. Sources of air finding a way to this space during cardiac surgery could be classified as surgical (atriotomy, aortotomy, cannulation site), anesthetic (CVC line), CPB pump (exhaustion of reservoir level, unsecured stock ports, cavitation), and natural dead space. The de-airing process is summarized in Flow Chart 3.

**Confirming Suitability for Weaning**

Before dismantling the circuit, the surgeon must confirm the heart and lungs are ready to resume their functions independently. The following is a summary of parameters.

- Two “No": No conditions include graft failure, valve leakage, and dissection. No residual air.

- Two “satisfactory”: Satisfactory pacing. Satisfactory ventilation

- Two “Physiological”: Physiological temperature (35 to 37 C). Physiological gases (ABG, K+, po2).

**Gradual Comedown**

The perfusionist starts to gradually limit the amount of blood coming back from the patient by applying gradual clamping to the venous line. Doing this alone will lead to more blood going into the patient than coming back, In other words, filling the heart. This is done until a satisfactory contraction is achieved, reaching the highest point of the Frank-Starling curve. At such point, the perfusionist starts to slow down the flow of the main head pump as instructed by the surgeon. This will limit the blood flowing back to the heart. This goes on gradually until the venous line is fully clamped and the main head pump is fully switched off

**Dismantle the Circuit**

This is done in a stepwise manner in the following order. Venous cannula out (but leave the purse string intact), then root vent out, then aortic cannula out (after giving protamine and satisfactory filling). Throughout the procedure, the surgeon keeps an eye on the heart parameters, bearing in mind the situation might necessitate going back on the bypass at any time. To enable that, certain precautions are done. Fill the venous line with crystalloid to re-prime it (siphon venous line). The perfusionist checks the heparinization, occlusion, and reservoir levels. The surgeon leaves the atrial purse strings ready to reuse if needed.
