Healthcare workers, including the primary care clinician and advanced nurse practitioner, should be familiar with malaria prophylaxis. The interprofessional healthcare team should take care to provide access and culturally competent guidance to those visiting friends and relatives in endemic areas. Providers should help assess travel risks and encourage both bite avoidance and chemoprophylaxis where recommended. A health belief model exploring potential barriers to chemoprophylaxis adherence and exploration of alternatives may improve counseling outcomes. While malaria prophylaxis is useful, clinicians need to educate the traveler from getting bitten by mosquitoes. Nurses should inquire about recent or upcoming travel to endemic areas, and set in motion the steps to address malaria prevention when applicable, working with the clinician to evaluate the patient. The pharmacist will have a role in vetting the agent choice as well as verifying dosing. Practitioners should take advantage of the opportunity to assess risk for the entire family and encourage all travelers to seek pretravel counseling. The key is for the clinician to educate the traveler on prevention; this means wearing appropriate garments, using DEET and mosquito nets when sleeping and not venturing out after dusk. The interprofessional team needs to coordinate efforts to execute effective malarial prophylaxis. [Level 5]
