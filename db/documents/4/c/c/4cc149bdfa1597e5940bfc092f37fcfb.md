Tricyclic antidepressant toxicity can be life-threatening and is best managed by an interprofessional team that consists of an emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, poison control specialist, cardiologist, neurologist, and an emergency or critical care nurse. As with all cases of poisoning, proper management of airway, breathing, and circulation is critical in cases of TCA poisoning. Gastrointestinal decontamination by activated charcoal should be done only if conditions are appropriate and the airway is protected. Sodium bicarbonate should be given to hemodynamically unstable patients, patients with seizures, and patients with QRS prolongation of more than 100 msec. Some patients may even require temporary pacing for bradycardia. Hydration and close monitoring in an ICU setting are recommended. It is vital to make sure that the patient has no other co-ingestants in the systemic circulation.Â  For patients managed promptly, the outcomes are good. However, if treatment is delayed or the patient has ingested multiple other agents, the prognosis is guarded. Before discharge, if attempted suicide is suspected, the patient should be referred to a mental health counselor. Parents should be urged to keep all medications in a locked cabinet away from the reach of children.
