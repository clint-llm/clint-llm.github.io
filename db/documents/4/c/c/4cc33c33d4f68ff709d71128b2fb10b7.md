Sensation of the nose comes from the ophthalmic (V1) and maxillary (V2) divisions of the trigeminal nerve. The ophthalmic division has three main branches: the lacrimal, frontal, and nasociliary. The infratrochlear nerve arises from the nasociliary nerve and provides innervation of the superior aspect of the external nose.  The external nasal nerve also arises from the nasociliary and exits between the border of the nasal bone and the upper lateral cartilage, providing sensation to the skin of the nasal tip, the medial aspect of the nasal alae, and the dorsum of the nose. The maxillary division (V2) provides bilateral innervation to the lateral dorsum and alae.

Intranasally, branches of both V1 and V2 supply sensation to the nasal mucosa.  The anterior ethmoidal nerve (branch of the nasociliary) provides sensation to the anterosuperior aspect of the internal nose and the anterior nasal septal mucosa.  More posteriorly, the nasopalatine nerve supplies sensory innervation to the nasal septum. The greater palatine nerve and the anterior ethmoidal nerve innervate the lateral nasal sidewall mucosa.  [6]

Other important innervations to the nose include the facial nerve(VII) which innervates the nasal musculature and the olfactory nerve (I), responsible for the sense of smell.
