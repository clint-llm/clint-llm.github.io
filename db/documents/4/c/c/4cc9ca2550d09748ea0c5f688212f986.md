According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), approximately 1,600 people get listeriosis each year with approximately 260 people dying from the disease. The disease is most prevalent in pregnant women, infants, immunocompromised, and elderly (65 and older). Pregnant women are also at risk as they can acquire L. monocytogenes and pass it to their unborn fetus.

L. monocytogenes is ubiquitous as it can be found in soil, water, and decaying vegetation. The bacterium can also be found in the human digestive tract. Foods that have the highest rates of L. monocytogenes related infections include:

- Raw sprouts

- Unpasteurized milk

- Soft cheeses

- Cold deli meats

- Cold hot dogs

- Smoked seafood
