Both genetic and environmental contributions lead to immune-mediated loss of beta cell function resulting in hyperglycemia and life-long insulin dependence. In an individual at risk (human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype accounts for 30% to 50% of their genetic risk. More than 50 other genes have been found through candidate gene and genome-wide association studies.  A "triggering" insult (e.g., maternal and intrauterine environment, exposure to viruses, host microbiome, diet and many other factors are thought to contribute to disease susceptibility) is suspected to initiate a process that recruits antigen-presenting cells to transport beta cell self-antigens to autoreactive T cells. Through failures of self-tolerance, these T cells mediate beta-cell killing and inflammation leading to insulinopenia and symptomatic diabetes. Recently, preclinical stages of type 1 diabetes have been recognized. Stage 1 is defined by the presence of beta cell autoimmunity, but normal glucose-handling, stage 2 is defined by abnormal glucose handling but no overt symptoms, and finally stage 3 is defined by clinically-apparent symptoms of insulinopenia. Progression through these stages may take years. Although the pre-clinical staging is not usually clinically relevant, research focusing on interventions in the pre-clinical groups may prove to delay or prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes.
