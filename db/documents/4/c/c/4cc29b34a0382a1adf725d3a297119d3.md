POD is common, and the prevalence increases with the severity of the surgical insult. According to DSM-5, the incidence of POD in non-cardiac surgery is anywhere between 15% and 54% depending on the screening test used. The incidence in the intensive care population is up to 70% to 80% during their entire stay. In cardiac surgery patients, the incidence is similarly high, between 26% and 52%.

While the incidence of POD is common and similar to other settings, there is a wide discrepancy in the literature regarding the incidence, partly due to the lack of clearly defined distinction between emergence delirium and POD. Prior studies have focused on hyperactive delirium, typically recognized as the patient in the PACU pulling at lines and tubes and being agitated, likely under-diagnosing hypoactive delirium, the most common, which is characterized by lethargy, decreased responsiveness and decreased activity level. This type will often go undiagnosed if routine delirium monitoring is not used.

Despite these limitations, the incidence and risk factors of POD reported in the literature is strongly influenced by the severity of the surgical insult, comorbidities, and sedative and/or analgesic drug exposure.
