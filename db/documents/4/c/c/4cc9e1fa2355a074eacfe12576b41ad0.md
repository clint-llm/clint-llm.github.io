Educating patients on the procedure, utility, and safety of the multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan is of paramount importance. Patients must be told what the goal of the study is and what the provider hopes to evaluate. They must also be informed that the test involves injecting a radioactive substance tagged to blood to track its transit through the heart and be aware of the risks associated with this. Patients must be informed of the preparation needed for their specific type of MUGA.

- For a “resting” scan: it is preferred that a fasting state of 3  to 4 hours is maintained before the scan.

- For an “exercise” scan: the patient may be required to exercise in between pictures. It is recommended the patient fasts for 3 to 4 hours before the study. It is also important to ensure that the patient is physically able and has no cardiac reasons precluding an exercise scan. If the patient cannot exercise, a pharmacological agent can be introduced to stress the heart for the study.

- Rate control medications must be held before the study, as these can confound the study results.

- A provider fully trained and certified in CPR and ACLS must accompany the patient as the study progresses, and appropriate equipment and medications must be present as the study is being conducted in the event cardiac arrest occurs.
