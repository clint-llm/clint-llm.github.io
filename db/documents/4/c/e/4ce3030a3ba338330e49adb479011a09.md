Some consultants that may be needed in the management of a patient with colovesicular fistula involve:

- Urologist for a cystoscopy

- Gastroenterologist: If the surgeonÂ  does not feel comfortable with endoscopy, they may need to consult a gastrointestinal (GI) doctor for a lower endoscopy

- Infectious disease specialist for a patient that develops multi-drug resistant bacteria in their urine secondary to the fistula
