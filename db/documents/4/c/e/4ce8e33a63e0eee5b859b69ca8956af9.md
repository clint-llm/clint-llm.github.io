The mitral valve is located between the left atrium and the left ventricle. The mitral valve apparatus is a complex anatomical structure consisting of a mitral annulus, mitral valve leaflets, chordae tendineae, and papillary muscles.

Rheumatic mitral stenosis occurs as a result of a chronic inflammatory process. It is characterized by the thickening of the edges of the mitral valve leaflets leading to commissural fusion and reduction in the mitral valve opening in diastole.
