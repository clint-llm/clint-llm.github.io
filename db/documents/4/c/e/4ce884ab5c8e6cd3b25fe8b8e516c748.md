The majority of patients with LHB tendinitis can be managed nonoperatively. Consideration for referral should be in the setting of persistent pain/symptoms despite 6 to 8 weeks of nonoperative management. In addition, referral for the appropriate physical therapy program focused on correcting any existing muscular imbalances about the shoulder girdle, including scapular dyskinesia.

In the management of young athletes, consideration should be given for early referral to a sports medicine physician experienced in managing these types of shoulder pathologies. Again, as most biceps-related shoulder pathologies can be managed nonoperatively, referral to an orthopedic surgeon for surgical management should be considered in any of the following scenarios:

- Persistent/worsening symptoms despite PT/NSAIDs/activity modification/injections

- Diagnostic imaging confirming evidence of tendon subluxation and/or dislocation

- In the setting of either post-operative “Popeye” deformity, failed biceps tenodesis techniques, or spontaneous rupture, referral to a surgeon with experience in correcting the deformity should be considered
