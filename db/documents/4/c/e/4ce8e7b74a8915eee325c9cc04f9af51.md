Renal masses are frequently found incidentally without signs or symptoms. The triad of hematuria, flank pain, and flank mass is seen infrequently in modern medicine because they, more likely than not, have already been detected by imaging before symptomatology. The classic triad is observed in approximately 15% of cases, and most of those are in advanced stages. However, if these findings are present, then it warrants further evaluation. New hypertension, unintentional weight loss, and night sweat are nonspecific but essential in elucidating the differential diagnosis. Laboratory findings for anemia or polycythemia, hypercalcemia are useful in this case. Physical examination should evaluate for varicoceles in the setting of tumor invasion.

History taking should be thorough and exploring information such as smoking history, eating habits, exercise status, comorbidities, and exposures to known cancer-causing agents. Literature suggests that obesity, hypertension, and smoking are present in up to 50% of cases.

Family history and comorbidities are significant if positive. Research has linked conditions such as ESRD to RCC because of the tendency to induce the kidney's cystic formation, leading to aberrant cell formation. Also, patients with a family history of genetic conditions such as polycystic kidney disease are at a higher risk, requiring close monitoring.
