While the foramen ovale does not serve a functional purpose in a healthy postpartum human, the anatomical structure plays an integral role in circulating blood during embryological development. The use of the opening between the atria allows the passage of oxygenated blood to enter the left atrium from the right atrium and to bypass the lungs, which have not fully matured during fetal development. Abnormalities in the development and closure of the foramen ovale can lead to blood flow irregularities. Such conditions can lead to a patent foramen ovale or other congenital atrial septal defects. However, in specific congenital developmental abnormalities, a right to left shunt is vital for a neonate to survive after birth. Specifically, total anomalous pulmonary venous return and tricuspid atresia are notable for neonates to have a shunt similar to that of a foramen ovale.
