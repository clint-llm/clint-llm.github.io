Practitioners should reassure patients that papular acrodermatitis on its own is a benign and self-limited illness. The majority of cases spontaneously resolve without active intervention. Symptomatic management of itching may be helpful. Patients may use emollients or oral antihistamines. Since infectious agents do not directly cause skin lesions, mild to moderate potency topical steroids may be used in patients who fail to achieve relief of itching with emollients and oral antihistamines. However, treatment with topical steroids or oral antihistamines does not shorten the course of illness. Any underlying disorder, such as hepatitis B that requires further management, should be addressed. Lesions resolve without scarring, although post-inflammatory pigmentary alteration may persist in some patients.
