Clinical history is usually that of a young female child with light hair that sheds easily. A classic contextual clue is a history of hair that does not require frequent cutting. The hair is often described to have unusual textures such as "sticky, matted, frizzy, and unmanageable." Often, parents report diffuse hair loss, and despite this, areas of complete hair loss usually are not present. Most commonly thinning is seen over the entire scalp or, as classically associated, the occipital scalp. Involvement of the eyebrows is uncommon but may be seen.

A pull test is the cornerstone of diagnosis in loose anagen hair syndrome. It is performed by using gentle traction on approximately 40 to 60 scalp hairs. Telogen hairs normally represent 10% of scalp hairs, and thus, removal of 4 to 6 hairs is a normal finding in the hair pull test. Loose anagen hair syndrome, similar to telogen effluvium, will result in greater amounts of hair removed. Despite easy removal from the scalp, individual hairs in loose anagen hair syndrome have normal tensile strength and are not brittle. Hairs can be examined under light microscopy by dry-mounting the hair on a glass slide with a cover slip placed over top. In loose anagen hair syndrome anagen, hairs lack inner root sheaths and external root sheaths with a ruffled cuticle.
