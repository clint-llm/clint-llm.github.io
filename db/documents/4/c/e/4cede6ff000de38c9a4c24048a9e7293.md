**Serious Adverse Effects**

Serious adverse effects include first-dose hypotension, and therefore it is recommended to take the initial dose at night. Also, patients may develop orthostatic hypotension and syncope. In cataract surgeries, patients taking prazosin may develop intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) due to the drug's effect on the alpha receptors on the iris dilator muscle. However, some patients develop IFIS without using alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists prior to surgery

Common side effects found in 5 to 10% of patients are dizziness, headaches, drowsiness, lack of energy, weakness, palpitations, and nausea. An extensive list of side effects can be found below with their occurrence rates.
