The use of beta-lactamase inhibitors is contraindicated in patients with a known anaphylactic reaction to penicillins, due to the potential for cross-reactivity with other beta-lactam antimicrobials and beta-lactamase inhibitors. Patients should be allergy tested to determine the presence of allergy as well as the type of allergic reaction prior to administration of beta-lactamase inhibitor therapy.****Beta-lactamase inhibitor therapy is also contraindicated in patients who have had previous adverse reactions to beta-lactamase inhibitors, such as neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, or renal toxicity. Beta-lactamase inhibitors are not contraindicated in pregnancy, although some teratogenic effects have occurred, and dose adjustments may be necessary for pregnant patients.
