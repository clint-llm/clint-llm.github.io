As discussed under the Histopathology section of this article, the first step in any patient with leukocytosis is to obtain a CBC with differential. Prior CBCs should be reviewed and evaluated for any particular trends. The next step is to evaluate a peripheral smear and perform a manual differential if abnormalities are collected on the automatic differential. If immature or lymphoma cells are present, an oncology service should be consulted and the patient should undergo bone marrow aspiration and biopsy with appropriate flow cytometry and molecular genetic studies as indicated. Depending on the results of the bone marrow biopsy, more laboratory testing and imaging may be necessary, as guided by the oncology service.

In the absence of concerning findings on peripheral smear, the following laboratory tests and imaging may be a part of the work-up (adapted from

- **Neutrophilia:**consider smoking history, infection, chronic inflammation, stressors, medication, bone marrow stimulation, splenectomy
- Next step: history collection, medication review, recent surgery review, recent illness, travel history, sick contacts
- Possible lab tests to collect: ESR, CRP, ANA, blood cultures, urine cultures, lumbar punctures, sputum cultures
- Possible imaging depending on the suspected source and system involvement on presentation

- **Lymphocytosis:**consider infections, hypersensitivity reactions
- Next step: history collection, sick contacts, immunization history, recent travel
- Possible lab testing: viral panels, blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum cultures
- Possible imaging: chest radiography, imaging depending on the suspected system involved

- **Monocytosis:**consider viral illness (EBV), rickettsial infection, tuberculosis, autoimmune disease, splenectomy
- Next step: history collection, family history (especially for autosplenectomy causing diseases like Sickle Cell disease), travel history, sick contacts, surgical history
- Possible lab testing: ESR, CRP, ANA, mononucleosis spot test, tuberculosis testing (PPD, interferon-gamma release assay)
- Possible imaging: chest radiography, imaging depending on the suspected system involved

- **Eosinophilia:**consider allergic reaction, parasitic infection, dermatologic conditions, medication reaction/hypersensitivity, eosinophilic esophagitis
- Next step: history collection, perform skin examination for rashes/lesions, travel history, social history to include home environment and animal exposure, medication review, chronic health condition review.
- Possible lab testing: allergy testing, parasite-specific testing (ex. stool ova and parasite evaluation), skin biopsy of lesions
- Possible imaging: upper endoscopy, imaging as warranted on the suspected system involved

- **Basophilia:**consider a malignancy or possible allergic condition
- Next step: history collection, ask malignancy symptom-specific questions (examples include fatigue, weight loss, unexplained fevers/chills, etc.)
- Possible lab testing: inflammatory markers
- Possible imaging: imaging depending on the suspected system involved
