Clomiphene citrate is available as a 50 mg oral tablet.

- Ovulation Induction: 50 mg daily (1 tablet) for five days. Treatment should start on day 5 of the menstrual cycle if there is spontaneous or induced bleeding. If the patient does not ovulate during the first cycle, the dose can be increased to 100 mg per day (two 50 mg tablets taken as a single daily dose) for five days during the second cycle. Treatment is repeatable for up to 6 cycles. A low dosage or treatment duration is explicitly recommended for patients with PCOS to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

Patients must be evaluated to exclude pregnancy, ovarian enlargement, or ovarian cyst formation between each treatment cycle.

Spermatogenesis induction: The regimen is 25 mg daily (half of a tablet) for 25 days, off for five days. Alternative administration is a 25 mg oral tablet every other day. Semen analysis to evaluate spermatozoa level and motility should take place at regular intervals. The dose can be increased to 50 mg daily for 25 days, off for five days.

Chronic short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks (SUNCT) (off-label use if SUNCT refractory to other recommended medications): Initial recommended dosing is 50mg orally daily. The maximum daily dose is 100mg orally daily until the patient becomes pain-free. Continue for a couple of months until the patient is out of cycle, at which point, clomiphene citrate should be tapered off.
