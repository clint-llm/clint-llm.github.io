The usual presentation is chronic and disabling excessive daytime sleepiness in an adolescent or young adult, with the majority complaining of "sleep drunkenness" as difficulty waking up from sleep with transient confusion upon awakening. The onset of the disease is insidious, with symptoms appearing over weeks to months, making it difficult to elucidate any specific triggering factors.

Patients commonly endorse symptoms of long daytime naps (>1 hour) which are typically non-refreshing but sleep attacks are not frequently reported. Two clinical subtypes of IH have been previously reported as IH with long sleep time (IHwLST, >10 hours) and IH without long sleep time (IHwoLST) in the second edition of ICSD. Individuals with long sleep time (>10 to 11 hours) tend to be younger at the time of disease onset, thinner, and have higher sleep efficiency.

Age at disease onset is usually reported to be younger in the IHwLST group, and MSLT latency is longer, with naps that are non-refreshing.

Although sleepiness is the hallmark of IH, symptoms of this condition are not limited to excessive daytime sleepiness and are frequently persistent despite treatment. Specifically, individuals with IHwLST can present with a history of severe sleep inertia, fatigue, and evening chronotype tendency. Furthermore, a study of five-hundred sixty-three participants with idiopathic hypersomnia, brain fog, and sleep drunkenness were more common in IH associated with long sleep durations.

Compared to narcolepsy, individuals with IH were more likely to have prolonged and unrefreshing daytime naps and have a family history of sleepiness. On polysomnography, they are more likely to have increased slow-wave sleep and present with a longer sleep latency on the multiple sleep latency test.
