Laboratory tests are not diagnostic but can provide valuable information about the organ affected. Historically clinicians used barium contrast studies to detect MALTomas of the gastrointestinal tract, but these are not sensitive. Positron emission tomography-computedÂ tomography (PET-CT) is more useful for the detection of MALTomas. In one study, PET-CT identified 42% of cases of early MALTomas, but sensitivity increases to 100% for stage III-IV disease.
