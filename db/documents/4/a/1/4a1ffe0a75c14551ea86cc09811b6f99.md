Multiple members of the interprofessional healthcare team should know when to close wounds and when to leave them open. This includes surgeons, other clinicians, including PAs and NPs, nurses, and surgical assistants. Premature closure of infected or contaminated wounds usually leads to prolonged hospitalization and higher healthcare costs. There are many wound closure techniques, and it is important to be familiar with them, as all of them have certain indications and contraindications. Once a wound is closed, the patient must be monitored to ensure that healing occurs without complications.
