Any neurosurgical intervention involving the ventricles, especially the external ventriculostomy, requires strict aseptic precautions as meningitis and ventriculitis can develop if infection infiltrates the CSF.

**CSF Leak**

Beta2-transferrin is only found in CSF, ocular fluids, and perilymph and is the desialated isoform of the iron-binding glycoprotein transferrin.

**Ventricular Access**

There are several common ventricular catheter insertion sites to access cerebrospinal fluid for CSF diversion.

- Kocher's point

- A localized entry point into the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle is anterior to the motor strip, commonly on the right side, to avoid the dominant hemisphere in most patients. Landmarks are 2-3 centimeters (cm) from the midline, which is approximately the mid-pupillary line. For insertion to be at least 1 cm anterior to the coronal suture, the target is approximately 11 cm posterior to the nasion. The ventricular catheter is then inserted perpendicular to the brain aiming toward the medial canthus of the ipsilateral eye in the medial plane and toward the external auditory meatus in the anterior-posterior plane.

- Â There are multiple other commonly described points to surgically access the ventricular system, including Keen's point, Dandy's point, Frazier's point, and Paine's technique.
