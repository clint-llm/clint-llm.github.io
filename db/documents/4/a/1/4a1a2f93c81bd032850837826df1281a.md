Wartenberg syndrome occurs when the superficial radial nerve is compressed by the brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus tendon and by fascial bands in the subcutaneous plane

The brachioradialis tendon is used clinically to test the C6 spinal nerve. Striking the brachioradialis tendon causes elbow flexion with forearm pronation or supination.

A midshaft fracture of the humerus can damage the radial nerve within the radial groove of the humerus. The brachioradialis is the first muscle to be innervated by the radial nerve distal to the fracture and is an important muscle to check during the recovery process of the nerve. The brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus are the two muscles that first recover innervation following an injury to the radial nerve at the radial groove. The radial nerve recovers about 1 mm per day.
