Diagnosis of cardiomyopathy requires multiple diagnostic tests. Imaging tests play a primary role in the workup. Echocardiogram remains the first test to order; it helps in establishing the diagnosis and provides an easy and cheap tool for routine follow up on disease progression and response to treatment. Cardiac MR provides an excellent evaluation of the myocardial function and is considered to be the definitive imaging test to diagnose hypertrophic and infiltrative diseases of the myocardium. It is useful for predicting prognosis in multiple types of cardiomyopathy. Cardiac CT is essential in the workup of ischemic heart disease and helps in the workup of hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathies. Nuclear imaging is helpful on the evaluation of metabolism and function of the myocardium, and it is an excellent tool for the diagnosis of ischemic cardiomyopathy and has value in the workup of infiltrative cardiomyopathies especially cardiac sarcoidosis and TTR amyloidosis.
