Apical periodontitis results from the encounter between microbial organisms and the host defense system.

As previously stated, the host response includes various cells, mediators, effector molecules, and antibodies. The cellular elements include polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and plasma cells.

Polymorphonuclear leukocytes play a significant role in the host response, as they secrete cytoplastic granules with enzymatic properties. Although the primary responsibility of PMNs is to protect the host, they can cause structural damage to tissue cells and extracellular matrices.
