Wound management is an essential part of emergency medicine practice. The clinicians care for wounds ranging from minor and simple lacerations or abrasions to complex wounds. Wound closure techniques have evolved significantly and now range from simple sutures to adhesive compounds, and techniques have also improved. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of wounds and highlights the role of the healthcare team in managing patients with different types of wounds and their respective closure.
