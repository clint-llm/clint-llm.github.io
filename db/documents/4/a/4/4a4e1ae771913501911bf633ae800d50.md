The upper portion of the urinary bladder is supplied primarily by the superior vesical artery, which is a branch of the hypogastric artery. The lower portion receives supply from the vaginal artery in females and by the inferior vesicular artery in males. There is minor blood supply via the inferior gluteal and obturator arteries as well. The venous system drains via the vesical venous plexus, which empties into the vesical veins. Vesical veins eventually lead to the internal iliac veins. The lymphatics of the bladder mostly drain into the external iliac lymph nodes.
