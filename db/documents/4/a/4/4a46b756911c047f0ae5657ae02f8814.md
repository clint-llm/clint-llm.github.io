Plain Radiograph:

Plain AP and Lateral knee radiographs will not reveal any changes to the LCL; however, X-rays are imperative to rule out associated structural injuries. Frequently seen radiographical changes include fibular head fractures/avulsions (arcuate sign), tibial spine avulsions, or lateral tibial plateau (i.e., Segond fracture). Arcuate sign (avulsion of the styloid of the proximal fibula) and Segond fractures are both pathognomonic for PLC injury, and should immediately warrant further workup for LCL injury. In elderly patients, with chronic lateral knee pain, plain radiographs can be beneficial in ruling out underlying arthritic changes.

Varus and kneeling posterior stress radiographs are also necessary. Both have shown the ability to distinguish the severity of LCL and PLC injury; however, they have high user reliability.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging:

MRI is the gold standard to diagnose structural LCL and PLC injuries. Coronal and sagittal T1 and T2 weighted series have the highest sensitivity and specificity for LCL injury (approximately 90%). MRI alone does not correlate with determining the need for surgery. Radiographs and proper physical examination are a requirement.

Musculoskeletal Ultrasound:  When available, ultrasound can be a useful tool in the rapid diagnosis of LCL injuries. Imaging will show a thickened and hypoechoic LCL. A complete tear may show edema, dynamic laxity, or lack of LCL fiber continuity.

Classification of Injury: LCL injuries classify into three grades depending on severity.

- Grade 1: Mild Sprain - Diagnosed with localized lateral knee tenderness. No instability or mechanical symptoms are present.

- Grade 2: Partial Tear – Diagnosed with more severe localized lateral and posterolateral knee pain, as well as swelling. 5 to 10 mm of laxity may be observed, but there is a fixed endpoint of the ligament.

- Grade 3: Complete Tear – Pain and swelling vary in patients. It is usually associated with PLC and other related injuries. >10mm of laxity, as well as mechanical symptoms, are noted.
