The patient (or next of kin/health care proxy if the patient is obtunded) should be educated about the procedure along with the risks/benefits that are involved. Once consent is obtained, the proper equipment and personnel should be present at the bedside. Patients should be moved into a controlled environment, procedure room, or operating room. Sedation, either partial or full, may be used. General anesthesia is not required; however, if used, an anesthesiologist must be present and preferred to be done so in an operating room.
