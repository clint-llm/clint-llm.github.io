According to the WHO, around 15% of the global population lives with some type of disability. The rising of life expectancy in most of the countries around the world causes aged populations and an increment of chronic health conditions. This epidemiological change involves an increase in the prevalence of disability, especially the one related to the essential daily living activities, such as dressing. Dressing disability is more evident during the last 24Â to 36 months before death.
