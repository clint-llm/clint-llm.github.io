MVP is the primary myxomatous degeneration of one or both leaflets of the mitral valve. Myxomatous degeneration may involve valve leaflet abnormalities, chordae tendineae weakening and elongation, mitral annular dilatation or thickened leaflet tissue, elongated chordae, mitral annular enlargement leading to segmental mitral leaflet prolapse. Other pathophysiological changes include fibroelastic deficiency characterized by thin, translucent, and smooth leaflets or deficiency in elastin, proteoglycan, and collagen with connective tissue deficiency.

Endothelium disruption leads to complications such as infectious endocarditis and thromboembolism. Most MVP individuals have minimal mitral valve structure derangement, which is not clinically significant.

There is usually a gross redundancy of the mitral valve leaflets, which fails coaptation of the leaflets during systole, leading to mitral insufficiency. Over time the patient develops mitral annual dilatation, resulting in further worsening of the mitral insufficiency. Fortunately, most patients have minor derangements in the leaflets and are asymptomatic.
