Patients may be asymptomatic early on in the disease process. When they become symptomatic, however, the stated history is usually of hip pain that may radiate to the groin and/or thigh. The pain is typically aggravated by activities such as walking and climbing stairs and alleviated by rest. The pain will often still be present, even in the absence of movement.
