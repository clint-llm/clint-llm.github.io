Hypoalbuminaemia is one of the most prevalent disorders in hospitalized and critically ill patients. Hypoalbuminaemia may be a result of decreased production (rare) of albumin or increased loss of albumin via the kidneys, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, skin, or extravascular space or increased catabolism of albumin or a combination of 2 or more of these mechanisms.
