Eptifibatide is useful in treating acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Healthcare workers, including nurses, pharmacists, clinicians, specialists, and cardiologists, should know that bleeding and thrombocytopenia are major complications following the administration of eptifibatide. They should work together to identify these complications. Nursing should be first in line to monitor for adverse events, especially bleeding. Pharmacists should conduct thorough medication reconciliation and verify dosing since medication errors in either area can lead to therapeutic failure or severe bleeding. Any concerns in these areas require immediate communication with the physician in charge and the rest of the team involved in care. Eptibitaide is a high-risk medication, according to ISMP (Institute for Safe Medication Practices). Also, since heparin is used in conjunction with eptifibatide in ACS treatment and during PCI, it is imperative to learn how to differentiate heparin-induced thrombocytopenia from eptifibatide-induced thrombocytopenia. Only through this type of interprofessional collaboration can patients achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes with eptifibatide. [Level 5]
