Cerebral palsy is a term used to describe a group of disorders that are caused by a non-progressive brain abnormality, which results in difficulty with movement, tone, and/or posture. There are several factors during pregnancy, around the time of birth, and after birth that play a role in the development of cerebral palsy. The significant risk factors for cerebral palsy are prematurity and low birth weight. Other causes of cerebral palsy include stroke, lack of oxygen to the brain, infections of the brain, and abnormal development of the brain. Cerebral palsy is the most common cause of childhood disability. Cerebral palsy is a clinical diagnosis, made by obtaining a detailed prenatal and birth history, physical exam, and neuroimaging. Treatment focuses on achieving the best functional outcomes and takes an interprofessional team approach. Routine prenatal care and measures to reduce preterm birth lower the risk of cerebral palsy.
