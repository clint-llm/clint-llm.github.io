Dumping syndrome occurs in patients who have had gastric surgery. Symptoms of early dumping occur within 10 to 30 minutes after a meal. Late dumping can present 1 to 3 hours after a high-carbohydrate meal.

There may be GI or vasomotor symptoms. GI symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or belching. Vasomotor symptoms include shock, syncope, near-syncope, palpitations, dizziness, desire to lie down, or diaphoresis.
