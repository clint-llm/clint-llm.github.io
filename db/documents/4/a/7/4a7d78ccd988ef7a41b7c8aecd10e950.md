Although the subpectoral (submuscular) placement allows for an extra tissue layer over the implant as well as preventing the implant from migrating inferiorly, this approach comes with its complications. Muscle dissection can cause an increase in postoperative pain levels. Other reported complications are animation deformity, shoulder dysfunction, and a less natural-appearing breast due to implant placement under the muscle.

The pre-pectoral (subcutaneous) placement allows for a more natural-appearing breast and decreased postoperative pain since the muscle insertions are left intact. Complications associated with this approach are capsular contracture, implant loss or exposure, migration of the implant, and skin flap ischemia.

**Capsular contracture**is defined as the development of an envelope around the implant that consists of fibrous tissue causing breast pain and deformity. There is an increased rate of this complication with breast reconstruction versus in breast augmentation patients. It has also been noted that capsular contracture occurs to a lesser degree in subpectoral placement because the muscle movement massages the implant and allows an extra coverage layer between the implant and skin with the muscle acting as a barrier from bacteria.

Complications to consider are seromas, skin flap necrosis, infection, implant exposure/loss.
