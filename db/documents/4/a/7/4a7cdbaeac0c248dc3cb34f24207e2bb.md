Evaluation should involve a thorough history including a sexual history.

Characteristically lymphogranuloma venereum has three stages

**Primary Stage**

- Begins in 3 to 12 days after exposure or sometimes it may be longer up to 30 days.

- The patient characteristically develops a painless genital ulcer or papules which are about 1 to 6 mm in size. Sores can also be present in the mouth or throat. An inflammatory reaction can occur at the site of inoculation.

- This stage often goes unnoticed due to the location of the lesions and as the lesions are usually small and there are no associated symptoms.

- The lesions resolve or heal spontaneously after few days.

**Secondary Stage**

- The secondary stage presents with the development of unilateral or bilateral tender inguinal and/or femoral lymphadenopathy (also called buboes), which occurs two to six weeks after the primary stage; this is called the inguinal syndrome.

- An anorectal syndrome also presents which is characterized by proctitis or proctocolitis-like symptoms. Pain during urination, rectal bleeding, pain during passing stools, abdominal pain, anal pain, tenesmus. Generalized symptoms like body aches, headache, and fever can occur during this stage.  This syndrome usually occurs when the transmission is via the anal route.

- An oral syndrome can occur in people get LGV through the oral route. Cervical lymphadenopathy can occur.

- There are also reports of systemic complications like pneumonia and hepatitis.

**Late Sequelae**

Usually, occur when the disease is left untreated.

- Necrosis and rupture of the lymph nodes

- Anogenital fibrosis, and strictures

- Anal fistulae

- Elephantiasis of the genital organs can also occur in some cases
