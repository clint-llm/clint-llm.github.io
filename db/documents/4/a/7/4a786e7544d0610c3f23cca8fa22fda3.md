# Continuing Education Activity

The undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), formerly known as malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), is a high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma (STS). The historical literature previously encompassed various STSs as MFH. These were later reclassified as distinct entities, with the advancements in cytogenetics and immunohistochemistry studies. This activity reviews the current description, evaluation, and management of UPS and highlights the interprofessional team's role in improving the care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.
- Describe the evaluation protocol for undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.
- Outline treatment alternatives for undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma according to disease staging.
- Review how interprofessional strategies can optimize patient outcomes in cases of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.

# Introduction

The undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) —formerly known as malignant fibrous histiocytoma, is a high-grade aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma (STS). Mesenchymal stem cells are the most likely origin of the tumor, instead of histiocytes as previously thought.

Prior subclassifications of MFH into storiform, pleomorphic, myxoid, giant cell, and angiomatoid variants are now rarely utilized. The definition of this tumor has been a matter of debate for more than five decades. Hence, a significant limitation of the historical literature is that only the most recent studies can confidently characterize this entity. At present, UPS is diagnosed by excluding other well-classified STSs.

# Etiology

The exact pathogenic mechanisms of UPS remain obscure. In general, STSs are composed of heterogeneous populations of cells with mesenchymal features that can originate from simple genomic alterations or complex genomics.

The tumorigenesis of UPS is reportedly initiated by a subpopulation of cells called side population (SP) cells, which the Hoechst dye efflux assay can identify. According to an elegant xenograft experimental model, these cells have an increased capacity for self-renewal, growth, proliferation and can recapitulate tumor formation. UPS-derived SP cells and UPS in situ analyses showed that Hedgehog and Notch signaling pathways and downstream transcriptional targets are notoriously upregulated at both subcellular and tissue levels.

The Hippo pathway may also be implicated in UPS tumor biology, as vestigial-like family member 3 (VGLL3) and yes1-associated transcriptional regulator (YAP1) cofactors were found to be highly amplified on a genome sequencing study.

Similarly, Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), a Wnt/B-catenin signaling pathway inhibitor, was differentially overexpressed in UPS compared to other STSs.

Mutations in tumor protein 53 (TP53), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), retinoblastoma-associated protein (RB1), and transcriptional regulator ATRX (ATRX) genes, as well as PR domain zinc finger protein 10 (PRDM10) and triple functional domain protein (TRIO) gene fusions have also been identified in UPS.

Besides genetic aberrations, radiation therapy (RT) is a known risk factor for STS development. Indeed, radiation-associated STS presents in around 1% to 3% of subjects diagnosed with any sarcoma. Specifically, in a series of 1068 UPS cases, 5.1% of the patients had a prior history of radiation.

# Epidemiology

The 2020 World Health Organization classification of STSs incorporates UPS under malignant tumors of uncertain differentiation.

# Histopathology

Histopathology examination is essential for the diagnosis of UPS.

On light microscopy, UPS exhibits atypical, pleomorphic spindle cells with abundant mitotic figures. Depth of invasion can extend through the deep dermis, hypodermis, fascia, and striated muscle. The tumor may display a storiform, fascicular, or sheet-like configuration within a fibrous stroma.

The definitive diagnosis of UPS is confirmed by excluding other malignancies with a panel of immunohistochemical markers.

A complete post-operative histopathology report must mention the location of the tumor, depth of invasion, size, histologic grade, presence or absence of necrosis, excision margins status, vascular involvement, mitotic rate, type and extension of the inflammatory infiltrate, as well as the tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging.

# History and Physical

UPS typically appears as an asymptomatic, unremarkable, rapidly growing cutaneous or subcutaneous nodule without superficial skin abnormalities.

# Evaluation

Once the diagnosis has been confirmed with histopathology and immunohistochemistry, evaluation and workup include imaging of the primary tumor, lymph nodes, and distant metastases. The TNM staging criteria will vary depending on the location of the tumor. The NCCN guideline Version 1.2021 recommends performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast to determine tumor size, invasion of visceral structures, and neurovascular involvement.

Chest, abdominal, and pelvic non-contrast computed tomography (CT) should be considered when internal viscera or retroperitoneal involvement is suspected. Total spine, head, and neck MRI or CT may be requested in particular cases. There is not enough evidence to recommend sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or positron emission tomography (PET) in UPS. Yet, it is worth noting that a recent systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scan is a useful predictive tool in patients with STSs and bone sarcomas.

# Treatment / Management

The standard of care for head, neck, trunk, and extremities UPS is en bloc surgical excision with microscopically negative margins, particularly for stage I tumors. This may be achieved by wide local excision with 2 cm margins of uninvolved tissue, albeit some cases may pose greater difficulty due to the involvement of important neurovascular structures. Postoperative radiotherapy (RT) is indicated when margins are close to the tumor (< 1 cm), microscopically positive, involve bone, major blood vessels, or nerves.

Broadly, chemotherapy with different antineoplastics is employed for advanced, widespread, or irresectable stages of various STSs.

Similar principles apply to internal, retroperitoneal, or intraabdominal UPS management. Excision with negative margins, with or without IORT, is the treatment of choice for resectable disease, whilst chemotherapy, chemoradiation, or HDR are preferred for unresectable cases.

# Differential Diagnosis

The most common differential diagnoses of UPS are other types of STSs, which must be distinguished by clinical history, physical examination, and immunohistochemistry markers.

# Staging

Trunk and extremities UPS is staged according to the TNM and histologic grade (G) (Table 1).

# Prognosis

Early disease recognition and an adequate treatment strategy are the most important interventions to improve overall prognosis. In a current retrospective study of 319 patients from three tertiary care centers, recurrences and metastases occurred in 14.1% and 7.8% of the cases, respectively.

The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 60% and 48%, respectively. Interestingly, in another publication, the 5-year disease-specific survival and recurrence rates were significantly worse in radiation-associated UPS than sporadic UPS, suggesting there might be distinct mutational profiles for the disease.

Follow-up visits are important to detect local recurrences or metastasis. Physical examination of stage I tumors should be performed at 3-to-6-month intervals for the first two years and then annually.

# Complications

As with many other high-grade STSs, the most common complications include local recurrences, metastasis, and death. Depending on the affected area, these may also be treatment-related, presenting as disability due to limb amputation, organ damage sequalae, wound complications, and neurovascular compromise.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patient education about UPS is vital for reassurance, adherence to treatment, and follow-up. A study showed that up to 45% of newly diagnosed sarcoma patients show signs of psychological distress.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Per the current guideline recommendations, an interprofessional healthcare team should be involved in the treatment decisions.
