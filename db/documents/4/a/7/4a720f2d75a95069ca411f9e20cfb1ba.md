Under normal homeostasis, pre-procalcitonin undergoes initial synthesis by thyroid C cells. Later this peptide is transformed into procalcitonin via cleavage of a 25-amino acid signal sequence by endopeptidases. The end product calcitonin, the 32-amino acid hormone responsible for serum calcium regulation, is formed following conversion by the enzyme prohormone convertase.

The extra-thyroid synthesis of PCT occurs in the liver, pancreas, kidney, lung, intestine, and leukocytes; notably, the synthesis of PCT is suppressed within these tissues in the absence of bacterial infection.
