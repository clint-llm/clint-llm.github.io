A dental implant is one of the treatments to replace missing teeth. Their use in the treatment of complete and partial edentulism has become an integral treatment modality in dentistry. Dental implants have a number of advantages over conventional fixed partial denture.

- A high success rate (above 97% for 10 years)

- A decreased risk of caries and endodontic problems of adjacent teeth

- Improved maintenance of bone in edentulous site

- Decreased sensitivity of adjacent teeth

A dental implant is a structure made of alloplastic materials implanted into the oral tissues beneath the mucosa and/or periosteum and/or within or through the bone to provide retention and support for a fixed or removable dental prosthesis.

Implant dentistry the second oldest dental profession; exodontia (oral surgery) is the oldest. Around 600 AD, the Mayan population used pieces of shells as implants to replace mandibular teeth. In 1809, J. Maggiolo inserted a gold implant tube into a fresh extraction site. In 1930, the Strock brothers used Vitallium screws to replace missing teeth. A post-type endosseous implant was developed by Formiggini (the father of modern implantology) and Zepponi in the 1940s. The subperiosteal implant was developed in the 1940s by Dahl in Sweden. In 1946 Strock designed a two-stage screw implant that was inserted without a permucosal post. The abutment post and individual crown were added after this implant completely healed. The desired implant interface at this time was described as ankylosis. In 1967, Dr. Linkow introduced blade implants, now recognized as endosseous implants. Dental implants became a scientific cornerstone after the serendipitous invention of Dr. Branemark who helped in the evolution of the concept of osseointegration (direct, rigid attachment of the implant to the bone without any intervening tissue in between two implants)
