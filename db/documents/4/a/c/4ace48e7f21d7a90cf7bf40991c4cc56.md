Acalculous cholecystitis accounts for ten percent of all cases of acute cholecystitis and 5% to 10% of all cases of cholecystitis. It has an equal predisposition between males and females. However, males are more likely to develop acute acalculous cholecystitis after surgery. Rates are increased in HIV and other immunosuppressed patients. These individuals are more susceptible to certain opportunistic infections such as microsporidia, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Cryptosporidium, which can seed and flourish in bile within the gallbladder. Carriers of Giardia lamblia, Helicobacter pylori, and Salmonella typhi are also associated with increased risks to develop cholecystitis.
