About 2.4 percent of the population is affected by peripheral neuropathy. The prevalence increases to 8 percent in older populations. Peripheral neuropathy can be a manifestation of a wide range of pathologies that require further evaluation and/or treatment. Furthermore, peripheral neuropathies must be addressed before they result in complications, such as falls with subsequent hip fractures or pedal infections necessitating amputation. Interprofessional team members must recognize and evaluate peripheral neuropathy so that any underlying cause can be addressed and complications can be prevented, in turn improving outcomes for patients. This activity highlights considerations when evaluating and treating patients with peripheral neuropathies and demonstrates the critical role that interprofessional care teams play in caring for patients suffering from peripheral neuropathies.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of peripheral neuropathy.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of a patient with peripheral neuropathy.
- Explain the treatment and management options available for peripheral neuropathy.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with peripheral neuropathy.
