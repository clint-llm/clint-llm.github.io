1. Inherited or familial (38% to 68% of glomangiomas):

Generally, it is autosome dominant with incomplete penetrance and variable expression, located in a 4--6--cm region of chromosome 1p21-22. Glomulin is the mutated gene that is located on the YAC and PAC maps. This gene includes 14 mutations in patients with this medical condition, which results in a loss of function. This loss of function increases cyclin E and c-Myc levels. In 60% of cases, one other family member is also affected. It can present at birth or later during adolescence.

Segmental type 2 is a variant of inherited glomangiomas. Initially they present with one primary lesion, followed by multiple distal lesions.

2. Sporadic or de novo mutation

It presents during birth.
