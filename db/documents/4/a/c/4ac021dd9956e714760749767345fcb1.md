Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is the name given to describe any deviation from the normal menstrual cycle. The average cycle lasts 29 days with a range of 23-39 days with bleeding episodes lasting 2-7 days. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and the American Congress of Obstetricians-Gynecologist have endorsed the PALM-COEIN classification system that divides AUB into structural and non-structural causes. This activity will discuss the aspects of acute AUB in non-pregnant reproductive-age women when it is of sufficient quantity to require prompt intervention to prevent further blood loss. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Recall the causes of menorrhagia.
- Describe the workup of a patient with menorrhagia.
- Summarize the treatment of menorrhagia.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by menorrhagia.
