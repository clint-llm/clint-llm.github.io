Beta-lactam antibiotics are used in the management and treatment of bacterial infections. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of an interprofessional healthcare team in the treatment of patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of beta-lactam antibiotics.
- Describe the possible adverse effects of beta-lactam antibiotics.
- Outline the appropriate monitoring of patients taking beta-lactam antibiotics.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance beta-lactam antibiotics and improve outcomes.
