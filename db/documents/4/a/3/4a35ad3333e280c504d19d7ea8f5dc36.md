The majority of nummular dermatitis cases should respond to conservative measures such as gentle skincare and bland emollients used in combination with mid- to high- potency steroids. Consultation with a dermatologist should be considered in refractory, widespread, or atypical cases. Further evaluation may include skin scraping with potassium hydroxide preparation, bacterial swab for culture and sensitivities, biopsy, or patch testing, as discussed previously. If narrow-band UVB light therapy, systemic immunosuppressant, or immunomodulator is warranted, this should also be carried out under a dermatologist's supervision.
