Urethritis is documented based on any of the following signs or laboratory tests

- Urethral mucopurulent or purulent discharge.

- Gram stain of urethral secretions showing >2 WBC per oil immersion field. Gram stain is the rapid diagnostic test of choice for testing urethritis. It has high sensitivity and specificity for documenting both urethritis and the presence (or absence) of gonococcal infection.

- Positive leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine or microscopic exam of a first-void urine sediment showing greater than 10 WBC per high-power field.
