Pneumonia can be classified as either community-acquired

**Neonates:**Neonates are at risk for bacterial pathogens present in the birth canal; this includes organisms such as group B streptococci,Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes.Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus can be identified in late-onset neonatal pneumonia.

**Older Infants and****Toddlers:**Viruses are the main cause of pneumonia in older infants and toddlers between 30 days and 2 years old.

**Preschool:**In children 2 to 5 years old, respiratory viruses are also the most common.S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type B is observed in this age group.

**School-age:**Mycoplasma pneumonia frequently occurs in children in the range from 5 to 13 years oldS. pneumoniae is still the most commonly identified organism.

**Adolescents:**Adolescents usually have the same infectious risks as adults. It is important to consider tuberculosis (TB) in immigrants from high prevalence areas, and children with known exposures.

**Special cases:**Children with chronic diseases are also at risk for specific pathogens. In cystic fibrosis, pneumonia secondary toS. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is ubiquitous.Pneumocystis jirovecii, cytomegalovirus, and fungal species if no other organism is identified.
