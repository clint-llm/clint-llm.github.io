Most of the early postoperative complications are due to improper surgical technique and can easily be prevented by proper procedural planning and better tissue handling. These complications include edema, hematoma formation, wound dehiscence, flap necrosis, urethrocutaneous fistula, penile torsion, accidental removal of the ureteral stent, etc.

To avoid flap necrosis and dehiscence, adequate flap mobilization and tension-free repair are needed. Fistula formation is a common complication after reconstructive surgery for hypospadias. Factors contributing to the formation of a fistula include poor tissue handling, distal construction, local infection, etc. All factors have to be kept in mind to avoid any fistula formation.

Accidental stent dislodgements can be avoided by adequate anchoring. Late complications include meatal stenosis, fistula formation, diverticulae formation, stricture formation, persistent chordee, torsion, etc. Late complications possibly arise due to unaddressed early complications. Children who develop wound infection, dehiscence, hematoma formation, etc. are at risk for developing further complications later. These complications generally require reoperation for their correction.
