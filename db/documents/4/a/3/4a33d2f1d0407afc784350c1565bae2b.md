Serotonin syndrome is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the pharmacist preferably trained in toxicology and a clinical toxicologist. Since many cases are drug-related, the physician and pharmacist must be aware of potential drug interactions. Drug-induced serotonin syndrome is usually mild and will resolve spontaneously but it is best to prevent the disorder in the first place. Cases that are diagnosed and managed have a good outcome. when prescribing a new agent, the clinician should have the pharmacist perform a thorough medication reconciliation looking for interactions and additive effects. Nursing should be alert to the signs of serotonin syndrome and report any concerns promptly to the prescriber so intervention can occur immediately. An interprofessional approach involving clinicians, pharmacists, and toxicologists with nursing assisting with monitoring and family education will lead to the best outcomes. [Level 5]
