Patients need to receive counsel on prevention and biomechanical optimal movement pertaining to the elbow joint to prevent strain and overuse to the forearm and elbow. Key counseling points can include:

- Avoid end range of motion extremes in both extension and flexion.

- Avoid repetitive hand and wrist motions, and take breaks from such activities when necessary to perform them.

- Avoid letting heavy items with the arm in full extension; perform work or weight-lifting partially bent with the elbow.

- Use two hands to hold heavy tools, and use a two-handed backhand in tennis.

- Limit repetitive grasping and gripping motions.

- If a movement causes the pain to return, avoid it, and report to your clinician's office.
