**Causes of LAD include:**

- Normal variation (physiologic, often age-related change)

- Left ventricular hypertrophy

- Conduction defects: left bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block

- Inferior wall myocardial infarction

- Preexcitation syndromes (e.g., Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome)

- Ventricular ectopic rhythms (e.g., ventricular tachycardia)

- Congenital heart disease (e.g., primum atrial septal defect, endocardial cushion defect)

- Hyperkalemia

- Emphysema

- Mechanical shift, such as with expiration or raised diaphragm (e.g., pregnancy, ascites, abdominal tumor, organomegaly)

- Pacemaker-generated rhythm or paced rhythm

**Causes of RAD include:**

- Normal variation (e.g., children, young adults)

- Limb-lead reversal (left- and right-arm electrodes)

- Right ventricular overload syndromes (acute or chronic)

- Right ventricular hypertrophy

- Conduction defects: left posterior fascicular block, right bundle branch block

- Lateral wall myocardial infarction

- Preexcitation syndromes (e.g., Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome)

- Ventricular ectopic rhythms (e.g., ventricular tachycardia)

- Congenital heart disease (e.g., secundum atrial septal defect)

- Dextrocardia

- Left pneumothorax

- Mechanical shift, such as with inspiration or emphysema

- Conditions that cause right ventricular strain (e.g., pulmonary embolism, pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, chronic lung disease, and resultant cor pulmonale)
