In acute suppurative submandibular sialadenitis, interstitial neutrophilic infiltration, necrosis with acinar destruction is present. Vacuolar changes in the acini cells and lymphocytic infiltration is more common in viral sialadenitis. Dilated duct with calculi, chronic inflammation, and fibrosis is evident in chronic sialadenitis due to sialolith. In sialadenosis, there is atrophy of parenchymal tissue and a compensatory increase in the amount of adipose tissue. Inflammatory infiltrates are absent.
