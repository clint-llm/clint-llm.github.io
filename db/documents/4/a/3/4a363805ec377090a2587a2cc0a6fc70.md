Agitation is a common feature observed in hospitalized patients. However, the cause of agitation may not always be obvious. Mild agitation can be managed with non-coercive treatments but when it is severe, pharmacological therapy is necessary. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, psychiatrist, internist, primary care provider (nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or physician). The condition can lead to harm to both the patient and the provider, hence, due precautions should be undertaken.
