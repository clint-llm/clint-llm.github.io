Oxygen is essential for ATP generation through oxidative phosphorylation, and therefore must be reliably delivered to all metabolically active cells in the body.

Oxygen is carried in the blood in two forms. The vast majority of oxygen in the blood is bound to hemoglobin within red blood cells, while a small amount of oxygen is physically dissolved in the plasma. The regulation of unloading of oxygen from hemoglobin at target tissues is controlled by several factors, including oxygen concentration gradient, temperature, pH, and concentration of the compound 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate. The most critical measures of adequate oxygen transportation are hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation; the latter is often measured clinically using pulse oximetry.

Understanding oxygen transport informs our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of tissue hypoxia, ischemia, cyanosis, and necrosis and management to improve global hypoxemia.
