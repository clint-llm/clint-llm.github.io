Since ECMO was first successfully used, cumulative information regarding its use, including complications, has been collected by the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO). The overall survival to hospital discharge for pediatric respiratory ECMO is 57%; for pediatric cardiac ECMO, it’s 50%.

- Technical complications

- 
              
- Inadvertent decannulation
              
              
- Membrane lung failure
              
              
- Tubing rupture
              
              
- Pump malfunction

- Medical complications

- 
              
- Neurologic (most common): intracranial hemorrhage, seizures, brain death, ischemic infarction
              
              
- Hematologic: cannula site bleeding, surgical site bleeding, clots in the circuit, vessel injury from cannulation, pulmonary hemorrhage, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hemolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, inadequate anticoagulation, limb ischemia
              
              
- End-organ hypoperfusion: renal failure, liver failure
              
              
- Cardiac tamponade
              
              
- Infection
              
              
- High-pressure system in neonates: increased hemolysis, hyperbilirubinemia, hypertension, end-organ damage with renal failure
              
              
- Long term: poor growth, neurodevelopmental deficits, organ damage (e.g., sensorineural hearing loss, lung injury, renal dysfunction)
