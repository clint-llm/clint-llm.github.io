It is common for exercise-associated collapse to occur in the pre-hospital setting, such as a mass participation athletic event. Healthcare providers should suspect EAC when athletes present with collapse during exertion or just after discontinuation of intense physical exertion, such as marathon running, cycling, triathlon, hiking, backpacking, or endurance-based military field training or combat operations.

The likelihood of EAC is increased if the exertional event occurred in hot, humid weather, but other etiologies should be considered if a patient presents with significantly abnormal vital signs, including significant hypertension and hyperthermia. Prompt identification and differentiation from other common exertional injuries are essential to caring for a collapsed athlete. Alternative etiologies include, but are not limited to, sudden cardiac arrest, exertional heat stroke, exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH), exercise collapse associated with sickle cell trait (ECAST), insulin-related hypoglycemia, seizures, and anaphylaxis.

Presenting symptoms of EAC include lightheadedness, orthostasis, faintness, fatigue, generalized weakness. The individual will often present with some alteration in mental status ranging from mild to significant. Severe symptoms include syncope after discontinuation of exertion.
