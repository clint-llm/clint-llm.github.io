The diagnosis of LWE is based on a careful history and slit lamp examination. Patients typically present with symptoms of ocular discomfort, foreign body sensation, and contact lens intolerance. Patients can often localize the source of the foreign body sensation to the upper eyelid. Slit lamp examination of the lid wiper region may reveal signs of inflammation, such as lid marginal redness, swelling, and increased vascularization due to hypoxia, mechanical irritation, or other stressors.

Using ophthalmic vital dyes is critical for properly assessing pathologic areas of devitalized cellular damage along the eyelid margins and goblet cells (lissamine green and rose bengal) and punctate epithelial erosions to the cornea (sodium fluorescein) epithelium.Â Although sodium fluorescein staining may highlight focal areas of epithelial defects along the cornea or bulbar conjunctiva, the most obvious way of highlighting LWE is with a lissamine green stain.

Other supplemental diagnostic tests such as Schirmer, tear break-up time, tear osmolarity, and conjunctival impression cytology may also be supportive to diagnosis, particularly with associated dry eye and ocular surface disease.

It is important to note that lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE) often coexists with various comorbid ocular surface diseases. These conditions can include anterior blepharitis, posterior blepharitis (such as meibomian gland dysfunction and evaporative dry eye), chalazia, hordeola, aqueous deficiency dry eye, conjunctivochalasis, pinguecula, pterygia, allergic conjunctivitis, bacterial conjunctivitis, viral conjunctivitis, cicatrizing conjunctivitis, marginal keratitis, punctate keratitis, ulcerative keratitis, among others.

In rare cases, lid margin disease may also encompass sebaceous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. The definitive diagnosis of these conditions typically requires a biopsy for confirmation. It is essential for healthcare professionals to consider these potential comorbidities and, when necessary, pursue appropriate diagnostic measures to ensure accurate identification and management of these associated ocular surface diseases.
