The thumb spica splint is indicated in radially-based hand and wrist injuries.  Examples of these injuries include but are not limited to

- Various types of soft tissue and/or osseous injuries along the thumb/first ray

- These injuries include osseous injuries (e.g., phalangeal or metacarpal fractures) or soft-tissue based injuries (e.g., thumb ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injuries)
- Other injuries include first metacarpal base injuries (i.e., Bennett and Rolando fractures)
- Degenerative conditions of the thumb (e.g., carpometacarpal thumb osteoarthritis, also commonly referred to as basal joint arthritis)

- Fractures of the carpus

- Scaphoid fractures
- Lunate fractures

- De Quervain tenosynovitis

- Carpal tunnel syndrome

- Not considered standard of care in the management of CTS
- Cock-up wrist splints are often effective as night-splinting modalities; however, the use of splinting measures in the management of CTS remains controversial
- Although controversial, some studies report improvement in symptoms in the short-term management of symptoms - some studies have demonstrated a potential clinical benefit in the use of splinting measures for patients with primarily nocturnal symptoms
