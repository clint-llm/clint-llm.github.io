Appendiceal malignancies are a rare group of tumors often found incidentally during surgical removal of the appendix. Histologically, this malignancy accounts for 0.5% to 1% of all biopsy specimens following appendectomies. Clinically, this condition most commonly presents as acute appendicitis due to obstruction of the appendiceal lumen. As it is for all malignancies, early detection is critical as the late diagnosis could lead to much poorer outcomes. This activity seeks to quantify and define appendiceal malignancies. It describes current recommendations for the evaluation and management of these disease processes. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating patients with these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of appendiceal malignancies.
- Describe features of the history and physical that may suggest underlying malignancy.
- Identify the appropriate treatment regimen for each type of appendiceal malignancy.
- Review the benefits of an interprofessional team approach to the treatment of appendiceal malignancy.
