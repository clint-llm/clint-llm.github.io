The prognosis of this condition is highly dependent on prompt diagnosis and management. The biggest predictors of mortality are perforation (32% to 59% mortality), a large segment of affected bowel (>40 cm), and ischemic bowel, which is indicated by an elevated lactic acid, or septic shock. There has been no documented significant difference between the age or sex of the patient and mortality.
