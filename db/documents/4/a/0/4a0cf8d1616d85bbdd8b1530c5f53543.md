- Clot formation causes a sudden drop in fluid flow or fluid leak around the insertion site. Try milking the plastic tube. If it does not work, inform the surgeon.

- It can get obstructed by small tissue fragments. The reduced collection may be misleading. When no fluid is collecting, check for occlusion or obstructed by adjacent tissue.

- The catheter can fall out when it slips off the suture. If it happens, keep a pad at the drain insertion site and secure with adhesive tape. Inform the surgeon.
