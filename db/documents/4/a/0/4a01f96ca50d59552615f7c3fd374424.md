Error management training in medical simulation has primarily been studied in procedural specialties, including surgery and intensive care settings.

An example of the development of an EMT based curriculum has recently been published in the field of combat medicine. There were high rates of lower extremity fasciotomies requiring revision amongst combat-wounded patients when they reached a higher level of care, indicating a need for improvement in training surgeons to perform fasciotomies.

When creating an error management training curriculum, it is important to evaluate what is being taught and who are the trainees. Prior work has demonstrated that trainees who had higher cognitive skills or were more open to new experiences learned the most from error encouragement training.

Dâ€™Angelo et al. created a classification scheme for evaluating errors made by residents performing a simulated surgical task. The classification scheme had its basis on prior work in the field of human factors engineering.
