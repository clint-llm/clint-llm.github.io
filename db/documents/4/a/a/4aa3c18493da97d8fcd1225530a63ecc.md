The majority of cases of food poisoning and non-foodborne diarrheal disease are self-limiting. Those who are hospitalized need fluid resuscitation and an advancing diet when tolerated. Generally, the prognosis is good. On the other hand, clostridial myonecrosis and sepsis are medical emergencies with a guarded prognosis. Early recognition and treatment, including surgical debridement, are vital. Even with appropriate treatment, the mortality rate is 20 to 30%, while the mortality rate is 100% without treatment.
