Symptoms can sometimes be alarming to the clinician, such as agitation, psychosis, and alteration of consciousness. Recognition of the diagnosis of Todd paresis in a patient will avoid unnecessary tests and treatments.

No laboratory studies help with the diagnosis of postictal paralysis.

Computed tomographic (CT) perfusion scan anomalies are often found but are not consistent and thus nondiagnostic. It can show a hypoperfusion state at the site of the epileptic focus.

CT angiography is unremarkable in postictal paralysis. This study can be used to differentiate between this condition and acute cerebrovascular accident (stroke) in which a major arterial branch can be seen occluded.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will show findings consistent with a seizure, such as a transiently increased T2 signal at the site of the epileptic focus. This is due to increased edema at the site, which is bright on T2 imaging. It is best appreciated on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images.

Electroencephalography (EEG) will show a focal or generalized slowing.
