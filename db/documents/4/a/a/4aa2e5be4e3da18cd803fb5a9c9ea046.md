Osteonecrosis often starts even before a patient experiences symptoms. It typically progresses to end-stage disease if left untreated. Symptoms vary, but patients with late-stage disease usually have severe pain, debilitation, and even joint collapse.

Patient presentation of this disease is highly variable, so it is essential to reduce your risk factors. Ways to decrease risks include avoiding excessive alcohol consumption, no tobacco use, and tapering corticosteroids to the lowest necessary dose. Other lifestyle modifications like eating a healthy diet and maintaining an appropriate weight minimize joint damage. For manual laborers, consider avoiding repetitive activities that place strain on their joints. If possible, laborers should take regular breaks. Lastly, be proactive. Since patients with early-stage often do not have symptoms, they should seek periodic well-being evaluations by their primary care clinician.
