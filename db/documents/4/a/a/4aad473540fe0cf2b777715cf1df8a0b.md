Colonic adenomas are raised protrusions of colonic mucosa, i.e., polyps formed by glandular tissue. Although a tumor of benign nature, these adenomas are usually considered precancerous and can transform into malignant structures, in contrast to hyperplastic polyps, with no malignant potential. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, histology, diagnostic evaluation, complications, screening, and treatment of tubular adenoma. Moreover, it highlights the role of the interprofessional team in educating patients to adhere to standard colorectal polyps and cancer screening.

**Objectives:**
- Review the histology and pathophysiology of tubular adenoma and pathways of malignant transformation.
- Describe the screening guidelines for colorectal polyps and cancer.
- Outline the differential diagnoses of tubular adenoma.
- Explain the importance of collaboration among the interprofessional team, including internists, pathologists, and surgeons to improve patient outcomes.
