Specific surgeries that encounter the superior tarsal muscle include procedures focusing on correction of elevation dysfunctions of the upper eyelid. These surgeries usually resect the superior tarsal muscle and the levator palpebrae superioris muscle together. A 10-year study of this procedure found that, after resecting the superior tarsal muscle, a significant majority of patients with congenital and acquired ptosis were within 1.5 mm of the opposite lid level, and less than 1% required additional surgery.

Another specific surgery which affecting the superior tarsal muscle is the superior tarsal muscle-conjunctival resection procedure. When performing this procedure, intended for correction of ptosis, careful consideration is to be given to adjustments of the resection, which is usually by resecting a very small amount per elevation required from the superior tarsal border. It is in this situation where the physiologic variants mentioned above are helpful to understand.
