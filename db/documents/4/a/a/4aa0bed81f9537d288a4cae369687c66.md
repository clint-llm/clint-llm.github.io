Recommended initial dose of zonisamide is 100 to 200 mg daily for adults and 2 to 4 mg/kg/day for children. Once or twice daily dosing is used. The dose should be increased at two-week intervals to achieve a target maintenance dose of 300 to 400 mg daily in adults and 4 to 8 mg/kg in children. Doses up to 600 mg/day have been used in adults, but studies have indicated more adverse effects and no greater efficacy for doses over 400 mg/day. The recommended doses are associated with a steady-state plasma concentration of 10 to 38 mcg/mL. Maintaining zonisamide concentrations of less than 30 to 40 mcg/mL is recommended.

It is available as tablets and capsules for oral use. The parenteral formulation of zonisamide is not available for use.

Caution is necessary when using this agent in patients with hepatic and renal impairment; slower titration and frequent monitoring are advised. It should not be used in patients with renal impairment with a glomerular filtration rate of less than 50 mL/min.
