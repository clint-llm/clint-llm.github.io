The maxillary nerve (CN V2) is the second branch of the trigeminal nerve and runs close to the maxillary artery. It courses from the middle cranial fossa into the pterygopalatine fossa via the foramen rotundum.

The pterygopalatine ganglion is located deep within the pterygopalatine fossa near the sphenopalatine foramen.
