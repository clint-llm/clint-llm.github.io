Unfortunately, there is no particular marker for Cogan syndrome. However, some labs can be abnormal. Differential diagnoses must be ruled out by extensive investigations as Cogan syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion. The usual findings are anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and elevated ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) along with hypofibrinogenemia and high CRP (c-reactive protein) during acute attacks. In some cases, antibodies against Chlamydia trachomatis or Chlamydia psittaci may be discovered. However, other features of infections may be absent.

On urinalysis, proteinuria and hematuria may be present. Certain antibodies may be present, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antibodies to smooth muscle, lupus anticoagulants, cryoglobulins, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA), or rheumatoid factor (RF). In some cases, direct antibodies were detected against components of the inner ear and corneal antigen.

Antibodies against heat shock protein may be present in around half of the patients with Cogan syndrome. Audiometry shows sensorineural hearing loss of all frequencies. Word recognition ability might improve or deteriorate; the initial evaluation demonstrates sensory hearing loss with abnormal electronystagmography.
