Patients should be evaluated for latent tuberculosis infection before and during therapy. If positive for latent tuberculosis, start treatment for latent tuberculous before initiating the drug.

The impact of baricitinib on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown as patients with active hepatitis B or C infection were excluded from clinical trials. Patients with positive hepatitis B core antibody and negative Hepatitis B surface antigen should be monitored closely for expression of hepatitis B virus DNA.

Liver function tests should be done at baseline, every four weeks for the initial twelve weeks, and then every three months. For patients who develop significant elevation of transaminases, 5x ULN for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), the drug should be stopped immediately.

Similarly, a patient needs to have a baseline complete blood count (CBC) with differential before initiating baricitinib. This needs to be repeated every four weeks for the first three months, followed by regular CBC monitoring every three months to monitor bone marrow toxicity.

The clinician needs to determine the dose as per GFR, so baseline renal function tests (RFTs) are required, followed by periodic RFTs every three months. Due to its risk of skin cancer, an annual skin cancer screening examination is also recommended.

Live vaccines are contraindicated in patients using baricitinib, and immunization status should be current before starting the drug.
