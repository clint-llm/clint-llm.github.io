An interpolated flap is a 2-stage tissue flap in which the base of the flap is not directly adjacent to the recipient defect, and the flap bridges over an intervening segment of normal tissue. These flaps are used when insufficient tissue or mobility in nearby skin prevents the coverage of a surgical defect with primary closure or an adjacent flap. This activity explains and describes the technique in common anatomic areas, and describes the techniques, risks, and contraindications.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of interpolation flaps.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to interpolation flaps.
- Summarize appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of interpolation flaps.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance reconstructive techniques and improve outcomes.
