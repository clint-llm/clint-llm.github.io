Cushing disease is an endocrine disorder characterized by increased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production from the anterior pituitary, leading to excess cortisol release from the adrenal glands.

A key feature is that many patients with Cushing disease do not present with bitemporal hemianopsia, and the reason is that most lesions are pituitary microadenomas (less than 10mm size).
