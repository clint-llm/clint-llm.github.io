The precise etiology of colloid cysts is unclear and still a topic of debate. In the early 20th century, the suggested etiology was that the cyst was a remnant of the paraphysis element. The paraphysis element is an embryonic structure located at the anterior portion of the diencephalon between the two hemispheres of the telencephalon.

As colloid cysts have also been found in the cerebellum, frontal lobe, and pontomesencephalon, there have been other theorized origins of the colloid cysts. Other etiologies include remnants of respiratory epithelium, an ependymal cyst from the diencephalon, and invagination of the neuroepithelium of the lateral ventricle, causing a cyst to form.
