Healthcare quality improvement is a dedication to working towards better performance and patient outcomes in the field of medicine. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration's article "Quality Improvement" from April 2011 defines quality improvement (QI) as "systematic and continuous actions that lead to measurable improvement in healthcare services and the health status of targeted patient groups." (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Resources and Services Administration, 2011). Over the past two decades, the Institute of Medicine has had significant involvement in driving quality improvement efforts to improve healthcare outcomes for patients and populations. In their 2001 publication, "Crossing the Quality Chiasm: A new Health System for the 21st Century," they describe six core aims including safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable patient care, and also put forth strategies for systems redesign to prevent errors and address outcomes (Institute of Medicine, 2001).

To quote one of the founding fathers of healthcare simulation, Dr. David Gaba, "Simulation is a technique—not a technology—to replace or amplify real experiences with guided experiences that evoke or replicate substantial aspects of the real world in a fully interactive manner."
