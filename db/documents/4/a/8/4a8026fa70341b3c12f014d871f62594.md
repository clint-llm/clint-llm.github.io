A papilloma is a benign non-cancerous epithelial proliferation caused by the Human Papillomavirus. Most papillomas are caused by low-risk HPV forms, and self-limiting human papillomavirus (HPV) is still the leading cause of cervical cancers, causing 270,000 deaths annually worldwide, of which 85% occur in developing countries. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of papillomas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with papillomas.
- Review the risk factors for developing papillomas.
- Outline the management considerations for patients with papillomas.
