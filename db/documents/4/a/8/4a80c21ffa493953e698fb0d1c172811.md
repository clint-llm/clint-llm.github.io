Hair in pili annulati has a characteristic shiny and speckled appearance with alternating light and dark bands. The light bands that are visible with the unaided eye under a refracted light, actually correspond to dark bands when seen under light (or polarized) microscopy. By electron microscopy, these abnormal hair segments correspond to air-filled cavities within the hair shaft’s cortex.

Altered light penetration of hair explains this banded appearance in pili annulati. The abnormal spaces containing air cause double diffraction and scattering of transmitted light, which results in a decrease of light transmission compared to normal areas, thus the dark appearance of abnormal areas under a light microscope. Conversely, under reflected light, the abnormal areas reflect more light and therefore appear lighter.

These air-filled gaps in abnormal areas appear to result from an insufficient matrix formation or a defective assembly of structural proteins in the matrix due to an abnormal regulatory protein.

Therefore, pili annulati appears to be a protein metabolic disorder. A partial dysfunction of cytoplasmic ribosomes in the differentiating cortical cells is suggested to be involved.
