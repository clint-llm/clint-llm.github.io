The incident command system (ICS) is a management tool employed during disasters and emergency responses to organize and coordinate response operations. The current ICS developed from the work of a collaborative task force, Firefighting Resources of Southern California Organized for Potential Emergencies (FIRESCOPE), in response to issues and complications involved in organizing efforts to control wildfires in California in the 1970s. FIRESCOPE realized that many of the incident failures were due to lack of coordination and organizational issues as opposed to insufficient resources or personnel. Because many different organizations had to work together at these incidents, lines of command were not clear, specific objectives were not established, and planning and utilization of resources were not coordinated. The incident command system intended to ameliorate these potential problems by designing a framework which could be replicated at future events and incorporate responders from different regions and backgrounds. The mutual understanding of the system and its components aids responding agencies in coordinating their efforts.
