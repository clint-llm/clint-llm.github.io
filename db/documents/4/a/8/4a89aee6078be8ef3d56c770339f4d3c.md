High altitude cerebral edema (HACE) is a severe and potentially fatal condition associated with high altitude illness that is often thought of as a late or end-stage acute mountain sickness (AMS). It is often characterized by ataxia, fatigue, and altered mental status. HACE represents the least common form of altitude illness, however it is critical that it be rapidly diagnosed and managed, as it can progress to coma and death as a result of brain herniation within 24 hours. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of high altitude cerebral edema and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the importance of rapid detection of high altitude cerebral edema.
- Review the history and physical exam findings typically seen in patients with high altitude cerebral edema.
- Describe the treatment of high altitude cerebral edema.
- Explain modalities to enhance care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by high altitude cerebral edema.
