The fiveÂ defects of the pentalogy as described in Cantrell's initial paper are as follows:

- Supraumbilical omphalocele

- Lower sternal cleft

- Defect in the central tendon of the diaphragm

- Defect in the pericardium

- Intracardiac anomaly

It is regarded as a developmental field defect by experts due to the involvement of multiple tissues, from cardiac to ventral abdominal wall.

Cantrell's theory involved two steps:

- Defect in spetum transversum and its adjacent mesoderm

- Failure of migration and fusion of primordial sternum
