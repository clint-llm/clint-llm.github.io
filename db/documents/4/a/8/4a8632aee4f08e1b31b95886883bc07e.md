Headache is a common chief complaint in the emergency room. Though the vast majority of cases will require only analgesia and reassurance, the emergency medical team must always be vigilant about identifying the more severe cases. Managing these critical secondary causes of headaches requires an interdisciplinary team of clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and ancillary staff. The professionals involved will vary depending on the underlying pathology, but most commonly, medical teams will include emergency physicians, neurologists, radiologists, pharmacists, critical care specialists, and neurosurgeons. Communication between nurses and physicians is critical; to monitor response to treatment and immediately note any clinical deterioration. Often, the management of these patients does not end in the emergency department. Effective communication during the handoff between emergency and inpatient teams is essential. Planning and coordination between teams of professionals involved in patient care are essential for favorable healthcare outcomes.

While clinicians will manage the case both in the ED and after that, nursing will provide support in performing examinations, patient counseling, and serving as coordinators for the interprofessional team. Pharmacists will perform medication reconciliation, verify appropriate dosing, and counsel patients on potential adverse reactions. Any interprofessional team member who notes a change in status or anything that causes concern for the patient's condition or progress must be able to contact other team members as appropriate to ensure the proper interventions or changes can be implemented. This coordinated, interprofessional team approach will optimize outcomes for patients with headaches. [Level 5]
