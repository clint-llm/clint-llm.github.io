Alternobaric vertigo is a benign condition caused by disequilibrium between middle ear pressures that results in a difference in perception in the vestibular system.

- A good history and physical are essential to rule out more serious causes of vertigo such as arterial gas embolism or decompression sickness.

- Alternobaric vertigo can be treated with equalization measures and is largelyÂ self-limiting.

- If one is experiencing vertigo while diving, it is important not to panic because this can lead to more serious injury.
