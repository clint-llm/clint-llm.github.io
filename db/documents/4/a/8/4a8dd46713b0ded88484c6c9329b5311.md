**Maternal screening**with rubella titers in early pregnancy is considered standard of care in the United States. Rubella-like illness in early pregnancy should be evaluated to confirm the diagnosis. Laboratory diagnosis is based on observation of seroconversion with use of RV-IgG and IgM titers. Maternal counseling and termination of pregnancy are options in such cases.

**Prenatal fetal diagnosis**is based on detection of viral genome in amniotic fluid, fetal blood or chorionic villus biopsies.

**Postnatal diagnosis**of congenital rubella infection is done by detecting RV-IgG antibodies in neonatal serum using ELISA. This approach has sensitivity and specificity of nearly 100% in infants less than three months of age. Confirmation of infection is made by detection of rubella virus in nasopharyngeal swabs, urine and oral fluid using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Congenital infection can also be confirmed by stable or increasing serum concentrations of rubella-specific IgG over the first year of life. It is difficult to diagnose congenital rubella in children older than one year of age.

Postnatal confirmation of congenital infection is important despite the absence of clinical features of congenital rubella syndrome. This is to develop a specific follow-up care plan for early detection of long-term neurological and ocular complications.
