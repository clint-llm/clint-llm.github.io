Hip pain is a common clinical complaint and a source of disability with an incidence of 12 to 15 percent among all adults over the age of 60 years. Therapeutic hip joint injection with corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, and plasma-rich platelets have formed the cornerstone of non-surgical management of hip pain. This activity outlines and explains the role of the fluoroscopy-guided hip joint injections, and the technique required for therapeutic hip joint injections for patients.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the steps involved in performing a hip joint injection in patients with hip pain and summarize key patient safety points.
- Describe the typical imaging findings associated with hip joint arthrography.
- Outline the importance of proper technique when performing a hip joint injection.
- Review the importance of collaboration between interprofessional team members caring for patients requiring hip joint injections, to improve clinical outcomes.
