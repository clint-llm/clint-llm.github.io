Vibrio infections usually occur after the consumption of contaminated seafood. The majority of these patients present to the emergency department, hence, healthcare workers should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of the disorder. The key to preventing this infection is patient education. The public should be educated about the importance ofÂ avoiding uncooked seafood. The outcomes after a vibrio infection in healthy people are excellent, but in patients who are immunocompromised, the prognosis is guarded. Besides antibiotic therapy, some patients may need immediate fasciotomy to relieve compartment syndrome. Others may develop multiorgan failure and require intense support in the ICU.
