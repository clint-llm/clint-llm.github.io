When pain is not present, treatment is not warranted. When pain is present upon snapping, treatment is conservative and consists of rest, stretching, steroid injections, oral anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy, and activity modification. Most of the time, patients experience relief with these measures.

If pain persists despite these conservative measures, surgical intervention can be considered. For external snapping hip syndrome, loosening of the iliotibial band is usually the goal and can be accomplished with either open or arthroscopic procedures. The iliotibial tendon is lengthened or completely released using various procedures including formal Z-lengthening, a cross-shaped release, a Z-shaped release, or a gluteus maximus release. Weakness in abduction may be a complication if the release is excessive or there is damage to the surrounding area.

For internal snapping hip syndrome, open or arthroscopic procedures also are available to lengthen or release the iliopsoas tendon. Arthroscopic methods are preferred to avoid complications of open surgery. The most common adverse effect of iliopsoas release is hip flexor weakness, which may occur if there is excessive release or there is damage to the surrounding area. Corrective surgeries for either internal or external snapping hip can result in other complications including infection, heterotopic ossification, muscle atrophy, continued symptoms, or nerve damage.
