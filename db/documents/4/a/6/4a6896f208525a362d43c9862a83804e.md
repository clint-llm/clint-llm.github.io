The differential diagnosis for VLM is broad as many infections may cause eosinophilia and fever. As this is a global disease, local epidemiology is paramount. Considerations include Ascariasis (LÃ¶ffler syndrome), trichinosis, Strongyloides, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, Paragonimus, Entamoeba histolytica, and Fasciola hepatica.

The central differential for OLM is retinoblastoma. The disease was originally discovered in the 1950s in enucleated eyes suspected to have retinoblastoma.

Eosinophilic meningitis has a narrow differential diagnosis as well: Angiostrongylus (rat-lung worm) is the chief consideration.
