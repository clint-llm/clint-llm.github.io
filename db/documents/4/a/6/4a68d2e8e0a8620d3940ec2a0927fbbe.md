The Pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block is a novel regional analgesia technique that can be used to reduce pain after hip surgery and hip fractures and demonstrated better analgesia compared to other peripheral blocks administered for this type of surgery. It is typically used to provide analgesia following injuries or surgeries of the hip or thigh (e.g., acetabular fractures, femoral neck or mid-shaft fractures, hip replacement, hip arthroscopy, knee surgery)

In a recent report, the author demonstrated effective surgical anesthesia with a PENG block for a medial thigh lesion.

In other studies, the authors describe the use of the block in vascular operations, such as stripping, because the ligation and stripping area was in both the FN and ON dermatomes.

It should be noted that PENG block cannot be offered as the only anesthesia for hip surgery due to the innervation of the posteromedial hip capsule deriving from branches of the sacral plexus and sciatic nerve.
