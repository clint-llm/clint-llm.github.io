Myocarditis begins with the direct invasion of an infectious agent and its subsequent replication within or around the myocardium causing myonecrosis.

This leads to the destruction of the cardiac tissue from the infiltration and replication of the infectious agent. Later, the host cellular immune responds and the cytotoxic effects of host immunity are activated by the offending agent.

There may also be a toxic effect of exogenous or endogenous chemicals produced by the systemic pathogen directly on the myocyte.

Three stages of the disease process:

- Acute: defined by direct viral cytotoxicity and focal or diffuse necrosis of the myocardium

- Subacute:Â defined by an increase in autoimmune-mediated injury with activated T cells and B cells and subsequent antibody production creating cardiac autoantibodies along with inflammatory proteins. There are higher concentrations of anti-b-myosin antibodies in patients with myocarditis with dilated cardiomyopathy than in control groups.

- Chronic: defined by diffuse myocardial fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction that may lead to dilated cardiomyopathy and its sequelae such as CHF, ventricular dysrhythmias, and abnormal ECG findings.
