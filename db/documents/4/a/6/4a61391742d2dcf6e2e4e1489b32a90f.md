Hearing aid fittings to pediatric populations should be performed by a suitably experienced healthcare professional, often an audiologist with additional training in pediatrics. Although the technique for fitting is similar to that in adults, additional considerations are required to ensure precision and appropriate post-fitting evaluation, particularly in pre-lingual children and those unable to provide subjective feedback. A multi-disciplinary team including audiologists, physicians, early intervention specialists/teachers of the deaf, and speech and language therapists should be familiar to the child and family by the time of fitting.
