Preoperative blood work should include CBC, electrolytes, coagulation profile, and a pregnancy test.

Imaging should provide useful information to differentiate orbital floor fractures from any of the following:

- Medial or lateral wall fractures

- Orbito-zygomatic fractures

- LeFort I, II, and III fractures

- Naso-orbital ethmoidal fractures (Markowitz fractures)

Clinical examination has to eliminate the need for acute intervention under the following conditions:

- Large fractures with a high risk of enophthalmos

- Entrapment of infra-orbital structures

- Optical neuropathy

**Computed Tomography Scan**

Computed tomography (CT) is the imaging modality of choice if a blowout fracture is suspected after blunt orbital trauma. Some symptoms include double vision, pain with eye movements, and restriction of extraocular muscle movements. A CT scan often reveals herniation of orbital fat or the inferior rectus muscle into the maxillary sinus. Such a scan can also detect occult tears and retained foreign bodies, if any are present.

**Plain Radiograph**

Can help suspect an orbital floor fracture in the presence of the following:

- Subcutaneous emphysema

- Soft-tissue teardrop along the roof of the maxillary sinus

- Air-fluid level in the maxillary sinus
