Most meningiomas are sporadic, but some are associated with genetic syndromes or mutations. Most meningiomas, even sporadic, have a mutation in chromosome 22 (Merlin tumor suppressor gene, SIS oncogene, or INI1). This same mutation is seen in neurofibromatosis type 2, also called MISME syndrome due to multiple inherited schwannoma, meningiomas, and ependymomas.

Meningiomas have progesterone receptors in up to 72% to 90% of the tumors.

A well-validated factor for increased risk for meningioma development is exposure to ionizing radiation.
