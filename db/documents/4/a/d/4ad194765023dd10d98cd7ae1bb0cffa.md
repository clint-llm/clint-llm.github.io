Due to the noted difficulty of treating failed back surgery syndrome, avoiding the initial development of pain may be the most effective way of reducing the condition’s burden on the general public. Reasonable non-operative measures including minimally invasive interventional treatments must be tried when indicated, before committing to an operative course. Poor selection of candidates for surgery or surgical technique is a common feature in the development of FBSS.

Patients should receive proper education from a multidisciplinary team consisting of physicians, nurses, and physical therapists on possible risks and complications of lower back surgery before and after the operation. One study found that patients cited proper pre-procedure education and realistic setting of expectations as factors that increased their opinion of their surgeon even in spite of the development of chronic post-surgical pain.
