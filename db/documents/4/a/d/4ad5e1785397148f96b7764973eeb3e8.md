Patients of exstrophy usually require long-term follow-up; therefore, the involvement of multipleÂ disciplines is necessary for their optimal care. Neonatologist and pediatrician plays a vital role in the pre-operative management of these children. Surgical consultation has to be sought immediately after birth, as an early repair generally obviates the need for osteotomy. For osteotomy, consultation with a trained pediatric surgeon is required. Long-term upper tract functional assessment requires consultation with a nephrologist. When these patients enter adolescence and adulthood, there are certain psychosocial and sexual issues that need to be addressed properly. Therefore, consultation with a psychiatrist and a urologist/andrologist is required during their transitional care.
