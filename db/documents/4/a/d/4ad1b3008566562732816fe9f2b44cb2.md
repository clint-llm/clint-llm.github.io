Sydenham chorea (SD), also referred to as St. Vitus dance is a manifestation of rheumatic fever (RF), occurring in up to 40% of patients with RF. It is uncommon in the United States but occurs at a much higher frequency in developing countries. It is thought to be an autoimmune process that is the result of antigenic mimicry between central nervous system basal ganglia cells and Group A B-hemolytic Streptococci antigens.

SD is much less common today than in the past, but when it does occur, the symptoms are less severe and the relapses are less frequent. This may be partially due to aggressive treatment of Group A Streptococcal infections, improved general hygiene practices, and a reduction in the strain of group A Streptococcus that causes the antigenic mimicry that triggers the disease. The Jones Criteria proposed by TD Jones for the diagnosis of RF included SD as a major criterion when diagnosing RF.
