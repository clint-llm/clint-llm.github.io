**Clinical**

Clinically, height is necessary for maintaining physical growth records. This is especially significant when it comes to monitoring the growth patterns of infants and children. Growth indicators such as the individual's height and BMI can help diagnose malnutrition in children.

In the current era of childhood obesity, an accurate measure of height is even more critical in diagnosing children at risk of obesity. Height assessment is required to calculate BMI and is a central data point for calculating waist-to-height ratio (WHR). Both measure are important in assessing growing children for obesity, particularly central obesity, which has significant clinical implications for their future health.

**Anthropological**

The significance of measuring the height of individuals for an anthropological setting comes into play while studying the physical growth patterns and secular trends across regions and population groups.

**Assessment of Abnormal Growth Curves**When a deviation from the expected growth pattern occurs in the height assessment of a child, a systematic approach to this abnormal growth is warranted.

Consequently, children with short stature who have normal growth rates and normal bone age have a genetic short stature and do not require further evaluation/workup. However, children with short stature and decreased growth rates need a comprehensive evaluation for an underlying pathologic condition.
