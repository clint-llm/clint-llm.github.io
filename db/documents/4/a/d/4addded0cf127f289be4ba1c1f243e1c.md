Several studies have tried to demonstrate the efficacy of vitamin supplementation to reduce cardiovascular and thromboembolic risk. The American Heart Association explained that folic acid supplementation (0.2 to 15 mg/d) could lower homocysteine levels. However, randomized control trialsÂ have been controversial in showing cardiovascular risk reduction with folic acid supplementation unless a patient has homocystinuria.

In patients with homocystinuria with severe hyperhomocysteinemia, homocysteine-lowering treatments with pyridoxine, folic acid, and hydroxocobalamin did reduce cardiovascular risk.

In patients who have hyperhomocysteinemia without homocystinuria, treatment remains controversial. Randomized control trials have not been able to show a reduction in cardiovascular risk for those who lower homocysteine levels using homocysteine-lowering therapies.
