Temporoparietal fascia flap transfer is an important technique in head and neck, hand, and lower extremity reconstruction. The TPFF can be harvested as a pedicled flap, a composite flap (along withÂ deep temporal fascia with or without the inclusion of surrounding calvarial bone), or as a free tissue flap, depending on the size and thickness of the defect needing to be repaired.

TPFF transfer constitutes a routine part of auricular reconstruction for microtia, whether using autologous costal cartilage or porous polyethylene implants, and is frequently used for the salvage of these reconstructions after trauma or infection as well.
