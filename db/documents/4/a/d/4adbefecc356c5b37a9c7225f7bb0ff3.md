The nature of a consultation of a patient with renal ectopia will vary greatly depending on the nature of the presentation. In cases where it is an incidental finding, the consultation will likely be primarily focused on the initial pathology under investigation. In cases where renal ectopia is diagnosed as a result of a direct complication, such as vesicoureteric reflux or renal calculi, this will require more direct investigation. Particularly in cases of vesicoureteric reflux, these patients may need ongoing follow-up, given the risk of chronic kidney disease.
