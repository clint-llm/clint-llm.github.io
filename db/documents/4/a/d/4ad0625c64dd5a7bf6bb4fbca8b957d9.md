The complex embryology of the aortic arch and the great vessels lends itself to numerous natural variations.  Studies show that the normal variant branching pattern of the aortic arch is likely only present in approximately 80% of the population and the left carotid artery (along with the right subclavian artery) share a common trunk, essentially making the innominate artery have three branches instead of the typical two. This variation is found in approximately 14% of the population worldwide, and findings may suggest that there is a higher than average prevalence in those of African descent and lower than the average prevalence in those of Asian descent

- Common carotid artery – The innominate artery effectively does not exist with there being a right subclavian followed by a common branch of both carotid arteries.

- Aberrant right subclavian – The right subclavian artery branches from the left side of the aortic arch or descending aorta distal to the other branches. This variation can be with or without a common carotid branch.

- Right-sided arch – aortic arch goes from left to right, giving a mirrored pattern to the normal variation with the innominate artery giving rise to the left subclavian and the left common carotid or an aberrant left subclavian.

Other less common variations involving the innominate artery are:

- Left and right innominate arteries

- Four branches with no innominate artery

- Double aortic arch

- Left-sided arch with a left-sided innominate artery

- Aberrant right subclavian

- Common trunk of the innominate, left common carotid, and left subclavian.
