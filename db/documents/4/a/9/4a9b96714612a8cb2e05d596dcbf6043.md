The differential for pulsatile tinnitus is very broad and can be overwhelming. It is essential first to try and determine if the tinnitus is vascular or non-vascular. Vascular lesions require further categorization into arterial vs. venous etiology. Figure 1 has a helpful flowchart that includes an extensive list of potential etiologies. Using this progression will help direct management and care for the majority of patients presenting with pulsatile tinnitus.

Common conditions include:

- Arteriovenous fistula

- Atherosclerotic vascular stenosis

- Idiopathic intracranial hypertension

- Anomalous basilar artery

- Paraganglioma

- Tensor tympani myoclous

- Paget Disease

- Otosclerosis
