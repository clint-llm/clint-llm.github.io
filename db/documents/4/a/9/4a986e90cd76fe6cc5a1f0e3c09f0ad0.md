The differential diagnosis for CECS can be quite broad. Most commonly, CECS initially gets misdiagnosed as shin splints or medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS).

Other considerations include

- Vascular pathologies

- Intermittent claudication
- Popliteal artery impingement.

- Tibial stress fractures

- Tendon pathologies (tendinitis, tendinosis, or tendon rupture)

- Nerve entrapment
