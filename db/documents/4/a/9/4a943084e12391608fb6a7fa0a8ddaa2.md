Subchorionic hematoma, although not considered normal in pregnancy, is not an unusual occurrence. It is important to let patients know that this does not mean they will lose the pregnancy. With close monitoring, the majority of these cases go on to deliver healthy babies.Â Subchorionic bleeding does not mean that the pregnancy is in imminent danger; however, it is important to follow up with the physician. Patients need to know the necessary precautions and when to be concerned or return to the hospital. These precautions include but are not limited to vaginal bleeding or spotting, abdominal pain.
