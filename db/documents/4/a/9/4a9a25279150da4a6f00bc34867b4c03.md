Mitral stenosis (MS) is a form of valvular heart disease characterized by the narrowing of the mitral valve orifice. The most common cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic fever, though the stenosis typically does not become clinically relevant until several decades later. Uncommon causes of mitral stenosis are calcification of the mitral valve leaflets and congenital heart disease. Other causes of mitral stenosis include infective endocarditis, mitral annular calcification, endomyocardial fibroelastosis, malignant carcinoid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, Whipple disease, Fabry disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. This activity reviews mitral stenosis and the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of mitral stenosis.
- Describe the characteristic exam of a patient with mitral stenosis.
- Outline the treatment for mitral stenosis.
- Explain modalities to optimize care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by mitral stenosis.
