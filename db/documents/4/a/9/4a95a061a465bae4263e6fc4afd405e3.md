Diagnosis of the PAES poses a considerable clinical challenge as it calls for the proper interpretation of clinical as well as radiological aspects of this rare clinical entity. Radiologically, to achieve the higher sensitivity in detecting the PAES, a combination of the radiological tests elaborating not only the functional and anatomical status of the popliteal artery; but also the structural details of the popliteal fossa are favoredet al. reported that a combination of the MRI and the duplex ultrasonography (DU) is far superior in diagnosing PAES

Besides, the duplex arterial ultrasonography (DAU) using provocative maneuvers (leg/foot positioned first in a neutral position and then in resisted plantar flexion) provides a quick, inexpensive, and non-invasive initial screening test
