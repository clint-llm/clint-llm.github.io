The following discusses the structures of Class I and II MHC molecules (Figure 2):

Class I MHC molecules are glycoprotein dimers, composed of two polypeptide chains, including a heavy chain and a light chain. The lighter chain is call beta2–microglobulin and is encoded by a single non-polymorphic gene located on chromosome 15. The heavy chain inserts into the cell membrane by a hydrophobic transmembrane segment. Beta2–macroglobulin functions in folding of the heavy chain, but does not penetrate the cell membrane. The heavy chain involves three alpha-helix domains, named alpha-1, alpha-2, and alpha-3. Alpha-1 and alpha-2 form the peptide-binding site that is used in antigen recognition and exhibits the most structural variation.

Class II MHC molecules are also composed of two polypeptide chains; however in contrast to Class I molecules both chains are encoded by polymorphic MHC complex genes on chromosome 6. Genes at the DR locus are most highly expressed and the most polymorphic. Both the heavy and light chains insert into the cell membrane. The heavy chain has two domains named alpha-1 and alpha-2, and the light chain has domains beta-1 and beta-2. Alpha-1 and beta-1 form the peptide-binding cleft.
