The incidence of CRPS seems to vary based on geographical location. A study by Sandroni et al. in Olmsted County reported in 2003, Minnesota found an incidence of 5.46 per 100,000 person-years for CRPS type I and 0.82 per 100,000 person-years for CRPS type II.

The Netherlands study reported a peak incidence at 61â€“70 years of age, while the American study found the median age of onset to be 46 years. Upper extremities were found to be more commonly involved than lower in both studies. Both studies used the IASP CRPS criteria for diagnosis. The most common trigger for the disorder was found to be a fracture, associated with 44 to 46% of the cases. Among clinical symptoms, vasomotor symptoms of swelling, temperature, and color changes were most commonly reported.

Among diagnostic tests, three-phase bone scans were found to be most helpful in making a diagnosis (85%). Compared to this, autonomic testing was helpful in diagnosing in 80% of cases.
