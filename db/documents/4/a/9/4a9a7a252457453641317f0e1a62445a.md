Surferâ€™s ear, or exostoses of the external auditory canal, is a slowly progressive disease from benign bone growth as a result of chronic cold water exposure. It is a condition most commonly associated with surfing but can be seen in anyone repeatedly exposed to cold water, such as swimmers, divers, kayakers, and participants of other maritime activities.
