Atypical antipsychotics are available in a variety of formulations such as immediate-release injectable (IM), long-acting injectable (IM), and orally disintegrating tablets in addition to the customary oral tablets.  None of the atypical antipsychotics are available for intravenous use. The immediate-release injectables are used in emergencies when a patient is highly agitated or acutely psychotic, including olanzapine and ziprasidone. The long-acting injectables include aripiprazole, olanzapine, paliperidone, and risperidone, which are administered at two to four-week intervals. Oral dosing is the preferred course of administration in most patients. The orally disintegrating tablets include aripiprazole, asenapine, clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone, which are identical to the standard tablets in terms of absorption and bioavailability.
