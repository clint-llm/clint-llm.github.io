There are few mechanisms suggested for development of ventilator-associated pneumonia: (1) most commonly it is thought to be a progression from colonization of the upper airway, leading to tracheal colonization, thenÂ tracheitis, and finally pneumonia. This depends on the number, type, and virulence of the bacteria as well as natural host defenses such as mechanical factors and humoral and cellular immunity. Mechanical defenses, such as ciliary motion and mucus secretion, can be altered in an intubated patient. Artificial airway inhibits gag reflex and ciliary functions and provides a substrate for growth of biofilm which acts as a reservoir for pathogens. This biofilm can be dislodged and delivered to the lower respiratory tract through mechanical suctioning or high-pressure airflow, leading to pneumonia in a susceptible host. Bacteria overgrowth can be secondary to proton-pump inhibitors and histamine type 2 receptor antagonists for stress ulcer prophylaxis, which neutralized gastric pH and promotes colonization of the upper gastrointestinal tract. In a supine patient with likely depressed mental status (possibly secondary to sedation), the risk of aspiration is high.
