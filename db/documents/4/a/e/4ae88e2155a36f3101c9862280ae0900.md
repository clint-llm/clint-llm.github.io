Emergency medical service (EMS) provides patient care in a variety of settings, from calm to chaotic. EMS providers frequently face challenges in gaining access to patients to provide care and also in extricating patients from the scene for transport. An example is a motor vehicle crash, where patients often become trapped in mangled vehicles. A less obvious example is the removal of a patient with obesity from the residence of a hoarder or the rescue of a victim who fell through the ice.Â A variety of techniques are used to remove the patients from their entrapment, and the appropriate technique depending on the situation. The essential focus for EMS providers, regardless of the situation or scene, is personal safety.
