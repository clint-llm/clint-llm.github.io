Insulin lispro is an insulin analog that is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2 to control hyperglycemia. Its off-label uses include treating patients with mild-to-moderate diabetic ketoacidosis, gestational diabetes mellitus, and mild-to-moderate hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. One unit of insulin lispro is as potent as one unit of human insulin in lowering glucose. This activity describes the mode of action of inhaled corticosteroids, including mechanism of action, pharmacology, adverse event profiles, eligible patient populations, monitoring, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of conditions where a rapid-acting insulin is beneficial for patient outcomes in diabetes care.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the mechanism of insulin lispro.
- Summarize the place and purpose of insulin lispro in a glycemic control regimen.
- Review the contraindications and adverse event profile of insulin lispro.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance insulin lispro and improve outcomes.
