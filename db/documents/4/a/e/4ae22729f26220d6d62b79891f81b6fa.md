Traditional medicine involves the diagnosis and treatment of pathology in a normal environment. The aerospace medicine clinician must remain cognizant of the fact that, in general, addressing the physical effects of the aerospace environment on professional aviators, divers, astronauts, etc., does not primarily comprise considerations of pathology but instead focuses on strategies to mitigate the deleterious effects of an extreme environment on normal human physiology. For example, high-performance tactical fighter pilots are exhaustively screened to ensure optimal health. They are also the population most frequently involved in G-LOC occurrences. Interventions to mitigate this have included aircrew training and conditioning to maximize G resistance and the development of novel garments (G suit) to compress the lower extremities under G and reduce pooling of blood in the extremities and optimize cerebral perfusion. Consequently, the frequency of G-LOC has been reduced, augmenting the safety and efficacy of flying operations.
