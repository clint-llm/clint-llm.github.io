The anterior abdominal wall receives its blood supply from the intercostal, subcostal, lumbar, and epigastric arteries. The supply to the lateral aspect of the abdominal wall comes from the inferior posterior intercostal arteries and lumbar arteries branching off the descending aorta. Scarpa’s fascia receives most of its blood supply from the epigastric vessels. Superior epigastric vessel branches of the internal thoracic artery course its way into the rectus sheath and eventually anastomoses with the inferior epigastric artery at the umbilicus. The inferior epigastric artery has its origin from the external iliac artery.

Lymphatic drainage of the abdominal wall (Scarpa’s fascia and other associated structures) below the umbilicus occurs through the superficial inguinal nodes.
