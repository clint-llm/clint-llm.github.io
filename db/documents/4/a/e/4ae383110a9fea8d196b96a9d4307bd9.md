Tapia syndrome is almost always associated with orotracheal intubation and surgical intervention. Hence, any presentation that lacks a history of direct trauma should be a cause for concern. The main pathologies to exclude are space-occupying lesions and infection, some of which are listed below:

- Lung cancer: Left-sided tumors causing compression of left recurrent laryngeal nerve

- Ortnerâ€™s syndrome: Left recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy due to expansion of structures within heart and major blood vessels

- Malignant lymph nodes

- Head and neck tumors

- Abscess formation
