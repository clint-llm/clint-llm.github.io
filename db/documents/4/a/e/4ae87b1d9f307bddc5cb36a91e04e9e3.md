- IgE plays a central role in the pathogenesis of atopic disorders.

- The binding of IgE to the Fc epsilon RI receptor on the surface of mast cells induces an immediate hypersensitivity reaction in allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, asthma, food allergies, and anaphylaxis.

- The prevalence of these allergic disorders in Western countries has increased significantly in the past few decades. This rapid increase in atopic disorders has been attributed to hygiene, counter-regulatory, GM-CSF, hapten-atopy, antioxidant, lipid, and vitamin D hypotheses.

- Primary immunodeficiency disorders, such as Job syndrome, require a high index of suspicion for diagnosis; management ofÂ these disorders is complex, requiring multidisciplinary care.
