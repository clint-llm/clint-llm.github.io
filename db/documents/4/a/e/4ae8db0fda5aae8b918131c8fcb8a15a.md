Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), formerly termed primary biliary cirrhosis, is an autoimmune disorder that leads to the gradual destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts, resulting in periportal inflammation and cholestasis. Prolonged hepatic cholestasis subsequently causes cirrhosis and portal hypertension. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of primary biliary cholangitis and the importance of the interprofessional team in recognizing and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the factors associated with increased risk of developing primary biliary cholangitis.
- Describe patient history clues that might prompt consideration of primary biliary cholangitis.
- Summarize the management options for patients affected by primary biliary cholangitis.
- Review how enhanced coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid detection of primary biliary cholangitis and subsequently enhance the detection of pathology and allow for treatment when indicated.
