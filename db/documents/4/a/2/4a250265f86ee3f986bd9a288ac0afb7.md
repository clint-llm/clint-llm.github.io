The gastric acid and the mucus barrier of the intestine serve as a protective mechanism that prevents the Entameba histolytica cysts from coming in contact with the intestinal epithelium. Encystation occurs in the terminal ileum or colon, which results in the trophozoites getting released into the lumen of the gut. Some individuals develop invasive amebic infection among those exposed is thought to be due to the interplay between the host's defensive factors and the virulence factor of the parasite. The three major virulence factors known to influence pathogenicity are:

- N-acetylgalactosamine-inhibitable lectin, which is responsible for binding colonic mucin and host cell adhesion.

- Amebapore which are small peptides that facilitate the killing of host cells.

- Cystine proteases; these enzymes facilitate the lysis of the host extracellular matrix.

As the pathology progresses, the colonic mucosa becomes diffusely inflamed, edematous, with associated necrosis and sometimes perforation of the intestinal wall.
