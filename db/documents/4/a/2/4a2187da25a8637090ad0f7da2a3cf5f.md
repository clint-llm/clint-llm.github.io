**Sliding Hip Screw (SHS)**

Incision: A direct lateral approach is performed. The incision usually starts in line with the lesser trochanter, in line with the femur, and extends distally—next, a longitudinal incision through subcutaneous fat. The next layer is the fascia lata. This is incised in line with the skin incision to reveal vastus lateralis. The epimysium is incised. Vastus lateralis can be elevated off the lateral intermuscular septum but is more commonly split along its fibers.

Exposure of femur: A periosteal elevator (Bristow) is used to clear muscle from the bone, leaving a clear surface for the plate without soft tissue interposition. One or two self-retaining retractors may be helpful to gain adequate exposure for guidewire placement.

Guidewire: The kit typically includes a guidewire jig placed on the femoral shaft. It is important to ensure that the jig is placed centrally on the lateral shaft of the femur and can be checked by feeling how much bone there is anteriorly and posteriorly and adjusted accordingly. Regarding the AP placement of the wire, it is necessary to visualize where the tip of the guidewire will end up in the femoral head. The lesser trochanter usually marks the level of entry for a 135-degree angle plate. The tip should be within the subchondral bone. The position should be continually assessed using an image intensifier.

Measure:  The included measuring device slides over the guidewire. It is important to ensure that it is sitting on the bone. Usually, 5 to 10 mm are deducted from the measurement.

Reaming: The guide wire is then over-drilled with a triple reamer. This creates a channel for both the lag screw and the barrel of the plate. Reaming is to the depth chosen for the screw. It is important to check on the radiograph that the third part of the reamer has engaged with the cortex of the bone and to ensure that the guide wire is not advancing into the pelvis.

Tap:  In young patients or those with strong bones, it is beneficial to tap the bone.

Insert lag screw: The lag screw is then applied over the wire and screwed in using the attached handle. The final position of the handle should be parallel to the femur. This ensures the lag screw will slot into the plating barrel.

Apply plate and screws: The plate is then slid over the lag screw. The plate temper may be needed to ensure it is fully advanced. The guidewire can now be removed. The plate can be secured to the femur using a clamp. The screws are inserted next. The most distal one is conventionally done first. The 3.5-mm drill is used with the neutral drill guide to make the screw holes, drilling through both cortices. These are then measured using the depth gauge and the appropriate screw inserted.

Closure: Final AP and lateral radiographs should be obtained. The wound is washed, and closure is in layers.

**Cannulated Screws**

Reduction: Reduction is usually not needed for these, as screws are typically used for non-displaced fractures.

Incision: Similar to the DHS, a direct lateral approach is taken with a longitudinal incision made at the level of the lesser trochanter. This, however, is much smaller, usually around 5 cm.

Guidewire: The next step is to insert the three guidewires. This can be done using a guide or freehand, depending on the surgeon's preference and experience. The typical formation is an inverted triangle with one screw distally and two proximally. The entry point for the first guidewire should be no lower than the lesser trochanter; otherwise, there is the risk of causing a stress riser which may trigger a comminuted subtrochanteric fracture. Ideally, it should sit just above the calcar (on the AP view) and go up to the subchondral bone in the femoral head. The second guidewire is placed superiorly and posteriorly to the first one. On the lateral view, it should lie next to the posterior cortex. The third wire is placed superiorly and anteriorly to the first wire. Ideally, it should sit parallel to the second guidewire on the AP view. All three should be within 5 mm of the subchondral bone.

Measure and screw insertion: The measure is then used to ascertain which screw length will be used. Next, a cannulated drill is used to ream over the guidewires. This is usually from 5 to 10 mm short of the measured distance. Three partially threaded screws are then inserted before a wire driver is used to remove the guide wires. The screw measurement is usually the same as the original measurement of the guidewire. The threads of the screw should be beyond the fracture site to ensure that adequate compression takes place. The screws should be tightened together to ensure uniform compression. Depending on surgeon preference, washers may be used to further increase compression.

Closure: Final AP and lateral images should be taken, and the wound should be washed with normal saline. It should then be closed in layers.

**Hemiarthroplasty**

Approach: There are numerous approaches to this operation.

The assistant should then externally rotate the leg to put the gluteus medius on the stretch. The tip of the greater trochanter should be identified, and the gluteus medius fibers split. Be aware that the superior gluteal nerve is approximately 5 cm proximal to the tip of the greater trochanter.

The abductors (gluteus medius superficially and gluteus minimus underneath) are then detached from the greater trochanter using diathermy. This is typically done in an "s" or "omega" shape, leaving a sufficient cuff for repair at the end. It is sometimes necessary to split some of the vastus lateralis fibers as well.

Adequate dissection should reveal the capsule. A T-shaped incision is made in the capsule, staying close to the bone at the base of the femoral neck.

Dislocate hip: It is then necessary to dislocate the hip by externally rotating it. This should reveal the fractured neck as the leg is placed into the leg bag to enhance exposure.

Neck osteotomy: The next step is to make the neck cut. This is done with an oscillating saw at a 45-degree angle. The neck cut is typically measured from a line running between the superior aspect of the neck to 1cm proximal to the lesser trochanter but depends on the prosthesis to be used, particularly whether it has a collar or not.

Femoral head removal: This is done using the corkscrew, which is placed centrally in the head and then twisted in. The head is spun to detach it from the acetabulum and then can be removed. It may be necessary to use a mallet to help engage the corkscrew with the bone. If it is difficult to remove the femoral head, check the capsule cut is sufficient.

Femoral head measurement: This is done using the guide. If between sizes, most surgeons advise erring on the smaller side to minimize the risk of dislocation.

Prepare acetabulum: Ensure all soft tissue is removed; a bone nibbler can be used to remove any remaining soft tissue.

Femoral canal preparation: A Hohmann retractor is then used to expose the femoral calcar. The femur is prepared using a box chisel. This is typically placed as posterolaterally as possible and opens the femoral canal. A T-handled reamer is then inserted into the canal. While doing this, it can be helpful to place your other hand on the patient's knee to ensure it follows the anatomical axis. Reamers of increasing size are used until rotational movement is resisted. The femoral canal is then rasped. Particular attention is given to rasping the lateral side.

Trial: Trial the head and reduce the hip to assess size and stability with internal and external rotation with the hip flexed and extended. Assess for equal leg length. This is not always performed due to its intrinsic stability. If the hip is difficult to reduce, it may be because the stem is too proud, the offset is too great, or there is soft tissue obstruction. Dislocate the trial.

Cementing: Insert a cement restrictor (this may need to be sized depending on the kit used; typically 2 cm more than the length of the stem. The femoral canal is then washed using copious pulse lavage. Ribbon gauze is inserted into the femoral canal alongside a clean suction catheter. This will ensure the canal is dry and free from fat and blood, allowing the cement to interdigitate with the bone for solid fixation. At this point, the cement is prepared. The gauze is removed, and the cement is inserted into the canal using the cement gun. The nozzle should be inserted fully into the canal and by allowing the pressure of the cement to push the gun up proximally. Surgeon preference dictates whether the cement is pressurized.

Stem insertion and head attachment: The selected femoral stem is then inserted into the femoral canal. Be sure to remove all excess cement. It should ideally have 10 to 15 degrees of anteversion. Once the stem is in situ at the appropriate depth, avoid altering the degree of anteversion, as this can result in a varus stem which will compromise the outcome. The femoral head is then attached to the trunion, and the hip is reduced. This is done with gentle traction and a small degree of internal rotation. Stability should be assessed.

Closure:  The wound is then washed and closed in layers (capsule, the abductors can be closed en masse, fascia lata, fat, skin). A double-layered closure of interrupted and then continuous sutures of the abductors may be of benefit to ensure a secure repair.

**IM Nail**

Incision: A small (3 to 5 cm) lateral longitudinal incision is made proximal to the tip of the greater trochanter. This should be in line with the femoral shaft.

Entry point and guidewire: The entry point for the guidewire depends on the nail. Most use the tip of the trochanter (cephalomedullary nails) or the piriformis fossa (straight nails) as landmarks. Guidewire position should be checked using an image intensifier; the ideal position is central within the shaft on the AP view and in line with the middle of the femoral neck in the lateral view. It is important to avoid a too-lateral entry point as this will cause varus malalignment, which will predispose the implant to early failure.

Ream: Usually, a protection sleeve goes over the guidewire, which should sit flush with the greater trochanter. The femur should be renamed; it is suggested that this is done by hand in elderly patients with osteoporotic bone but can be done on power in younger patients.

Nail insertion: The nail is typically attached to a jig and is inserted manually over the wire. The depth of the nail as its inserted should be checked on the image intensifier. The lag screw must sit in the middle of the femoral neck with the tip in the center of the femoral head on AP and lateral views.

Lag screw guidewire: The guidewire is mounted on the jig. A small skin incision is then made. The drill sleeve should sit on the lateral cortex of the femur. The positioning of the screw is similar to that of the DHS, in line with the neck of the femur in the AP view with a slightly inferior position and centrally placed in the lateral view. It should go up to the subchondral bone. The tip apex distance should be less than 25 mm. The guidewire is then measured. The final measurement should be 5 to 10 mm less. The lateral cortex is then reamed. It is then locked using the jig.

Distal locking screw: Depending on the jig and whether it is a long or short nail, the distal locking screws may need to be done freehand using the 'perfect circles' technique. It is usually possible to use the selected hole on the jig for short nails. A stab incision is made in the skin, and both cortices are drilled using the drill bit and the protective sleeve. It is then measured, and a screw is inserted.

Closure: Final AP and lateral images are checked, and the wounds are washed. The closure is often surgeon-specific and can consist of multiple different suture options. The decision to repair the capsule and/or other periarticular tendinous structures is surgeon-dependent based on the preferred technique and the approach utilized. Strong suture options can generally be used in an interrupted or running-style closure. Once the deep layers are closed, 2-0 synthetic absorbable sterile surgical sutures composed of a copolymer can be used in an interrupted and buried stitch technique. Finally, the skin is closed utilizing staples, nylon, or running synthetic, absorbable sutures. Augmentation skin closure options include various types of skin glue or steri-strips. A sterile bandage is then applied.

**Postoperative Plan**

- Routine labs, including complete blood count (CBC) and BMP, are checked at various intervals following surgery, and the frequency will depend on the patient's overall condition and

- Formal radiographs depending on surgeon preference (essential post hemiarthroplasty to ensure the joint is reduced and in an ideal position

- Postoperative antibiotics as per hospital protocol

- Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis as per hospital protocol

- Mobilize full weight bearing as pain allows with physiotherapists (partial or touch weight bearing for cannulated screws and for comminuted fractures managed with an IM Nail)

- Follow-up depending on surgeon preference
