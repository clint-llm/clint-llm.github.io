Patients requiring MAOI administration often are refractory to other medications and require an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including a nurse, laboratory technologists, pharmacists, and several physicians in different specialties. Without proper monitoring, there is a risk of developing potentially fatal adverse effects such as serotonin syndrome or a hypertensive crisis.

An MAOI prescription will require the patient to follow up with a dietitian to ensure a safe diet that does not trigger a food-drug interaction with the medication. Moreover, patients who have Parkinson disease may be put on an MAOI as part of early management by a neurologist. PD patients often develop depressive episodes as the disease progresses and may benefit from follow-up with a psychiatrist.

Only by working as an interprofessional team can we reduce the likelihood of and monitor potential side effects of MAOIs. Data available from published literature shows that the use of rasagiline improves motor fluctuations and PD symptoms in early course Parkinsonâ€™s disease patients on levodopa.
