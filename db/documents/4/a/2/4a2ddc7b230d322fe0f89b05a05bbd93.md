The cause of tricuspid stenosis can be broadly classified into three categories: acquired, congenital, and iatrogenic.

**Acquired**: Rheumatic heart disease is one of the most common causes of acquired tricuspid stenosis and almost always occurs in conjunction with mitral stenosis.

Acquired causes also include valvopathy associated with drugs like fenfluramine, phentermine, and methysergide, characterized by thickened fibrotic and hypo-mobile tricuspid leaflets with various degrees of valve stenosis and regurgitation.

**Congenital:**Other less common causes of tricuspid stenosis include congenital abnormalities such as Ebstein’s anomaly and metabolic or enzymatic abnormalities such as Fabry and Whipple disease.

**Iatrogenic:**The presence of permanent pacing and fusion of implantable cardioverter defibrillator leads with sub-valvular structures can cause tricuspid stenosis.
