Periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PIVH) is a disease process that affects the premature newborn infant. Hemorrhage occurs when vessels of the germinal matrix in the periventricular area rupture, which can then extend into the ventricles as intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). In severe cases, bleeding will occupy a significant portion of the ventricle and extend into the intraparenchymal area. Infants most at risk are those born before 33 weeks of gestational age, as after this time, the germinal matrix involutes.

The second most frequent cause of death in preterm infants is PIVH and is one of the leading causes of cerebral damage in low birth-weight preterm newborns.

Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) was first discovered by Abraham Towbin in 1968.

The degree of hemorrhage is graded I through IV:

- Grade I – hemorrhage limited to Germinal matrix

- Grade II – IVH without ventricular dilatation

- Grade III - IVH with ventricular dilatation occupying > 50% of the ventricle

- Grade IV – IVH with intraparenchymal hemorrhage

Grade III and IV are termed as “severe IVH”.
