The patient will commonly complain of pain and swelling of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. The patient may also complain of antalgic gait and pain, especially with foot flat to toe-off during the gait cycle. The patient may or may not describe an inciting event of an acute forceful hyperextension of the first MTP. There have also been reports of subacute to the chronic development of turf toe.

A physical exam should consist of inspection, palpation, ROM, muscle strength testing, and special testing.

- Inspection: There may be swelling and ecchymosis of the first MTP.  The examiner should evaluate the patient's gait pattern and note an antalgic gait, especially with the patient favoring toe-off. The patient will find it difficult to perform toe raises on the affected side.  The examiner should also note any obvious deformities of the joint, including dislocation, hallux valgus, or hallux varus deformities.

- Palpation: There should be point tenderness over the plantar aspect of the first MTP. There can also be tenderness over the medial and lateral or dorsal joint. Examiner should compare the location of the sesamoid bone to the unaffected side to assess proximal migration.

- ROM: Examiners should evaluate passive and active ROM. The patient will complain of pain with extension of the first MTP with passive ROM. The patient will complain of pain with active flexion of the first MTP.

- Muscle strength: Examiners can have patient flex toes or extend toe against resistance. Abduction can also be performed.

- Special testing: Examiner can perform a valgus and varus stress test of the first MTP joint to assess medial and lateral stability. Vertical Lachman test will test the degree of vertical translation of the proximal phalanx compared to the metatarsal; it is important to compare this to the contralateral side. A positive test has more laxity than the contralateral side.

- To perform vertical Lachman, the examiner should neutralize the metatarsal head in one hand and the base of the proximal phalanx in the other; the maneuver is one of pure vertical translation at the joint. Normally a competent plantar plate will not allow for any vertical translation, but normal variations of soft tissue compliance make it important to compare the affected toe to the unaffected side.
