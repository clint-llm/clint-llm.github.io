**Lumbar Spine**

To flatten the lordosis of the lumbar spine, the patient lays supine with their hips and knees flexed on a supportive cushion. A PA film should display the spine as straight as possible as well as display the visible superior margin of bilateral iliac crests and the central portion of the T12/L5 vertebral body. Bone mineral density measurements are obtained using the L1 through L4 vertebral bodies.

**Hip**

The long axis of the femoral diaphysis is aligned with the scanner as the patient lies supine and a positioning device that internally rotates the femur to elongate the femoral neck on the PA image. If the femur is effectively internally rotated the lesser trochanter should be barely, if at all, visible. Bone mineral density measurements are obtained using the femoral neck, greater trochanter, Ward’s area, intertrochanteric region, and total hip.

**Forearm**

The patient’s non-dominant arm is placed on the table with the forearm pronated, and the image should demonstrate the distal cortex of the radius/ulna and the diaphysis of each aligned with the long axis of the image. Bone mineral density measurements are obtained using the mid to distal radius and ulna.

**Whole Body**

The patient is placed supine on the table with arms pronated and feet in dorsiflexion. Bone mineral density measurements are obtained using the upper/lower extremities and the head.

**Choosing Site to Scan**

Two sites are routinely evaluated with DEXA: the lumbar spine and hip.
