Typically, three visits to the Nuclear Medicine Department might be necessary. In the first visit, a radioactive tracer is injected into the vein. Recommendation for the administration of 111-In pentetreotide is 5 mega Becquerel/kilogram (0.14 milliCurie/kilogram) for children and 222 mega Becquerel (6 milliCurie) for adults, amounting to 11 to 20 mg pentetreotide. 111 Indium has a half-life of 2.8 days.

Pentetreotide gets cleared rapidly by kidneys with just 1/3rd dose remaining in blood after 10 minutes. Elimination is principally by kidneys, but dialysability status is not known. The patient will be on an imaging table under a special detector, namely a gamma camera. The camera itself is non-radiation producing. It stays near the body part, which is under focus for imaging. CT scans may also be an option for better anatomical localization. Imaging may take place over periods of  4 to 48 hours (usually at 4,24 and 48 hours) after injection.
