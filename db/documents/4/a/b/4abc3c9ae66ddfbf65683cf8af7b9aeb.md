There is a broad range of general adverse effects that patients can experience with the usage of desvenlafaxine. A study comparing desvenlafaxine to a placebo in treating major depressive disorder in adolescents noted the most common side effects to be abdominal pain, decreased appetite, headache, and nausea. Less commonly noted were diarrhea, dizziness, and cough. As with most selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), it is necessary to monitor for increased suicidal ideation. Abruptly stopping the use of desvenlafaxine can cause irritability, nausea, and headaches. Gradually tapering the medication is recommended to avoid such side effects.
