The mesenteric circulation consists of three primary vessels that supply blood to the small and large bowel: the celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). Blood flow through these arteries increases within an hour after eating due to an increase in metabolic demand of the intestinal mucosa. Diffuse atherosclerosis, usually occurring at the origin of these vessels, is the primary mechanism and accounts for 95% of CMI. Chronic occlusion of a single vessel allows collateral blood flow to compensate, thus symptoms do not typically present until at least two primary vessels are occluded. Less common causes include vasculitis, fibromuscular dysplasia, and radiation.
