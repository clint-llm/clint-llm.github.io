Infants and children should be followed up frequently (every 4 to 6 months) to understand the rate of progression as subvalvular aortic stenosis is a progressive disorder.

The survival in patients who undergo surgery to excise the subaortic membrane is excellent, but these individuals need to be followed up as the left ventricular outflow tract gradient increases slowly over time. Long-term follow-up care in postoperative patients is important. Most patients will need reoperation for recurrence at some point in their lifetime.

The independent predictors for increased reoperationÂ rate are as follows

- Female gender

- Peak instantaneous LVOT gradient progression over time

- Difference between preoperative and postoperative peak instantaneous LVOT gradients

- Preoperative peak instantaneous LVOT gradient greater than or equal to 80 mm Hg

- Age older than 30 years at diagnosis
