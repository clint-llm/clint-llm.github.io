The disposition of patients with spontaneous pneumothorax is multifactorial. For patients with a first-time episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax that is small and asymptomatic, conservative measures can be a reasonable option. For patients with a first-time episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax that is large and/or symptomatic, aspiration can be attempted as discussed in the treatment/management section; however, failure should prompt admission. It is recommended that all patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax regardless of the stability of the patient and the size of the pneumothorax should be admitted. Even with proper management, the recurrence rate for spontaneous pneumothorax is relatively high. Some studies estimate a recurrence rate of over 50% with the highest risk within the first 30 days. However, the rate of recurrence can be less than 5% after VATS with resection of blebs/bullae and pleurodesis.

Special considerations should be made for patients who have travel plans due to risk for pneumothorax expansion. While some guidelines suggest that air travel should be delayed at least a week after radiographic evidence of pneumothorax resolution, there is no definite consensus among U.S. thoracic surgeons about the timeframe. Further investigation of the topic is warranted.
