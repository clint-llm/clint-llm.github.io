Over 2-3 years without treatment, 50-60% of eyes with wet ARMD and subfoveal CNV will lose 6 or more lines of vision, compared to 20 to 30% of eyes with any submacular CNV.

Eyes with large subretinal hemorrhages that involve the fovea often have poor visual outcomes, although some eyes have surprisingly good visual recovery, suggesting that prompt treatment (such as with intravitreal anti-VEGF medications or surgery) is still beneficial.
