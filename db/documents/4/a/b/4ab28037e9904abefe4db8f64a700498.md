Arnold-Chiari 1 malformation, otherwise known as the Chiari 1 malformation, is the more common variant of the Chiari malformations, defined as a spectrum of hindbrain abnormalities involving the cerebellum, brainstem, skull base, and cervical cord. It is characterized by the caudal descent of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. This activity reviews the key findings seen in the Chiari 1 malformation with workup recommendations regarding key investigations and further management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of the Chiari 1 malformation.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of a Chiari 1 malformation.
- Review the appropriate investigations, treatments and management options available for a Chiari 1 malformation.
- Describe team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance Chiari 1 malformations and improve outcomes.
