Quality control is an essential part of the nuclear medicine department as it ensures that radiation exposure is minimal during imaging procedures. The basic functionality of nuclear medicine equipment contributes to shaping high-quality diagnostic images has a direct impact on image quality. The procedures for nuclear medicine quality assurance, including imaging and non-imaging instruments, are summarized in this review article.

**Objectives:**
- Explain and summarise the standard Nuclear Medicine Quality Control (QC) procedure to achieve consistent and high standard diagnostic image quality.
-  Describe the routine quality control procedures for the gamma camera to obtain high-quality diagnostic images.
- Outline the standards of quality control procedures for non-imaging instruments.
- Review and identify the common quality control issues that can result in artifacts that degrade diagnostic imaging in nuclear medicine.
