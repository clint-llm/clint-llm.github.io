Galactorrhea is nonlactational production of milk. Prolactin, estrogens, and TRH all play a role in the production of milk from the breast. The condition is often managed by an interprofessional team that consists of a radiologist, endocrinologist, neurosurgeon, neurologist, and an internist. The galactorrhea associated with hyperprolactinemia is often associated with symptoms of hypogonadism (decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and menstrual irregularities) and thus a thorough medical history and physical exam are needed. Serosanguinous discharge from the breast should prompt further evaluation for breast pathologies. Inquiring of the patient about their current medications is vital. In most cases, treatment with dopamine agonists (cabergoline or bromocriptine) normalizes prolactin levels and results in shrinkage of the tumor. (Level V)
