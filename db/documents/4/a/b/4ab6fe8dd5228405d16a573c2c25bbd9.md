Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid hormone produced in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex that influences water and salt regulation in the body. Aldosterone's primary function is to act on the late distal tubule and collecting duct of nephrons in the kidney, favoring sodium and water reabsorption and potassium excretion while also contributing to acid-base balance. To execute these tasks, it influences epithelial sodium channels, sodium-potassium exchange pumps, hydrogen ion ATPases, and bicarbonate-chloride antiporters.
