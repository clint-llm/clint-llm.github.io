Safe EMS practices will assume the possibility of infectious disease in a person with symptoms, history, or physician assessment signs which suggest infection. Proper protection of the patient (and EMS personnel) and properly communicating this clinical diagnosis to receiving facility is required for good prehospital care. Although thermometers are now often available for EMS personnel, clinical assessment is an even more important consideration in the assessment of infectious disease.

Evaluation of the patient's vital signs, including pulse, respirations, and blood pressure, should accompany a focused physical assessment. Tactile skin temperature, color, and condition also can give important information. Altered mental status, decreased cardiac function, and evidence of any end organ failure should increase concern over serious infectious disease or sepsis. The patient's history of symptoms, clinical course, and exposures may aid the final diagnosis, also.
