There is little epidemiological data with regards to biloma formation. Most bilomas are secondary to iatrogenic disruption of the biliary tree, and therefore the incidence of bilomas depends on the frequency of interventions. Biloma typically presents in patients aged 60Â to 70 years old. This likely reflects the underlying etiological factors requiring invasive intervention rather than a predisposition to complications resulting in biloma formation. There has been no difference shown in the incidence of biloma formation between male and female patients.

Spontaneous biloma formation is exceedingly rare, with all literature on the subject in the form of case reports. In 2007, Ahktar et al. noted that 27 cases of spontaneous biloma had been reported since 1979.
