- Trigeminal neuralgia: Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is most commonly mistaken for trigeminal neuralgia since both have similar pain characteristics. Additionally, both of them are cranial neuralgias with similar pathophysiology and medical management. In certain rare cases, these conditions can coexist. Since the incidence of glossopharyngeal neuralgia is 1/1000 times less than trigeminal neuralgia, underdiagnoses of glossopharyngeal neuralgia are very common; this is why a thorough history and physical examination are essential since they both differ in the location of pain and provoking factors. Pain from glossopharyngeal neuralgia occurs in the throat and tonsillar region and is exacerbated by swallowing and chewing movement, whereas pain from trigeminal neuralgia occurs on the face in the trigeminal nerve distribution and is exacerbated by a light touch on the face, washing the face and brushing the teeth.

- Jacobson’s neuralgia: When the only symptom of glossopharyngeal neuralgia is the sensory loss at the ear (the otic form of glossopharyngeal neuralgia), it gets confused with intermedius or Jacobson neuralgia.

- Temporal arteritis and temporomandibular joint dysfunction: Pain in these pathologies occurs in the same distribution, but the pain characteristics in both pathologies are entirely different from glossopharyngeal neuralgia.
