Wrist instability can be easily missed in emergency presentations. A thorough clinical examination and radiograph are necessary for an appropriate diagnosis of wrist instability. Coordinated management of radiologists and orthopedic surgeons is required for wrist instability correction. Acute injuries are timely treated because chronic instabilities are difficult to manage, and outcomes are not as satisfactory as in acute injuries management. Acute timely treatment of these injuries would prevent the development of chronic wrist pain, weakness, and improving function.

These conditions and injuries require the efforts of an interprofessional team. A family clinician may be the first to encounter the patient, and an appropriate referral to orthopedic specialists may be necessary to determine the way forward. Orthopedic specialty-trained nurses can also be key players, providing patient counsel and coordinating therapy. Physical therapists can also contribute during post-surgical rehab or to increase function and strength to prevent surgery. This interprofessional approach will yield improved patient results.
