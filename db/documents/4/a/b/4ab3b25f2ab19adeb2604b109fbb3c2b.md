Health care providers should communicate the benign nature of lichen nitidus with patients and be aware that lesions will most likely spontaneously resolve on their own. This explanation will avoid treatment that is not required and decrease the risk of side effects of the treatment modalities used for lichen nitidus. If lesions persist, become symptomatic, or cosmetically disturbing, the clinician should discuss appropriate treatment options with patients. Referring to a specialist for management when needed and having open communication between all health care providers will overall improve patient care.

When initiating treatment, it is wise for the clinician to consult a pharmacist, especially given the side effect profile of retinoid drugs. The pharmacist can verify dosing and help educate the patient on dosing and adverse effects. This counsel should be reiterated byÂ a dermatology specialty nurse who is familiar with these medications and can assist the clinicians in implementing any treatment plan. This interprofessional team approach will improve treatment outcomes for patients with lichen nitidus. [Level 5]
