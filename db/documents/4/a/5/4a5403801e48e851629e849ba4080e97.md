Gamma scintillation camera systems are used for renal scanning. These systems convert radiotracer emitted photons from the radiopharmaceuticals into display images.

The gamma camera system consists of a collimator, scintillation crystal, photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), and a processing computer.

A collimator is placed between the patient and the gamma camera. It localizes the radiated area to only the required field of view for the scan absorbing undesired radiation and that outside the field of view from reaching the gamma cameras. The scintillation crystals convert emitted gamma rays from the patient into a florescent light pulse. Photomultiplier tubes convert the light pulse into a signal of various voltages. The gamma camera system's computer converts the output signal into an image based on how the radiopharmaceutical has been distributed. The gamma camera system's computer is used to further refine and format the images for interpretation. Quantitative information can be determined. That information and the resultant images are then placed into a local or hospital-wide PACS (picture archiving and communications) system.

Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) systems fuse information obtained from gamma cameras with anatomy determined by CT.
