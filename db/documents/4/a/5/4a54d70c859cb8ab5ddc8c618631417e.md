All patients diagnosed with hyperlipidemia must understand how the disease affects their organs and the health risks that it may pose. A proper diet, smoking cessation, and lifestyle modifications should always be discussed. If pharmacological therapy is necessary, discussion of the risks and benefits of each medication should be explored before initiation. The primary care physician and pharmacist alike have a duty to educate the patient on medication compliance, side effects, interactions, and the overall risks versus benefits of the medications prescribed. The patient must also understand the potential risks related to not taking the medication and what alternatives they may have as treatment options.
