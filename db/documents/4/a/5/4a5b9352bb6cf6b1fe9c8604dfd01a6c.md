Parathyroidectomy is the surgery to remove one or more of the parathyroid glands in the patient who has hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism. Most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have a single parathyroid adenoma, though a significant minority (up to 10%) may have double adenomas, and a small minority will have hyperplasia of all four glands.

With the development of the preoperative localization technique, the minimally invasive surgery using the radio-guided technique, ultrasound imaging, high-resolution endoscopic technique, rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoringÂ has been used by many surgeons to avoid exploration of all glands. The traditional parathyroidectomy still has its advantages and is still routine practice for some surgeons. For completeness' sake, this standard surgery is the operation reviewed in this article.
