Acute cystitis is often managed by an interprofessional team that includes a primary care provider (MD, DO, NP, or PA), internist, urologist, and nephrologist. It is important to understand that most simple cases of cystitis resolve quickly with treatment, but if there is a persistence of symptoms, admission may be recommended. Nursing staff and pharmacists round out the interprofessional care team by providing patient counseling and medication reconciliation, and the pharmacists can also assess the appropriateness of antimicrobial agents chosen. Each team member must note any changes in the patient's case, including medication adverse events or therapeutic failure, document their findings in the patient's record, and inform the appropriate team members to initiate appropriate case intervention.

There are many things to consider when treating cystitis. The choice between agents should be individualized and depends on the duration of treatment as well as the possible organism involved. According to guidelines, there is no single, best agent to treat acute uncomplicated cystitis. Choosing an antibiotic depends on its effectiveness, the risk of adverse effects, local resistance patterns, and the propensity to cause collateral damage; furthermore, clinicians should consider cost, availability, and patient factors, such as allergy history. On average, patients will experience symptom relief within 36 hours of beginning treatment. [Level 5]
