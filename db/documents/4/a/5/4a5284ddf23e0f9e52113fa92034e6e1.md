The neurovascular bundle of the forearm, including the ulnar artery, vein, and venae comitantes, is formed by the flexor carpi ulnaris, FDS, and flexor digitorum profundus. The flexor carpi ulnaris is an important anatomical guide when the wrist is flexed and ulnarly deviated.

Cubital tunnel syndrome is the second most common compression neuropathy of the upper extremity and involves the ulnar nerve.

Prolonged compression of the ulnar nerve by the flexor carpi ulnaris may lead to not only decreased sensation in the ulnar 1-1/2 digits, but patients may complain of weak grasp and thumb pinch (Froment’s sign) from loss of metacarpal phalangeal joint flexion power and thumb adduction.
