When understanding the prognosis of cryoglobulinemia, the patient's root state must be considered to understand the extent of the disease properly. Specifically, when considering type 1 cryoglobulinemia, hematologic diseases are often a pre-existing condition.

Survival rates with cryoglobulinemia are 70 percent after 10 years of evident symptoms and approximately 50 percent after 10 years of post-diagnosis. Prognosis is usually dependent on the effectiveness of the treatment.

HCV (hepatitis C) cryoglobulinemia related vasculitis is also a significant disease with an approximate five-year death rate of 25 percent.

However, recent trials with CD-20 antibody rituximab have shown some beneficial results and its use is being suggested.
