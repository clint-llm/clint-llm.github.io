Vision is one of the five senses the body uses to interpret its surroundings. In the past, our primitive ancestors had what is called "dichromatic vision,” allowing for interpretation of only UV light and red light. About 30 million years ago, the trichromatic part of vision came to existence due to the evolution of opsin genes.
