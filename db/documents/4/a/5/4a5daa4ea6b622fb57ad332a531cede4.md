The etiology of Klippel-Feil syndrome is not well known. Several studies have hypothesized that vascular disruption, global fetal insult, primary neural tube complications, or related genetic factors may carry implications in the development of KFS.GDF6, GDF 3, and MEOX1 genes can cause Klippel-Feil syndrome and cane be inherited.  GDF6 is involved in proper bone formation, while GDF3 is involved in bone development. MEOX1 gene creates the homeobox protein MOX1 that regulates the separation of vertebrae. GDF6 and GDF3 abnormalities are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, while MEOX1 mutations are autosomal recessive.
