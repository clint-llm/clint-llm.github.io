More than 100 type-1 ryanodine receptor channel mutations potentially present in skeletal muscle, including malignant hyperthermia, central core disease, and multi/minicoreÂ disease.

Malignant hyperthermia is a hypermetabolic syndrome that appears in susceptible patients after exposure to specific pharmacologic agents that induces abnormal regulation of the ryanodine receptors, producing a massive release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in striated muscle.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is characterized by a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the setting of a high adrenergic tone, as in exercise.
