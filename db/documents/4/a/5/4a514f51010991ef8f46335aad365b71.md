For surgeries involving the foot and ankle, the surgeon may use a sural nerve block as an adjunct to general anesthesia. It is relatively easy to perform as the nerve lies very superficial at the ankle and is locatable using anatomical landmarks, though ultrasound guidance is also an option. Risks are similar to those of any nerve block, including pain on injection, bleeding, infection, and allergic reaction to the anesthetic.

The sural nerve can suffer an injury during procedures involving the ankle, calcaneal tendon, or small saphenous vein. The saphenous vein often gets harvested in coronary artery bypass procedures, and the proximity of the sural nerve to this vein predisposes it to injury during the harvesting procedure. Researchers have conducted several studies on the anatomical variability of the nerve as they may pertain to the surgical and clinical outcomes of procedures near the nerve. As it is not a motor nerve and only supplies sensation to a small part of the leg and foot, injury is well tolerated, and this is why the nerve is often used for nerve grafting or biopsy.
