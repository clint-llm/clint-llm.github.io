Ametropia refers to any refractive condition that results in the image of an object not correctly focused on the retina. Spectacles lenses are the most common devices used in the correction of ametropias. Spectacle lenses consist of a frame that carries the corrective ophthalmic lenses. The spectacle frames come in different materials, which can be full-rimmed, half-rimmed, or rimless. Lenses contained in spectacles can be convex (for correcting hyperopias), concave (for correcting myopias), or cylindrical (for astigmatism). Spectacle lenses have advantages over other forms of correction for ametropia, mainly because they are non-invasive. A proper refraction procedure is required when preparing a prescription for spectacles. This chapter reviews spectacles as a method of ametropia correction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the examination, selection, and dispensing of corrective spectacles.

**Objectives:**
- Review the concept of ametropia and identify its causes, types, and correction, in addition to discussing compensatory mechanisms that patients may employ in the presence of ametropia.
- Summarize the clinical examination required for the diagnosis of ametropia.
- Explain the Fechner paradox and outline its cause.
- Describe the concept of aniseikonia.
