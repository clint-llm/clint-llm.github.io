Oogenesis occurs in the female embryo before birth but does not complete until puberty. Therefore, an embryo will not form a corpus luteum. Once a female begins ovulating and menstruating, a corpus luteum will form in the ovary once the secondary oocyte is released from the follicle during monthly ovulation.
