During embryogenesis, testicles descend from the posterior abdominal wall and gradually migrate into the scrotal area. This descent or migration movement of the testicles is guided by a cord-like structure called the gubernaculum. It attaches the inferior pole of the testicles to the developing scrotal sac.

With the descent of the testicles, a peritoneal outpouching called the processus vaginalis follows the testicles to the scrotum. Following the descent of the testicles into the scrotum, the processus vaginalis degenerates. This process of degeneration or obliteration may be delayed, or it may fail completely. Failure of closure of the pocessus vaginalis leads to the propensity to develop a number of abnormalities. Peritoneal fluid can travel down a patent processus vaginalis leading to the formation of a hydrocele. Persistent processus vaginalis may increase the risk of development of inguinal hernias.

Failure of the testicles to descend may result in various degrees of undescended testes. This is a common pediatric surgical problem.
