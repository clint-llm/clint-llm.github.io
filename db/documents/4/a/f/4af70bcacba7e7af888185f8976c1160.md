**Parkinson Disease**

On histopathology (HP), parkinsonism usually presents as depigmentation, gliosis, and a decrease in the population of neurons, predominantly in substantia nigra pars compacta and in the locus ceruleus in the pons.

**Normal-pressure Hydrocephalus**

HP showed the presence of tau-positive neurons and tufted astrocytes seen in the caudate nucleus or Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra.

**Vascular Parkinsonism**

VP denotes the presence of microangiopathy, lacunar infarcts, and very rarely large vessel infarcts. Lacunar infarcts are more commonly present in the basal ganglia and thalamus and may be visible both macro- and microscopically. Microangiopathy reveals perivascular pallor, arteriolar wall thickening, and gliosis.

**Drug-induced Parkinsonism**

It includes loss of neurons present in the substantia nigra but no Lewy bodies.
