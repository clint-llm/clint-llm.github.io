The incidence of fibromuscular dysplasia in the general population is approximately 0.42% to 3.4%. Risk factors include gender, age, and history of smoking. The disease primarily affects middle-aged women in the fifth decade of life. In most studies, up to 90% of patients with FMD have been women. The carotid artery is involved in 75% of cases and is often bilateral, with about two-thirds having an additional arterial bed involved. FMD commonly correlates with cerebral aneurysms (31%), fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal arteries (up to 40%), and dissections (63.7%). Gender differences have been identified as well.  Fibromuscular dysplasia affects women twice as often as men. Women are more likely to have extracranial internal carotid artery involvement and are at higher risk for cervical (carotid and vertebral) dissections and aneurysms. Men have a higher incidence of renal artery involvement and are more likely to have renal dissections.
