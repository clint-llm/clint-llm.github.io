In most cases, the acute phase of Chagas disease is asymptomatic and goes undiagnosed. When symptomatic, the findings are typically non-specific and can easily be attributed to other etiologies. Typical findings include:

- Asymptomatic

- Fever

- Malaise

- LocalizedÂ nodule at the inoculation site (chagoma)

- Unilateral palpebral edema (Romana sign)

- Lymphadenopathy

- Hepatosplenomegaly

These findings usually occur over four to eight weeks. If infected by oral transmission, symptoms may also include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or gastrointestinal hemorrhage. In most cases, the acute infection resolves spontaneously. Severe but rare acute organ-specific manifestations can include myocarditis or meningoencephalitis.

A small subset of patients will experience an anaphylactic reaction to the kissing bug bite. Presenting signs and symptoms can include acute onset urticarial rash, flushing, difficulty breathing, wheezing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, and edema.

Approximately 30% to 40% will develop a chronic infection with subsequent organ damage.

Clinical manifestations of Chagas reactivation often occur in the setting of immunosuppression and results in an acute illness that may include chagoma, panniculitis, myocarditis, or meningoencephalitis.
