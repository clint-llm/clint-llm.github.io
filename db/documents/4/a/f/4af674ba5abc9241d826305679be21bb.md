Early discussion with the Poison Control Center or a Medical Toxicologist will assist in guiding workup and management.

Body fluid testing for cobalt is not widely available, so use in the acute setting is limited. Use of adjunctive tests that may signal signs or symptoms of toxicity should be used to direct acute care, including the complete blood count (CBC), reticulocyte count, erythropoietin, and thyroid stimulating hormone levels (TSH). Patients with more severe illnesses may have findings of metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate levels. Electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and troponin may help identify patients with cardiomyopathy.

Chest radiographs and computed tomography scans will help identify patients with pulmonary disease, particularly in the context of occupational exposures, although pulmonary toxicity can be found in the setting of other routes of exposure. In the outpatient setting, pulmonary function testing may show decreased vital capacity.

In patients where arthroprosthetic failure is of concern, imaging may be beneficial to identify those who are at high risk of developing toxicity. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are more specific and sensitive studies for cobalt-containing implants.

Urine cobalt levels are most commonly used for occupational monitoring. Normal serum cobalt is reported to be 0.1 to 1.2 mcg/L. The normal reference range for urine cobalt is 0.1 to 2.2 mcg/L.

More recently, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has been used to diagnose cobalt-induced cardiomyopathy in metal-on-metal hip prostheses.
