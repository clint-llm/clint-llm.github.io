Cerebral cavernous malformations, also known as cavernomas or cavernous hemangiomas, are clusters of abnormal and hyalinized capillaries without intervening brain tissue. Due to recurrent microhemorrhages and thrombosis, they are typically surrounded by hemosiderin deposits and gliosis. These lesions have slow flow and low pressure, causing average rupture risk to be much lower than that of some other vascular malformations such as arteriovenous malformations. Cavernomas are often found incidentally, but can also present during evaluation of headaches, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, or symptomatic hemorrhage.

Supratentorial location is the most common, though lesions in the basal ganglia, brainstem, cerebellum, and spine also can occur. They can be associated with developmental venous anomalies (DVAs).

The average annual rate of hemorrhage is reported at 0.7%-1.1% per lesion in patients without a history of prior hemorrhage.
