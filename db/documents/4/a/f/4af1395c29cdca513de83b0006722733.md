While the diagnosis of pediatric migraine is primarily clinical, lab testing and neuroimaging may be needed in certain circumstances.

**Indications for Lab Testing**

- Children with sickle cell disease may present with headaches in case of low Hgb. Blood work may be warranted for such patients.

- A lumbar puncture may be performed if an inflammatory process or mitochondriopathy is considered the cause of the headache. Caution is advised while performing lumbar punctures as it can worsen the headaches by causing intracranial hypotension.

- EEG may be performed in patients if there is clinical suspicion of seizures.Â Migraine-associated EEG abnormalities are relatively common: 10% to 75% in total (paroxysmal in 20% to 30%).

**Neuroimaging for Patients with Migraine Indications**

- Any neurological deficits, including but not limited to seizures, reduced visual acuity, altered consciousness, and deterioration of motor skills.

- Enlarged head in an infant or toddler.

- Abnormal ophthalmological evaluation, such as visual field cuts, disconjugate gaze, or abnormal fundus

- Headaches that always occur on one side (fixed unilaterally).

- Refractory headaches that last several days and are not responsive to treatment.
