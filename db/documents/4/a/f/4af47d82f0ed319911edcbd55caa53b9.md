Patients with colonic volvulus may present with an intestinal obstruction. Often, the symptoms are hard to differentiate from blockages caused by colon cancers. Common symptoms are acute onset of severe abdominal pain, constipation, obstipation, nausea, and vomiting. Often, a tympanitic and markedly distended abdomen are seen, and often, the distention is more impressive than other causes of bowel obstruction. When the wall of the distended bowel is placed under increased tension, the cecal volvulus may be associated with ischemia. Another cause of ischemia may be occlusion of the arterial blood supply to the mesentery cause by torsion. Ominous signs include tachycardia, rebound tenderness, and severe abdominal pain not improved with medical management.
