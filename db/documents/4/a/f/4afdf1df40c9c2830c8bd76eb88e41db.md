The goal of the treatment of allergic contact dermatitis is to decrease the inflammatory response that is triggered by the type 4 hypersensitivity reaction. Reactions caused by strong sensitizers may require quicker and more aggressiveÂ treatment as the intensity of dermatitis will increase. Identifying and removing the allergen is the most effective definitive treatment. Ointment-based moisturizers and steroids are preferred vehicles of treatment as creams contain a variety of chemicals and preservatives.
