An assessment would confirm that ‘true’ labor has been established, with appropriate documentation of onset time. The patient feels less pain with every contraction, with less frequency and increasing intervals between the contractions. Maternal exhaustion is unusual but appears later as anxiety increases. The fetus is also usually not affected early on.

The common clinical finding is inadequate cervical dilatation or fetal descent. With ineffective labor, there may be observed slow progression called protracted labor, absence of progress called the arrest of labor or ineffective expulsive effort. The woman must be in the active phase with cervical dilatation up to 4 cm to be diagnosed with any of these dysfunctions.
