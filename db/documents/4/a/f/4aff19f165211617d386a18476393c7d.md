The differential diagnosis for patients presenting with a cardiac murmur and a widened pulse pressure includes conditions associated with hyperdynamic circulation. These include:

- Thyrotoxicosis

- Severe anemia

- Wet beriberi or Thiamine deficiency

- Presence of arteriovenous fistulae

- Pregnancy

Other intracardiac causes of similar physical presentation include:

- Infective endocarditis

- Mitral stenosis

- Tricuspid stenosis

- Mitral regurgitation

- Pulmonic regurgitation

As originally described by Flint in 1862, theÂ murmur was "presystolic in timing and indistinguishable from that of mitral stenosis."
