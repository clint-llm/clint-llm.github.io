When patients present with large bullae, it is important to seek a dermatology consultation. The sooner the disorder is treated, the better the prognosis.

Bullous pemphigoid is typically a chronic disease with unpredictable exacerbations, with up to 30% of affected patients relapsing within the first year. When treatment is discontinued, up to 50% of patients may relapse within the first three months of discontinuation. The mortality rate is increased in bullous pemphigoid due to the elderly population being affected, with a death rate of approximately 10% to 40%.
