The lateral part of the flexor digitorum profundus muscle (associated with the index and middle fingers) is innervated by the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve, and the medial part of the muscle (associated with the ring and little fingers) is innervated by the ulnar nerve (C8, T1). Besides the flexor carpi ulnaris, the flexor digitorum profundus is the only flexor muscle that is not exclusively innervated by the median nerve.

The median nerve descends between the flexor digitorum superficialis and the flexor digitorum profundus proximally. The anterior interosseous nerve branches from the median nerve halfway down the forearm and from the dorsal lateral aspect of the median nerve. The anterior interosseous nerve has only motor functioning.
