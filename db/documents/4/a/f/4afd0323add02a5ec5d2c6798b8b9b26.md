Bile duct hamartomas are thought to arise from the abnormal development of intrahepatic bile ducts. Histologically, they are composed of inflammatory cells, bile ducts, and fibrosis. No BRAF V600E mutations have yet been identified in biliary hamartomas despite bile duct adenomas having that mutation.
