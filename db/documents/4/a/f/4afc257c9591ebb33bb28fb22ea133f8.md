If the ingestion was intentional, then intervention from psychological professionals is necessary. For unintentional ingestion, the patient will require counsel on proper dosing and administration to prevent further events. If the overdose occurred in a child, it is often a case of the patient or parent needing to understand the importance of keeping the drug in a place not accessible by the child.
