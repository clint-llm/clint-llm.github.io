The patient should have been adequately evaluated and examined before surgical intervention and deemed appropriate for surgery by an appropriately qualified surgeon. Patients should be educated about the risks and benefits of the intervention, including available alternative therapies. All possible complications should be discussed. Lastly, any questions from the patient need to be answered to their satisfaction.
