Patients who are cognitive before initiating mechanical ventilation should be made aware of the possible complications associated with mechanical ventilation, including barotrauma. Physicians should inform patients and family members of the increased morbidity and mortality associated with barotrauma; especially in patients with a known history of COPD, asthma, or ILD. Providers should discuss goals of care with every patient and their family members.
