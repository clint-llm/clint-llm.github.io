The incubation period may be as few as three days or as long as several weeks. When ingested, Brucella organisms are phagocytosed and enter the intestinal submucosa, where they are transported to lymphoid tissue by macrophages. In the bloodstream, the organisms are quickly contained within circulating polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and macrophages, making use of numerous mechanisms to avoid or suppress bactericidal responses. The bacteria do not activate the alternative complement system. Brucellae are transported into the lymphatic system and may replicate there locally; they also may replicate in the liver, spleen, kidney, breast tissue, or joints, causing both localized and systemic infection. Symptoms frequently last for several months, and chronic infections with brucellosis may last for years.
