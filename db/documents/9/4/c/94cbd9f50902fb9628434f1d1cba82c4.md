The dorsal scapular artery (DSA) follows the DSN to provide blood to the trapezius, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles. The DSA commonly spirals around the DSN as it runs medial to the scapula and anterior to the rhomboid muscles. There is some variability for the origin of the DSA. A direct dorsal scapular artery from the subclavian artery is the most common origin (75%) followed by an indirect dorsal scapular artery branch from the thyrocervical trunk (25%). The course of the artery also varies as it passes between the trunks of the brachial plexus. A direct branch is most likely to pass between the upper and middle trunks of the brachial plexus while an indirect branch is most likely to pass above the upper trunk.

As the dorsal scapular artery descends medial to the scapula, it gives off anastomoses to join with intercostal arteries on the medial side and with the circumflex scapular artery laterally. In making these connections, the dorsal scapular artery provides a significant blood supply to the entire posterior scapular region to include the infraspinatus muscle.
