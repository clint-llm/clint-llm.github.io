Candida albicans can be part of the normal oral flora. Due to impaired cell-mediated immunity, the esophageal epithelial layer is susceptible to infection and colonization by candida. The candida proliferates and adheres to the esophageal mucosa forming white-yellow plaques. The plaques can be seen on upper endoscopy and do not wash from the mucosa with water irrigation. These plaques can be found diffusely throughout the entire esophagus or localized in the upper, mid, or distal esophagus.
