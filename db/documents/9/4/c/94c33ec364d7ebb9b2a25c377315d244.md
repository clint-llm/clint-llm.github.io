Management of gastric varices and their resulting complications requires an interprofessional team approach consisting of gastroenterologist, hepatologist, internist, intensivist, critical care nurse, pharmacist, respiratory therapist, blood bank team, endoscopy technician, and interventional radiologist.  The patient’s hemodynamics and blood work should be monitored closely, and there should be close communication between the caring nurse and the ordering physician. The pharmacy team should make all critical drugs available, and the blood bank should mobilize blood products as needed. The gastroenterology team should discuss the case with the interventional radiology team well in advance, especially in patients presenting with acute gastric variceal hemorrhage in anticipation of TIPS or BRTO. If specialized interventional radiologic techniques such as TIPS or BRTO are unavailable, supportive therapy should be provided, and the patient should be transferred to a facility where these procedures are available. Such a holistic team approach goes a long way in improving patient outcomes. [Level 5]
