Most pathologic causes of infant head lag are linked to conditions causing neonatal/infantile hypotonia. These conditions make up a list of differential diagnoses to consider when assessing an infant with persistent or severe head lag. This includes chromosome disorders (i.e., Prader Willi), Hypoxic-ischemic injuries, cerebral dysgenesis, spinal cord injuries, spinal muscular atrophies, congenital hypomyelination neuropathy, familial dysautonomia, infantile neuronal degeneration, CNS infections (i.e., meningitis and encephalitis), infantile botulism, congenital and transient myasthenia gravis, muscular dystrophies, metabolic myopathies (i.e., hypothyroidism), central core disease/fiber myopathies and other congenital myopathies.
