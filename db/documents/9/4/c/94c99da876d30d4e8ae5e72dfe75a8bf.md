Intensive care physicians are quite familiar with the concept of ventilator-induced lung injury and preventive strategies. Other specialties like cardiology and/or pulmonology may have to be involved on a case-to-case basis to rule out cardiac or pulmonary causes closely mimicking ventilator-induced lung injury.Â As with any other medical condition, close coordination and interactions among various specialties comprising the interprofessional healthcare team ensure a better outcome in a given patient.
