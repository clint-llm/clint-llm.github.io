For this dietary intervention, it is optimal for patients to consult with a gastroenterologist and a nutritionist or registered dietician for instructions and symptom monitoring. Regular follow up with clinicians allows patients to incorporate the appropriate changes into their lifestyle successfully. Furthermore, advising the patient and paying close attention to his or her response to the diet will minimize potential harms associated with inadvertently extreme restrictions or the opposite. From the psychosocial perspective, one should note that a practitioner's attitude toward the diet plays an essential role in preventing a patient's poor response to it.

Additionally, clinic visits are an opportunity to disseminate written material to patients, which improves understanding and has been demonstrated to enhance diet adherence.
