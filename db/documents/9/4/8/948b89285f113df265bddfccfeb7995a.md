Atrophic vaginitis is not a life-threatening disease, but it can significantly negatively affect patients' quality of life if not diagnosed and treated appropriately. Interprofessional communication and patient education are essential. The condition can be recognized and treated by multiple clinicians to include primary care, obstetricians/gynecologists, dermatologists, and surgeons. A proper diagnosis can be challenging without a dedicated history taking, and physical exam and misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary referrals and procedures. With adequate interprofessional communication and patient education, atrophic vaginitis can be diagnosed and treated for improved patient outcomes.
