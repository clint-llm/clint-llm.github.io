Post-operatively, patients typically require continued nasogastric drainage, which may or may not need to be accompanied by parenteral nutrition. Once the nasogastric tube output decreases significantly or stops, then feeds may be started at a low amount and advanced as tolerated. The exact timing at which to starting enteral feeding is patient-dependent. If there is concern about the duodenoduodenostomy site or other anastomotic site, such as a duodenojejunal anastomosis, then an upper GI series with water-soluble contrast may be performed.
