Contraindications to Perforator flaps for breast reconstruction include the following:

- Severe lung or cardiac disease because this long-lasting procedure is not devoid of complications.

- Collagen vascular disease

- Obesity with BMI > 30

- Older patientÂ  because age over 65 is an increased risk for a hernia after abdominally based surgery and thrombosis

- Active Smoker

- Prior abdominal or thoracic surgery that has interrupted blood supply to potential flaps (for DIEP Flap and SIEA Flap)

- lack of availability of autologous tissue

- Prior radiation therapy to the donor site

- Thrombotic diseases because they increase the risk of free flap failure

- Advanced breast cancer with metastatic disease

Some may not consider all of these to be contraindications, but increased risk factors to be taken into consideration when reconstructive options are being weighed.
