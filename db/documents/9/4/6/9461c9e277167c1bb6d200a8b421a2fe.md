Nuclear cataracts are the product of changes in the lens proteins known as crystallins. Evidence is emerging that these changes are likely due to the effect of oxidative damage, probably through a nitric oxide-mediated pathway. Cataracts can be thought of as aÂ chronic oxidative injury of aging. The changes in crystallins alter the lens's ability to refract light and therefore decrease visual acuity. This general view of the pathophysiology of nuclear cataracts is concordant with the increase in myopic changes and cataracts reported in relation to hyperbaric oxygen.
