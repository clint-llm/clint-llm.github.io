Clinicians must consider different clinical conditions that manifest themselves with the typical symptoms of tracheomalacia (e.g., stridor) in the differential diagnosis:

- Laryngomalacia

- Subglottic stenosis

- Vocal cord paralysis

- Epiglottitis

- Inhaled foreign body

- Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis

Laryngomalacia is a condition characterized by foreshortened aryepiglottic folds with laxity in the supraglottic structures (such as the epiglottis), resulting in an inward collapse during inspiration. Patients can present with feeding difficulties and inspiratory stridor, which is worse when lying flat. The stridor is usually not present at birth but appears in the first 4 to 6 weeks of life, then increases in the following months, and is exacerbated by crying. Nevertheless, laryngomalacia often resolves by the age of 2. It is diagnosable using flexible nasendoscopy.

Subglottic stenosis commonly results from repeated trauma from either intubations or high-sited tracheostomies, though it is frequently idiopathic. Autoimmune and connective tissue diseases are also important causes of subglottic stenosis. Patients often have biphasic stridor, which does not typically change with position. These patients may be mistaken for children with recurrent croup episodes. Diagnosis is via endoscopic examination, either flexible nasendoscopy or bronchoscopy.

Vocal cord paralysis can either be congenital or acquired. If unilateral, patients may have weak phonation or hoarseness with potential issues with swallowing and aspiration. If bilateral, this is a potential airway emergency, and the patient can present with stridor and severe dyspnea but will often have a near-normal voice and cry. The unilateral form is most commonly due to dysfunction of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (compression, surgical trauma, neoplastic invasion). The bilateral acquired vocal cord paralysis with adduction is a serious iatrogenic condition, whereas the bilateral congenital form is usually associated with CNS problems such as perinatal asphyxia or hemorrhagic stroke, hydrocephalus, or Arnold-Chiari malformation. Diagnosis is via laryngoscopy, flexible nasendoscopy, or bronchoscopy.

Epiglottitis and other infections of the airway may cause stridor and dysphagia. The clinical picture develops acutely and requires rapid treatment.

Patients with foreign body aspiration usually have a history of choking after swallowing an object. Plain radiographs will show the foreign body if it is radio-opaque. Ventilating bronchoscopy may be both diagnostic and therapeutic for these patients. It is particularly important to determine if the foreign body is of organic material or a button battery, as both can significantly damage the respiratory epithelial lining.

Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis in children is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening, benign viral neoplasm of the respiratory tract. This condition is characterized by recurrent growth of polyps due to the human papillomavirus (types 6 and 11, classically), especially in the larynx but also in the tracheal and distally. Patients may have symptoms of upper airway obstruction and have a hoarse cry and phonation. The diagnosis is with flexible nasendoscopy or bronchoscopy, confirmed via biopsy of a lesion.
