Submandibular glands are major paired salivary glands. It is located in the submandibular triangle covered by the investing layer of deep cervical fascia. Mylohyoid muscle separates the superficial and deep lobe of the glands. Submandibular glands drain into the mouth via Wharton’s duct, which courses between the sublingual gland and hyoglossus muscle; it opens through a small opening lateral to the frenulum on the floor of the mouth.

Parasympathetic stimulation increases saliva secretion, and sympathetic stimulation slows it down. Saliva is high in potassium, low in sodium; it contains substances that begin the breakdown of food, to maintain and protect the oral cavity environment, and immunoglobulin A (IgA).

Sialadenitis is inflammation of the salivary gland. Sialadenitis of the submandibular gland is less common than that of the parotid gland. Acute sialadenitis is usually due to bacterial or viral infections and usually presents with rapid onset pain and swelling.

Chronic sialadenitis is characterized by recurrent or persistent of the salivary gland. Chronic sialadenitis is usually due to obstruction, e.g., calculi, stricture, and usually presents with swelling without erythema.

Sialdenosis is nonneoplastic,non-inflammatory swelling of the salivary gland in association with acinar hypertrophy and ductal atrophy. Sialdenosis presents as non-tender swelling that is often bilateral and symmetric. Sialadenosis is often associated with systemic metabolic conditions.
