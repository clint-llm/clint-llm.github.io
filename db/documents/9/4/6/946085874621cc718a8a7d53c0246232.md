Based on the adverse reaction profiles of each category, several significant contraindications can be elucidated

- Cholinomimetics/Cholinesterase inhibitors – relative contraindications in asthma/COPD, bradycardia, volume-depleted/hypotension, cardiogenic shock, sepsis, reduced ejection fraction heart failure

- Anticholinergics – relative contraindications in glaucoma especially angle-closure, older men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, and peptic ulcer disease; atropine specifically not recommended for children, especially infants who are sensitive to its hyperthermic effects

- Adrenoreceptor agonists/Sympathomimetics – relative contraindications in patients with a previous/current history of tachycardia or hypokalemia, hypertension, urinary retention, gastroparesis; for clonidine specifically in elderly who are more prone to fall from orthostatic hypotension, and epinephrine in those with angle-closure glaucoma

- Adrenoreceptor antagonists – relative contraindications for alpha-blockers in orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, myocardial ischemia; for beta-blockers asthma/COPD for the nonselective agents, bradycardia, hypotension
