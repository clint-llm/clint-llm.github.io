Sulindac use, as is the case with other NSAIDs, does not involve any routine monitoring. No regular blood work is necessary; however, it is essential to note that sulindac is not free from toxic side effects. Adhering to the dosing regimen is critical in preventing some of the side effects discussed above.

- If a patient develops signs of anemia, have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia.

- If pancreatitis develops while taking sulindac, monitor closely with appropriate laboratory studies (e.g., serum and urine amylase, amylase/creatinine clearance ratio, electrolytes, serum calcium, glucose, lipase, etc.

- Patients with hepatic insufficiency need to be monitored closely.

- Pregnant women who use sulindac for more than 48 hours between 2 and 30 weeks of gestation should be monitored for oligohydramnios.

- Patients on long-term treatment should have their CBC and chemistry profile checked periodically since sulindac might cause unexpected severe GI bleeding and ulcerations.
