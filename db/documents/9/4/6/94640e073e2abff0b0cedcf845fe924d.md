Hyperkalemia is unusual in the general population, reported in less than 5% of the population worldwide, but may affect up to 10% of all hospitalized patients. Most cases in hospitalized patients are due to medications and renal insufficiency. Diabetes, malignancy, extremes of age, and acidosis are other important causes in inpatients. Hyperkalemia is rare in children but may occur in up to 50% of premature infants. Hyperkalemia is more commonly reported in men than women, perhaps due to increased muscle mass and higher rates of rhabdomyolysis, and increased prevalence of the neuromuscular disease. Other factors include non-Black patients and older age.

Today there is a risk that empirical use of ACE inhibitors may cause hyperkalemia, which can be of concern in high-risk populations like people with diabetes, heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease.
