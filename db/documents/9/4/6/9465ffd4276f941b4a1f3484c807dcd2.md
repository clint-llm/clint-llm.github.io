Due to the wide range of folinic acid indications and administration guidelines, specific protocols are available that clinicians should follow. In general, folinic acid is compounded with calcium in the form of leucovorin calcium (especially for FDA-approved indications) and can be administered intramuscularly, intravenously, or orally. Â The timing, dosage, and route of folinic acid administration depend on the desired outcome for the desired indication.

**Adult**

- As an antidote for the toxic effects of methotrexate, folinic acid should not be administered concurrently. Most commonly, folinic acid is initiated 24 hours after starting methotrexate therapy. Furthermore, the toxic effects of methotrexate may not be reversible without the initiation of folinic acid within approximately 40 hours of methotrexate. As rescue therapy, folinic acid is generally administered orally, intramuscularly, or as an IV bolus.

- For combination therapy with 5-FU, clinicians should follow specific administration schedules as individual protocols vary. In general, when used for combination therapy, folinic acid is administered as an IV bolus or short IV infusions (minutes-hours).

**Pediatric**

- Folinic acid usually gets compounded with calcium, and as such, it should not be administered intravenously at rates over 160mg/min. Folinic acid is also not to be administered intrathecally.
