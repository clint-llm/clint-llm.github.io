The patient, rather than the healthcare community, represents the first line of defense in combating the devastating sequelae of the contracted socket. Inability to retain prosthesis in a contracted socket is aesthetically disabling and has a profound psychosocial impact on the patient and his/her family. Frequent postoperative follow-up visits and education regarding hygiene maintenance and self-care are the keys to avoid disastrous complications. Use of customized prosthesis, a regular and thorough cleaning, periodic replacement of prosthesis, and seeking an expert opinion from the ocularist and the ophthalmologist, as and when required, will lead to enhanced cosmetic and functional outcomes.
