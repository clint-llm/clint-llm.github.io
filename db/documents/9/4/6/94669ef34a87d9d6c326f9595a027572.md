In peripheral neurons such as those found in the intestinal mucosa, they express CCK in I-cells. Food intake, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), and glucocorticoids play a role in regulating CCK expression. Estrogen, dopamine, and injury situations activate CCK-mRNA in neuronal cells. Activation of transcription factors of these signaling pathways is unknown. Receptors in the CNS are G protein-coupled; CCK-2 receptor subtype (formerly known as CCK-B) are found mainly in the brain, and CCK-1 receptor subtype (formerly known as CCK-A) found mainly peripherally, for example, in the pancreas. Adenylyl cyclase is activated inducing a rise in intracellular cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and the activation of protein kinase A (PKA). They associate this rise in cAMP with CCK-receptor-mediated pathway with high concentrations of CCK. cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity is CCK concentration dependent. PKA activity peaks rapidly and maintains a high level of activity at high doses of CCK.
