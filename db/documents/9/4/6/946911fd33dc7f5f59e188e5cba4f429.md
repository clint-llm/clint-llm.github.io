Because of its location, Klumpke palsy can also affect the axillary artery; this can be from both a hyper-abduction stretch injury, but also a crush injury to the local area. If there is a severe vascular compromise, the patient will undergo emergency surgery. Fractures correlate with this condition, and treatment typically involves surgery. With injuries that are closed, meaning they do not have an obvious break through the skin or are vascular compromised, there is a conservative option. Spontaneous recovery from nerve palsy is possible, but it is important to note that most C8-T1 nerve palsies do not recover without intervention.Â Conservative treatment including exercising supportive muscles and stretching affected muscles, helping to maintain the range of motion and aid in a full recovery. The nerves will heal, but most are mild cases. In 3 to 6 months, if there is no improvement, surgery will take place. Surgical correction mostly involves nerve grafting, but in injuries proximal to the dorsal root ganglion, neurotization is the recommended procedure.
