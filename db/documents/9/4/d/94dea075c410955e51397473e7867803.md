Close postoperative patient monitoring is essential for recognizing early complications, especially the failure of the vascular anastomosis in the case of vascularized grafts. It is important to evaluate the flap regularly, looking for skin mottling, pallor, or ecchymosis, cooling of the skin, increasing edema, decreasing capillary refill, rapid return of dark blood, or no blood at all with skin pricking, or lack of Doppler signal. Additionally, other clinical signs such as hypotension, dizziness, excessive pain, and fever should raise suspicion for an evolving complication and trigger evaluation by the surgeon.
