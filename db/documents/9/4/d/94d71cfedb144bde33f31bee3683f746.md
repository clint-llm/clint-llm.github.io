**History**

Depending on the level of severity and institution, the initial assessment and management of a patient presenting from trauma may be overseen by the trauma service. Adhering to the principles and protocols of Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) should always take precedence if indicated.

When obtaining a patient history upon initial presentation of an avulsion fracture, the provider must obtain information regarding inciting event. In the setting of trauma, one must determine if the patient sustained high versus low-energy trauma. Discerning the mechanism is important.

It can be helpful to find out if symptoms are worse with activity, improve with rest, if this has happened before, or if this is a recurrent issue or injury. Patients with continued pain and a preexisting diagnosis of muscle strain or apophysitis should raise concern for an avulsion fracture. Along the same lines, a history of an acute event without previous pain may help differentiate a minimally displaced acute avulsion fracture from the chronic avulsion changes that might appear similar.

Providers must also find out if the patient has a history of cancer or infection.

In many trauma scenarios, the patient can be unsure of their body position and mechanism of their injury; or there are conflicting stories from witnesses. Likewise, the patient may be unconscious or unable to communicate. Similar to forensic science, in the context of avulsion fractures, it is possible to make an accurate diagnosis as well as determine the mechanism, and find other associated occult injuries, even with very limited, or contradicting information. A thorough physical exam accompanied with the appropriate background knowledge and radiographs may be all that is needed to make the diagnoses to direct appropriate management and follow up.

**Physical Examination**

Patients may present with pain, swelling, a palpable gap, visible deformation, decreased range of motion, local tenderness, discomfort, guarding, weakness, bruising, inability to bear weight, mild limitation of activity, sudden loss of function, or possibly chronic pain preceding the injury.

Providers should attempt to observe the patient’s gait or active range of motion if possible, as well as look for skin tenting or dimpling.

Direct palpation of the injured area, specifically trying to derive the area of maximal point of tenderness, can be an essential diagnostic feature in distinguishing a peripheral fracture from an uncomplicated sprain.

Because avulsion fractures are often associated with instability or dislocation, altered function, loss of range of motion, and loss of normal mechanics may be encountered.

In general, one should always examine the joint above and below the injured body part.

During the physical exam addressing an avulsion fracture, the provider must check for associated injuries. For example, in many avulsion fractures about the shoulder, shoulder stability, as well as the biceps tendon, may need to be evaluated.

One point to consider is that it can be difficult to assess a patient with an acute swollen body part accurately; therefore, the patient may need to be reexamined 10 to 14 days after the injury.

Although rare, certain avulsion fractures have a high association with compartment syndrome even without high-energy trauma. Therefore compartments must always be assessed on presentation. In such fractures, even when presenting without signs or symptoms of compartment syndrome, the high association may justify the need to proceed acutely for surgical fixation. If it is determined that immediate surgery is not necessary, observation and serial compartment checks of the extremity may be warranted in these patients.

Lastly, if a patient does present with a fracture-dislocation with the joint still dislocated, the physical examination components discussed above, especially the neurovascular status should be assessed both before and after the reduction is performed.
