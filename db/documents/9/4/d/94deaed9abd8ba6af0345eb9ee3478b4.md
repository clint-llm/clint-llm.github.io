Anxiolytics and sedative-hypnotics are widely consumed at home and in a hospital setting. This activity reviews the most commonly used agents of these classes, their potential toxicity, and therapies for toxicity. This activity focuses on the main factors relevant to anxiolytic and sedative-hypnotic medication toxicity and how a multi-disciplinary approach can potentiate or mitigate this result.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of anxiolytic and hypnotic-sedative use and related toxicity.
- Review how common pharmaceutical interactions, pathological states, and the metabolism of anxiolytics and sedative-hypnotics impact toxicity.
- Outline the management options available for anxiolytic and sedative-hypnotic toxicity.
- Explain some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve anxiolytic and hypnotic-sedative toxicity outcomes.
