Healthcare workers should work together to recognize workplace hazards, including exposure to HIV. Together, they can develop protocols to mitigate these threats and create programs to promote health and safety in the laboratory.

Though training and understanding HIV prevention is critical to avoid transmission, accidents and exposure to bloodborne pathogens will occur. Knowledge of exposure, treatment, and postexposure prophylaxis is of vital importance. By using safety-engineered medical devices, the number of needlestick injuries has decreased.

Nurses, technicians, and phlebotomists collect and screen tissues and blood samples. Laboratory personnel ensures safe testing and handling of these products. Physicians, pharmacists, and advanced care providers work in the coordination of care and information. Communication throughout the levels of the healthcare team is critical for patient care and healthcare workersâ€™ safety. Coordinating care amongst all interprofessional team members can improve health and safety measures.
