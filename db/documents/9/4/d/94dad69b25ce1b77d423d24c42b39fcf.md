Tinea cruris is caused by dermatophytes belonging to three genera, Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, and Microsporum.Trichophyton rubrum has been isolated most commonly and remains the most frequent cause of tinea cruris worldwide; however, most studies do recognize the increasing prevalence of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and other organisms in certain regions.

Athletes, especially those involved in contact sports, may be more likely to contract tinea infections.
