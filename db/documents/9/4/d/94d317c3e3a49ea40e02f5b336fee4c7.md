An often overlooked aspect of pectus carinatum is the psychological impact the deformity has on the patient.  Presentation of the condition occurs during the teenage years when body image formation is occurring.  Coping strategies may develop, such as wearing clothes that minimize the appearance of pectus or withdrawing from group activities and team sports to avoid the unwanted attention of their peers.  Those that pursue cosmesis with body-building should be made aware that the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support that level of strenuous activity in children whose skeletons are still maturing.
