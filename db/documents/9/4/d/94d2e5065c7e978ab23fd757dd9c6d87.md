As discussed, the particles that exist in our environment are endless. Therefore, our lungs have anatomical defense mechanisms to avoid these toxins. The mucociliary escalator begins from the level of primary bronchi to the level of the terminal bronchioles. It consists of cilia and goblet cells that secrete mucus. Larger particles are warded off in these areas, triggering the cough reflex to allow the exit of pathogens that may have entered the bronchi. Further down extending from the terminal bronchioles to the alveoli, the alveolar macrophages engulf smaller particles (less than 2 micrometers). They break the particles down and digest, recruiting more macrophages or other cells, such as neutrophils, to help ward off the stressors.
