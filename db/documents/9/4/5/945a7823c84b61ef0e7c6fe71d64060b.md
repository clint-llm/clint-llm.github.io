The pathophysiology of DIL is unclear and different mechanisms are responsible for the induction of autoimmunity by different lupus-inducing drugs.Â There are some genetic risk factors such as HLA-DR4, HLA-DR0301 and Complement C4 null allele which vary between different agents. Slow acetylators with genetic deficiency of N-acetyltransferase are at a higher risk of DIL, especially from procainamide and hydralazine.

Inhibition of DNA methylation is thought to contribute to the development of DIL from many agents including procainamide and hydralazine. The demethylation of CD4+ T cells makes them autoreactive by overexpression of the LFA-1 adhesion molecule. These autoreactive T-cells can then overstimulate autoantibody production by interaction with self class II MHC molecules on B-cells and induce apoptosis of macrophages by interacting with self class II MHC molecules on macrophages which release the highly antigenic apoptotic chromatin from the dying macrophages. This autoantibody production and release of the antigenic macrophage chromatin is thought to contribute to the development of lupus-like autoimmunity.
