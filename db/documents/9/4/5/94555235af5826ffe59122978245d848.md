Mediastinoscopy is a thoracic surgical procedure performed with a mediastinoscope to examine the mediastinumâ€” the space in the thoracic cavity between the lungs for various indications, including diagnostic tissue sampling, mediastinal lymph node biopsy, and TNM (tissue, nodes, and metastasis) staging. Mediastinoscopy has a high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (100%) in the staging of lung cancer. This activity reviews the role of mediastinoscopy, its indications, contraindications, complications and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with lung cancer.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the location of lymph nodes in the mediastinum.
- Describe the indications for mediastinoscopy.
- Review the clinical relevance of mediastinoscopy.
- Explain the role of the health care team in the coordination of care of patients undergoing mediastinoscopy.
