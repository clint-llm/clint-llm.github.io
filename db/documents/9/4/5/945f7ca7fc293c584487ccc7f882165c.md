**FDA-approved Indications**

Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic medication indicated in patients with overactive bladder or symptoms of detrusor overactivity, including urinary frequency and urgency. Animal studies have shown that it has four to ten times the antispasmodic effect of atropine. It also is indicated in patients with detrusor instability related to the neurogenic bladder (e.g., spina bifida). It has been studied and approved for patients over five years of age.

**Off-labeled Indications**

Occasionally, oxybutynin is used to treat bladder spasms provoked by indwelling ureteral stents or Foley catheters. However, this is not an FDA-approved use.
