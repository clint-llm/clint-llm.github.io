Hyperthermia is defined as a body temperature greater than 40 degrees C. Several conditions can cause hyperthermia. In sepsis, the immunologic reaction to the infection most often manifests as a fever. Some toxic ingestions and withdrawal states can cause elevated body temperature. Certain medications can cause a hyperthermic response, such as in neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The most common disease that treatable by cooling alone is heat-related illness and heat stroke. This activity illustrates the pathophysiology of hyperthermia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the causes of hyperthermia.
- Describe ways to lower body temperature.
- Summarize the presentation of a patient with hyperthermia.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of hyperthermia and improve outcomes.
