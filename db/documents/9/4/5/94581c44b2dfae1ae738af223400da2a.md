Complications of unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis are often limited as long as other comorbidities are not present. Complications such as dyspnea, exercise intolerance, sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-onset hypoventilation (such as in chronic spinal cord injury), or hypercapnia may arise if left untreated, with respiratory failure being the most dreaded complication.

As mentioned earlier, as high as 20 percent of cardiac bypass surgery may have diaphragm weakness as a complication.
