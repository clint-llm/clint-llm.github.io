Acute necrotizing pancreatitis usually presents as fluid collections in the pancreatic and peripancreatic regions, which may present as an acute necrotic collection (ANC) thatÂ does not have a definitive wall, or when they are more organized with well-defined wall-off necrosis (WON). These fluid collections initially are sterile but can become infected to develop a pancreatic abscess.
