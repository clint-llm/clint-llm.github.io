Osteoarthritis is a progressive disorder with no cure. The prognosis depends on the number of joints and the severity of the disease. Rapid progression is likely in older patients, obese individuals, those with varus deformity and multiple joint involvements. After joint replacement, the outcomes are good but no prosthesis is permanent; thus revision may be necessary after 10-15 years.

With recent advancements in therapy, the prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis has improved significantly, although morbidity and mortality in rheumatoid arthritis are significantly higher than the general population, predominantly due to the extra-articular manifestations.
