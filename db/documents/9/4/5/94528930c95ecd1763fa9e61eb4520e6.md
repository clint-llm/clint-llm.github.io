A good fundus evaluation with a 20D and a 90D lens is indispensable. Detailed ophthalmoscopic examination elicits the various pathological lesions present in a myopic eye. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy with a 90D lens alerts the clinician about the possibility of myopic traction maculopathy and makes them probe thoroughly into the disease.

Spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) is an essential tool in the diagnosis of myopic traction maculopathy. It delineates the retina layer by layer and provides detailed information about the pathology. The OCT shows the formation of cystic cavities within the retina, which causes a split in the layers of the retina, giving rise to a thicker inner layer and a thinner outer layer.

Since myopic eyes are large, large OCT scans (12 mm) are preferred. It is imperative to scan the entire posterior pole. OCT scans should be done both along the horizontal and along the vertical axis. Myopic traction maculopathy cannot be judged solely on the basis of OCT. Fundus photographs are essential for the evaluation of the eye. Conventional 30-degree photographs do not help in the proper evaluation of the staphyloma, and therefore, wide-field fundus photos are preferred. They give the full extent and the location of the staphyloma.
