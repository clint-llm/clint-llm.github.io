The primary care provider can use the RNV scan to assess the left ventricular function for any new sign or symptom of CHF, particularly for the patient taking cardiotoxic chemotherapy. The test can be performed in 1Â to 2 hours, with results obtained immediately. The patient care should be in coordination with cardiology and oncologist for any drop in ventricular function to adjust the chemotherapy regimen.
