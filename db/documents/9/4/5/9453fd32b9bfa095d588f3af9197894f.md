Two United States-licensed vaccines are available for Salmonella typhi, an oral attenuated live virus, and an injectable polysaccharide vaccine. The FDA indicates both vaccines for individuals traveling to an endemic are from a non-endemic area. They are also FDA-recommended for individuals with household exposure to a chronic Salmonella typhi carrier or working in a laboratory setting with potentially contaminated specimens. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods and timing of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring for typhoid vaccine, so providers can administer and monitor this vaccine in cases where it is needed.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action for both types of typhoid vaccine.
- Review the contraindications unique to each type of typhoid vaccine.
- Summarize the target patient population and administration schedule for typhoid vaccines.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to properly use typhoid vaccines to optimize patient outcomes against infectious disease.
