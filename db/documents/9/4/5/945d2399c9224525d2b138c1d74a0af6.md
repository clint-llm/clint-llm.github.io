In adults, syphilis initiates an infection after local infiltration through subcutaneous tissues to cause a local immune response and establish an initial ulcerative lesion. However, congenital syphilis differs from syphilis in adults in that T. pallidum is released straight into the bloodstream of the fetus causing spirochetemia with spread to most organs including the bones, kidney, spleen, liver, and heart. This leads to widespread inflammation throughout these organ systems leading to a variety of clinical manifestations.
