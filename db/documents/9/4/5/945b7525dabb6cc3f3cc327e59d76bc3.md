- **Growth:**Low birth weight followed by failure to thrive is common in Edwards syndrome. Patients with Edwards syndrome have feeding difficulties, gastroesophageal reflux, and recurrent aspiration. Edwards syndrome-specific Growth curves are available.

- **Developmental delay**- Severe to profound developmental handicap is the rule. Cognitive and motor delay is noted in most of the surviving patients with Edwards syndrome. Very few cases of Edwards syndrome, mosaic type, have been reported with normal intelligence.

- **Cardio-respiratory failure**is the leading cause of death in Edwards syndrome. It can be due to congenital cardiac defects, hypoventilation, central apnea, and pulmonary hypoplasia.

- **Neoplasm-**Edwards syndrome increases the risk of neoplasms like Wilms tumor/nephroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, and Hodgkin disease.

- **Endocrine**- Thymic hypoplasia and adrenal hypoplasia are common in Edwards syndrome.
