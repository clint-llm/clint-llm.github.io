The anterior tympanic artery supplies the malleus, incus, and stapes. This artery branches off of the mandibular portion of the maxillary artery. The anterior tympanic artery is also thought to supply portions of the tympanic membrane.

The venous system of the tympanic cavity leads, superiorly, into the middle meningeal veins and the superior petrosal sinus; inferiorly, in the bulb of the internal jugular vein and in the pterygoid, pharyngeal and internal carotid plexuses.

The lymphatic vessels of the tympanic cavity go to the parotid, retropharyngeal and mastoid lymph nodes.
