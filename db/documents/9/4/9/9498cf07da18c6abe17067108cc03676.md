The talonavicular coalition requires differentiation from:

- Calcaneonavicular coalition - identified by lateral pain in the foot and an anteater sign on the radiographs

- Congenital vertical talus - rocker-bottom foot associated with a vertical talus on the radiographs, which does not correct on dorsiflexion of the foot

- Calcaneovalgus foot - intrauterine positional packaging deformity characterized by hindfoot eversion and dorsiflexion - these contractures can sometimes lead to flexible flat foot deformities in the feet in adulthood.

- Pes planovalgus

- Accessory navicular bone - can present with painful flat foot

- Tumors or rheumatoid arthritis in the subtalar joint
