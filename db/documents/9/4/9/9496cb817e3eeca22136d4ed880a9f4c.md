Dural arteriovenous fistulas are not common, and hence there are no universal guidelines for clinicians to follow. The clinical signs of the condition are heterogeneous, and a high index of suspicion is necessary for the diagnosis. An integrated approach with a team of healthcare professionals is recommended to make an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The neurologist, neurosurgeon, interventional radiologist, and critical care physician can coordinate the treatment care plan and monitoring.

Post-treatment, the nurse is vital for monitoring the neurological exam and helping with ambulation and feeding. The nurse also plays a role in educating the patient and family about the disease and the potential adverse effects of treatment. In addition, the pharmacist ensures that the patient remains compliant with medications and controls his or her blood pressure.
