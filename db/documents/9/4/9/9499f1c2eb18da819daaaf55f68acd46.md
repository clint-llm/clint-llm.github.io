Vasculopathy occurs when a thrombus forms in the arterial lumen leading to compromised blood flow. It is distinct from vasculitis, which refers to primary inflammation of the vessel wall followed by fibrinoid necrosis. Livedoid vasculopathy is usually associated with phenomena that cause hypercoagulability and thrombus formation, including:

- Conditions associated with stasis: Chronic venous hypertension of the limbs, varicose veins. This venous stasis associated vasculopathy is generally not surrounded by livedo reticularis.

- Autoimmune connective tissue diseases: Systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease

- Thrombophilias: Inherited causes- factor V Leiden variant, prothrombin gene G20210A mutation, and protein C, protein S, and antithrombin deficiency, etc. Acquired causes- acquired homocysteinemia, cryoglobulinemia, cryofibrinogenemia, acquired antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

- Neoplasms: Myeloproliferative disorders, paraproteinemia, etc.

- Idiopathic
