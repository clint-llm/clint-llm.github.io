The examiner rotates the patient’s head 45 degrees to the right and quickly lays the head back over the end table. The patient’s eyes should exhibit torsional nystagmus. Each position should be held for at least 30 seconds. As the nystagmus improves, the otolith is descending and in an optimal position for the next step.

Rotate the patient’s head 90 degrees to the left, again holding for at least 30 seconds.

Instruct the patient to turn their entire head and body in the left lateral position, with the head facing 135 degrees from supine or 225 degrees from the starting position (looking at the floor).

Assist the patient in returning back to the sitting supine position while holding their head in place. The head position should be maintained as they are assisted in the sitting position, and repeat if necessary.
