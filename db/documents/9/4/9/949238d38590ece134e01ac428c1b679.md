Nasopalatine duct cysts arise from epithelial remnants of the nasopalatine duct, which can undergo activation by trauma, infection, or spontaneously.

Nasolabial cyst's pathogenesis is unclear; however, it is suggested that the epithelium in the nasolacrimal duct undergoes spontaneous activation and subsequent cyst formation.

Palatal cysts of the newborn arise from entrapped epithelium during the fusion of the palatal processes or trapped minor salivary glands.

Oral lymphoepithelial cysts arise from either entrapped epithelium in the area of Waldyerâ€™s ring or from obstructions in minor salivary gland ducts.

Epidermoid cysts arise from epidermal inclusions. In comparison to the dermoid cyst, the epidermoid cyst does not demonstrate any skin adnexa, like sebaceous glands or hair follicles.
