Patients should be advised that if clinical symptoms are acute, they should seek care at the emergency room to rule out life-threatening diagnoses such as ischemic stroke and malignancy. If symptoms are gradual or intermittent, they should visit their primary care physician for a referral to a neurologist for evaluation and management.
