In due time, the chronic adaptations of aerobic exercise have an immense impact on all of the body’s organ systems. However, for the sake of consistency and scope, we will focus on the clinical effects of these adaptations on 2 common major disease processes: cardiovascular disease and Type II diabetes mellitus.

**Cardiovascular Diseases**

In 2019, the American Heart Association released a set of guidelines for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. One of these recommendations involves “engag[ing] in at least 150 minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity physical activity”.

Another meta-analysis by Cornelissen and Smart reported that endurance training had the potential to decrease sBP 6-12 mmHg and dBP 3-6 mmHg in individuals with hypertension.

**Type II Diabetes Mellitus**

The American Diabetes Association noted in their 2016 position statement that individuals should perform “at least 150 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity spread out over 3 to 7 days with no more than 2 consecutive days between exercise bouts”.

A meta-analysis performed by Boule et al. reported 20 weeks of moderate to vigorous exercise (50 to 75% VO2 max) resulted in decreased Hgb A1c.

Other studies have yielded similar findings, noting aerobic exercise may improve intraepidermal nerve fiber density and peripheral nerve function.
