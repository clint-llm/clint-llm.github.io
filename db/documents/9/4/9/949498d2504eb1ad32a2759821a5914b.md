The Quincke sign, also known as the Quincke pulse, represents the visualization of capillary pulsations upon light compression applied to the tip of the fingernail bed. It is an eponym associated with chronic severe aortic regurgitation.

The Quincke sign is named after Dr. Heinrich Quincke, a German physician who first coined the term in 1868.
