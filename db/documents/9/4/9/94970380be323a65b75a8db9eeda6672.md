ECMO, especially in the pediatric setting, is complex in that it requires meticulous comprehension of pediatric and neonatal physiology. Possessing a foundation in education of the most intricate details of oxygen delivery should be a mandatory aspect of care. ECMO entails many ethical dilemmas as it heavily involves children’s families in the decision-making process. When ECMO is being considered acutely, there is often limited time to assess the estimated course of the patient’s clinical condition, reversibility of the underlying disease process, actual candidacy for heart or lung transplant, and the balance between post-survival quality of life with the family’s goals of care.

Challenges may include the moral distress of caregivers and providers during prolonged ECMO, the cessation of treatment, and considerable resource allotment. It is essential to be aware of the serious ramifications associated with each clinical choice.
