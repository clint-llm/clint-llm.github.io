Cogan syndrome (CS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the inner ears and the eyes, presenting with vestibulo-auditory dysfunction and interstitial keratitis.

Humoral and cellular immune responses are the suggested mechanisms. There is expression and upregulation of cytokines like intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and (IL-)1β.

Cogan syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion, and other differentials, including syphilis, have to be ruled out before diagnosing Cogan syndrome. Other features of Cogan syndrome include fever, arthralgia, arthritis, headache, and myalgia. Vascular involvement, including aortitis, is an important manifestation of the disease. Cogan syndrome is treated with corticosteroids and immunomodulatory therapy. Biologics and immunomodulatory therapy are promising therapy to improve the prognosis in such patients.
