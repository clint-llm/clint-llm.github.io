The hospital and healthcare team should be involved with the active promotion of chemical safety and education on the risks associated with exposures. Additionally, proper signage, warning labels on containers holding dangerous chemicals, and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment [Level IV] can help maintain hospital employee safety and save lives.

Strategies during the education process should include pictograms and labels associated with the specific hazards of a chemical so hospital employees can better understand the risks and implications of chemical exposure. The inclusion of these clear visual depictions of the chemical hazard has proven very effective. It is estimated to have contributed to a reduction of between 107,000Â and 459,000 acute chemical injuries as well as significant decreases in carcinogen exposures since their widespread use began.

Chemical hazards pose a significant threat to employees' health handling them. Still, proper education, precautions, and labeling have significantly reduced the incidence of acute exposure and long-term complications.
