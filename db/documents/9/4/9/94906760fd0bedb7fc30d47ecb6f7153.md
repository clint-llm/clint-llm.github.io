DCS is a clinical diagnosis. As the goal for treating all patients with symptomatic DCS is hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), with emphasis placed on recompression, there should be no delay in treatment for further diagnostic workup. The one exception is a chest x-ray, as untreated pneumothoraces are an absolute contraindication for HBO.
