The mediastinum is the central component of the chest between the two pleural spaces. The mediastinum can be divided into the superior, anterior, middle, and posterior mediastinum. The middle mediastinum contains the heart and root of the great vessels. The superior mediastinum is above the heart and contains the aortic arch and root of the carotid and subclavian arteries as well as the nodes about the vessels.

The anterior mediastinum will be behind the sternum and in front of the pericardium. The posterior mediastinum is behind the pericardium and heart. For the purposes of the mediastinotomy, there will be access to the superior and anterior mediastinum, but the main portion of access is the superior mediastinum, as this is the location of the AP window nodes the peribronchial nodes, and the structures of interest for this procedure.

The structures in jeopardy include the aorta, the pulmonary artery and vein, and the pericardium. Neural structures include the phrenic nerve medially along the pericardium as well as the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, which wraps underneath the aortic arch heading back into the neck to supply the vocal cord. Resultant injury to the phrenic nerve includes an ipsilateral elevated hemidiaphragm and the injury to the recurrent nerve results in hoarseness and a paralyzed vocal cord on the ipsilateral side.
