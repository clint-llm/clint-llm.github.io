- High-risk percutaneous intervention, there is no precise definition for high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and many factors should be taken into consideration like impaired LV function, left main stenosis, ostial stenoses, heavily calcified lesions, and cardiogenic shock.

- Acute myocardial infarction. Some patients with (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) would benefit from circulatory support to unload the LV and improve the coronaries' perfusion; however, no evidence of the benefit of the mechanical circulatory support in decreasing the myocardial injury in the setting of acute occlusion.

- Cardiogenic shock and advanced heart failure stabilize critically ill patients and serve as a bridge to recovery, surgical, mechanical circulatory support, or transplant.

- Selected high-risk patients undergoing percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty or aortic valve replacement.

- Patients with severe LV dysfunction undergoing electrophysiologic procedures as these high-risk patients will be intolerant to prolonged ventricular arrhythmia during the procedure.

- Right ventricular failure using percutaneously inserted RVD. RECOVER RIGHT trial demonstrated the safety and the immediate hemodynamic stabilization in patients with acute RV failure.
