Complications can arise from both medical treatment and surgical intervention. Tamoxifen has been associated with a higher risk of endometrial adenocarcinoma, uterine sarcoma, pulmonary embolism, and stroke in female patients.

Many of these complications occur in the postoperative period. Thus prophylactic management with DVT prophylaxis, antibiotics during preop, insertion/removal of foley catheters, incentive spirometry, and slowly escalating the diet as tolerated should be considered.
