Although ASAS is unpreventable and usually non-reversible, the most common underlying causes that lead to the development of ASAS are preventable such as aortic aneurysm/dissection and atherosclerotic disease. The patient's education should focus on primary disease prevention, especially at preventing major risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking to promote a healthier lifestyle, including healthy nutrition, exercise, and smoking cessation. If a patient develops morbidities that are risk factors, it is crucial to start medical management to control those risk factors. The strict management of risk factors helps to prevent recurrence or worsening functionality.
