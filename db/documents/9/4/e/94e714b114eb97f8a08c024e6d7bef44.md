The first step in a medication overdose is to immediately contact a poison control center for the appropriate management steps. Doses that exceed 60 mg of the IR (immediate-release) formulation or 120 mg of the ER (extended-release) formulation can be considered toxic. If the overdosed quantity is unknown, look for signs and symptoms such as tremors, hyperreflexia, convulsions, euphoria, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, flushing, and fever, in addition to the common adverse effects mentioned above. Supportive care with supplemental oxygen, IV fluids and external cooling methods is the mainstay of treatment. Multiple studies have shown that benzodiazepines are an option, especially if dystonia, agitation, or convulsions are present.
