Amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menarche in females of reproductive age. Primary amenorrhea is defined as the failure to reach menarche. Evaluation should be undertaken if there are no secondary sex characteristics by 13 years of age, if menarche has not occurred five years after initial breast development, or if the patient is 15 years or older. In contrast, secondary amenorrhea is defined as the cessation of previous menses for more than 6 months.
