As there are many different etiologies of torticollis, depending on the etiology of the condition, it may be necessary to obtain specialty consultation (physiotherapy, orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery, neurology, neurosurgery, otorhinolaryngology) for the treatment of these patients.

The outcomes depend on the cause. Recurrences are common with all treatments. Chronic torticollis leads to poor aesthetics and isolation. Thus, some of these patients may benefit from a mental health nurse consult.

In cases of torticollis, an interprofessional team approach to include physicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, physical therapists, and even chiropractors working collaboratively can achieve the best outcomes for the patient. [Level V]
