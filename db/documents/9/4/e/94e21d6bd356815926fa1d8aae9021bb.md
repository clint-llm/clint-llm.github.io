The arterial supply to the intestines consists of the SMA and the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The venous system parallels the arterial circulation (drains into the body’s portal venous system). The superior mesenteric artery supplies most of the small intestine, whereas the inferior mesenteric artery supplies the colon. The celiac artery (which mostly supplies the liver and spleen) provides collateral blood flow to the small and large intestines.

Mesenteric ischemia can be either acute or chronic and can be caused by arterial emboli, arterial thrombi, venous thrombi, or vasospasm of the mesenteric artery. No matter the etiology, ischemic injury occurs when there is not enough oxygen delivery required for cellular metabolism. However, intestinal injury occurs when there is tissue hypoxia, followed by reperfusion. Thus, mesenteric ischemia not only inflicts injury via hypoperfusion but through reperfusion as well. This multifactorial response, characterized by free radicals, toxic byproducts, and neutrophil activation results in multisystem failure.
