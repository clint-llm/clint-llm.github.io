- Roth spots although classically associated with infective endocarditis are a nonspecific ophthalmologic finding with multiple etiologies.

- Retinal vessel rupture with whole blood extravasation and fibrin plug development at the site of vessel rupture is the mechanism by which Roth spots occur.

- A thorough history and physical examination are paramount in diagnosing the underlying disease and guiding treatment in patients with Roth spots.

- If Roth spots are found on routine ophthalmologic examination referral to a primary care physician for evaluation and work-up of systemic disease is suggested.

- Identification of the underlying etiology is important in patients found to have Roth spots so that management can be guided to prevent any systemic or ocular complications that might occur.

- Roth spots are usually asymptomatic and resolve with treatment of the underlying condition.
