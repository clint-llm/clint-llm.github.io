The breach effect occurs due to an increase in the amplitude of alpha, beta, and mu rhythm activity over or near an area of a bony defect on the skull, usually post-surgical craniotomy site. Skullbone normally acts as a filter for brain electrical activity and attenuates the higher frequencies. An increase in amplitude and frequency of the breach effect is due to the decrease in electrical impedance caused by reduced filtering from the skull defect. Small skull defects, for example, a burr hole, is unlikely to produce a breach effect, as the field detected by each electrode is larger than the hole.

In certain cases like astrocytoma, there has been a case that reported either attenuation orÂ loss of the breach rhythm can be an initial sign of tumor progression.
