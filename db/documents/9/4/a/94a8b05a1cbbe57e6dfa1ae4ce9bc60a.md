**T****ype 1 respiratory failure:**

The distinguishing characteristic of Type 1 respiratory failure is a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) < 60 mmHg with a normal or decreased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2); Depending on the cause of hypoxemia, the alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient may be normal or increased. Formulas of the A-a gradient and alveolar gas equation are provided below, as these concepts are helpful in understanding the pathophysiology of respiratory failure.

A-a gradient:

- A-a gradient = PAO2 - PaO2, where

- PAO2 = Alveolar partial pressure of oxygen
- PaO2 = Arterial partial pressure of oxygen

Alveolar gas equation:

- PAO2 = FiO2 (PB - Pwater) - PaCO2/0.8, or PIo2= (PB - 47) × FIo2,

- PAO2 = Alveolar partial pressure of oxygen
- FiO2 = Fraction of inspired oxygen
- PB = Barometric (Atmospheric) pressure
- Pwater = Vapor pressure of water at body temperature (37°C)=47 mmHg
- PaCO2 = Partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide

Etiologies of Type 1 respiratory failure with normal A-a gradients include:

- **Alveolar hypoventilation:**Alveolar hypoventilation increases the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). The alveolar gas equation demonstrates that an increase in PaCO2 causes a decrease in the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PAO2). In this situation, the A-a gradient is normal, as the PAO2 and PaO2 decrease in equal magnitudes. When severe, alveolar hypoventilation may progress to Type 2 respiratory failure.

- **Low atmospheric pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen:**The alveolar gas equation demonstrates that the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PAO2) decreases with low atmospheric pressures (Patm) and with low levels of inspired oxygen (FiO2). In either situation, the A-a gradient remains normal, and the PaCO2 is decreased, given the response to hypoxia is hyperventilation. Clinically, this cause of respiratory failure occurs at high altitudes.

Etiologies of Type 1 respiratory failure with increased A-a gradients include:

- **Diffusion defect:**Gas exchange between the environment and the body occurs at the alveolar-capillary interface. Structural changes to the alveolar component of the alveolar-capillary interface, such as decreased surface area or increased thickness, may result in diffusion defects across the membrane. Additionally, reducing pulmonary capillary transit time through the alveolar-capillary interface may result in diffusion defects across the membrane. In either situation, hypercapnia does not occur, as carbon dioxide diffuses more readily across the alveolar-capillary membrane than oxygen.
- Emphysema
- Interstitial lung disease

- ****Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch:****The alveolar gas composition depends on the balance of alveolar ventilation and pulmonary capillary blood flow that occurs at the alveolar-capillary interface. When perfectly matched, the V/Q ratio is equal to one. When ventilation is excessive to perfusion, the V/Q ratio is greater than one; Dead space ventilation occurs when the V/Q ratio reaches infinity. When perfusion is excessive to ventilation, the V/Q ratio is less than one; Shunt occurs when the V/Q ratio reaches zero. In healthy subjects, however, the V/Q ratio is approximately 0.8, as the balance between ventilation and perfusion differs from the apex to the base of the lungs. V/Q mismatch is the most common cause of Type 1 respiratory failure.
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
- Congestive heart failure
- Pulmonary embolism

- ****Right-to-left shunt:****As discussed above, shunt occurs when the V/Q ratio reaches zero. The absence of gas exchange at the alveolar-capillary interface represents a true shunt and is analogous to intracardiac right-to-left shunting seen in atrial septal defect and patent foramen ovale. Unlike V/Q mismatch, true shunt does not improve with supplemental oxygen therapy.

- Severe pulmonary edema

**Type 2 Respiratory Failure**

Hypercapnic respiratory failure is defined as an increase in arterial carbon dioxide (CO2) (PaCO)> 45 mmHg with a pH < 7.35 due to respiratory pump failure and/or increased COproduction. In general, according to the modified alveolar ventilation equation, the PaCO2 level is proportionally related to the rate of CO2 production (VCO2) and inversely associated with the rate of CO2 elimination (i.e., alveolar ventilation) (PaCO2 =VCO2 /VA). The relationship between minute ventilation and CO2 production in response to exercise can be affected by age and pregnancy.

Alveolar ventilation (VA) is the product of minute ventilation (VE) and the ratio of dead space (VD) to tidal volume (Vt) (VA = VE x [1 - VD/Vt]). While decreased VA is the most common reason for the respiratory failure of hypercapnia, increased CO2 production is a very rare reason. Depending on the cause of respiratory failure, the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) may be normal or decreased. The two main paradigms responsible for hypercapnia respiratory failure are either manifested by "won't breathe" due to a central drive issue or "can't breathe" as a result of a peripheral neuromuscular defect, resistive loading (narrow airway) or restrictive defect that lead to hypoventilation and hypercapnia.

**Respiratory pump failure:**The respiratory pump is comprised of the chest wall, the pulmonary parenchyma, the muscles of respiration, as well as the central and peripheral nervous systems. The inability to ventilate can occur if any of the components mentioned above of the respiratory pump fails.

- Decreased central dive: Sedatives (i.e., alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opiates) and diseases of the central nervous system (i.e., encephalitis, stroke, tumor, and SCI) may impair the respiratory drive, resulting in hypoventilation.
- Altered neural and neuromuscular transmission: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, botulism, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia graves, organophosphate poisoning, poliomyelitis, spinal cord injury (SCI), tetanus, and transverse myelitis may impair the function of the respiratory pump, resulting in hypoventilation.
- Chest wall and pleural disorders: Flail chest, kyphoscoliosis, hyperinflation, large pleural effusions, obesity, and thoracoplasty may impair the function of the respiratory pump, resulting in hypoventilation.
- Dead space ventilation: Conditions that increase the V/Q ratio, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, emphysema, and pulmonary embolism, can result in hypoventilation. Hypoventilation typically occurs once dead space ventilation exceeds 50% of total ventilation.
- Muscle abnormalities: Diaphragmatic paralysis, diffuse atrophy, muscular dystrophy, and ruptured diaphragm may impair the function of the respiratory pump, resulting in hypoventilation.

**Increased dead space:**Dead space (VD) refers to areas of the lung that are not anatomically or physiologically able to exchange gas. Tachypnea can contribute to high CO2 by increasing the dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/Vt). High alveolar VA and the associated ventilation-perfusion mismatch are considered one of the main mechanisms for developing hypercapnia in individuals with COPD.

**Increased CO production:**CO2 is a by-product of oxidative metabolism, and high CO2 production may occur due to fever, exercise, hyperalimentation, sepsis, and thyrotoxicosis. High C2Oproduction becomes pathologic if the compensatory increase in minute ventilation mechanism fails.
