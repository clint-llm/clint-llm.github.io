Phenazopyridine is an azo dye first synthesized in 1914 and adopted by the U.S. Pharmacopoeia in 1928. Phenazopyridine is used as an adjuvant medicine to treat the discomfort, urgency, and frequency associated with lower urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is commonly used and available medication over the counter (OTC) and with a prescription. Phenazopyridine is compatible with concurrent antibiotic therapy, and its analgesic properties should improve the patientâ€™s comfort until antibiotics can control the infection. This activity reviews the use, mechanism of action, adverse effects, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) of phenazopyridine pertinent for members of the healthcare team in the management of patients with UTI and related conditions. In this article, a UTI will refer to an infection of the lower urinary tract, the bladder (cystitis), and the urethra.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of phenazopyridine.

- Review the indications for phenazopyridine use.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of phenazopyridine.
- Summarize the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes when phenazopyridine is administered in UTIs and related conditions.
