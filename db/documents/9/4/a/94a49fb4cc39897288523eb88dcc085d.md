The cause of hypotonic labor is uterine inertia, also known as hypotonic or hypocontractile uterine dysfunction. Though the etiology of the inertia is unknown, these conditions are commonly associated with hypocontractile uterine dysfunction:

- Uterine overdistension and overuse as seen in multifetal gestation, fetal macrosomia, polyhydramnios and grand-multiparity

- Mechanical disruption of myometrial function from myoma or distension of the bladder or bowel

- Malpositioning and malpresentation of the fetus, where there is absent reflex in uterine contraction, due to inadequate contact of the presenting part onto the lower uterine segment

- Abnormal uterine axis as seen in a pendulous abdomen.Â There is an exaggerated anteversion of the uterus.

- Uterine deformities or myometrial disorganization as seen with developmental uterine hypoplasia and extensive myomectomy

- Prematurity below 30weeks gestation where oxytocin receptors are not fairly established

- Other general/systemic causes may include maternal anemia, maternal exhaustion, and improper use of analgesia in labor.
