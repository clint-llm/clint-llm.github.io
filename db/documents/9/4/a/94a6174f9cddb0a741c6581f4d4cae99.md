- Eyes: Commonly reddened, irritated, and tearing. Vision may be blurry.

- Mouth/throat: Irritation is normal to the examiner. Absent other caustic ingestants, the mouth, and throat are resistant to damage.

- Skin: Mild irritation may be evident. Do not let the patient spread the chemicals.

- Stomach/GI tract: These are rare symptoms. The GI tract is resistant and resilient.

- Respiratory: Irritation, including bronchospasm, can occur. This does not apply to chlorine gas exposure, a much more severe problem. Exposure to chlorine gas can be fatal.
