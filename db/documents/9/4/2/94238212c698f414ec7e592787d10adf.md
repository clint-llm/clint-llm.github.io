The PNET terminology has been removed from the CNS tumors with the new 2016 WHO revised classification. They were aggressive tumors from poorly differentiated embryonic cells in young children, but on rare occasions affecting adolescents and adults.

Tumors are now classified according to their molecular characteristics. Embryonal tumors are primarily classified depending if they have on chromosome 19 an amplification of the C19MC region (19q13.42). Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor tumors have an alteration of INI1 or, on rare occasions, BRG1. Other embryonal tumors have FOXR2 activation, CIC alteration, MN1 alteration, and BCOR alteration. The SMARCB1 (also known as INI1, BAF47, hSNF5,) located on chromosome 22 at locus 22q11.2 is important for the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex.

Those embryonal tumors that no amplification of the C19MC, no alterations of INI1 or BRG1, or no rosettes are identified, are called embryonal tumor, NOS (WHO 9473/3). At present, there are no molecular or genetic alterations associated with them. These embryonal tumors have to be well investigated. This is an exclusion diagnosis. They have to be differentiated from supratentorial ependymoma, high-grade glioma, embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes, and ATRT based on their specific genetic alterations.
