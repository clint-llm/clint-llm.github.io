Other than the presenting symptoms of pain, rash, facial paralysis, dysgeusia, hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, hoarseness, dysarthria, and others mentioned above, short-term complications of Ramsay Hunt syndrome include corneal abrasion and exposure keratopathy, depression and social anxiety, and transmission of chickenpox to unvaccinated or immunocompromised close contacts. While long-term flaccid paralysis is unlikely, the development of synkinesis is very common. Other long-term complications includeÂ postherpetic neuralgia, scarring from the vesicles, and persistent depression and/or social anxiety due to loss of facial function.
