Gastrin is primarily involved in the upper GI tract, specifically the stomach, and to a lesser degree, the duodenum and the pancreas. Gastrin primarily affects the ECL cells and parietal cells of the gastric fundus and cardia. Gastrin's role also affects the immune system via poorly understood mechanisms involving the CCKB receptor on monocytes, lymphocytes, and mast cells.
