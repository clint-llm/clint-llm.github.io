Epithelial downgrowth is a rare, but vision-threatening, complication of penetrating ocular trauma or intraocular surgery. In this disease, epithelial cells enter the anterior chamber and proliferate into intraocular structures. Stratified squamous epithelium is not normally present in the interior of the eye but can grow into nearly any intraocular structure. Epithelialization can appear in three forms: pearls, cysts, and sheets.

This article presents a brief overview of the etiology, pathophysiology, and risk factors for epithelial downgrowth with a broader discussion of the many diagnostic and therapeutic options, along with the advantages and disadvantages of each. Of note, the terms epithelial downgrowth and epithelial ingrowth are sometimes used interchangeably in the literature. However, this article will not discuss epithelial ingrowth that occurs after procedures such as LASIK where there is ingrowth of epithelium into the corneal flap interface.

Epithelial downgrowth should also be distinguished from fibrous downgrowth. These two conditions are quite similar in terms of etiology, risk factors, and complications and are often managed the same way. However, there are subtle but important differences between the two that will be further discussed in the “Differential Diagnosis” section.
