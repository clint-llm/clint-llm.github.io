Cardiac catheterization remains the gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension, assessing disease severity, and determining prognosis and response to therapy. By directly measuring pressures, cardiac output, right heart catheterization allows for the determination of multiple prognostic markers such as right atrial pressure, cardiac output, cardiac power output, cardiac index, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery pulsatility index, right atrial: pulmonary capillary wedge ratio, etc.
