In almost all heart diseases, due to the high incidence and complexity, VPCs can be the major cause of mortality in coronary artery disease and dilated cardiomyopathy. According to the MRIFT and Framingham Heart Study, frequent occurrence of VPCs correlates with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.

The benign premature ventricular contractions that occur occasionally do not interfere with the average lifespan, but their frequent occurrence implies an ominous prognosis. The patients post-MI with frequent VPCs are prone to sudden cardiac death. However, patients treated either with medication or catheter ablation therapy can improve and recover from the LV dysfunction.

The characteristics of VPCs that confer poor prognosis include:

- An "arrhythmic burden" with VPCs more than 500 in 24 hours on Holter monitoring

- VPCs morphologies with LBBB or RBBB

- VPCs with intermediate or superior axis and wide QRS complexes

- Short-coupled VPCs

- VPCs superimposed on preceding T-waves

- VPCs induced by adrenergic stimulation
