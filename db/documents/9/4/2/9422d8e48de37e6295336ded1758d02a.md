CHARGE syndrome patients need careful medical as well as surgical management strategies. Management is dependent on timing, features, and severity of the presentation. The most common neonatal emergencies in CHARGE syndrome include cyanosis due to congenital heart defects, or bilateral posterior choanal atresia, less likely due to trachea-esophageal fistula.

- Therefore, all patients suspected of having CHARGE syndrome should have a cardiology consultation. If the infant has patent ductus arteriosus and limited pulmonary blood flow, prostaglandin should be given to maintain ductal patency.

- Some cases require tracheostomy to manage chronic airway difficulties, aspiration, or gastroesophageal reflux disease. Children with CHARGE syndrome need extensive medical management of their feeding difficulties, regularly needing jejunostomy or gastrostomy feeding tubes.

- In children with CHARGE syndrome, intubation may be very difficult. Hence, a pediatric otolaryngologist or anesthesiologist should be present for planned surgical procedures.

- In patients with facial palsy, corneal scarring can be prevented by using artificial tears. Hearing aids should be used as quickly as hearing loss is recognized with regular followup.

- Regular remolding of the earpieces is required as the ear canals can be tiny initially, and ear cartilage may be inadequate to support a hearing aid. Cochlear implantations have been efficaciously done in CHARGE syndrome patients.

- For endocrine issues, sex steroid therapy must be used for the descent of testes and penile growth in males with CHARGE syndrome. Testosterone is given for incomplete and delayed male puberty during adolescence. Females are given hormone replacement therapy if indicated at puberty. The use of sex hormone replacement can prevent osteoporosis.

- Assessment for cleft palate, together with submucous cleft palate and surgical correction at the appropriate age, must be done by an oral maxillofacial surgeon.

- Physical examination to evaluate the integrity of the cranial nerve in patients presenting with facial palsy.

- Ongoing and regular consultation with a genetic counselor or geneticist is recommended.
