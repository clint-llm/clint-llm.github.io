Neonatal lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that takes place due to the passive maternal transfer of autoantibodies of Sjogren syndrome autoantigen type A (Ro/SSA) or B (La/SSB) to the fetus. The incidence of neonatal lupus erythematosus approximates to 2% in offspring of mothers with autoantibodies of Sjogren syndrome autoantigen type A (Ro/SSA) or B (La/SSB) with an 18 to 20 percent recurrence rate in subsequent pregnancies. Neonatal lupus erythematosus causes 80 to 95 percent of the cases of severe atrioventricular block in the neonatal period (younger than 28 days of life); after this period it is a less frequent cause of AV block (5 percent of cases). This activity describes the monitoring, evaluation, diagnosis, and management of neonatal lupus erythematosus and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients and their families.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of neonatal lupus erythematosus.
- Describe the evaluation of neonatal lupus erythematosus.
- Review the treatment and management options available for neonatal lupus erythematosus.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance prevention and treatment of neonatal lupus erythematosus and improve outcomes.
