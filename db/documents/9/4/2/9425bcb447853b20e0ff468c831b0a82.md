Management of hemochromatosis needs an interprofessional effort from health care providers, including the patient's primary care providers, gastroenterologists, and hepatologists. Patients should be referred to consultants for managing complications like endocrinologists, orthopedics, and cardiologists if complications arise from progressive iron overload. Nurses should educate patients that alcohol should be strictly prohibited in this condition because it can accelerate liver and pancreatic toxicity. Genetic counseling may be required in some patients.
