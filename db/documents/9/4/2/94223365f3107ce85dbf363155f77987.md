Esmolol (esmolol hydrochloride) is an intravenous cardioselective beta-1 adrenergic antagonist. Esmolol is used in various settings, including urgent care, perioperatively, and postoperatively. It is indicated in sinus tachycardia, where a rapid rate requires intervention secondary to other comorbidities. Esmolol is FDA-approved for tachycardia and hypertension induced by intubation. It is off-labeled for rate and rhythm control in aortic dissection, acute coronary syndrome, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, hypertensive emergencies, thyrotoxicosis, refractory ventricular tachycardia, refractory to defibrillation ventricular fibrillation, and to decrease catecholamine response during electroconvulsive therapy. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse events, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of esmolol, pertinent for interprofessional team members in treating patients with tachycardia and other related conditions where esmolol will provide a benefit.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of esmolol.
- Summarize the indications for using esmolol.
- Review the potential adverse effects of esmolol.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients when using esmolol.
