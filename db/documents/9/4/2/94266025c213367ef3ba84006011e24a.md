Plain radiographic images are the imaging modality of choice in the diagnosis of KohlerÂ disease. The navicular will appear wafer-thin with bony collapse. The bone will appear fragmented with a loss of a trabecular pattern. There will be patchy sclerosis of the bone and increased radiodensity. Soft tissue swelling around the affected navicular bone can also be seen on plain radiographs. Advanced imaging such as CT and MRI are not required for diagnosis, although they may become necessary if the patient's symptoms do not improve with treatment. While navicular sclerosis may be consistent with a normal variant in asymptomatic patients, it is important to correlate radiographic findings with clinical suspicions.

Basic labs, such as a complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are needed in cases in which an infection is suspected. If any of these are elevated, further diagnostic testing is warranted.
