Education on occupational safety and health is a recommendation for those working in industries that use CCl4 for industrial applications.

Alcoholic patients who survive CCl4 toxicity should receive education about the synergistic effect of ethanol on the hepatic toxicity caused by CCl4. The clinician should advise such patients to stop alcohol intake for at least three months after discharge from the hospital.
