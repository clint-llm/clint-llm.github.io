Inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO) describes a narrowing or inappropriate obstruction of the true vocal fold and/or the supraglottic structures in response to a trigger or stimulus. When this phenomenon occurs during exercise, it is referred to as exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction (EILO). The ILO terminology has been recently adopted. Since 2013, the term inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO) has been used to describe "inducible laryngeal obstructions causing breathing problems. This activity illustrates the pathophysiology and presentation of exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction and reviews evaluation and management by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction.

- Review the different presentations of exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction.
- Identify patient groups at risk for exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among an interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction.
