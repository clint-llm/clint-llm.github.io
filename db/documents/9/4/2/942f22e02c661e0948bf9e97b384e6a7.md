The evaluation for Crouzon syndrome is relatively straightforward in the setting of known family history as the characteristic physical examination findings confirm the diagnosis. However, in cases where there is a spontaneous mutation, and the clinical presentation is not clear initially, these patients may require genetic testing for diagnosis. Additional tests in these situations may include imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the brain to detect craniosynostosis or other skeletal abnormalities. The most common imaging findings on X-ray-based techniques are perisutural sclerosis, reduced serration, and bony bridging and/or the absence of the suture altogether.

If the history, physical, and imaging are still not conclusive, molecular testing can be pursued. Unfortunately, multiple craniosynostosis syndromes have a defect in one of the FGFRs; therefore, there is some overlap even in their molecular pathophysiology.

While not all required, the combination of detailed family history, specific physical examination findings, the use of various imaging modalities, and genetic testing help differentiate the spectrum of craniosynostosis syndromes (Pfeiffer, Apert, Saethre-Chotzen, Carpenter, and Jackson-Weiss syndromes) in which signs and symptoms can have significant overlap.
