Posterior urethral valves are a congenital malformation, yet there remains debate regarding their precise embryological origin. There is no consensus regarding the origin of posterior urethral valves. Early theories attributed posterior urethral valves to the persistent attachment of the verumontanum to the roof of the urethra or a persistent urogenital membrane. A study by Stephens in 1955 using voiding cystourethrography, as well as microscopic and macroscopic analysis, lead to the hypothesis that posterior urethral valves are formed due to the failure of the Wolffian ducts to properly integrate into the urethra resulting in a membrane which obstructs the lower urinary tract.

The lack of microscopic analysis of specimens with posterior urethral valves is a significant limitation in this study. The work by Dewan in the 1990s may unify some of these discrepancies with their “COPUM” and “Cobbs Collar” theories. They concluded that Cobbs collar type malformation is due to the persistence of the urogenital membrane, and COPUM was caused by the attachment of the verumontanum to the urethra’s roof.
