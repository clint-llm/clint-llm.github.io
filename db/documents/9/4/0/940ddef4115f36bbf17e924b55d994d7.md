The recommended monitoring of methocarbamol is to evaluate the clinical response and mitigate risk for the emergence of adverse effects. There is no need to check blood chemistry in follow-up, nor blood levels of the drug. Specific populations at risk for toxicity include those on multiple CNS depressants, patients with cirrhosis, renal impairment, substance use disorders, and, most importantly, the elderly.
