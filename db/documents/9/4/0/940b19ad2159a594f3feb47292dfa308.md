Dysphagia is defined as objective impairment or difficulty in swallowing, resulting in an abnormal delay in the transit of a liquid or solid bolus. The delay may be during the oropharyngeal or esophageal phase of swallowing. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of oropharyngeal and esophageal dysphagia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with dysphagia.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of oropharyngeal and esophageal dysphagia.
- Describe clinical approaches for the diagnosis of dysphagia.

- Outline current management options used in dysphagia.
- Review the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with dysphagia.
