Cooperation betweenÂ pediatricians, general practitioners (including mid-level practitioners), and ophthalmology specialists is fundamental for the early interception of cases of congenital lacrimal fistula. Surgery may require other professionals to join the multispecialty teams, including maxillofacial and ENT surgeons, especially when a dacryocystorhinostomy is considered. Interprofessional communication and care coordination between health figures, especially for the pediatric age or for complex syndromic cases, should be enhanced for the improved management of the patient.
