Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare autoimmune condition which presents as recurrent episodes of cartilaginous inflammation of the auricular, nasal and tracheal cartilage. Jaksh-Wartenhorst described the first case in 1923. A 32-year-old patient presented with fever, pain, and swelling of the ears and later developed stenosis of external auditory canal and saddle nose deformity. A biopsy of the nasal cartilage showed the absence of cartilage. The term relapsing polychondritis was coined by Pearson and his coworkers in 1960. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology and presentation of relapsing polychondritis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of relapsing polychondritis.
- Review the presentation of relapsing polychondritis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for relapsing polychondritis.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with relapsing polychondritis.
