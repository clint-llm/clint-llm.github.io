The management of dermatitis herpetiformis is complex and requires an interprofessional team that includes a dermatologist, dietitian, gastroenterologist, nurse practitioner and a neurologist.

The cornerstone of long-term dermatitis herpetiformis management is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. Not only does this improve skin changes over time, but it is also essential in the management of associated GSE. Patients are best managed in consultation with an experienced dietitian who will be able to provide appropriate support, as maintenance of a strict gluten-free diet can be challenging. For patients who adhere to the dietary restriction, the prognosis is good but will still be marked by multiple relapses and remissions. For those who do not adhere to the diet the prognosis is poor and the quality of life is abysmal.
