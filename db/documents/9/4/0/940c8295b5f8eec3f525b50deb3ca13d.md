As with the etiology, the pathophysiology of BD is unknown and is thought to involve interactions between multiple genetic, neurochemical, and environmental factors. A recent neurobiology review article discusses in detail the “genetic components, signaling pathways, biochemical changes, and neuroimaging findings” in BD.

Evidence supports a strong genetic component and an epigenetic contribution. Human studies have shown changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) in patients with BD, indicating neurotrophic signaling is a molecular mechanism associated with decreased neuroplasticity. Other proposed mechanisms include mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, immune-inflammatory imbalance, and compromised hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Additionally, neuroimaging studies have shown “evidence of change in regional activity, functional connectivity, neuronal activity, and bioenergetics associated with BD,” and anatomic studies have revealed dendritic spine loss in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the post-mortem brain tissue of patients with BD.

As mentioned, imbalances in systems associated with monoaminergic neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine and serotonin, and intracellular signaling systems that regulate mood are thought to be involved. However, no singular dysfunction of these neurotransmitter systems has been identified.
