- Evaluate the need for MAST by assessing injuries and obtaining vital signs.

- Unfold MAST and lay it flat on a backboard or stretcher before moving the patient.

- Perform a secondary survey to identify injuries that the device will be covering, dressing wounds as necessary. Remove all clothing and foreign objects as these will be pressed into the patient’s skin by the device.

- While maintaining immobility of the spine, place the patient on the MAST device so that the top of the garment is approximately 1 inch inferior to the costal margin.

- Secure and fasten the leg sections. Ensure all creases are removed.

- Secure and fasten the abdominal section (unless contraindicated). Ensure all creases are removed and that the garment has not changed position relative to the patient’s chest wall.

- Attach the pump and check all valves for closure.

- Inflate leg compartments.

- Re-assess the patient and obtain repeat vital signs.

- If the patient’s systolic blood pressure is between 100 to 110 mm Hg, ensure valves are closed and continue to monitor the patient’s blood pressure. Do not attempt to increase the systolic blood pressure beyond 110 mm Hg.

- If the patient’s systolic blood pressure is not between 100 to 110 mm Hg, inflate the abdominal compartment (unless contraindicated).

- Continue monitoring the patient's systolic blood pressure, adding air to the device as needed to maintain a systolic blood pressure between 100 to 110 mm Hg.

- Remove MAST only when the patient has been adequately resuscitated and under the direction of a physician in a controlled setting.
