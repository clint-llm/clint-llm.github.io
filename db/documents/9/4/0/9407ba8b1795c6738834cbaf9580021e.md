In addition to proper diagnosis, it is important to consider the contra-indications, both relative and absolute. It is helpful to think of relative contra-indications as those that will not result in severe debility/disability if the manipulation occurs. Relative contraindications (to HVLA in general) include acute whiplash, pregnancy, post-surgical, herniated disc, anticoagulation use/hemophilia, tense or malingering patient, female patients who smoke or use oral contraceptive pills (increased risk of thrombus), atherosclerosis, or vertebral artery ischemia.

Relative contra-indications would necessitate a discussion with the patient about the possible risks and benefits before the treatment application to inform them of specific risks associated with each condition. Absolute contraindications include osteoporosis, osteomyelitis, fractures in the area of thrusting, boney metastasis, severe rheumatoid arthritis (especially true in cervical HVLA), cauda equina/conus medularis syndrome (or symptoms of numbness/weakness suggestive of these diagnoses), fused spinal joints, osteomyelitis, joint instability, DownÂ syndrome (also especially true in cervical spine manipulation), and patient refusal. Typically, the presence of an absolute contraindication excludes HVLA, as the risks would heavily outweigh any benefit.
