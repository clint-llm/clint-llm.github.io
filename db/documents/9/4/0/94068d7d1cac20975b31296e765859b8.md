The true etiology of cerebral salt wasting (CSW) remains an area of debate and research. As noted, some argue cerebral salt wasting does not exist and is a form of SIADH.

There are two current theories for the etiology of cerebral salt wasting: the effect of a circulating factor or sympathetic nervous system dysfunction.

Some research points to the brain releasing brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) after injury, which then enters systemic circulation through a disrupted blood-brain barrier. The BNP acts on the collecting ducts of the renal tubules to inhibit sodium reabsorption as well as decrease the release of renin.

The second theory suggests that an injured sympathetic nervous system can no longer promote sodium reabsorption and stimulate renin release due to injury to the hypothalamus. The exact mechanism of cerebral salt wasting remains open to debate.
