There are three intercostal muscles; externally intercostal, internal intercostal and innermost intercostal muscles. These muscles are present in the intercostal spaces and the intercostal nerves and blood vessels run between them. The most superficial layer is the external intercostal muscle. The external intercostal muscles extend posteriorly from the rib tubercle to the costochondral junction anteriorly where the anterior (external) intercostal membrane takes the place of the muscle fibers.

The internal intercostal muscle forms the intermediate layer. This muscle extends anteriorly from the sternum to the rib cage posteriorly where the muscle fibers are replaced the posterior (internal) intercostal membrane. The innermost intercostal muscle forms the deepest layer and is lined internally by the endothoracic fascia, which in turn is lined internally by the parietal pleura.
