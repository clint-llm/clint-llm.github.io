InterprofessionalÂ teamwork is essential for both the diagnosis and treatment of trochanteric bursitis. This interprofessional team can include clinicians (MDs, DOs, NOs, or PAs), orthopedic specialists, chiropractors, physical therapists, and nurses. All team members should maintain open communication lines with the other caregivers involved in the case and maintain updated and accurate records of all patient interactions, interventions, and status changes. This communication is crucial to the successful diagnosis and management of these patients. The interprofessional case model will drive optimal patient results. [Level 5]

Primary care clinicians should be educated in the diagnosis and treatment as they are often the first to encounter patients with trochanteric bursitis and can prevent the increased healthcare costs associated with specialist consultation. For most patients, the outcomes are excellent, but recovery may take a few weeks.
