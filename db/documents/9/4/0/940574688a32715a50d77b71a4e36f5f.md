The Berg Balance Scale is a testing tool with high validity and reliability used to measure balance. Balance gives an individual the ability to achieve physical movement and further carry out the activities of daily living. Balance can be classified as either static or dynamic. It was first created to be used in elderly individuals; however, it has been used in other individuals, such as amputees and persons with neurological conditions as Parkinson disease and strokes. This scale has also been used to assess the risk of falls and predict the length of stay during inpatient rehabilitation.
