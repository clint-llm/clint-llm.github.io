After a CVC placement, nurses are charged with maintaining, monitoring, and utilizing central venous catheters. The bedside nurse must be adept at recognizing complications such as infections, hematoma, thrombosis of the catheter, and signs of pneumothorax and bleeding. Nurses are also responsible for ensuring that the site is maintained in a clean and sterile fashion. Beyond the immediate complications of the procedure itself, nursing must be immediately aware of any ongoing issues and delayed complications. Their role in the interprofessional team is of monumental importance in maintaining the central venous catheter and recognizing potential complications.

Clear communication between all team members is essential to appropriate patient care.
