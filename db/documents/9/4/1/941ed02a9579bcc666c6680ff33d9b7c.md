The cause of the majority of T-cell Lymphoma remains unexplained. CTCL is considered to arise secondary to dysregulation of genes (cancer-testis genes and B lymphoid tyrosine kinase) and signaling pathways(Jak-3/STAT and NOTCH1). There have been reports suggesting an association between chronic cutaneous inflammation (e.g.: chronic urticaria, chemical exposure) and CTCL development.

Infectious etiology has also been considered for both CTCL and PTCL, which include bacterial (staphylococcal enterotoxin) and viral association (retrovirus-like Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)1 and HTLV2, HIV, EBV, CMV, HHV8), with a specific association of HTLV1 with adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia and EBV with Natural-killer cell/T-cell lymphoma, and AITL.
