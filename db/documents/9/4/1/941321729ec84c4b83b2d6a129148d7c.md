Extensive research has demonstrated the importance of family dynamics to health, illness, and recovery outcomes. However, there is little scholarly consensus on the exact definition of family and family dynamics. For example, several studies of patients receiving treatment for mental illness have defined family strictly as the patientâ€™s parents.

The lack of clarity on who should qualify as a family member makes it challenging to analyze the role of family dynamics in health outcomes. As a result, it is often too difficult to develop positive interventions. To introduce more consistency in future studies, some researchers have called for the establishment of a more precise definition and a classification scheme for identifying the members of a family unit.

One classification scheme proposes seven clearly defined family types: proton, electron, nuclear, atom, molecular, joint, and quasi-family.
