Thiamine, or vitamin B1, was the first vitamin to be identified. It functions as a catalyst in the generation of energy through decarboxylation of branched-chain amino acids and alpha-ketoacids and acts as a coenzyme for transketolase reactions in the form of thiamine pyrophosphate. Thiamine also plays an unidentified role in propagating nerve impulses and taking part in myelin sheath maintenance. This activity reviews the causes of thiamine deficiency, the associated pathophysiology, and typical patient presentation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of thiamine deficiency.
- Outline the causes of thiamine deficiency.
- Summarize the presentation of a patient with thiamine deficiency.
- Explain strategies to optimize care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by thiamine deficiency.
