Without prompt diagnosis and treatment, cellulitis could lead to several complications. If the bacterial infection reaches the bloodstream, it could lead to bacteremia. Bacteremia is diagnosable by obtaining blood cultures in patients who exhibit systemic symptoms. The clinician should obtain identification and susceptibilities from the blood cultures and tailor antibiotics accordingly.

Patients who have cellulitis along with two or more SIRS criteria (fever over 100.4 degrees F, tachypnea, tachycardia, or abnormal white cell count) get diagnosed with sepsis. If cellulitis moves from the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue to the bone, it can lead to osteomyelitis.

Cellulitis that leads to bacteremia, endocarditis, or osteomyelitis will require a longer duration of antibiotics and possibly surgery.
