N. meningitidis was estimated to be responsible for 1.2 million cases of infection per year, as well as approximately 135,000 deaths worldwide.

Furthermore, the serogroups causing meningococcal disease vary geographically. Meningococcus serogroup A predominates in Africa and regions of Asia, whereas serogroups B, C, and Y predominate in other areas, including North America and Europe.

Between 2006 and 2015:

- Annual incidence changed from 0.40 cases to 0.14 cases per 100,000.

- For serogroup B infection, incidence changed from 0.25 to 0.05 cases per 100,000.

- For serogroup C infection, incidence changed from 0.38 to 0.01 cases per 100,000.

- For serogroup Y infection, incidence changed from 0.42 to .02 cases per 100,000.

- Besides those serogroups, the incidence of infection from other serogroups remained constant.

The incidence of infection in the male population is slightly higher than females. Among races, the incidence rate in African-Americans is found to be 0.27 cases per 100,000, whereas the incidence rate of infection in other races is 0.20 cases per 100,000. Despite medical advancements in the prevention of this disease, mortality rates remain in a range between 5% and 15% for those treated, and as high as 50% in those without treatment.
