A thorough differential list is important in considering a diagnosis of sciatica and should include.

- Herniated lumbosacral disc

- Muscle spasm

- Nerve root impingement

- Epidural abscess

- Epidural hematoma

- Tumor

- Potts Disease, also known as spinal tuberculosis

- Piriformis syndrome

**Piriformis Syndrome**

Piriformis syndrome is a specific condition of special mention as it is often misdiagnosed and unrecognized. The piriformis muscle connects the sacral spine to the upper portions of the femur and aids in hip extension and leg rotation. Due to the proximity of the sciatic nerve, any injury or inflammation to the piriformis muscle can cause "sciatica symptoms." Often overuse injuries, particularly in runners or other endurance athletes, cause inflammation of the piriformis muscle, and the ensuing symptoms mimic sciatica. Therefore, these patients tend to have increased pain from applying direct pressure to the piriformis muscle, increased pain when walking up inclines or stairs, and decreased range of motion of the hip joint. Piriformis-specific stretches, as well as hamstring stretches, are helpful to release this muscle tension and to treat this painful condition. Lumbar and sacroiliac manipulation may also prove beneficial for some patients.
