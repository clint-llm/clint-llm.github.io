Non-pharmacological treatment includes smoking cessation to prevent recurrent symptoms.

Pharmacological management depends on the presentation and the EKG changes. Nitrates will help in reducing symptoms, but coronary angiography should be done to rule out active coronary lesions. If coronaries are normal, long-acting nitrate with or without calcium channel blocker will improve the symptoms. In acute attacks, sublingual nitrates can also be used to get an immediate effect. Calcium channel blockers have vasodilating properties and can be used to prevent recurrent attacks. The dose should be gradually increased to reach the maximal tolerable dose. Beta-blockers should be avoided as it increases the risk of spasm, but if the patient has left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, then beta-blocker will need to be instituted considering the associated mortality benefit. ICD should also be a consideration in patients for secondary prevention.
