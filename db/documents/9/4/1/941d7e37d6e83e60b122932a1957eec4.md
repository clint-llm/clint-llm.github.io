Though the dive reflex is a remarkable physiological adaptation that has been studied and cited throughout scientific literature, there is a more serious medical syndrome potentially associated with it.Â  The mechanism of the dive response is one of the most frequently considered reflex-etiologies related to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

Several studies suggest that diving reflex hyperreactivity could potentially be the principal cause of SIDS due to its ability to trigger bradycardia and apnea.
