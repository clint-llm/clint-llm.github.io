To use Wood's lamp, the skin to be examined should not be recently washed; it must be free of makeup, deodorant, moisturizing cream, or any other topical lotion. These topical liquids can cause a false positive test. Turn on the Wood's lamp for about 60 seconds, and the room must be dark. Then examine the skin with Wood's lamp for a few seconds. The lamp is usually held 10-30 cm away from the skin and does not emit heat. The exam is painless.
