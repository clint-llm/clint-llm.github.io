Rib fractures can be diagnosed clinically based upon history and physical exam without imaging. Dedicated rib x-ray series are typically not necessary due to the benign clinical course of isolated rib fractures. If there is suspicion for multiple rib fractures or significant trauma with underlying organ damage, imaging can be the next step. However, chest radiographs are limited and can only diagnose about 50% of isolated rib fractures.
