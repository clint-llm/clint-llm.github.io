Ideally, rickets is treated with a multidisciplinary approach. The treated team ideally should consist of a primary care physician (pediatrician), registered dietitian, and pediatric endocrinologist. Radiologists help in the interpretation of rachitic radiographic features from other conditions. Referral to an orthopedic surgeon may be needed to treat the deformities. Additionally, in genetic cases of rickets, referral to a geneticist in providing genetic counseling for the family. Consultation with a pediatric nephrologist and/or metabolic bone specialist is helpful in genetic conditions. The role of pharmacists is indispensable in helping clinicians in administering medications.
