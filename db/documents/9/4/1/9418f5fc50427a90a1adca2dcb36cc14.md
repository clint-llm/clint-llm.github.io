Maternal education and early in utero diagnosis is very important in diagnosing a child with a TORCH infection.  Early intervention may allow for the treatment during pregnancy (toxoplasmosis and syphilis) or prophylaxis at delivery (HSV) to help eliminate risk to the newborn.  Regular prenatal care and maternal health are key elements for any pregnancy.  All women of childbearing age should ensure that they have their immunizations up to date as this can prevent any possibility of congenital rubella syndrome.

Safe sexual practices can help eliminate the risk of the acquisition of syphilis, HIV, and HSV during pregnancy.  Expectant mothers who have a febrile illness during pregnancy should be sure to report that illness to their physicians.  Safe eating practices such as the avoidance of processed foods (deli meats) and eating thoroughly cooked foods can help prevent the transmission of toxoplasmosis.  Similarly, expectant mothers should refrain from cleaning the cat litter boxes during pregnancy to prevent the transmission of toxoplasmosis.
