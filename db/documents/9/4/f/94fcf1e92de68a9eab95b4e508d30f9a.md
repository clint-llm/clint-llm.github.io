Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in men and women in the United States and the leading cause of cancer death. The current surgical guidelines for lung cancer call for lobectomy as the minimal resection for most stages. However, certain patients cannot tolerate that level of lung volume reduction and may undergo segmental lung resection. There is also ongoing interest and investigation into segmental lung resection as the first-line surgical approach to early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.
