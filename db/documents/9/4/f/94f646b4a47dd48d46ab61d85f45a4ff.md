In summary, UVFP is a common disorder presented to the otolaryngologist and other medical practitioners. If identified, imaging from the skull-base superiorly to the aortic arch inferiorly is necessary to evaluate the full course of the RLN. Chest x-ray, CT scans, or MRI scans are often used. Treatment plans will vary depending on the patient and injury, but options are generally focused on airway protection and improving dysphonia. Techniques and surgical procedures that should be considered are speech and swallow therapy, injection augmentation, medialization laryngoplasty (laryngeal framework surgery), and arytenoid adduction.
