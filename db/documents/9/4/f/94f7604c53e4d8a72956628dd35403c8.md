Histopathological examination of nails is important to rule out other more common causes of yellow nails, such as onychomycosis. The appearance of nails in YNS is varied. Changes include a thickened nail plate with exaggerated curvature, xanthonychia (yellow discoloration), scleronychia (hardening of the nail), onycholysis (separation of the nail plate and nail bed), and slow growth.

When a pleural effusion is present, thoracentesis and examination of the fluid typically reveal a serous exudative effusion.
