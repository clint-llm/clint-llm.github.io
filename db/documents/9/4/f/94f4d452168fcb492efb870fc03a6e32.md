Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a mild clinical syndrome and will resolve within 7 to 10 days. Treatment is primarily supportive. Pain and fever can be managed with NSAIDs and acetaminophen. Making sure the patient remains well-hydrated is important. Additionally, a mixture of liquid ibuprofen and liquid diphenhydramine can be used to gargle, which helps coat the ulcers, easing the pain.

Over the past decade, researchers have developed specific treatments to manage enterovirus 71-induced hand, foot, and mouth disease because of its severe neurological complications. So far, no drug has been approved, but promising novel agents include molecular decoys, translation inhibitors, receptor antagonists, and replication inhibitors. An antiviral agent that has shown promise in the treatment of enterovirus 71 is pleconaril, an anti-picornaviral agent. However, there are currently no licensed antivirals for the treatment of HFMD.

Several vaccine candidates have been developed against HFMD and Enteroviruses. Currently, strain-specific inactivated whole-virus aluminum-adjuvant vaccines have been developed in China and are approved for widespread use.
