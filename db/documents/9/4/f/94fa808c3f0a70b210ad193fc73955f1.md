The primary pathophysiological mechanism in pernicious anemia is diminished dietary B12 absorption due to IF deficiency. Vitamin B12 is found in meat, eggs, and dairy products and is essential for erythropoiesis and nerve myelination; therefore, its deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia due to disrupted DNA synthesis and demyelinated nerves. B12 deficiency causes megaloblastic changes in all formed blood elements, but erythrocytes show the most significant changes, with the degree of anemia corresponding to the severity of red blood cell morphologic changes.

Dietary B12 is released from food carrier proteins via proteolysis in the acidic gastric environment and binds to haptocorrin, protecting B12 from degradation.

Vitamin B12 deficiency prevents the proper functioning of these coenzymes, leading to an accumulation of their substrate in plasma. Specifically, adenosylcobalamin deficiency results in an accumulation of methylmalonic acid (MMA), and methylcobalamin deficiency in an accumulation of homocysteine. Additionally, the formation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and methionine diminish.

SAM is the methyl donor to key substrates, such as nucleic acids, proteins, phospholipids, and neurotransmitters. As a donor in DNA methylation, it plays an important role in epigenetic adaptability to developmental and environmental factors.
