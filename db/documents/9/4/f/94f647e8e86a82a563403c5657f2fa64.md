Methanol is a dangerous chemical, which if ingested can be deadly. The key to the management of methanol toxicity is to recognize it and prevent it. Providers caring for a patient with methanol exposure or undifferentiated metabolic acidosis, particularly with visual symptoms, should consult a medical toxicologist or poison center for experienced expert guidance. Physicians, nurses, and pharmacists should play a proactive role in educating the public about the proper storage of chemicals containing this agent, such as windshield washer fluid so thatÂ they are out of the reach of children. Further, people who work in an industry where methanol fumes are generated should utilize proper protective equipment.

**Outcomes**

When prompt diagnosis and treatment occur, patients often recover. Retinal toxicity and basal ganglia toxicity may result in permanent symptoms. When patients present late or diagnosis is not recognized in a timely fashion, significant morbidity and mortality can occur.
