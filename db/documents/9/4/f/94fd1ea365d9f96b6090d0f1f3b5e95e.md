The diagnosis of measles is based on three elements: clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and laboratory testing. Serological tests with specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) measurements, molecular biologic techniques with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction application, and viral isolation are available for diagnostic confirmation. The measles specific IgM antibody in primary infection, which is confirmatory of disease, are detected from the third day of the rash and remain positive for 30 to 60 days.  For the evaluation of IgG, there is more than a four-fold increase in antibodies between the acute and convalescence phases of the disease.

Measles RNA can be detected by a polymerase chain reaction from pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs or urine samples. This test confirms the disease and allows the genotyping of the agent.
