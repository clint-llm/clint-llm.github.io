Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of hematologic neoplasms classically described as a clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells leading to dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis in the bone marrow. Because of the diverse presentation and complex management, this syndrome is best managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that includes a hematologist, oncologist, internist, infectious disease specialist and a geneticist. The prognosis for patients with MDS is variable; depending on the severity and type of cytogenetic defect. Karyotype with a good prognosis includes normal karyotype, -Y, deletion 5q, deletion 20q. Poor risk karyotypes include complex cytogenetics (greater than three abnormalities), or chromosome 7 abnormalities. All other karyotypes are categorized as intermediate risk. Based on these findings, a score is calculated to determine a risk score of either low, intermediate-1 or intermediate-2, or high risk.
