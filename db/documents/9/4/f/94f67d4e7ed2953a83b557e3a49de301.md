Duodenal trauma is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. An overall morbidity rate of 22 to 27% is seen. A mortality rate of 5 to 30% is reported but varies by grade and timing.

Mortality is reported to be 8.3% for grade I, 18.7% for grade II, 27.6% for grade III, 30.8% for grade IV, and 58.8% for grade V. Early deaths are generally due to exsanguination while late deaths are due to fistula, sepsis, and organ failure. One of the most consequential factors in predicting mortality is a delay in diagnosis. A delay in diagnosis by over 24 hours nearly quadruples the mortality rate.
