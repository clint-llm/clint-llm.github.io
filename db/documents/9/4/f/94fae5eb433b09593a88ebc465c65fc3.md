Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) are disasters, either man-made or natural, in which local management agencies and the healthcare system are overwhelmed. Emergency medical services (EMS) provides a vital role in triaging, stabilizing, and transporting victims to definitive care during MCIs.  There may be large numbers of victims who will need care. Strategies and plans for effective management, communication, and collaboration are essential during an MCI. The military, fire department, police department, search, and rescue units, as well as the country's or jurisdiction's health ministry, may become involved depending on the type and severity of an MCI.
