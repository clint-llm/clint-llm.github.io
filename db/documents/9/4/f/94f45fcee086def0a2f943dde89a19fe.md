Amniotic fluid surrounds the embryo and fetus during development and has a myriad of functions. Physically, it protects the fetus in the event the maternal abdomen is the object of trauma. Furthermore, it protects the umbilical cord by providing a cushion between the fetus and the umbilical cord, thus reducing the risk of compression between the fetus and the uterine wall.
