Pars defect is an acquired condition that develops at a young age.

Congenital pars injury has never been described.

Isthmic spondylolysis represents a fatigue fracture in the pars interarticularis isthmus; this is the weakest part of the posterior vertebral arch. Hyperextension and rotatory forces may result in repetitive stress in this region. An isolated traumatic event is less common as a cause of spondylolysis; however, it could potentially complete a developing pars fracture.

Athletes encompass the majority of patients presenting with spondylolysis. Sport-specific maneuvers with repetitive twisting rotation and extension increase the load on the spine and may result in stress injury. There are reports that the strength of the neural arch increases through adulthood until the age of 50. Children and adolescents are prone to a higher risk of fatigue pars fractures.
