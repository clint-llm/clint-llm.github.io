Epispadias lies on the milder end of the spectrum of anomalies under the bladder exstrophy-epispadias-complex (BEEC). Although a number of theories have been put forward for its occurrence, whether as a part of BEEC or isolated, the exact cause of epispadias is still unclear. It is believed that abnormalities of the cloacal membrane might be responsible for its occurrence. An abnormally large cloacal membrane not only prevents the normal migration of mesenchymal tissue but is also prone to early rupture, leading to this spectrum of anomalies. Isolated epispadias occurs when this rupture causes a non-union of the distal portion of the urinary tract.
