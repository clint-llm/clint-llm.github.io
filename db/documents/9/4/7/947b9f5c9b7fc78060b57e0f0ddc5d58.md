The incidence of double aortic arch is generally unknown. Published data estimates the prevalence of vascular rings to be 1%. Up to 55% of patients undergoing vascular ring repair have a double aortic arch. There is no predilection towards a particular sex or race. An underlying cardiac diagnosis is prevalent in up to 12.6% and includes ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, and other complex congenital cardiac conditions. There is an association with chromosome 22q11 deletion, trisomy 21, and other syndromes in up to 20% of cases. A 2 to 3 fold increase in the incidence of double aortic arch has been reported with the use of routine first-trimester ultrasound compared to postnatal data, with risk increasing significantly in those conceived via in-vitro fertilization.
