Before a blood transfusion, a complete history and physical exam needs to be done to assess the patient's clinical status. Most likely, the hemoglobin is lower than 7, or they are actively bleeding and need a red blood cell transfusion. Abnormal coagulation studies with consumptive coagulopathy also warrant correction with FFP or cryoprecipitate before any interventions or emergent surgery. Within 6 hours of blood transfusion for acute TRALI or 6 to 72 hours for delayed TRALI, patients can develop body temperature of greater than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or 37 degrees Celcius or hypotension along with acute dyspnea requiring more oxygen via nasal cannula, nonbreathable mask or even mechanical ventilation depending on severity.
