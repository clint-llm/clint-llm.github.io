Universally, HHV-6 primary infection is benign with spontaneous resolution in 5 to 7 days. The most common complication of roseola infantum is febrile seizures. Additional complications are often due to HHV-6 neurotrophic effects, as highlighted in cases where the central nervous system becomes compromised, for example, in cases of meningoencephalitis and encephalopathy. In these cases, the virus occupies the brain during primary infection and can remain dormant in brain tissue.
