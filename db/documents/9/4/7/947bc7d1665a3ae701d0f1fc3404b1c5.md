Ropivacaine is administered in incremental doses. Factors that affect the dosing of any administered local anesthetic include the area to be anesthetized, the vascularity of tissues, the number of neuronal segments to be blocked, and the depth and duration of anesthesia required.

An adequate test dose of 3 t5o 5 mL of short-acting local anesthetic with epinephrine should be used before the induction of the complete block. A repeat of the test dose should be given if the patient is moved in such a way that displacement epidural catheter may have occurred.

For lumbar surgery epidural blocks, the ropivacaine doses considered necessary to produce a successful block are 15 to 30 mL of 0.5% solution, 15 to 25 mL of 0.75% solution, 15 to 20 mL of 1% solution.

When used in lumbar epidural blocks for cesarean section, the doses for ropivacaine are 20 to 30 mL of 0.5% solution and 15 to 20 mL of 0.75% solution.

Dosages of ropivacaine when performing thoracic epidural blocks for surgical anesthesia are 5 to 15% mL dose of 0.5% solution and 5 to 15 mL of 0.75% solution.

When performing major nerve blocks, the dosages are 35 to 50 mL of 0.5% solution and 10 to 40 mL of 0.75% solution.

For field blocks (e.g., minor nerve blocks and infiltration), ropivacaine is dosed at a 1 to 40 mL dose of a 0.5% solution.

When managing post-operative pain, peripheral nerve blocks are continuously infused at a dose of 5 to 10 mL/hr of 0.2% solution. For pain management through lumbar or thoracic epidurals, the continuous infusion dose of ropivacaine is at 6 to 14 mL/hr of 0.2% solution.

In prolonged blocks, there should be consideration of the risks of reaching a toxic plasma concentration or inducing local neural injury. A 24-hour cumulative dose of up to 770 mg ropivacaine is generally well-tolerated in adults for postoperative pain management. Ropivacaine should be used with caution when administering it to debilitated patients for more than 70 hours.
