Acetazolamide is a classic treatment option for glaucoma as it causes a reduction in aqueous humor. It is also useful for treating altitude sickness because of its underlying mechanism of action. The medication works to excrete bicarbonate. Doing so alkalizes the urine as there is greater bicarbonate in the urine. As a result, the blood is more acidic, given that the bicarbonate has been excreted. Some mechanisms equate the carbon dioxide concentrations in the body to the degree of acidity, resulting in an artificial compensatory mechanism for what the body believes to be excess carbon dioxide. This compensation results in faster and deeper breathing. The outcome of that is higher oxygen concentrations in the body, which improves the ability of the body to adjust itself to the higher altitude levels.
