There are two common varieties of diaphragmatic pacers:

- Conventional DP - An internal electrode is attached to the phrenic nerve at the cervical, thoracic, or diaphragmatic level. Pacing wires connect this electrode to a receiver under the skin. An external transmitting box is placed above the receiver on the surface of the skin. This box is the main control unit and emits radiofrequency signals.

- Diaphragmatic Pacing System (DPS) - DPS consists of four electrodes implanted in the diaphragm to provide direct muscle stimulation and a fifth electrode implanted under the skin, which acts as a grounder. An electrode connector groups the five electrodes exiting the skin into a socket called an external pulse generator (EPG). A removable cable connects the electrode socket to the EPG.
