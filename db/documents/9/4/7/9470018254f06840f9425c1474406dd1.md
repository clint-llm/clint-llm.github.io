The residual volume functions to maintain the patency of alveoli even after maximal forced expiration. In healthy lungs, the air that makes up the residual volume is utilized for continual gas exchange between breaths. Inspiration then draws atmospheric oxygen into the lungs to replenish the oxygen-depleted residual air for gas exchange in the alveoli.
