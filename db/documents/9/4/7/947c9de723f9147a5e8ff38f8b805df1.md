Overall, griseofulvin has few adverse effects. It most commonly causes gastrointestinal issues of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as headaches and allergic reactions.

Griseofulvin is an inducer of cytochrome P-450 and thus interacts with medications that metabolize via the P-450 system. One such drug is warfarin. When taken with griseofulvin, warfarin's anticoagulation effect decreases.****

A study involving 295 children, 79 (or 26.8%) experienced mild to moderate adverse effects, with the most common being gastrointestinal. These included elevated triglycerides (1/79), anemia (2/79), SGOT (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase; 1/79), rash (1/79), abdominal pain (10/79), diarrhea (7/79), dyspepsia (3/79), fever (1/79), headache (12/79), nausea (9/79), weight gain (3/79), vomiting (12/79), and other unspecified events (17/79).
