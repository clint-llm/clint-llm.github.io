While fine-needle aspiration can technically be used on essentially any region of the body, it is most commonly used to biopsy newly identified masses in the breast, the thyroid, suspicious lymph nodes, or suspicious skin masses.

Given the diverse array of anatomical structures that may be accessed by fine-needle aspiration, detailing the anatomical nuances of each is beyond the scope of this chapter; however, there are a few universal principles worth mentioning. The first is to plan any fine-needle aspiration so that it avoids any critical intervening structures or blood vessels; it is inappropriate to biopsy the liver through the gallbladder or the thyroid through an intervening artery, for example. Secondly, while fine-needle aspiration can be used to aspirate abscesses, particularly in cosmetically sensitive areas such as the breast, infected areas should otherwise be avoided as it will seed infectious material along the tract of the needle.
