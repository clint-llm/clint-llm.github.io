The diagnosis of YNS is clinical, and no specific test is required or diagnostic. More commonly encountered diagnoses, such as heart failure, primary lymphedema, and onychomycosis, should be ruled out. This can be done through a thorough investigation of the patient's history and physical exam or may require additional tests. Potential testing may include the following:

- Echocardiography to rule out heart failure

- Chest radiography to identify pneumonia or other pulmonary pathology

- CT of the sinuses to assess for chronic sinusitis

- Testing for infection, such as sputum analysis or CBC

- Analysis of nail scrapings or clippings to rule out onychomycosis

- Thoracentesis with an evaluation of pleural fluid

- Lymphoscintigraphy to identify lymphatic insufficiency
