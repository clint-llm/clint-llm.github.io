Initial treatment of myeloid leukemia is based on age, history of prior myelodysplastic syndrome or cytotoxic chemotherapy, and performance status. The use of cytogenetics and molecular markers gained through next-generation sequencing is necessary for risk stratification and can guide upfront frontline therapy. Several molecular markers such as FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, IDH, And other mutations are important for risk assessment. However, although karyotyping and molecular markers are robust predictors of disease-free survival, induction chemotherapy is often initiated before this information is available. Standard induction regimens have as their basis the backbone of cytarabine in combination with anthracycline popularly known as the 7+3 regimen. The therapy intends to reduce the leukemic burden and restore normal hematopoiesis. For people that are found to be FLT3 mutated, midostaurin, an FLT3 inhibitor to both ITD and TKD mutations, is now added to standard chemotherapy as part of frontline treatment based on the RATIFY Alliance Trial.
