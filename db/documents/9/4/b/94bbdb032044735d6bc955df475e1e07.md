The etiology of JNA is not well understood, and still often debated.  There are a few different hypotheses currently in the literature, primarily revolving around a vascular source, such as an AVM, or remnant of the first branchial arch.

Others have connected JNA to a hormonal influence affecting the proliferation of vascular erectile tissues following repeated microhemorrhages and repair.

Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma has also correlated with genetic anomalies and other disorders. There have been reports of chromosome 17 deletions.

Another association with recent documentation is with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV is known to be associated with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.  It is also known for its tumorigenic effect, similar to the Epstein-Barr virus, raising the question if there could be an association with nasopharyngeal angiofibroma.  A small study demonstrated a strong association between JNA and HPV, with the presence of HPV-specific proteins and DNA within the nasopharyngeal angiofibroma tissue, without concomitant infection in the control group's adenoidal tissue.
