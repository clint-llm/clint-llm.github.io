**Status Migrainosus**

This is a debilitating migraine attack that tends to last for more than 72 hours. Some patients with status migrainosus require hospitalization due to intense pain.

**Migrainous Infarction or Stroke**

Patients with migraine with aura have a higher risk of stroke. Migrainous infarction is a migraine attack in patients with aura, wherein the aura symptoms last for more than an hour, and infarction is seen on the neuroimaging.

**Persistent Aura without Infarction**

This can be seen in patients where the aura lasts for more than a week after the migraine headache has ended. Patients can have symptoms similar to migrainous infarction, but neuroimaging does not show any infarction.

**Migraine-aura Triggered Seizure**

This is a seizure triggered by a migraine attack with aura. The seizure typically occurs within an hour after a migraine attack.

**Mental Health Issues**

Some patients with migraine headaches are at an increased risk of having a major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder.
