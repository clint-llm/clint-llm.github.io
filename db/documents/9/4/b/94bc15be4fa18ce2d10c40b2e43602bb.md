There is no definitive laboratory test for PAN. The diagnosis is mainly clinical. Laboratory studies are most often obtained to assess organ involvement and rule out other disease processes. Laboratory tests should include serum creatinine and urinalysis to assess renal function as well as a liver panel and creatinine kinase. Hepatitis B and hepatitis C serologies are essential to rule out secondary causes of PAN. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein may be elevated but are not specific to PAN and often are elevated in other vasculitides. The following lab tests are particularly helpful to assess for other disease processes and vasculitides: antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, complement levels (C3 and C4), cryoglobulins, serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis (SPEP and UPEP), rheumatoid factor, and human immunodeficiency virus serology. A biopsy of an affected organ should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.
