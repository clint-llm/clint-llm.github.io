Colitis, depending on its cause, may be self-limited, life-threatening, chronic or recurrent. Patients with chronic and recurrent colitis need lifelong monitoring. The general practitioners have key roles in early diagnosis of the disease, support of the patients and assisting them with smoking cessation and management of their disease. The patients should be encouraged by nursing to take responsibility for their condition and provide knowledge of their pathology and drugs used. The pharmacists should be aware of the disease and drugs that could cause colitis and assist in explaining the potential complications. The nurse and pharmacist should report untoward complications to the clinical team. Other healthcare professionals including nurses need to be mindful of the clinical picture, common presentations, management, and care of patients with chronic and recurrent colitis. The surgeons play a key role with specific aspects of colitis in emergencies and in cases that failed to respond to medical therapy. Patients with chronic colitis develop depression and anxiety and need mental health support. All these various disciplines need to work together collaboratively in an interprofessional team to bring about the best outcomes for patients who have colitis. [Level V]
