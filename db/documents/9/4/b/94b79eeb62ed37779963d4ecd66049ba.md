Due to the various effects of the ANS on cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary systems, the general theme of reactions to these medications involves effects on these organ systems. The various reactions to each of the categories of agents include

- Cholinomimetics/cholinesterase inhibitors – nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, urinary urgency, excessive salivation, sweating, cutaneous vasodilation, bronchial constriction

- Anticholinergics – tachycardia, urinary retention, xerostomia (dry mouth), constipation, increased intraocular pressure

- Adrenoreceptor agonists/sympathomimetics – tremor, tachycardia, hypertension, urinary retention, piloerection

- Adrenoreceptor antagonists – bradycardia, bronchospasm, hypotension
