The incidence and prevalence of SSc vary among different studies. The overall worldwide incidence of SSc is reported to be between 8 to 56 new cases/million/year. Whereas, the overall prevalence is between 38 to 341 cases/million/year. SSc is more common in women (3 to 7: 1 female to male ratio), with an average age of disease onset being 35 to 50. There are several differences in disease presentation between males and females. For instance, females are found to have disease onset at a younger age with longer disease duration. Females are also found to have more limited SSc than men, more frequent but less severe peripheral vascular involvement, and increased frequency of anti-centromere antibodies with pulmonary hypertension being the most frequent cause of mortality.

Primary cardiac disease is reported in both diffuse and limited systemic sclerosis; however, it is more prevalent and more severe in diffuse systemic sclerosis.
