Kidney and renal pelvic cancers are the 12th most common cancer in the US, with more males affected than females. Middle age Caucasian and African Americans are equally affected, with Asians being the least affected. US Census found that there are around ~7400 cases in 2019. There are approximately 15,000 deaths yearly, with RCC accounts for approximately 80% of those deaths.

Overall, renal masses have increased in the past decades because of improved sensitivity and usage frequency of advanced imaging modalities such as MRIs and CTs. Therefore, it is not surprising to find such renal mass in healthy individuals. On the other hand, new malignant kidney mass cases have been holding steady from 2008 to 2016, with the five-year survival rate steadily improving due to advancement in detection and intervention.
