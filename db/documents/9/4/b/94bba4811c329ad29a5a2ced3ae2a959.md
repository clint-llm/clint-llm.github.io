Opiates can be administered intravenously (IV), topically, inhaled, intramuscularly (IM), and orally. Following intravenous administration, the peak effects of the opiate are reached within 5 to 10 minutes but may take up to 90 minutes when administered orally. Following nasal insufflation, drugs Like heroin and butorphanol can reach peak levels within 10 to 15 minutes and about 30 to 45 minutes following intramuscular injection. Fentanyl which is the only available topical analgesic agent often takes 2 to 4 hours to reach peak levels.

When administered orally, the majority of opiate absorption occurs in the small intestine. When large doses of opiates are consumed, this can lead to gastric aperistalsis and a delay in gastric emptying and absorption of the drug. Once in the body, opiates are broken down by the liver to inactive compounds that are excreted primarily by the kidneys. Opiates like buprenorphine and fentanyl are highly lipid soluble and tend to redistribute into the fatty tissues and thus, have a prolonged half-life. Since all opiates are broken down by the liver, they tend to have a long half-life when consumed in the presence of liver dysfunction (for example, cirrhosis). In these patients, opiate toxicity can occur rapidly even with small doses as the drug remains in the body for a long time.

The hepatic microsomal CYP2D6 enzyme is responsible for breaking down codeine into the active metabolite, morphine. Some individuals carry more than 2 copies of the enzyme, and these ultrarapid metabolizers breakdown codeine into morphine rapidly; thus, individuals who take even normal doses of codeine may develop morphine toxicity. The same mechanism of ultrarapid breakdown explains why tramadol can cause opiate toxicity.

Once broken down in the liver, the opiate metabolites are excreted in the urine. Individuals with renal dysfunction may develop adverse effects from the accumulated active metabolites like normeperidine.

Several other studies show that long-acting opiates used for non-cancer pain can increase the risk of adverse cardiac events compared to tricyclics or anticonvulsants.

**Formulas of Opiates and Delivery**

Unlike the past when opiates were only available in oral, IM, and IV formulations, today there are dermal, sublingual and inhaler formulas on the market. Butorphanol is available in an intranasal form and fentanyl is available both as a topical and as an inhaler.

The transdermal delivery of opiates like fentanyl has been widely accepted in healthcare settings for analgesic relief. This route of administration is favored because the drug levels take 4 to 6 hours to peak and there is a long elimination half-life, thus making the drug suitable for use in patients with chronic continuous pain. In addition, because of the relatively prolonged slow onset of action, this route of administration is rarely known to precipitate toxicity. However, the topical formulation of fentanyl can contribute toward the toxicity of parenteral or oral opiates.

Dextromethorphan was once widely available in many over the counter cough preparations, but because of diversion, it is no longer available in over the counter products. Dextromethorphan may have been an over the counter preparation, but at high doses, it is known to cause sedation and even respiratory depression. Further, the use of dextromethorphan by patients who have been prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitors can lead to the life-threatening serotonin syndrome that can lead to adverse cardiac events.

Tramadol (Ultram), although classified as a non-opiate analgesic, has a dual mode of action by acting on non-opiate and opiate receptors. Tramadol has a comparatively long duration of action of 5 to 6 hours. If it is known that a patient has overdosed on tramadol, naloxone is recommended, and most people require repeated doses or a continuous intravenous infusion.

Because of the difficulty in legally obtaining prescription opiates, many clandestine laboratories have sprung up in the nation. These laboratories work under unsterile conditions and use impure substances; the eventual result is more toxic drugs that are sold on the street. The other difficult with illicit drugs made in the clandestine laboratories is that many can’t even be detected with the normal toxicological screens because the levels are so low.

There are several types of synthetic fentanyl derivatives on the street like alpha-Methylfentanyl, which are extremely potent. In fact, several deaths have been reported in drug abusers with the needle still in the arm. One other synthetic derivative, 3-Methylfentanyl, is several thousand times more potent than morphine and when people overdose on it, extremely high doses of intravenous naloxone infusions are required. Deaths from these fentanyl derivatives often occur in clusters as the sellers go from street to street, leading to multiple deaths along the way.

Pentazocine is classified as a partial agonist-antagonist and is used to treat moderate to severe pain. It acts by stimulating the K-opiate receptors (KOR) and inhibiting the Mu-opiate receptors (MOR). The drug shares many of the same features of other opiates in terms of adverse effects. The one unique feature about pentazocine is that it also is known to cause nightmares, hallucination, and delusions. The drug is also subject to a high ceiling effect, meaning once a certain dose is reached, no further pain relief can be obtained.  Although the pharmacological effects of pentazocine can be reversed by naloxone, extremely high doses of naloxone (10 to 115 ng) are required.

Propoxyphene is an opiate analgesic and was once prescribed to manage mild pain and cough. Even though propoxyphene was withdrawn from the US market in 2010 because of concern for serious adverse cardiac events, sporadic cases of poisoning still continue to occur. Despite the ban, the drug still is available illegally and accounts for a fair number of poisoning each year. Naloxone can reverse the toxicity of propoxyphene but not the cardiac arrhythmias. The cardiac arrhythmias are due to the quinidine-like effects of propoxyphene and are unresponsive to naloxone. Propoxyphene is known to cause sinus bradycardia, ear block or ventricular arrhythmia. The treatment is to immediately administer sodium bicarbonate.

Diphenoxylate/atropine: This combination product is often used to treat diarrhea. The diphenoxylate acts like an antidiarrheal agent, and the atropine is an anticholinergic that is added to deter deliberate overdose. Atropine has no antidiarrheal activity. When high doses are ingested, one may note mainly anticholinergic side effects, respiratory depression, and constipation. Because of the long half-life of diphenoxylate, the adverse effects can be worrying. The majority of cases of diphenoxylate/atropine overdose are seen in children. If the child is seen in the emergency room within a few hours after ingestion, gastric decontamination with activated charcoal may be attempted. All children need to be observed for a minimum of 6 hours to ensure that they do not develop arrhythmias.

Body packers: Over the past 2 decades, the transport of illicit drugs in the body has become very common. These individuals place drugs inside plastic bags or condoms and ingest them. Often the number of packages ingested vary from 1 to 3 dozen and even though well wrapped, sometimes the packages do break open and systemic toxicity results. Others may develop complications like bowel obstruction or intestinal perforation. In some cases, when the individual is pursued by police, he or she may stuff the drugs into the anus, vagina, or ingest them. These individuals are likely to suffer from adverse effects because the drugs are often not properly packaged. After ingestion, systemic symptoms appear rapidly, and these individuals often require aggressive medical therapy to prevent death, and in some cases, surgery is required to relieve a bowel obstruction. Even after surgery, if the drugs have been absorbed into the systemic circulation, the risk of death is often high.
