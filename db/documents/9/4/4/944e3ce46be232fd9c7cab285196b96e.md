Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a rare and aggressive form of chronic pyelonephritis that is best managed with an interprofessional team approach. It is often confused with renal cell carcinoma and renal tuberculosis due to similar signs and symptoms. The diagnosis of XGP is based on the CT scan finding of the "bear paw" sign and histology showing lipid-laden foamy macrophage. It has the ability to involve the adjacent structures or organs if left untreated. Hence, early diagnosis and treatment can prevent the complications of this disease. Treatment with nephrectomy has an excellent prognosis. As the disease can involve multiple organs when left untreated, a team consisting of an infectious disease specialist, oncologist, radiologist, urologist, and a urological surgeon should carefully evaluate the disease and look for any complications.
