Complications related to AVM can be intracranial hemorrhage or mechanical pressure-related damage. Ophthalmic complications include exudation from the AVM causing macular edema, retinal ischemia, retinal vein occlusion, neovascular glaucoma, and vitreous hemorrhage.

The complications related to intracranial surgery include loss of vision or field of vision.

Complications of dental or maxillary surgical procedures may include profuse bleeding due to the presence of these AVM.
