Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a relatively rare but potentially devastating ocular emergency. Patients present with sudden, painless monocular vision loss. The prognosis for visual recovery is poor, and up until fairly recently, there was no treatment that could restore any degree of functional vision to the affected eye. Central retinal artery occlusion leads to hypoxia, and the retinal tissue is especially intolerant of hypoxia. In 2006, hyperbaric oxygen therapy was approved for the treatment of central retinal artery occlusion, though it remains a vastly underutilized modality, partially due to lack of availability and lack of awareness in the ophthalmology community. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of central retinal artery occlusion and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of central retinal artery occlusion.
- Desrcibe the presentation of a patient with central retinal artery occlusion.
- Review the treatment and management options available central retinal artery occlusion.
- Summarize a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by central retinal artery occlusion.
