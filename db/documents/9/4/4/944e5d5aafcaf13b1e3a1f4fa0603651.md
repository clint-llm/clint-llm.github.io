Reports regarding the epidemiology of imposter syndrome exist but are not significant enough in breadth or depth to make meaningful statements on biostatistical factors regarding imposter syndrome (incidence, prevalence, demographic information, etc.) on the scale of the U.S. or worldwide. Despite this knowledge gap, based on existing studies and reports, imposter syndrome tends to be more common in females than males and in marginalized groups (minority racial and ethnic groups, socioeconomic status).

Imposter syndrome is highly prevalent among students in healthcare professions. For instance, one study of medical students found more than one-quarter of male students and half of the female students experienced IS. In that same study, there was a statistically significant association between IS and burnout syndrome, as determined by the Maslach Burnout Inventory.

In a study of pharmacy students, higher Clance Imposter Phenomenon Scale (CIPS) scores correlated with the number of hours worked per week and prior mental health treatment.
