The following should be ruled out or considered in the differential diagnosis prior to diagnosing enuresis:

Normal development is children meeting milestones of being dry by day around 2-years-old, dry by night around 3-years-old, then able to toilet alone at 4-years-old. At 5-years-old, 15% of the children remain incontinent of urine. Due to these normal development milestones, enuresis cannot be diagnosed in children less than 5-years-old.

**Medical Conditions**

These include urinary tract infection (UTI), diabetes mellitus (DM), diabetes insipidus (DI), urethritis, seizure disorder, sickle cell disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), neurogenic bladder, spina bifida, sleep disorder, genitourinary malformation, hyperthyroidism, constipation, central hormone abnormality, delayed bladder maturation, decreased bladder capacity, neurodevelopmental disorders

- It is important to rule out seizures as a cause of enuresis or micturition, as enuresis may occur during the ictal period.

**Medication-induced**

Know causes include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), bupropion, diuretic, and antipsychotics (risperidone).

**Comorbidities**

- Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

- Neurodevelopmental disorders

- Other psychiatric conditions are comorbid with secondary, rather than primary enuresis.
