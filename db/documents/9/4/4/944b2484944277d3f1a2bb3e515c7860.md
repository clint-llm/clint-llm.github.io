Internal anal sphincterotomy is indicated in patients who have failed at least 6 weeks of conservative medical management. Typically, patients undergo medical management for 1 to 3 months. If it has failed, surgery is recommended.  Surgical candidates must have good fecal continence prior to the procedure to reduce the risk of postoperative fecal incontinence.
