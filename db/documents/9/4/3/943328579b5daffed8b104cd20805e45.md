Embryologically, an aberrant left pulmonary artery arises from a lack of development of the sixth aortic arch.

Respiratory symptoms can range from mild tachypnea, wheezing, to severe distress requiring mechanical ventilation.

All PAS patients need to be thoroughly evaluated with advanced imaging such as computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A bronchoscopy is necessary to evaluate for complete tracheal rings as a cause of tracheal stenosis. About 50%-79% of patients with PAS also have congenital tracheal stenosis with complete cartilaginous rings.

Patients with congenital tracheal stenosis from complete cartilaginous rings, absent membranous trachea, also have a higher association with cardiovascular anomalies, with PAS being the most common, around 50%.

About 30% of patients can also have concomitant cardiac lesions (atrial septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, and ventricular septal defect) that can be repaired simultaneously during PAS repair, making performing a pre-operative echocardiogram also necessary.

Right lung agenesis can also exist with the failure of the development of the right main-stem bronchus. One more associated complexity is associated with VACTERL (vertebral defects, anal, cardiac, tracheal, esophageal, renal, and limb) syndrome.

Classification for PAS can be qualified with CTA/MRI according to the tracheobronchial anatomy. Type 1A described normal tracheobronchial anatomy, with sling just above the carina. Type 1B is where the right main bronchus and distal trachea leading to tracheomalacia or air-trapping. Type 2 is the most common with the presence of tracheal stenosis secondary to cartilaginous rings, and more caudally at T5-6 or low T-shaped carina.
