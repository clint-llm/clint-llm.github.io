nNMBs classify as competitive acetylcholine (ACh) antagonists, which directly bind to the alpha subunits of nicotinic receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. Under normal circumstances, the transmission of impulses from the primary motor cortex to the motor endplates occurs via ACh release from the presynaptic terminal, diffusion across the synaptic membrane, and binding to the nicotinic receptor of the postsynaptic membrane. The receptor binding then activates its sodium (Na+) channel domain allowing the influx of Na+ and depolarizing the motor endplate from a resting membrane potential of -100 mV to +40 mV depolarized potential. The depolarizing signal would reach the sarcoplasmic membrane, which would signal a release of calcium ions (Ca2+) that facilitates muscular contraction.

These agents differentiate into two subcategories, classified structurally andÂ clinically based on drug reversal patterns

- Steroidal: Rocuronium, vecuronium, pancuronium

- Benzylisoquinolinium: atracurium, cisatracurium, mivacurium

Although slight differences in clinical effects like the steroidal agents possess more vagolytic activity and benzylisoquinolines, causing more histamine reactions, both subtypes have the same mechanism of action. However, clinical reversal algorithms now differ due to the recent development of sugammadex.
