To achieve its goals, predictive medicine must provide applicable insights about outcomes that have not yet occurred and deliver these personalized insights to frontline healthcare providers such as physicians, mid-level practitioners, and nurses at the point of patient contact. Otherwise, predictive medicine's potential will be reduced to an academic novelty: compelling in theory but impractical for the reality of clinical practice.

Effective adoption and implementation will require significant efforts to purchase, develop, and refine the necessary IT infrastructure and advocate for this next generation of data-based medicine. Success will require the alignment of incentives across all stakeholders—from the medical software companies who develop these tools to the medical center administration that invests in the infrastructure, to the healthcare providers that are ultimately responsible for using these tools appropriately.   Assuming full adoption, predictive medicine will face additional new challenges. With the unprecedented acquisition and utilization of healthcare and healthcare-related data, HIPAA and data security will become an even more prominent issue. Philosophically, there will likely be ongoing debates about the use and overuse of these technologies and its effect on clinical acumen and medical practice, just as there is ongoing criticism regarding the overuse of CTs and other imaging modalities.None of these challenges are insurmountable, and the potential benefits at this time appear to be worth the effort. With the Affordable Care Act's shift from quantity-based healthcare payment reimbursement to a value-based reimbursement system, stakeholders should be even more compelled to closely examine the cost savings and quality improvements afforded by predictive medicine and big data. Only time will tell if predictive medicine will live up to its potential.

The biggest problem with predictive medicine is the validity of the available test. No test is 100% sensitive and 100% specific. Hence, both false positives and false negatives are expected when applying any test to predict disease. When it comes to genetic testing to predict disease, cost, and ethics are also major concerns. When applying genetic tests to predict disease, one can never negate the role of the environment or lifestyle. Plus, the reliability of genetic testing is not 100%. With cost containment a priority in healthcare, empirical ordering of predictive tests may not be practical or realistic for the entire population.

While big data results have helped yield valuable clinical variables that are potentially associated with patient clinical outcomes of interest, one must appreciate the limitations of big data.  Indeed, there have been several reports regarding the potential miscoding and/or incorrect diagnostic coding that ultimately can result in inconclusive or potentially incorrect statistical conclusions.

Several authors have proposed utilizing big data results and its statistically and clinically relevant variables as a "flashlight" to highlight larger groups of relevant variables to be applied at the institutional level as part of more customized statistically relevant analyses to mitigate these limitations.
