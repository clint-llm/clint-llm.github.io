Etiology is still unclear. Researchers believe that it is due to irritation due to the retention of urine, smegma, and scale in the context of a dysfunctional foreskin. It does not occur in circumcised men. This retention occurs between 2 desquamative, secretory, hyper colonized epithelial surfaces underÂ conditions of inadequate hygiene and repeated infection. Also, friction, heat, trauma, can be contributing factors. Professionals conclude that the 2 main trigger factors are, firstly, constant exposure to humidity, and secondly, constant exposure to chronic irritation. This explains why the Zoon balanitis lesions go through long remission after circumcision.



Other theories include chronic infection with Mycobacterium smegmatis or chronic infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). These theories have not been validated.
