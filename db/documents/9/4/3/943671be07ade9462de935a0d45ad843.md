Complications of elevated hemidiaphragm related to neuropathic or muscular causes can lead to respiratory distress, which can progress to respiratory failure or heart failure. The complications are related to the diaphragm's inability to function as a primary muscle for respiration and secondary to impairment of the pressure gradient required for adequate blood flow to the heart.
