Because of the fibula's ability to provide up to 30 cm of straight, healthy bone with minimal morbidity at the donor site and minimal postoperative functional limitation, it has become a commonly-used source of grafting material. Applications for fibula grafting run the gamut from oncological resections to chronic infections to post-traumatic defects and congenital anomalies. Direct medialization of the fibula has even been described for reconstructing long tibial defects.
