Recurrence of necrotizing periodontal diseases is not uncommon, and therefore regular recalls are recommended to monitor for signs of future illness. Additionally, a critical factor in the prognosis of NPDs is the management of risk factors. The prognosis is more favorable if patients improve their risk factors such as oral hygiene, nutrition, psychological stress,Â or smoking cessation. Additionally, treatment of underlying conditions, such as therapy for HIV, may reduce the patient's immunosuppressed state, thus improving their prognosis.
