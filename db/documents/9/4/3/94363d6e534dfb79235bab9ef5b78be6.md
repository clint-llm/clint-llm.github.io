A-cells, B-cells, D-cells, D1-cells, and D2-cells are the normal types of islet cells of Langerhans in the pancreas. The normal function of A-cells is to secrete glucagon, B-cells is to secrete insulin, D-cells is to secrete somatostatin, D1-cells is to secrete a pancreatic polypeptide, and D2-cells is to secrete vasoactive intestinal peptide. Islet cell tumors secrete one or more than one of these substances in the majority of the cases. However, in some cases, they may secrete other substances like gastrin, which is normally produced by the fetal cells of the pancreas.

Islet cell tumors can be either functional (release hormones that can further produce symptoms) or nonfunctional (they do not produce any hormones). Nonfunctional tumors produce their symptoms due to mass effect. The common types of functional tumors are gastrinoma, insulinoma, glucagonoma, somatostatinoma, and VIPoma.
