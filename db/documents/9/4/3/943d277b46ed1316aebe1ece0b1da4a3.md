There are several side effects to keep in mind for several specific syndromes and their associated management (see Table 5). For example, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as carbamazepine and lamotrigine should be avoided in patients with ChAc due to the worsening of involuntary movements.

Another consideration for MLS patients is to avoid heterologous blood product transfusions due to an increased risk of adverse transfusion reactions. Case reports have suggested avoiding alpha-tocopherol and idebenone in treating the neuromuscular symptoms of patients with PKAN due to anecdotal evidence suggesting worsening of symptoms.
