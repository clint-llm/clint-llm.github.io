Angle-closure impairs aqueous outflow by obstructing, damaging, or degenerating trabecular meshwork, leading to an increase in intraocular pressure and subsequent glaucomatous optic nerve damage. Angle-closure is characterized by the presence of irido-trabecular contact. This contact may lead to chronic closure of the angle due to peripheral anterior synechiae formation. If a glaucomatous optic neuropathy is also present, this is termed chronic angle-closure glaucoma.

The major mechanisms leading to angle closure include:

- Pupillary block

- Anomalies at the level of the iris and/or ciliary body. These anomalies may result in a plateau iris configuration.

- Thicker irisÂ 
- Anterior iris insertion
- Anterior ciliary body position
- Anteriorly positioned ciliary processes

- Anomalies at the level of the lens

- Cataract or lens intumescence
- Lens subluxation
- Microspherophakia

- Anomalies posterior to the lens

- Aqueous misdirection

- Other secondary causes

- Uveitis
- Trauma
- Iris neovascularization
- Surgery
- Iridociliary cysts or tumors
- Retinal gas or silicone oil tamponade
- Massive vitreous hemorrhage
- Iridocorneal endothelial syndrome
- Epithelial and/or fibrous ingrowth after surgery or trauma
- Uveal effusion
- Retinopathy of prematurity
- Congenital anomalies
