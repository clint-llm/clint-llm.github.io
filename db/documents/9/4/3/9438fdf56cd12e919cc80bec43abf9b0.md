As mentioned above, transmyocardial laser extravascular angiogenesis (TMLR) is used in patients with refractory angina. Refractory angina is caused by ischemic heart disease. TMLR is explicitly indicated in patients where CAD causes angina.Â For example, per ACC/AHA guidelines published in 2012, there is a class 2b indication for using TMLR as sole therapy in patients with disabling, medically unresponsive refractory angina with no other options available. The same guidelines indicate that TMLR-CABG combination does not improve survival in refractory angina patients. However, there may be a benefit in selected patients to relieve angina.
