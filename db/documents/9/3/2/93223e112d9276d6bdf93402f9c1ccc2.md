The presentation typically involves a history of new darkening or dark spots in the mouth, generally brown or black, well-circumscribed, flat, or raised.Almost half of the lesions are located on the buccal mucosa, followed by the palate and lips and, less commonly, the gums.

Because they exhibit radial growth, which can be rapid, they can often be mistaken for melanoma. Melanomas most commonly affect the hard palate.

A thorough oral exam to assess for the presence of multiple spots should be performed as well as a full skin exam to assess for concomitant nevi or suspicious melanotic lesions. These lesions tend to regress spontaneously and may be characterized by rapid growth before stabilization and regression. In rare instances, patients may present with diffuse oral pigmentation.

A family history of pigmented oral lesions or polyposis may suggest Peutz-Jegher syndrome.

The palate is more commonly affected by multifocal than by solitary lesions. Multifocal lesions are usually more black with a mean diameter of each lesion smaller than the solitary ones. The number of these lesions typically ranges between two and five.
