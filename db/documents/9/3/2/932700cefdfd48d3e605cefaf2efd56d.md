The retina is an extension of the optic nerve, also known as cranial nerve II. After light reaches the photoreceptor cells, rods and cones, action potentials are conveyed to the brain through the optic nerve. The optic nerve project through the optic stalks back into the optic chiasm, to the lateral geniculate nucleus, and to the visual cortex in the posterior occiput. The optic nerve is relatively close to the fovea, but at that point, there are no cones- this results in a blind spot.
