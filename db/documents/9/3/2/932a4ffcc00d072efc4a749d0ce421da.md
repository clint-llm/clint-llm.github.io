Platelets are acute-phase reactants, and secondary thrombocytosis can occur due to underlying infection (typically acute), tissue damage, chronic inflammatory disorders, and malignancy. A complete history and physical examination should be performed to exclude common causes of reactive thrombocytosis.

In patients with secondary thrombocytosis (reactive thrombocytosis) for whom the underlying causative condition has not been identified, a thorough workup should be done to exclude occult disorder (e.g., malignancy). Thrombocytosis occurs in a variety of clinical situations and can have diverse underlying etiologies. In certain patients differentiating primary from secondary causes of thrombocytosis can be difficult, yet the distinction has important therapeutic and prognostic implications. In those conditions, expert opinion from a hematologist is recommended. Patient education is essential and regular followup should be emphasized.
