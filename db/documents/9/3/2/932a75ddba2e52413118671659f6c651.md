Alternobaric vertigo is a benign condition that affects individuals traveling in environments with changing ambient pressures, such as scuba diving or aviation, though it has also been reported in patients utilizing positive airway pressure breathing assistance. It is the direct result of incongruence in middle ear pressures caused by incomplete or insufficient equalization, typically while moving from an area of higher pressure to one of lower pressure. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of alternobaric vertigo.
- Describe the history and physical exam findings typically seen in patients with alternobaric vertigo.
- Summarize the treatment options for alternobaric vertigo.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by alternobaric vertigo.
