Acute calcium pyrophosphate arthritis is generally self-limited, and the inflammation usually resolves within days to weeks of treatment.

Patients with chronic CPP inflammatory arthritis may present overlapping manifestations with rheumatoid arthritis, such as morning stiffness, localized edema, and decreased range of motion. Some patients also present tenosynovitis with carpal or cubital tunnel syndrome.

Patients with underlying joint comorbidities, such as osteoarthritis, have an increased risk for acute CPP arthritis. When deposited, CPP crystals activate the immune system, promoting inflammation and fibrocartilage injury.
