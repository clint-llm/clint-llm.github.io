Statins play an essential role in lowering the plasma concentrations of atherogenic lipids and in the prevention of clinical ASCVD. It is vital for healthcare professionals to educate patients about the benefits of statins and the importance of medication adherence. Additionally, patients need education about the side effects of statins to help improve their adherence to medication.

Clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs) will prescribe these drugs and decide both which agent as well as the dose based on the patient's lipid status. Nurses will often offer initial counseling to the patient as they start statin therapy, and can be the first line on monitoring treatment success, medication adherence, and the presence of adverse medication effects.Â  Pharmacist involvement comes in the form of verifying the agent selected, checking the dose, and performing medication reconciliation, as well as counseling on optimal administration and monitoring for adverse events. In both cases, nurses and pharmacists should report any concerns they encounter to the rest of the healthcare team.

The medical personnel, including the physicians, specialists, nurse practitioners, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, should all work collaboratively as an interprofessional team when administering statin therapy. All parties must be aware of the drug interactions and take a proper medication history before initiating statins. [Level V]
