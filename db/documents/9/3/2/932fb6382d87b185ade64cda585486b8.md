It is imperative to obtain a thorough history focusing on identifying some underlying cause of glomerulonephritis, such as systemic disease or recent infection. Mostly, the patient with acute glomerulonephritis is from the pediatric age group, aged 2-14 years, who acutely develops periorbital puffiness and facial swelling in the background of a post-streptococcal infection. The urine is usually dark, frothy, or scanty, and the blood pressure may be high. Nonspecific symptoms include generalized weakness, fever, abdominal discomfort, and malaise.

With acute glomerulonephritis associated with staphylococcal infection, the patient is more likely to be a middle-aged or older male, often diagnosed with diabetes mellitus.

History should be taken about the onset and duration of the disease. Symptom onset is often abrupt. In acute postinfectious GN, there is usually a latent period of up to three weeks before clinical presentation. However, the latent period varies; it is typically one to two weeks for the cases that occur after a pharyngeal infection and two to four weeks where post-dermal infection, such as pyoderma, is the cause. Nephritis occurs within one to four days of streptococcal infection usually means preexisting kidney disease.

Identifying a possible etiologic agent is important. Recent fever, sore throat, arthralgias, hepatitis, valve replacement, travel, or intravenous drug use may be associated.

As the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is decreased, symptoms like edema and hypertension occur, majorly due to the subsequent salt and water retention caused by the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

A) Some symptoms occur primarily and include:

- Hypertension

- Edema (peripheral or periorbital) - initially in the dependent areas/areas with low tissue tension

- Abnormal urinary sedimentation

- Hematuria – microscopic or gross

- Oliguria

- Azotemia

- Shortness of breath or dyspnea on exertion

- Headache - secondary to hypertension

- Confusion - secondary to malignant hypertension

- Possible flank pain

B) Or there can be symptoms specifically related to an underlying systemic disease:

- Triad of sinusitis, pulmonary infiltrates, and nephritis – granulomatosis with polyangiitis

- Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, purpura -  Henoch-Schönlein purpura

- Arthralgias - systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

- Hemoptysis - Goodpasture syndrome or idiopathic progressive glomerulonephritis

- Skin rashes – in hypersensitivity vasculitis, SLE, cryoglobulinemia, Henoch-Schönlein purpura

Patients often have an unremarkable physical examination; however, they may present with a triad of edema, hypertension, and oliguria.

The provider should look for the following signs of excess fluid in the body:

- Periorbital and/or peripheral edema

- High blood pressure

- Fine inspiratory crackles due to pulmonary edema

- Raised jugular venous pressure

- Ascites and pleural effusion

Other signs to look for include the following:

- Vasculitic rash (as with Henoch-Schönlein purpura, or lupus nephritis)

- Pallor

- Renal angle fullness or tenderness

- Abnormal neurologic examination or altered sensorium

- Arthritis
