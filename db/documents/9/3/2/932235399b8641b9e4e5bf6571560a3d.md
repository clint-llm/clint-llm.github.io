**Differential Diagnosis of Hyphema**

- Traumatic hyphema

- Hyphema secondary to intraocular procedures

- Herpetic keratouveitis (blood-stained hypopyon) - secondary to HSV and VZV virus.

- UGH (uveitis glaucoma hyphema) syndrome

- Uveitis

- Fuch's heterochromic iridocyclitis (Amsler sign - hemorrhage in the aspirated fluid from vitreous tapping or anterior chamber paracentesis due to iris atrophy. It is supposed to be due to rupture of fragile iris vasculature because of iris atrophy)

- Juvenile xanthogranuloma

- Hyphema due to neovascularization of iris and angle secondary to severe retinal ischemia secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy, CRVO, Ocular ischemic syndrome.

**Differential Diagnosis of Vitreous Hemorrhage**

- Vitritis (associated findings should be ruled out like keratic precipitates, anterior chamber reaction, posterior synechiae, festooned pupil, complicated cataract. The fundus should be screened to rule out chorioretinitis, retinitis, choroiditis, vasculitis, exudative retinal detachment)

- Primary intraocular lymphoma (Masquerade Syndrome)

- Endophytic (retinoblastoma in children)

- Asteroid Hyalosis(not visually depriving)

- Retinal detachment(It has to be differentiated from posterior hyaloid detachment associated with vitreous hemorrhage on B scan ultrasonography).

**Differential Diagnosis of Retinal Hemorrhages**

- Retinal hemorrhages seen in children could be due to vacuum or forceps delivery, birth trauma, Secondary to Shaken baby syndrome, Coats' disease, PHPV(Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous), Retinopathy of Prematurity, Hematological disorders like severe anemia, sickle cell retinopathy.

- Retinal hemorrhages in adults could be due to trauma, Diabetic retinopathy, Hypertensive retinopathy, Retinal venous occlusion, Ocular ischemic syndrome, sickle cell retinopathy, juxtafoveal telangiectasia, retinal microaneurysm, raised intracranial tension, bleeding or coagulation disorders, Valsalva retinopathy.

- If Roth spots are seen, thorough systemic evaluation to rule out the cause for the same should be done.

**Differential Diagnosis of Disc Hemorrhages**

Linear hemorrhages along the disc margin should be differentiated from other causes of hemorrhages apart from glaucoma, which includes the following:

- Posterior vitreous detachment from disc area

- ischemic optic neuropathies

- Grade IV hypertensive retinopathy

- Diabetic papillopathy

- Systemic hypertension

- Leukemia

- SLE

- Vascular anomaly at the disc

**Differential Diagnosis of Suprachoroidal Hemorrhage**

- Retrobulbar hemorrhage

- Choroidal effusion (Serous type)

- Hemorrhagic choroidal detachment

- Acute angle-closure glaucoma

- Choroidal hemangioma

- Posterior scleritis

**Differential Diagnosis of Macular Hemorrhage**

- Choroidal neovascularisation secondary to age-related Macular Degeneration

- Type I(under the RPE),
- type II (under the neurosensory retina),
- type III (RAP lesion)

- High myopia

- Idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy

- Choroidal rupture secondary to trauma

- Angiod streaks

- Presumed ocular histoplasmosis (POHS)

- Chorioretinitis or retinochoroiditis

- Secondary to laser photocoagulation

- Secondary to intraocular foreign body

- Ruptured retinal artery microaneurysm

- Valsalva retinopathy

- Anemic retinopathy

- Leukemic retinopathy

- Secondary to an intraocular tumor (primary or metastatic)

- Secondary to diabetic retinopathy and retinal venous occlusion

- Secondary to bleeding and coagulation disorders.
