**Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus**

Increased CSF with concomitant ventriculomegaly, causes this condition; hence, intracranial pressure appears within normal or levels at high normal. However, slightly elevated ICP may be recorded with continuous ICP monitoring. This often affects subjects older than 65 years and presents with the triad of gait abnormalities, urinary incontinence, and dementia. This triad is from where the mnemonic "wobbly, wet, and wacky" comes.
