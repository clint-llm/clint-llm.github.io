The differential diagnosis for acute kidney injury associated with nephrotic range proteinuria and a low C3 level and a positive cANCA was confusing as ANCA related vasculitis is not associated with low complements and his infectious and autoimmune workup typically causing low complements was negative.

His differential diagnosis included:

**Vasculitis**

Vasculitis including granulomatosis with polyangiitis, polyarteritis nodosa, Churg-Strauss Syndrome, IgA vasculitis, cryoglobulinemia, immune complex-associated vasculitis (infectious, SLE, or drug hypersensitivity), giant cell arteritis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

**Glomerular Disease**

Primary Glomerular Disease due to:

- Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis

- Membranous nephropathy

- Other proliferative glomerulonephritides (focal, “pure mesangial,” IgA nephropathy)

- Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and dense deposit disease

- Minimal change disease

Secondary Glomerular Disease due to:

- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

- Drugs (NSAIDs, penicillamine, heroin)

- Infection (schistosomiasis, malaria, syphilis, hepatitis B & C, HIV)

- Malignant disease (carcinoma, lymphoma)

- Diabetes mellitus

- Hereditary nephritis.
