Outcomes in cases of ocular sarcoidosis depend on several variables such as the severity of disease, chronicity of disease, time of presentation to healthcare facilities, and secondary complications due to long-standing ocular inflammation.

Irreversible loss of vision usually occurs due to glaucoma and chronic maculopathy. In a prospective study by Edelsten et al., it was noted that the prognosis of sarcoid uveitis is not affected by extraocular disease. The presence of the HLA DQB1*0201 allele is proven to be protective against severe sarcoidosis.

Prognostic factors for poor visual outcomes include black race, delayed presentation to a subspecialist, glaucoma, intermediate or posterior uveitis, cystoid macular edema, and use of systemic steroids. The overall mortality from sarcoidosis may reach 5% or even 10% with neurosarcoidosis. Poor prognostic factors in sarcoidosis include female gender (compared to male), early-onset disease, African-American ethnicity, chronic sarcoidosis, Annexin A11 gene, HLA-DQB1*1501, HLA-DQB1*0602, pulmonary fibrosis, poor pulmonary function test, optic nerve involvement, panuveitis, lupus pernio, chronic arthritis, and stage 3 or 4 of the disease in radiography.
