Imaging has become an essential tool in the management of patients with ocular trauma. The use of CT imaging increased from 3 million scans in 1980 to more than 60 million in 2005. The use of MRI nearly tripled between 1997 and 2006. There are now many different imaging modalities available, and each has its advantages. While CT is traditionally the imaging modality of choice for most cases of ocular trauma, it is important to be aware of the newer and less invasive modalities such as ultrasound and ASOCT. Overuse of imaging can be harmful, leading to unnecessary radiation exposure, incidentalomas, patient anxiety, increased length of stay in the emergency room, and waste resources.

For both the emergency physician and the ophthalmologist, it is important to understand the indications for each imaging study and to be able to communicate them to the radiologist. Several ocular emergencies require urgent intervention, and imaging plays a key part in the medical decision-making process. Streamlined and efficient use of imaging can be vision and life-saving.
