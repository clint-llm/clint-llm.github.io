Chronic pain is the main cause of disability in the United States, and based on National Institute of Health report in 1998, lost jobs, healthcare costs, and lost productivity due to chronic pain cost estimated $100 billion annually. Usually, chronic pain cannot be prevented, but by staying in a good physical and mental health, individuals can reduce the risk of CNCP. There are multiple studies of chronic pain models:

- Persistent post-surgical pain (PPP)

- Persistent post-trauma pain (PTP)

- Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN)

Diagnosing and treating the underlying cause of nervous tissue injury is vital. In one instance, using antiviral in early treatment of herpes zoster known to impair DNA replication of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) virus reduces the risk of occurrence of PHN. Also, an effort to limit tissue injury during procedures, careful dissection, the least invasive surgical approaches, and multimodal pharmacological methods to target the underlying mechanism of neuropathic pain are recommended to prevent PPP and PTP incidence.[14]

Studies have shown benefits of using gabapentin preoperatively for procedures like hysterectomies, thyroidectomies, and mastectomies to reduce the need for post-surgery analgesics and to reduce the incidence of PPP. In one study of patients with total knee arthroscopy (TKA), pre-surgery administration of pregabalin for 2 weeks resulted in the reduction of postoperative and chronic neuropathic pain at both 3 and 6 months, postoperatively. There was 0% incidence in the pregabalin group compared to the placebo group (8.7% and 5.2% at 3 and 6 months respectively).[15]
