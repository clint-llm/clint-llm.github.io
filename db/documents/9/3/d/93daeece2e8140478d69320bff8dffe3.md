Any clinician (MD, DO, NP, PA) can prescribe losartan for the treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. However, clinicians should follow the patients and regularly monitor their renal function and blood pressure. The drug is effective for hypertension and can be part of long-term therapy. However, it still requires the participation of an interprofessional team to optimize treatment. When initially prescribed, a pharmacist should verify appropriate dosing, perform medication reconciliation, and can counsel the patient about the drug. Nursing can also provide valuable patient counseling, as well as answer questions and assess therapeutic effectiveness on subsequent visits.Â  If the pharmacist or nursing staff encounter any concerns, they should report these to the prescriber promptly so that therapeutic adjustments can take place. This interprofessional team approach to losartan therapy can optimize patient outcomes while minimizing potential adverse effects. [Level 5]
