An interprofessional team educates and manages the patient with chronic rejection. The team consists of primary care, medical and surgical specialists, specialty trained nurses, and pharmacists. Since this conditionÂ is life-threatening, the health care providers should advise the patient fully about all other treatment options, psychological support, and in extreme circumstances, consideration for an organ or tissue re-transplantation. Nephrology, cardiology, and transplant nurses provide education to patients and their families, monitor patient status, and direct feedback to the team. Pharmacists evaluate prescribed medications, check for drug-drug interactions, and participate in patient education. In this way, the team can improve outcomes. [Level 5]
