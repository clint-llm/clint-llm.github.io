Patients taking diclofenac should be monitored frequently for symptomatic relief to maintain the lowest effective dose to limit the emergence of potential adverse effects. Blood pressure requires regular monitoring to assess the possible development of hypertension. Symptoms of GI distress, including the development of symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and lower GI bleeds, should be assessed in patients. Prescribers should observe renal function due to the adverse effects involving kidney perfusion. Regular blood testing including complete blood count (CBC) is crucial to monitor potential adverse effects on platelet function and count and subsequent risk of bleeds. Regular liver function testing is also necessary.
