Clinical trials have demonstrated brexanolone as generally well tolerated. The most common adverse effects associated with brexanolone are dizziness, sedation/somnolence, xerostomia, loss of consciousness, and hot flushes.

In patients whose symptoms of postpartum depression worsen or develop suicidal ideation or behavior, providers should consider changing the therapeutic regimen or stopping brexanolone completely.

At the highest recommended infusion rate of 90 mcg/kg/hour, brexanolone causes a minimal increase in the QTc interval.
