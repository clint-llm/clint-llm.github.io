Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) is a commonÂ occurrence in old age. It is defined as the separation of the cortical vitreous from the neurosensory layer of the retina. The posterior vitreous detachment was first narrated histopathologically by Muller in 1856 and clinically by Briere in 1875, but it was not explored thoroughly until 1914.

Vitreous humor is a gel-like substance that is present amid the lens and the retina. The composition of vitreous humor includes water (98%), type 2 collagen, and hyaluronic acid.

Posterior vitreous detachment is the most common cause of primary symptomatic floaters. Floaters are small cobweb shaped particles emerging from a compact collagen matrix of the posterior vitreous cortex.
