**Interpretation of DLCO**

- 
**DLCO= Va X Kco**

**Va:**number of contributing alveolar units measured by tracer gas (helium)

**Kco:**CO transfer coefficient, usually written as**DLCO/Va,**which indicates the efficiency of CO transfer by alveoli.

A decrease in DLCO will be due to a decrease in Va, Kco, or both.

**Low DLCO and Low KCO**: seen in COPD with emphysema due to alveolar destruction (usually normal in chronic bronchitis) with an obstructive pattern on PFT.

Smoking can also cause a decrease in DLCO.

**DLCO and KCo are also reduced**in interstitial lung diseases, pulmonary fibrosis due to the thickening of the alveolar-capillary membrane with a restrictive pattern on PFT.

A **normal DLCO**with a restrictive pattern on PFT suggests neuromuscular or chest wall disorder.****

In dyspnea cases of unknown etiology, the pattern of **normal spirometry with low DLCO**increases the likelihood of pulmonary vascular disease. However, this pattern may also present in other disorders, e.g., mild ILD.

**High DLCO**is seen in conditions like obesity, asthma, which are characterized by large lung volumes.
