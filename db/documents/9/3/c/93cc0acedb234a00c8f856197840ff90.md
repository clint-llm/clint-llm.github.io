In the acute setting, receiving opioids for a very short duration is not likely to induce a substance use disorder. A single event of opioid toxicity likely by itself will not produce substance use disorder either. Once the opioid wears off, patients are predicted to regain normal physiology and capacity to do activities of daily living, provided the toxicity event did not result in hypoxic organ injury. Although there are claims that single doses of opioids by themselves created a cascade of disordered use, this appears to be quite rare. The more opioid doses a given patent receives, the more chance they have of expressing an opioid use disorder.

It requires emphasis that there is a clear difference between the opioid user with prescribed, legal, controlled dosing increases in the setting of tolerance and true opioid use disorder. According to the DSM-5, to qualify as opioid use disorder, a patient must express at least some of the following features: longer consumption than expected, inability to tolerate reduced dosing, a great deal of time spent in pursuit of opioids, craving, use interferes with social obligations, use causes interpersonal problems, physically hazardous use, continued use despite pathologic consequences of use, tolerance causing a need for increased dosing for similar effects, and characteristic withdrawal state when use is reduced or stopped. The more criteria the patient has, the more likely they are to have opioid use disorder. As of early 2019, there is growing literature evidence supporting medications such as methadone or buprenorphine to stabilize opioid use disordered patients and make relapse and future opioid toxicity/overdose events less likely. Detoxification to the point of abstinence from all forms of opioids, including avoidance of such medications as buprenorphine or methadone, does not seem to provide the same relapse prevention advantage.
