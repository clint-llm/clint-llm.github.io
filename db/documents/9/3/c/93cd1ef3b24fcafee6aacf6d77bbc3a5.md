Different causes of steatorrhea lead to different complications. Following are some complications that can occur due to steatorrhea:

- Weight loss in adults and other consequences of malnutrition such as increased susceptibility to infections, and increased morbidity and mortality from various disease states. Additionally, in children, malnutrition results in growth failure and poor neurological development

- Deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K)

- Poor bone health resulting in osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fractures (CF, celiac disease)

- Iron deficiency anemia, zinc deficiency (celiac disease)

- Dermatitis herpetiformis, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, adenocarcinoma of the upper gastrointestinal tract (celiac disease)

- Megaloblastic anemia due to B12 deficiency (in terminal ileum disease and SIBO)

- Pancreatic pseudocyst, ascites, splenic vein thrombosis, diabetes, pancreatic cancer (chronic pancreatitis)

- Seizure, osteopenia, ataxia, early bruising, headache, hyposplenism, and tetany (celiac disease)

- Cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease (PBC, PSC), malignancies such as cholangiocarcinoma, colon cancer in PSC
