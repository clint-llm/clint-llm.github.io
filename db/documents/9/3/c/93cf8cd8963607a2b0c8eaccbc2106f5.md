Thumb sucking can be characterized by the frequency, intensity, and duration of the habit. The duration of the force in the thumb/digit is more critical than its magnitude, and the resting pressure has the greatest impact on the position of the tooth. Thumb sucking can lead to dentoalveolar and skeletal malformations.
