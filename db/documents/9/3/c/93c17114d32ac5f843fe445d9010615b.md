NODAT can cause similar complications to traditional DM, including neuropathy, ophthalmopathy, nephropathy, ketoacidosis, and episodes of hypoglycemia. Even though these manifestations are similar to DM, the rate at which they occur is remarkably accelerated. Other than the increased risk of transplant rejection, there is a higher incidence of infection and late cardiovascular events, which leads to a higher mortality rate.
