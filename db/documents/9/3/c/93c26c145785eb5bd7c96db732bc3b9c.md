The complications of pica can be categorized according to the type of substance ingested:

- Geophagia: Clay ingestion is a very common form of pica. It can lead to constipation, hypokalemia with myopathy, and nutritional deficiencies.

- Pagophagia: Ice ingestion could lead to iron deficiency, especially during pregnancy.

- Amylophagia: Excessive starch consumption has been associated with iron deficiency. It also can cause high blood sugar and obesity due to its high carbohydrate content.

- Other substances: Ingested materials can contain a wide variety of toxic contaminants such as lead, mercury, arsenic, fluoride, and many others. Exposure to such items can lead to a wide range of toxic effects such as lead poisoning.

**Fetal Toxicity**

Pica during pregnancy can have dire consequences on the growing fetus. There are case reports of intrauterine toxicity due to maternal pica. Lead poisoning has been implicated in long-term neurological disability.
