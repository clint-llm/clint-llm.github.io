Rubella needs to be distinguished from other infections with similar maculopapular rashes, including measles, human herpesvirus 6 and 7, infectious mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus, arboviruses (Zika virus, West Nile fever, Ross River fever, and Chikungunya virus), enteroviruses, scarlet fever, and mycoplasma infection. Other conditions to be considered in the differential diagnosis for rubella are non-infectious causes like Kawasaki disease, drug eruption, and contact dermatitis.
