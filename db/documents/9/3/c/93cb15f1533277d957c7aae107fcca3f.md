Research on the adverse effects of common cerebral perfusion radiopharmaceuticals is extremely limited. Generally speaking, adverse reactions to radiopharmaceuticals include flushing, nausea, and pain at the injection site. There are very few reports of anaphylaxis secondary to radiopharmaceutical administration.

Adverse reactions to augmenting pharmaceuticals such as acetazolamide are much more common. The most common side effects associated with intravenous acetazolamide include flushing, paresthesias, perioral numbness, headache, and rarely anaphylaxis.
