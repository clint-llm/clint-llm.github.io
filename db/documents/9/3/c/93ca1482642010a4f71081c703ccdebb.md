There is little documentation on the complications of McRobert’s maneuver in the current literature. However, there are several reported cases which highlight the possible complications which may arise.  One potential complication is that of lower extremity neuropathy. Lower extremity neuropathy results from prolonged compression of the femoral nerve beneath the inguinal ligament, which can lead to decreased hip flexion and knee extension on the ipsilateral side of the injury.  Another complication which may arise is symphyseal separation.  This complication results from excessive abduction of the hips. The literature notes surgical management with internal fixation was necessary. The last documented complication of McRobert’s maneuver involved a case of sacroiliac joint dislocation.  The resolution of the dislocation required using closed reduction by an orthopedic team.  These complications were all cited with excessive time spent performing the McRobert’s technique.
