After a thorough history and physical, the evaluation needs to be complemented with laboratory analysis. The blood work should include hemoglobin A1C to screen for insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus type 2. A lipid panel should also be drawn to assess for abnormally elevated triglyceride level, low HDL level, and elevated low-density lipoprotein level. The initial evaluation should also include a basic metabolic panel to evaluate for renal dysfunction and examine glucose level. Further studies such as C-reactive protein, liver panel, thyroid study, and uric acid can be drawn to investigate the existence of further and support the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. Imaging studies can be ordered when appropriate. For instance, anyone suspected to have atherosclerotic coronary artery disease should have an electrocardiogram to evaluate for signs of cardiac ischemia, infarct, arrhythmias,  as well as evaluate for hypertension with structural heart disease. If warranted, patients should be evaluated further with cardiac stress testing including electrocardiogram stress test, stress echocardiography, stress single-photon emission computed tomography or myocardial perfusion imaging.
