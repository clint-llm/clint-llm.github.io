Exercise-associated collapse (EAC) is defined as the inability to stand or walk unaided during or after the completion of strenuous exercise.

Prompt differentiation of EAC from other exertional illnesses is critical, as it is a generally benign condition that can present similarly to other means of exertional falls.Â These presentations include sudden cardiac arrest, exertional heat stroke, exercise-associated hyponatremia, and exercise collapse associated with sickle cell trait (ECAST). A simple treatment of oral fluids and assisted walking, where medical personnel walk collapsing runners in designated safe areas, reduces the incidents of medical interventions related to EAC.
