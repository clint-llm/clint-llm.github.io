Urgent utilization of neuroimaging is recommended for cases of severe acute radiculopathy. Severe symptoms include progressive worsening of neurological deficits, suspected underlying neoplasm, epidural abscess, or cauda equina syndrome.

MRI of the lumbosacral spine is the most useful imaging to identify underlying pathology and the need for surgical intervention. An MRI can be more useful to distinguish between inflammatory, malignant, or vascular disorders when compared to a CT scan. The recommendation is for an MRI with contrast unless otherwise contraindicated when evaluating lumbar radiculopathy. When imaging is either equivocal or negative with high suspicion for radiculopathy, nerve conduction studies are warranted. A CT is a poor test for nerve root visualization, making it challenging to diagnose radicular disease. Standard CT scans are better than MRI to assess bony structures.

The use of CT myelography is when the patient has either a contraindication for an MRI such as having a pacemaker device or defibrillator or when a standard CT or MRI is negative or equivocal. Myelography is a CT scan or an MRI with intrathecal administration of contrast. CT myelography visualizes a patient's spinal nerve roots in their passage through the neuroforamina. CT myelography can be used to assess the underlying root sleeve. A unique population for whom to recommend a CT myelogram is patients with surgical spinal hardware.

More advanced tests, such as EMG or nerve conduction studies, are accurate only after three weeks of persistent symptoms. This is because they depend on fibrillation potentials after an acute injury, which does not develop until two to three weeks following injury.

When the origin of the patient's pain is thought to be from the dorsal rami, such as the case of pain originating from the paraspinal muscles, EMG can help make the diagnosis.

The usefulness of EMG is to help distinguish neurogenic weakness from the decreased muscular effort or muscle inhibition due to pain.

A nerve conduction study or an EMG helps to localize specific nerve roots that are damaged. These diagnostic tests can also help distinguish between new and old nerve damage and support the presence of demyelination at a nerve level leading to a conduction block.

Cerebrospinal fluid analysis is another useful test for a suspected neoplasm or infectious cause or radiculopathy symptoms. The recommendation for a lumbar puncture is progressive neurological symptoms, negative or non-diagnostic neuroimaging, without known primary cancer, and failure of prompt improvement.

A systematic review found insufficient evidence to support the use of somatosensory evoked potentials in helping make the diagnosis of radiculopathy.

Discography, a diagnostic modality with the injection of contrast into the nucleus of the disc under fluoroscopy, has also not demonstrated usefulness in the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy.
