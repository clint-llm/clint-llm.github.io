The severity of illness may range from a mild respiratory tract infection to a diphtheria-like illness. Pharyngitis and pharyngeal erythema are present in nearly all patients. About half of patients will also experience fever, tender bilateral anterior cervical or submandibular adenopathy, and an erythematous rash. The rash appears as diffuse erythematous blanching papules often described as “sandpaper-like.” It begins on the distal extremities then spreads centrally, affecting mostly the neck, chest, and back while sparing the face, palms, and soles. The pharyngitis usually presents 1 to 4 days before the rash, and the rash persists between 2 to 5 days. Clinically, symptoms resemble scarlet fever due to Streptococcus pyogenes; however, there is no strawberry tongue.A. haemolyticum can have complications such as Lemierre disease.

In patients with cutaneous symptoms, A. haemolyticum infections present as chronic skin ulcers, abscesses, or cellulitis. They are often found co-infected most commonly with other gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium diphtheria, or streptococci.A. haemolyticum infections.

Though less common, reports of A. haemolyticum infections may be complicated and have been reported to cause brain abscesses, pneumonia, infective endocarditis, pyothorax, and bacteremia.
