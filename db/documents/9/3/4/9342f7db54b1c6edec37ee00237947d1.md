March fractures are best managed by an interprofessional team that also includes nurses and physical therapists. The key is to prevent them in the first place. Patients need to be educated on the importance of stretching prior to exercise. In addition, correcting predisposing biomechanical conditions such as gait training and arch supports can be beneficial.

The outcomes for most patients are good, but recurrence is not uncommon. Failure to diagnose a march fracture can lead to non-union and moderate disability.
