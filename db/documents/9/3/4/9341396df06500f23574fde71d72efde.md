Glass ionomer cement (GIC) is a self-adhesive restorative material.

GIC was first described in the literature by Wilson and Kent in 1972Â and has evolved gradually since then to improve its properties and broaden its uses. It is used for the cementation of fixed dental prosthesis (FDPs), orthodontic bands and brackets, and as liners or bases, as core build-up material, to restore carious and non-carious lesions, as pit and fissure sealant, and for atraumatic restorative technique (ART).
