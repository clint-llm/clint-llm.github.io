There are few recent longitudinal studies on spina bifida and long-term outcomes which makes it difficult to prognosticate for patients given the significant improvements in spina bifida management. Most studies also combine data from patients with both open and closed dysraphisms. Overall, the prognosis depends mostly on the presence of hydrocephalus, level of defect, and severity of Chiari malformation. A recent study showed that survivability up to 1 year of age was about 71% overall. Of those with and without hydrocephalus, 56% and 88% survived beyond age 1, respectively. The rates of survival drop slightly as patients with hydrocephalus age, to about 50% by age 20.
