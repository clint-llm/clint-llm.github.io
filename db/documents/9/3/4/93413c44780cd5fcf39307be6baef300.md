Histopathology of arterial vessels that contain thrombosis shows an area of fibrin with numerous platelets and leukocytes. Older layers tend to have fewer leucocytes compared to a new area. Red blood cells could also be present, and these lines are called lines of Zahn. In the arterial histopathology, there is usually a fibrous cap atheroma, which could contain a lipid-rich necrotic core.
