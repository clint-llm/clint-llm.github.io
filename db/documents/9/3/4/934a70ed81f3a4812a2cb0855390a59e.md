Blood volume is necessary to maintain adequate perfusion to all of the tissues in the body. Nearly all cells in the body require replenishment of nutrients and a removal system for waste, both of which the blood provides. When a tissue loses its blood supply, ischemia occurs, potentially leading to an infarct after some time. Depending on the location of this tissue, an infarct could have a fatal effect. An infarct of the heart isÂ a myocardial infarction; an infarct of cerebral tissue is a stroke.

Blood volume also functions in the maintenance of body osmolality. Osmolality refers to the balance of solutes and water within a solution, in this case, the blood. A properly functioning system maintains an osmolality of 275 to 295 mOsm/kg of water through water and sodium manipulation, primarily at the kidney.
