Young syndrome, also named sinusitis-infertility syndrome, is named after urologist Dr. Donald Young who first observed this condition. It is a rare inherited syndrome similar to Kartagener syndrome and often presents in middle-aged men with chronic rhinosinusitis, reduced fertility due to azoospermia, and bronchiectasis. Its prevalence is comparable to Klinefelter syndrome and is one of the causes of both chronic sinopulmonary infections and azoospermia. Spermatogenesis is normal, and the reduced fertility is due to obstruction of sperm transport down the genital tract.
