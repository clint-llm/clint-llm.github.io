Herpes gingivostomatitis is generally a mild and self-limited condition, and supportive care is generally adequate. Barrier lip creams such as petroleum jelly have been suggested to prevent adhesions in patients with active herpetic gingivostomatitis. The most important component in the management of herpetic gingivostomatitis is hydration. Adequate hydration is often achieved with pain control; thus, analgesics such as oral acetaminophen and oral rinses are encouraged to make the patient more comfortable and promote fluid intake. It is important to note that patients who are unable to drink to maintain proper hydration should be hospitalized. Other indications for hospitalization include immunocompromised children, patients who developÂ eczema herpeticum, and HSV spread that results in encephalitis or pneumonitis.

Several studies suggest the usage of acyclovir cream or oral suspension in a rinse and swallow technique.
