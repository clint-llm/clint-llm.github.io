Due to its vast web of nerve fibers, the celiac plexus is also called the solar plexus. Many abdominal organs receive autonomic innervation via the celiac plexus, including the liver, gallbladder, stomach, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, small bowel, and the first two-thirds of the large bowel.

The celiac plexus comprises the celiac, aorticorenal, and superior mesenteric ganglia and is positioned anterolateral to the aortic diaphragmatic crus at the level of the L1 vertebra. The celiac plexus consists of parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves. Sympathetic innervation of the celiac plexus originates from the anterolateral horns of the spinal cord at levelsÂ T5 to T12.
