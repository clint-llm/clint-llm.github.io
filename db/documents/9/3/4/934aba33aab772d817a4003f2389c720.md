Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL) is the most common B-cell lymphoma of the skin and has an excellent prognosis. It can be confused with secondary involvement by systemic follicular lymphoma, Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma - Leg Type, reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, and primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma. Immunohistochemical studies and cytogenetics can help determine a diagnosis of PCFCL. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of PCFCL and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the histopathological findings of primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL).
- Describe the immunohistochemical staining pattern of primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL), the cytogenetics, and how to differentiate it from mimickers.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL) and review how the location of the lesion(s) can affect prognosis.
- Summarize some interprofessional strategies that will drive improved patient outcomes in cases of primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL).
