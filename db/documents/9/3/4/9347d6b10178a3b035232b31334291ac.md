High-altitude pulmonary edema is largely preventable for most individuals with a slow rate of ascent and adequate time to acclimatize to the altitude. Maintain a high index of suspicion, with early attention to those developing even mild symptoms such as cough or decreased exercise tolerance at altitude. If diagnosed early, patients may be able to pause ascent until symptoms resolve fully and then continue activities at a slowed rate. Shortness of breath at rest, especially at night, is highly suspicious for developing HAPE in an otherwise healthy individual.

Supplemental oxygen, if available, should be the first-line therapy in conjunction with descent for anyone suffering from more than mild symptoms. Logistics of treating HAPE in the wilderness may dictate what therapy is most appropriate. Oxygen is difficult to carry on a trek, and an oxygen concentrator may not be available. Portable hyperbaric oxygen chambers are easier to transport than oxygen and may be the best option for treatment in austere environments.

Nifedipine, sildenafil, tadalafil, and dexamethasone are useful for HAPE prophylaxis in known HAPE susceptible individuals. However, their role in the treatment of HAPE is limited. Dexamethasone shows no utility in the treatment of HAPE. These should not be used as monotherapy unless oxygen, hyperbaricÂ therapy, and descent are all impossible.
