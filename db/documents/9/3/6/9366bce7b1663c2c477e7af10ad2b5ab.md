The neural crest cells are the origin of the peripheral sensory nervous system. Neural crest cells are the detached cells of the neural plate as it separates from overlaying ectoderm. These cells give rise to the peripheral neurons with cell bodies and Schwann cells. A pair of dorsal root ganglia develop in a craniocaudal succession generating seven cervical, twelve thoracic, five lumbar, five sacral, and one pair of coccygeal dorsal root ganglia. Studies have shown that survival and differentiation of dorsal root ganglion cells rely on growth factors secreted by the neural tube including nerve growth factor, neurotrophin-3, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).
