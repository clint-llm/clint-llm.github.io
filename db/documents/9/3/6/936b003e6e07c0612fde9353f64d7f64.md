The formation of this tumor may be linked to brain development. Studies suggest that the disease process is created by particular cells that exist in very high concentrations, while the cerebral tissue is developing. This theory is supported by the fact that this tumor rarely occurs in adults and almost always occurs in mid-childhood (ages 5Â to 10), a period in which the cerebral tissue is very active in development. The model has identified the neural precursor-like cell population in the normal human ventral pons that is linked both anatomically and temporally to the incidence of DIPG.

On the molecular level, recent advances in the biological understanding of the disease have identified the H3K27M mutation in nearly 80% of DIPGs, leading to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of diffuse midline glioma H3K27M-mutant, a grade IV brainstem tumor.
