Nephrotic syndrome is an important chronic disease in children. The estimated annual incidence of nephrotic syndrome in healthy children is two to seven new cases per 100,000 children less than 18 years of age. It is more common in boys than girls at younger ages, but once adolescence is reached, there is no significant difference between genders. Increased incidence and more severe diseases are seen in African American and Hispanic populations.

We will look at the statistics from different regions of the world.

**United States Statistics**

Diabetic nephropathy associated with nephrotic syndrome is most common, with an estimated rate of around 50 cases per million population. In the pediatric population, nephrotic syndrome could occur at a rate of 20 cases per million.

**International Statistics**

In India and Turkey, biopsy results in children with nephrotic syndrome have revealed similar histology types compared to what would be expected in Western countries.

In parts of the Middle East and Africa, glomerular diseases have also been linked with urogenital schistosomal infection.

Doe et al. reported causes of nephrotic syndrome in the African pediatric population where kidney biopsy most often revealed typical histologic findings, such as minimal change disease and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis.

**Race-, sex-, and Age-related Demographics**

Because diabetes mellitus is one of the major causes of nephrotic syndrome, American Indians, African Americans, and Hispanics have an increased incidence of nephrotic syndrome than White persons. HIV-associated nephropathy is a consequence of HIV infection that is uncommon in Whites; however, it is frequently seen in African Americans because of their greater prevalence of the ApoL1 alleles.
