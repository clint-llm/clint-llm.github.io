The precise pathophysiology of sympathetic ophthalmia is not clearly understood; however, most evidence points to an autoimmune inflammatory process secondary to ocular injury following trauma or surgery.

Disruption of this system in penetrating injuries results in exposure of previously sequestered ocular antigens to local conjunctival lymphatics resulting in activation of cell-mediated immunity, a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction.

Though no singular culprit has been identified as the antigen responsible for sympathetic ophthalmia, several ocular antigens have been implicated, including arrestin (S-antigen), recoverin, rhodopsin, melanocyte-associated tyrosinase, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, and RPE-associated antigens. These have all been studied in animal models and shown to produce autoimmune uveitic reactions that mimic sympathetic ophthalmia.

Genetic predisposition to sympathetic ophthalmia is another emerging area of research, potentially enabling the identification of at-risk patient populations. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR4, HLA-A11, and HLA-B40 have been shown to be associated with sympathetic ophthalmia.

More recent studies have shown the expression of HLA-DRB1*04 and HLA-DQA1*03 to be significantly associated with sympathetic ophthalmia across patient populations in both white and Japanese patients.
