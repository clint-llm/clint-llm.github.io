Splenomegaly can be classified based on its pathophysiologic mechanism:

- Congestive, by pooled blood (e.g., portal hypertension)

- Infiltrative, by invasion by cells foreign to the splenic environment (e.g., metastases, myeloid neoplasms, lipid storage diseases)

- Immune, by an increase in immunologic activity and subsequent hyperplasia (e.g., endocarditis, sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis)

- Neoplastic, when resident immune cells originate a neoplasm (e.g., lymphoma).
