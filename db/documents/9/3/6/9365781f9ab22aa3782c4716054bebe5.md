Using the tweezers or hemostat, grasp the tick at the head, directly where it has attached to the skin. Be sure to grasp the head of the tick and not the body. Removing only the body of the tick leaves the head attached to the skin; the head can serve as a nidus for infection and is much more difficult to remove after disembodiment.

Grasp the head of the tick firmly. Then, pull suddenly and directly away from the skin, avoiding twisting or jerking movements. Expect a tiny patch of the skin to come away with the tick. Once the tick has been identified, dispose of it securely.

Post-removal care includes routine cleaning of the skin and the application of a topical antibiotic. Bacitracin is recommended. Apply a wound dressing over the area.

Tetanus prophylaxis is usually not indicated.
