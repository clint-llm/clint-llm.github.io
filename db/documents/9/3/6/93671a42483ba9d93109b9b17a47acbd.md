Peters anomaly is divided into three grades based on the ocular structure involvement:

- Mild: Only cornea is involved, rest of iris and lens is normal.

- Moderate: There are iridocorneal adhesions or iris abnormalities like coloboma and iris atrophy.

- Severe: This is characterized by corneo-lenticular adhesion or corneal staphyloma with or without corneo-lenticular adhesion.
