Tibial tubercle avulsion fractures are an uncommon cause of knee pain in jumping adolescent athletes. Tibial tubercle fractures are a fairly uncommon pediatric fracture and account for under 1% of epiphyseal injuries. Of all proximal tibial fractures, approximately 3% are tibial tubercle avulsion fractures. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of tibial tubercle avulsion fractures and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of tibial tubercle avulsion fractures.
- Describe the evaluation of tibial tubercle avulsion fractures.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for tibial tubercle avulsion fractures.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance knowledge about tibial tubercle avulsion fractures and improve outcomes.
