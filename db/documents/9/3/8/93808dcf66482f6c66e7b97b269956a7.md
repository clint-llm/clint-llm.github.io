Endophthalmitis is a rare but severe disease of ocular inflammation involving vitreous or aqueous fluids and other intraocular tissues that can result in blindness. Fungal endophthalmitis is caused by intraocular fungal infections originating either exogenously from penetrating trauma and surgeries or endogenously from hematogenous spread. The highly variable clinical picture of fungal endophthalmitis presents as a diagnostic challenge as the features of the disease overlap with bacterial, non-infectious, and neoplastic etiologies.

A lack of clinical suspicion and the empiric use of corticosteroids without proper antifungal coverage increases the risk of significant visual loss. Therefore, it is imperative for healthcare providers to recognize fungal endophthalmitis and diagnose it early for prompt initiation of effective antifungal therapy.
