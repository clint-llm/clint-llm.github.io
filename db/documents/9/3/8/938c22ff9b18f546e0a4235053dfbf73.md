To sum up, PPC is an autosomal dominant or rarely sporadic congenital form of cataract that affects the patients' daily activities. It presents as a round onion ring-like discoid opacity dense adherent to the central posterior capsule. The PPC plaque is densely adherent to the posterior capsule and can result in posterior capsular rupture during cataract surgery. In expert hands, the surgical outcome is usually excellent. Cases landing up with intraoperative PCR can be managed by sulcus fixated, iris claw, iris sutured, scleral fixated, or anterior chamber IOL. Dreaded complications like nucleus drop, cortical matter in vitreous or IOL drop can be managed in conjunction with a vitreoretinal surgeon.
