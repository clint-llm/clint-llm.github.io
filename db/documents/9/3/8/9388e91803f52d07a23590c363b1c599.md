Elder abuse has complications for the victims, caregivers, and society as a whole. For the victim, it has been shown to lead to physical and mental health problems, PTSD, poorly controlled chronic disease, high medical bills, decreased quality of life, breakdown of trust or quality of relationships, and even premature death.

Caregivers may suffer from the high burden of care, loss of productivity, loss of the ability to work, and financial strain as they are caring for the older adult.
