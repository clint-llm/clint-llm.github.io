Sigmoid volvulus is the most common type of colonic volvulus and occurs when a portion of the intestine twists around its blood supply. In sigmoid volvulus, this occurs at the base of the mesentery. It most commonly presents in patients who are bedbound and have a history of chronic constipation. Patients may demonstrate a loss of appetite, diminished or absent bowel output, and worsening abdominal distension. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of sigmoid volvulus and describes the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the typical presentation of a patient with sigmoid volvulus. 
- Identify the testing that should be done if sigmoid volvulus is suspected.
- Explain the management strategies for sigmoid volvulus .
- Summarize the importance of cooperation among the interprofessional team to recognize the typical presentations of sigmoid volvulus and provide prompt decompression, which will improve outcomes.
