KCl toxicity is primarily a discussion of hyperkalemia. Like hypokalemia, the potentially fatal complication of hyperkalemia is cardiac arrhythmia. The risk for cardiac arrhythmia is significant at serum potassium levels greater than 6.0 to 6.5 mEq/L. Other manifestations of symptomatic hyperkalemia include ascending muscle weakness and GI disturbance (e.g., nausea, local mucosal necrosis, etc.).
