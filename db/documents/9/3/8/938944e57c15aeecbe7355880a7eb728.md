Carcinoid tumors are slow-growing tumors arising from neuroendocrine cells and capable of secreting a variety of peptides and neuroamines. The common primary sites are the gastrointestinal tract, accounting for 60 percent of the primary tumors, followed by the tracheobronchial tree, accounting for 25 percent of the primary tumors. Other primary sites include the ovaries and kidneys. Most carcinoid tumors occur in the small intestine. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of carcinoid tumors and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of carcinoid tumors.
- Describe the presentation of carcinoid tumors.
- Summarize the treatment options for carcinoid cancer.
- Review the importance of optimizing care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with carcinoid tumors.
