Acromegaly is usually a slow-progressing disorder, with onset usually in the third or fourth decade of life. The presenting complaints can include the following:

- Joint pain due to hypertrophic arthropathy

- Wrist pain and numbness from carpal tunnel syndrome

- Snoring and sleep disorders related to sleep apnea

- Headaches and visual disturbances (bitemporal hemianopia) as a direct result of the pituitary adenoma

- Erectile dysfunction or low sex drive

- Abnormal menses in women

- Sweaty palms and soles (hyperhidrosis)

- Deepening of the voice

Signs upon physical examination can include the following:

**General Examination**

- Coarse facial features, prominent forehead, prominent brow, and prognathism (mandibular enlargement)

- Prominent forehead crease and nasolabial folds

- Macroglossia and widely spaced dentition

- Thick eyelids, large nose, and large lower lip

**Visual Field**

- Bitemporal hemianopsia

**Neck**

- Possible thyromegaly or palpable nodules

- Raised JVP (in acromegalic cardiomyopathy)

**Integumentary**

- Thick and rough skin

- Skin tags

- Oily skin

- Abnormal or excess hair distribution, e.g., hirsutism(in women), hypertrichosis

- Hyperpigmentation

- Acanthosis nigricans, especially in the axillary areas

**Breast**

- Galactorrhea (this may be due to a combination of a GH-secreting adenoma co-secreting prolactin or pituitary stalk compression)

- Dry atrophic skin

**Cardiovascular**

- Features of acromegalic cardiomyopathy: may have displaced apex beat, the character may be sustained "pressure-loaded" in the hypertrophy stage, and if there is reduced systolic function, it may be diffuse

- Elevated blood pressure

- Cardiac murmur (evaluating for valvular disease)

**Chest**

- Potential dorsal kyphosis and lumbar hyperlordosis, prominence of the distal part of the sternum

- Bibasal crepitations in the case of congestive heart failure in a patient with acromegalic cardiomyopathy

**Limbs**

- Acral enlargement: large hands (with stubby fingers) and feet

- Proximal myopathy

- Carpal tunnel syndrome

- Genu varum

- Rolling gait
