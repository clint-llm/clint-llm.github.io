Supernumerary digit, or polydactyly, is an autosomal dominant congenital defect of the upper and/or lower extremity that is typically discovered immediately after birth.

Polydactyly is categorized based upon its location. Preaxial polydactyly involves the radial or great toe side of the extremity, whereas postaxial polydactyly involves the ulnar or 5th toe side of the extremity. Central or meso axial polydactyly involves the 2-4 digits.
