It is important to distinguish asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism from FHH because FHH is a benign inherited condition that typically does not require parathyroidectomy, nor will it be routinely cured by it. Although it is not difficult to differentiate patients with typical biochemical findings of either FHH or primary hyperparathyroidism, it can be challenging to differentiate patients with atypical presentations of either disease and in the absence of family history. Family screening and education are mandatory to avoid unnecessary surgery in the hypercalcemic family members.
