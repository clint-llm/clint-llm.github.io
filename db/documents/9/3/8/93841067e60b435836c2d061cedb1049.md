Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is named one of the top ten disabling disorders by the WHO. Patients with OCD tend to avoid situations that make them uncomfortable. This fact may lead to a decrease in social interactions and a poor quality of life. Most who struggle with OCD go undetected for years. If OCD goes untreated, the pattern is harder to break as structural changes to the brain take place.
