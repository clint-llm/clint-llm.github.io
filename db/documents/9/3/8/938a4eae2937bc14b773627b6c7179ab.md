Anatomically, the vallecula is situated between the pharynx and larynx and thus helps demark the transition from these to regions. The median glossoepiglottic fold is the separation between the epiglottis and the base of the tongue and gives rise to the two valleculae. Together the valleculae and the pyriform recesses are named the pharyngeal recesses. The anatomic location of the vallecula makes it ideally situated to collect saliva and prevent the swallowing reflex while a person is supine during sleep.
