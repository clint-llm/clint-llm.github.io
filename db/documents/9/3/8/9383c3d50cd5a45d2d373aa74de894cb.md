The diagnosis and management of Asherman syndrome are often difficult and require an interprofessional team that includes an obstetrician, gynecologist, and radiologist. Asherman syndrome should be treated by a surgeon experienced with hysteroscopy, sometimes with sonographic or laparoscopic guidance.

These patients should be closely followed by the nurse practitioner and primary caregiver as they may develop endometrial cancer before or after menopause.
