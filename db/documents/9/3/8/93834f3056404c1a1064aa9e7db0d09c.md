The nerve coaptation is usually performed by a facial plastic surgeon, neurosurgeon, head and neck surgeon, or plastic surgeon. This may be the primary surgeon whose procedure resulted in the facial nerve injury or a consultant whose expertise is required for nerve repair. For cases that require proximal exposure of the facial nerve within the mastoid process of the temporal bone, an otolaryngologist or otologist should perform the mastoidectomy.

In addition to the surgeon, a circulating nurse and a surgical technologist should be present. In some cases, a surgical first assistant may be necessary.Â An anesthesia provider is also required. The anesthesia provider should be capable of maintaining a general anesthetic plane deep enough to prevent patient movement without requiring long-acting paralytics, as these preclude the use of intraoperative nerve stimulation.
