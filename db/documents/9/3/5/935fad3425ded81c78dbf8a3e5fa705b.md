Leukotrienes undergo synthesis via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism. Arachidonic acid is a fatty acid found within the phospholipids that constitute cell membranes. When a stimulus arrives that calls for the production of leukotrienes, phospholipids within our cell membranes metabolize to arachidonic acid via phospholipase A (PLA). The arachidonic acid is then acted on by 5-lipooxygenase in concert with FLAP to yield LTA. Within the cell, LTA is used as the substrate for the production of LTB via hydrolysis or leukotriene C (LTC) via conjugation with glutathione. At this point, LTB and LTC are exported out of the cell via separate transport proteins. Extracellularly, LTC can subsequently undergo hydrolysis to produce leukotriene (LTE). LTC, LTD (an intermediate in LTE synthesis), and LTE are termed cysteinyl leukotrienes.
