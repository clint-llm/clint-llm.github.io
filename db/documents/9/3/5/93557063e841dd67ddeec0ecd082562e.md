Endometrial hyperplasia results from estrogen predominance and relative progesterone insufficiency. The typical causes for endogenous estrogen excess include anovulatory cycles (perimenopause, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)), obesity, and estrogen secreting ovarian tumors. The exogenous causes include unopposed estrogen therapy, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and tamoxifen (used in breast cancer treatment).

The Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions Trial (PEPI) showed that when unopposed estrogen treatment with 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen was given to women for three years, it leads to increased incidence of endometrial hyperplasia.
