Inner ear decompression sickness (IEDCS) is an incompletely understood condition observed in compressed-gas divers, likely resulting from the precipitation of gas bubbles in the endolymphatic and perilymphatic spaces during a quick ascent. The classic presenting symptoms of IEDCS develop within approximately 30 minutes of surfacing and are vestibular in nature; these include vertigo, ataxia (or difficulty with coordination), nausea, and vomiting. To avoid the high morbidity associated with this condition requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. This activity describes the evaluation and management of inner ear decompression sickness and reviews the role of the inter-professional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of inner ear decompression sickness.
- Identify the risk factors for developing inner ear decompression sickness.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with inner ear decompression sickness.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by inner ear decompression sickness.
