Patients may notice a prodrome of burning discomfort a day or two before the onset of ulcerations. Fever, rash, headache, or lymphadenopathy are typically absent and would suggest a different diagnosis such as herpangina or PFAPA syndrome (periodic fever, pharyngitis, adenitis, and oral ulceration). A history of prior ulceration is typical.

On physical exam, patients with aphthous stomatitis are well-appearing and afebrile. Assess for clinical signs of dehydration, especially in infants and children. Involvement of the eye (uveitis) or genitalia suggest other diagnoses, such as Behçet syndrome or MAGIC syndrome (mouth and genital ulcers with inflamed cartilage).

The ulcers of aphthous stomatitis are present as well-circumscribed lesions with central necrotic ulcer with gray, fibrinous exudate surrounded by an erythematous halo on the non-keratinized oral mucosa. Typical locations include the buccal (cheek) and labial (lip) mucosae, the floor of the mouth, the ventral surface of the tongue, and the soft palate. Minor aphthous ulcerations, the most common form of aphthous stomatitis, are less than 1 cm in diameter, round or oval in shape, with yellow or gray pseudomembrane surrounded by an inflammatory red halo, and heal typically within 7-14 days.  Major aphthous ulcers are deeper, larger (often 2-3 cm in diameter), may have irregular raised borders, and can take many weeks or months to heal, sometimes with scarring.  Much less common are herpetiform recurrent aphthous ulcers, 1 to 2 mm in diameter in clusters of 10 to 100 in groups or throughout the mouth, which usually heal within a few weeks.
