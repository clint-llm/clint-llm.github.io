Myotonia congenita (MC) is a genetic neuromuscular channelopathy which usually presents in early childhood resulting in a delay of skeletal muscle relaxation following contraction. MC has many implications for patients and their families, including impaired locomotion, swallowing, gastrointestinal disturbance, and respiratory complications. This activity describes the presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of MC and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of myotonia congenita.
- Describe the appropriate process for the evaluation of myotonia congenita.
- Outline the current management options for myotonia congenita.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients with myotonia congenita.
