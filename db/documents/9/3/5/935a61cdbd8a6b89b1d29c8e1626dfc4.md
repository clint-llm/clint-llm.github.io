Studies have shown a clear mechanism by which TREX1 maintains host innate immune tolerance to cytosolic self-DNA. TREX1 mutations lead to the accumulation of self-DNA in the cytosol of TREX1-deficient cells. The persistence of the ssDNA species substrate of TREX1 triggers systemic inflammation and uncontrolled autoimmunity by chronic activation of checkpoint signaling and cGAS-STING-mediated type I interferon response.

Previous studies have shown that TREX1 gene deletion in mice leads to inflammatory myocarditis and shortened lifespan due to an interferon-dependent autoimmune response.

Additionally, research has shown that the TREX1 is associated with the SET complex.
