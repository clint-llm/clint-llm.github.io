The use of thalidomide correlates with significant contraindications that physicians should consider before prescribing this compound. In particular, the FDA Black Box Warning involves embryo-fetal toxicity.

A history of or significant risks to venous thromboembolic events represents another contraindication to the use of thalidomide therapy. Specifically, thalidomide increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients receiving treatment for multiple myeloma. This risk increases when using thalidomide in conjunction with chemotherapeutic agents such as dexamethasone.

Previous hypersensitivity reactions represent the final contraindication to thalidomide usage. Patients who previously displayed severe adverse events such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or type 1 hypersensitivity reaction to this drug should no longer be considered candidates for therapy.
