The superficial musculoaponeurotic system receives its blood supply from the transverse facial artery, which also supplies blood to a broad region of the lateral malar area of the face. As this vessel courses directly through the SMAS, there is a risk of transection of this vessel during SMAS elevation. SMAS elevation is a step in facelift surgeries, technically known as rhytidectomy, and also for facial reconstruction following parotidectomy procedures.

The SMAS also partially receives arterial supply from the musculocutaneous perforators of the facial artery.

The small lymphatic vessels lying deep to the SMAS mainly flow into the preauricular or submandibular lymph nodes, which then drain into the anterior cervical chain. These nodes are situated around the anterior jugular vein and then drain ultimately to the deep cervical chain, which is related to the internal jugular vein and descends to the mediastinum.
