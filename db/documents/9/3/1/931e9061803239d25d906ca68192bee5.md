The prognosis for individuals with BSS varies depending on the cause of injury and the extent to which the spinal cord is damaged. Generally, as BSS is an incomplete spinal cord injury the potential for significant recovery is strong. More than half of BSS patients recover well, and the majority of post-traumatic patients recover motor function. Recovery becomes slower throughout three to six months, and it can take up to two years for ongoing neurological recovery.
