Dieulafoy lesion is a developmental vascular malformation of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). It is an enlarged submucosal blood vessel that bleeds in the absence of any abnormality, such as ulcers or erosions. The signs and symptoms are related to blood loss, either due to intermittent or massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage. To avoid the complications associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of Dieulafoy lesions and highlights the healthcare team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Dieulafoy lesions.
- Summarize the epidemiology of Dieulafoy lesions.
- Describe the typical imaging findings associated with Dieulafoy lesions.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with Dieulafoy lesions.
