The latissimus dorsi is considered an extrinsic muscle of the back, meaning it is a muscle that originates from the myogenic cells in the developing upper limb buds rather than from the myotomal dorsal epaxial division of the somite where the intrinsic (deep back) muscles take origin. The latissimus dorsi and teres major muscles, embryologically, are closely related as they both originate from the pre-muscle sheath of the arm. Unlike teres major, which develops in the limb bud, latissimus dorsi spreads across the posterior aspect of the thorax and trunk as the myoblasts migrate out of the limb bud into the axial mesenchyme posteriorly. It is not until an embryo is at least 20 mm long that the fibers of latissimus dorsi reach the iliac crest, whereas teres major is already well-developed by the time an embryo is 14 mm in length.
