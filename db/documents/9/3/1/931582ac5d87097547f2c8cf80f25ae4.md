The greater petrosal nerve is an important and reliable landmark for the geniculate ganglion, the internal auditory canal, and the middle cranial fossa. In the region of the middle cranial fossa, identification of the greater petrosal nerve is critical to the identification of the Kawase (posteromedial) and Glasscock (posterolateral) triangles hence avoiding injury to essential structures. For example, identification of the Kawase triangle before drilling in an anterior petrosectomy can aid in the avoiding of injury to the facial nerve and internal carotid artery.

The nerve is also disposed to injury from bone drilling, dural elevation off the middle fossa floor, electrocauterization, or dissection due to its vulnerable location. Hence bony landmarks and anatomical distances have been published to guide the identification of this nerve during surgery.
