The liver is divided into lobes and segments; there are several classification schemes for describing these segments, but the most widely used is the Couinaud classification. In this classification, the segments and lobes are defined in part by their third order (third branch) portal venous supply and in part, by their systemic venous drainage.

The arterial liver supply is variable. The most common configuration is that of a single proper hepatic artery derived from the common hepatic artery in turn derived from the celiac artery, with the proper hepatic artery dividing into right and left branches to feed the right and left lobes of the liver, respectively. However, this configuration is probably present in less than 50% of humans; various sources give various percentages. Authors disagree regarding the terminology of the artery that supplies segment 4, which is termed a middle hepatic artery by some and a segment four branch by others.

The following are the 3 common potential accessory arterial supplies to liver tumors:

- The right phrenic artery (sometimes called the inferior phrenic artery)

- A replaced or accessory left hepatic artery

- The right internal mammary artery (also called the internal thoracic artery)

The following 4 arteries should be kept in mind as common avenues for inadvertent chemoembolization (i.e., embolizing non-target healthy tissues):

- The cystic artery

- The right gastric artery

- The falciform artery

- The duodenal (or supraduodenal) artery
