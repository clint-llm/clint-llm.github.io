The early start of dietary galactose restriction with calcium supplements is essential; this results in a significant reduction in metabolite levels.

Long termÂ follow-up involves measurements of the galactose and its metabolites, especially the measurement of galactitol in the RBC. Routine ophthalmologic examination by slit lamp is necessary. In patients with developmental delays or mental retardation, neurodevelopmental testing is important. Blood sugar checks should be performed regularly due to the incidence of hypoglycemia.
