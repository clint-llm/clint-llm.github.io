Pacemaker implantation has shown a mortality benefit. The CARE-HF (Cardiac Resynchronization in Heart Failure) trial limited subjects to the QRS duration greater than 150 ms (89% of patients) or QRS duration 120 to 150 ms with echocardiographic evidence of dys-synchrony (11% of patients). It was the first study to show a significant (36%) reduction in the death rate for resynchronization therapy unaccompanied by backup defibrillation compared with guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). There has been evidence from the multiple randomized trials of CRT-D in patients with reduced LVEF and NYHA class II shows that CRT can provide functional improvement and decrease the risk of HF events and composite outcomes. In clinical trials, CRT-D has not shown improvement in NYHA class I Heart failure. The ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines from 2012 thoroughly reviewed the conditions of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy, genetic arrhythmia syndrome, terminal care, and congenital heart disease, and no changes were made as compared to 2008 guidelines in these conditions. There was a change in guidelines for indications of CRT insertion in the 2012 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines as compared to 2008 guidelines. These are incorporated in the indications for pacemaker section mentioned above.

New guidelines recommend CRT in a patient with QRS duration greater than or equal to 150 ms instead of 120 ms based on multiple analysis/studies (class I indication). An additional difference in CRT recommendations includes patients with QRS duration greater than or equal to 150 ms with LBBB as class I indication. Newer guidelines based on multiple studies suggest that in patients who have QRS greater than or equal to 120 ms but does not have complete LBBB, the evidence of benefit from CRT is less compelling. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines are similar to the ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines, but there are few differences. One major difference noted is ESC guidelines have CRT indication for QRS less than or equal to 120 ms in patients with atrial fibrillation (in whom we have inadequate rate control requiring AV node ablation) and heart failure with EF less than or equal to 35%. The ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines have no such indication.
