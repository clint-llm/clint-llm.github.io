The approach for elevated serum creatinine in a renal transplant recipient would be the same as evaluating for acute kidney injury (AKI) with added workup for the rejection.

The specific workup for evaluating allograft dysfunction should include the following:

- Rule out prerenal causes: Check orthostatic vital signs, blood pressure, and volume status

- Rule out post-renal causes, mainly obstructive uropathy in older adults, by bladder scan, renal ultrasound (US)

- Complete blood count: Look for anemia and thrombocytopenia to rule out thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)

- Electrolyte abnormality related to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and AKI

- Urinalysis (UA) and urine culture: It is essential to rule out infection as a cause of AKI

- Check for proteinuria: Either urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) or 24-hour urine collection as nephrotic range proteinuria correlates with the presence of extensive transplant glomerulopathy

- Check for BK polyomavirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in clinically indicated patients

- Testing for donor-specific antibodies

- Transplant renal ultrasound with doppler for renal arterial and venous indices

- Many transplant centers use testing for donor-derived free DNA testing. This test can be positive even before the actual rise in serum creatinine, suggesting possible rejection.
