Glycogen is the branched polymer of glucose. Glucose is stored in cells as polymers to increase solubility, occupy less space, and allow for rapid mobilization. The glycogen stored in a hepatocyte corresponds to an estimated glucose concentration of 400 mM. Conversely, the contribution of insoluble glycogen to the cytosol osmolarity is 40 million times smaller than the contribution of 40 mM glucose. Therefore, if the glycogen polymer form did not exist, the cytosol osmolarity would be sufficiently high to cause water penetration into the cell via osmosis and result in cell lysis. Glycogen leads to higher solubility, mainly due to its formation of branches. On the other hand, most of the polymer forms by alpha 1-4 glycosidic bonds, which get organized in chains, branching occurs every 4-8 glucose monomers via alpha 1-6 glycosidic bonds. This arrangement leads to the classical organization of glycogen, called the beta-particle, with a self-glycosylating protein called glycogenin in the core.

It is essential to understand the conformation of glycogen because glycogenolysis involves the disintegration of this polymer into glucose monomers via distinct enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of glycogen's branches and chains.
