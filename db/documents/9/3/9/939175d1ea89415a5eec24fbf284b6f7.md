A patient presenting with ventricular premature complexes usually complains of palpitations. A thorough history and examination can help identify the etiological cause of VPCs. Several risk factors or potential causes can lead to frequent VPCs. Benignly occurring ventricular premature complexes are usually due to excessive adrenergic stimulation. Other factors include various medications, electrolyte abnormalities, hypoxia, etc. The following describes several specific etiological causes:

- Illicit drug abuse (alcohol, amphetamines, cocaine, etc.)

- Various medications like digoxin, tricyclic antidepressants, sympathomimetics, aminophylline, caffeine, etc.

- Electrolyte imbalance including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypercalcemia

- Hypoxia

- Hypercapnia

- Acute myocardial infarction

- Cardiomyopathies mainly hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy

- Myocarditis

- Myocardial contusion
