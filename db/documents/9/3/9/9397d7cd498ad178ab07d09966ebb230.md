The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology have recommended the following management plans in their 2008 guidelines:

- Asymptomatic patients with peak doppler gradient <30 mm Hg can be followed up every five years with an electrocardiogram and doppler echocardiography.

- Asymptomatic patients with peak doppler gradient >30 mm Hg can be followed up every two to five years with doppler echocardiography.

- Asymptomatic patients with peak doppler gradient >60 mm Hg are recommended for balloon valvotomy.

- Symptomatic patients with a peak doppler gradient >50 mm Hg and a domed pulmonic valve are recommended for balloon valvotomy.

Surgical intervention is recommended for severe valvular stenosis with severe pulmonary regurgitation, hypoplastic pulmonary annulus, subvalvular stenosis, or supravalvular stenosis. Unfortunately, balloon valvotomy is not as effective in dysplastic valves as in domed valves, making surgery the preferred option. Balloon valvotomy may be worthwhile if peak doppler gradient is >60 mm Hg in asymptomatic patients, or if peak doppler gradient is >50 mm Hg in symptomatic patients. Surgery should also be considered in patients undergoing concurrent cardiac surgical procedures. Pulmonary artery balloon angioplasty, with optional stent placement, is an acceptable treatment for supravalvular and subvalvular pulmonic stenosis.
