Zidovudine is classified as an NRTI that is FDA approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and prevention of perinatal HIV-1 transmission, although it is not currently recommended as a first-line agent or used as monotherapy.

Interprofessional communication and coordination of care by clinicians, infectious disease specialists, mid-level practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other health professionals are necessary to improve outcomes and patient safety. Providers should monitor the patient for side effects and check routine blood work, including a CMP and CBC. Pharmacists should monitor for drug-drug interactions, such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim increasing plasma levels of zidovudine, verify appropriate dosing, and convey their recommendations to the provider. Nurses should monitor for common side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, and myalgias and report their findings to the provider. This interprofessional approach to patient care will optimize antiviral therapy outcomes. [Level 5]

Understanding the treatment options for HIV-1 is important for nurses, doctors, and pharmacists, all acting as an interprofessional team. Communication is vital to making sure patients receive prompt retroviral therapy, especially when trying to reduce the likelihood of maternal-fetal transmission. HIV-1 requires prompt treatment with antiretroviral therapy to maintain an adequate CD4+ T cell count and prevent some dangerous sequelae resulting from a reduced CD4+ T cell count. Clinicians should give attention to at-risk populations and screen patients with associated risk factors. Prompt treatment with antiretroviral therapies such as zidovudine can provide life-saving immunological support. Zidovudine plays a crucial role in helping prevent the maternal-fetal transmission of HIV-1 in pregnant patients. Zidovudine has not only proven to reduce the likely hood of vertical transmission, but it has also demonstrated the capacity to provide prophylaxis for those children exposed in utero.

Clinicians must provide patient education about the importance of maintaining compliance with zidovudine. This way, patients can maintain an adequate immune response and be less likely to become susceptible to opportunistic infections or neoplasms. This therapy will, in turn, improve the quality of life and survival rates of patients with HIV-1. Patients who are infected and become pregnant should receive proper counseling on treatment that will help prevent vertical maternal-fetal transmission. HIV-1 needs to be on all clinicians' differentials when dealing with certain opportunistic infections, neoplasm, and patient populations. Those who are infected should receive prompt, highly active antiretroviral therapy. Treatment with zidovudine has proven to be effective in several clinical scenarios.

Specialty trained HIV care nurses review the importance of compliance with patients, check for side effects, follow up on laboratories, and inform prescribing providers of patient issues. Board-certified infectious disease pharmacists can consult with the prescriber on appropriate dosing and regimen, evaluate interactions, and educate patients. These interprofessional interventions are examples of how coordinated healthcare team dynamics can improve patient outcomes when using zidovudine therapy.
