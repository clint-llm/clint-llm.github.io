Serotonin toxicity is the most serious drug reaction from inadvertent or intentional SSRI overdose and can be iatrogenic, caused by the introduction of a serotonergic agent, increased dosing of an established serotonergic agent or after coadministration with another agent that increases serotonin activity.

Many medications affect serotonin levels by different overlapping mechanisms. In addition to SSRIs, ondansetron, methadone, clomipramine, amitriptyline, dextromethorphan, fentanyl, meperidine, tramadol, trazodone, venlafaxine, and pentazocine increase serotonin levels by blocking reuptake. Medications that can increase serotonin levels by inhibiting serotonin metabolism include linezolid, methylene blue, St. John's wort, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors like phenelzine, selegiline, and isocarboxazid. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and mirtazapine enhance serotonin release. Tryptophan is a serotonin precursor. Cocaine increases serotonin synthesis. Buspirone, fentanyl, dihydroergotamine, lithium, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), metoclopramide and triptans stimulate serotonin receptors.
