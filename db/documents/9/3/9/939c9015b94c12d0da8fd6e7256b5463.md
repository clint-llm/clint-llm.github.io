Within certain patient populations, HMPV can cause severe illness requiring hospitalization. Among those are patients who are immunocompromised or have a pre-existing cardiac or respiratory condition. These patients are more susceptible to developing acute respiratory failure requiring high flow oxygen support, with some patients even deteriorating enough to require mechanical ventilation. In these cases, patients need to be admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring.
