Adverse effects of ketorolac increase significantly when used in higher doses, for durations over five days, and in patients who are over 75 years old. Like other NSAIDs, ketorolac shows correlations with significant gastrointestinal (GI), renal, and cardiovascular risks.

Ketorolac can cause an increased risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarctions, and hemorrhagic stroke. Heart failure is a significant risk factor for the adverse effects of NSAIDs. A large case-controlled study spanning multiple European countries tested the risk of heart failure for 27 different NSAIDs, including 92,163 hospital admissions for heart failure and 824,6403 control patients. Seven NSAIDs were shown to increase the risk of heart failure, with ketorolac having the highest odds ratio of 1.83 vs. the lowest odds ratio of 1.16 for naproxen.
