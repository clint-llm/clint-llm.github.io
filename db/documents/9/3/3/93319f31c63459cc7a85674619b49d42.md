Since DSD patients present with symptoms of lower urinary tract symptoms, more common causes need to be investigated before diagnosing DSD. More common etiologies of these symptoms include non-neurogenic causes like bladder neck obstruction, external sphincter spasticity, bladder neck, and urethral strictures, dysfunctional voiding, and pseudodyssynergia. Pseudodyssynergia is the presence of an external urethral sphincter contraction occurring during micturition that may be easily misinterpreted as DSD. Causes of pseudodyssynergia include abdominal straining with Valsalva, pain response, or attempting to block a detrusor contraction.
