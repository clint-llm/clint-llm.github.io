Syndactyly is one of the most common congenital anomalies of the extremities. It is a failure of differentiation of the digits, defined as a fusion of adjacent digits. Syndactyly can be seen in the upper and lower extremity, and up to 50% of cases are bilateral. To avoid the morbidity associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of syndactyly and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of syndactyly. 
- Review the evaluation of syndactyly.
- Describe the surgical management of syndactyly. 
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to adequately treat syndactyly and improve outcomes.
