Contraindications to different pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions in patients withÂ hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are as follow:

- Antiarrhythmic drug therapy for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with HCM is not indicated due to the side effect profile and unclear benefit.

- Radiofrequency ablation in HCM patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia is not indicated due to diffusely abnormal cardiac substrate present in these patients.

- Dobutamine to induce left ventricular outflow tract gradients is not indicated while evaluating patients for alcohol septal ablation due to its lack of specificity.

- The presence of an underlying left bundle branch block in a patient undergoing alcohol septal ablation has a high likelihood of post-procedural complete heart block and may require permanent pacemaker implantation.
