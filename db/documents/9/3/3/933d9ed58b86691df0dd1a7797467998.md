In the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, there are two main subclasses of endocrine cells: insulin-producing beta cells and glucagon secreting alpha cells. Beta and alpha cells are continually changing their levels of hormone secretions based on the glucose environment. Without the balance between insulin and glucagon, the glucose levels become inappropriately skewed. In the case of DM, insulin is either absent and/or has impaired action (insulin resistance), and thus leads to hyperglycemia.

T1DM is characterized by the destruction of beta cells in the pancreas, typically secondary to an autoimmune process. The result is the absolute destruction of beta cells, and consequentially, insulin is absent or extremely low.

T2DM involves a more insidious onset where an imbalance between insulin levels and insulin sensitivity causes a functional deficit of insulin. Insulin resistance is multifactorial but commonly develops from obesity and aging.

The genetic background for both types is critical as a risk factor. As the human genome gets further explored, there are different loci found that confer risk for DM. Polymorphisms have been known to influence the risk for T1DM, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA).

T2DM involves a more complex interplay between genetics and lifestyle. There is clear evidence suggesting that T2DM is has a stronger hereditary profile as compared to T1DM. The majority of patients with the disease have at least one parent with T2DM.

Monozygotic twins with one affected twin have a 90% likelihood of the other twin developing T2DM in his/her lifetime.

MODY is a heterogeneous disorder identified by non-insulin-dependent diabetes diagnosed at a young age (usually under 25 years). It carries an autosomal dominant transmission and does not involve autoantibodies as in T1DM. Several genes have implications in this disease, including mutations to hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-alpha (HNF1A) and the glucokinase (GCK) gene, which occurs in 52 to 65 and 15 to 32 percent of MODY cases, respectively.

Gestational diabetes is essentially diabetes that manifests during pregnancy. It is still unknown why it develops; however, some speculate that HLA antigens may play a role, specifically HLA DR2, 3, and 4. Excessive proinsulin is also thought to play a role in gestational diabetes, and some suggest that proinsulin may induce beta-cell stress. Others believe that high concentrations of hormones such as progesterone, cortisol, prolactin, human placental lactogen, and estrogen may affect beta-cell function and peripheral insulin sensitivity.

Several endocrinopathies, including acromegaly, Cushing syndrome, glucagonoma, hyperthyroidism, hyperaldosteronism, and somatostatinomas, have been associated with glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus, due to the inherent glucogenic action of the endogenous hormones excessively secreted in these conditions. Conditions like idiopathic hemochromatosis are associated with diabetes mellitus due to excessive iron deposition in the pancreas and the destruction of the beta cells.
