There is a general consensus that accurate diagnosis of premalignant endometrial lesions and mitigation of risk factors can prevent progression to invasive carcinoma. During the cyclical hormonal endometrial remodeling, the endometrium responds to the estrogenic stimulation in a uniform programmed manner. The proliferative response is regulated by progestogenic effects. However, unopposed estrogenic stimulation of the endometrium can lead to the hyperproliferative glandular epithelium. This may lead to glandular remodeling and crowding of glands impinging on stromal spaces. Additionally, metaplastic changes may occur in glandular epithelium. If sporadic mutations accumulate in these hyperproliferative glands, prolonged or unopposed estrogen exposures act as a selection factor. The positively selected hyperproliferative clones then crowd out the normal glands.

Thus, two biologically distinct types of lesions, those that represent hormonal field effects i.e., AH and true precancerous lesions i.e., EIN, may be seen. They may either present independently or coexist in the same patient. Biologically, they have differing cancer risks and must be matched with appropriate intervention to avoid under- or over-treatment.
