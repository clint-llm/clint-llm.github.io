The cause of bronchial atresia has yet to be fully elucidated; however, two mechanisms are theorized. One hypothesis is that the proliferating cells lose their connection with the developing respiratory bud during normal lung maturation. A second postulation is that a repetitive vascular insult to lung parenchyma during early fetal development leads to obliteration of an already completed bronchus.
