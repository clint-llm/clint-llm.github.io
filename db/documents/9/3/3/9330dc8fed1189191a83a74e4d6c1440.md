Werner syndrome is an inherited disorder that results in the loss of function in the DNA protective repair mechanisms. Genetic instabilities are a normal feature of aging, but in Werner syndrome, the body cannot repair these abnormalities. This results in the accumulation of genetic instabilities, which manifests as a premature aging phenotype in the affected individual. The premature aging only affects certain types of tissue. Premature neurocognitive deficits are not typically seen in Werner syndrome patients, making an argument against the classification of an overall accelerated aging syndrome, but more a segmental aging syndrome.
