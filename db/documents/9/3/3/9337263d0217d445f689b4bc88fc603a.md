The patellar tendon inserts at the tibial tubercle and consists of cartilaginous tissue. This is followed by ossification of the tibial tubercle at ages 10-12 in girls and at ages 12-14 in boys. It is during this stage of bone maturation when Osgood Schlatter disease develops. The prevailing theory is that there is repeated traction over the tubercle leading to microvascular tears, fractures, and inflammation; which then presents as swelling, pain, and tenderness.

Osgood Schlatter disease is an overuse injury that occurs in active adolescent patients. It occurs secondary to repetitive strain and microtrauma from the force applied by the strong patellar tendon at its insertion into the relatively soft apophysis of the tibial tubercle. This force results in irritation and severe cases partial avulsion of the tibial tubercle apophysis. Force is increased with higher levels of activity and especially after periods of rapid growth. Rarely trauma may lead to a full avulsion fracture. Predisposing factors include poor flexibility of quadriceps and hamstrings or other evidence of extensor mechanism misalignment.

Risk factors for the disorder include:

- Male gender

- Ages: male 12-15, girls 8-12

- Sudden skeletal growth

- Repetitive activities like jumping and sprinting
