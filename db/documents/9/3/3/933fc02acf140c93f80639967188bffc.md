Fentanyl is a widely used narcotic in the hospital environment. However, with recent concerns about opiate overdose and toxicity, all interprofessional healthcare team membersÂ who prescribe, administer, or dispense this medication should be familiar with the drug's adverse effects and how to reverse them. This includes all clinicians (including mid-level practitioners), nurses, and pharmacists. When prescribing fentanyl, the dose and duration should be the lowest and shortest effective, and the patient is continually assessed for compliance and/or diversion in outpatient settings. Healthcare workers should be aware of new prescribing laws governing opioids, and unlike in the past, empirical prescribing of narcotics can lead to legal troubles, including loss of prescription privilege.
