Ultrasound (US) has similar indications to MRI, though it remains useful in children who have thinner musculature and less abdominal fat. It has a sensitivity of 55% and a specificity of 95% for diagnosing acute appendicitis.

The exam employs graded compression and evaluates several factors: diameter (over 6 mm), surrounding peri-caecal fat, peri-appendiceal inflammation, free fluid, presence of reactive lymph nodes, and mural hyperplasia.

A common mimic of appendicitis on sonographic imaging is lymphoid hyperplasia, a benign condition causing enlargement of the appendiceal diameter, specifically in the lamina propria.

When investigating for neoplasm, mucoceles may also be visible on ultrasound. They appear as an ovoid cystic mass with variable echogenicity. Typically they will have concentric echogenic layers (“onion skin”), acoustic shadowing from mural calcifications, and the appendix will be pear-shaped. They can also demonstrate regional adenopathy, fat stranding, and free fluid.
