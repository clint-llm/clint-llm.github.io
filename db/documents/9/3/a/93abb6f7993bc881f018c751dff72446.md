Classification is broken down into 4 stages. Stage 1 demonstrates radial styloid degenerative changes. Stage 2 is represented by degenerative changes that involve the scaphoid fossa and the styloid. Stage 3 has lunocapitate degenerative changes. Stage 4 is the last stage. Pancarpal arthritis is indicative of stage four; however, this is somewhat controversial because some surgeons do not believe scapholunate advanced collapse will result in pancarpal arthritis. Nevertheless, the radiolunate facet is always spared of arthrosis in scapholunate advanced collapse.
