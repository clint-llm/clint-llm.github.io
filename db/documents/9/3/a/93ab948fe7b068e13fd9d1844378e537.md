The hip joint is primarily responsible for providing dynamic support of the weight of the upper body while facilitating force and load transmission from the axial skeleton to the lower extremities. This structure and function allow for ambulation and mobility. It is a ball-and-socket synovial joint that articulates the head of the femur with the acetabulum of the pelvis.

The arteries of the pelvic region originate from the bifurcation of the common iliac artery into the external iliac artery and the internal iliac artery. The internal iliac artery divides into anterior and posterior trunks at the superior border of the greater sciatic foramen. Various branches of these major vessels supply the hip joint.
