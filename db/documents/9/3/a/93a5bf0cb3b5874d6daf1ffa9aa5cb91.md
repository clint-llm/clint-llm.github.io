This fracture is much more complex to treat than Bennett fracture patterns due to its intrinsic instability.

- Closed reduction and thumb spica splinting/immobilization 

- Indicated for extra-articular fractures or minimally displaced 2-part articular fractures (i.e., Bennett fractures) with less than 1mm displacement

- Closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP)

- Percutaneous reduction pinning with K-wire fixation is necessary to set either:

- Extra-articular fractures with more than 30 degrees of angulation following closed reduction
- Rolando fracture patterns with minimal (i.e., less than 1 mm) of displacement or when fracture patterns are 
- Comminuted fracture patterns not amenable to screw fixation

- Open reduction internal fixation (ORIF)

- Indicated when greater than 1 mm displacement in intra-articular fractures (Bennett or Rolando fracture patterns) and comminuted fracture fragments involving the metacarpal base when the fragments are large enough and amenable to screw fixation

- Distraction and external fixation

- Indicated for the following:

- Rolando fracture with >1mm displacement and significant soft tissue injury not amenable to ORIF
- Bennett, Rolando, or severely comminuted fractures with fragments too small for ORIF

Surgery can be open or arthroscopic, but in both cases, it requires an articular approach.
