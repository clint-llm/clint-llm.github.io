Gallstones or cholelithiasis are stones that form in the gallbladder composed of cholesterol, bilirubin, and bile. These stones are asymptomatic in most cases, with stones discovered incidentally. Symptomatic patients present with right upper abdominal pain after eating greasy or spicy food, nausea, vomiting, pain in epigastrium that radiates to the right scapula or mid-back. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of gallstones and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk factors associated with the development of gallstones.
- Describe the pathophysiology of gallstones.
- Outline the use of a right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound in the evaluation of gallstones.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by gallstones.
