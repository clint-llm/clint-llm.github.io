Subsequent to aging or inflammation, the degenerated epithelial cells with debris and inspissated proteinaceous secretions like keratin get organized and deposit in the subepithelial space or conjunctival recesses of Henle's glands. With time calcium may or may not deposit within the substance. However, there is no definitive pattern of calcium crystals on electron microscopy, and therefore the term "lithiasis" previously used is a misnomer.
