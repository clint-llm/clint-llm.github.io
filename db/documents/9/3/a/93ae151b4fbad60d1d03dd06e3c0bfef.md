There is no effective treatment for most of the forms of N-ALD or X-ALD. Supportive care by optimizing nutrition, occupational therapy, and respiratory support can help alleviate some of these disorders' severe consequences but typically do not significantly impact survival or long-term outcomes. Coreterosteriod and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy is the recommended therapy in those with impaired adrenal gland function. Some reports have shown that allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) may have beneficial effects. Favorable outcomes with HCT therapy occur in asymptomatic patients at the time of diagnosis or those with mild symptoms and CNS involvement.

Recent trials to use docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or the induction of peroxisome proliferation were not conclusive.
