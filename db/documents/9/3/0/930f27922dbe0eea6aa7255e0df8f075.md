Several potential complications are specifically related to surgeries performed within the PPF. Damage to the Vidian nerve can result in chronic xerophthalmia. Removal of the pterygoid plates and associated muscles can lead to chronic trismus in the patient. CN V2 damage is possible while performing surgeries in either the PPF or infratemporal fossa. Finally, there can be an inadvertent injury to the carotid artery causing devastating consequences. While the carotid injury is unlikely when performing surgery within the PPF, stringent identification of the carotid artery is crucial while operating within the infratemporal fossa.
