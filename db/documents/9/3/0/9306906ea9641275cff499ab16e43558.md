The Bennett fracture is the most common fracture involving the base of the thumb. This fracture refers to an intraarticular fracture that separates the palmar ulnar aspect of the first metacarpal base from the remaining first metacarpal. The injury is typically caused by axial loading on a partially flexed metacarpal and may be associated with other carpal bone fractures or ligament injuries. This activity describes the presentation, cause, and diagnosis of Bennett fracture and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its treatment.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the cause of Bennett fracture.
- Describe the history and physical exam of a patient with Bennett fracture.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for Bennett fracture.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by Bennett fracture.
