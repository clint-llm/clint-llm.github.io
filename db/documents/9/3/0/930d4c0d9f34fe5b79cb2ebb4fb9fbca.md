Health care professionals, including family clinicians (MDs, DOs, PAs, NPs), specialists, nurses, and pharmacists, are valuable sources of information for patients. The nurses, pharmacists, and clinicians should work as an interprofessional team to increaseÂ patient knowledge about the medication and provide them information about possible side effects to look for, helping them become more compliant with their medications, and subsequently improve their blood pressure control and overall clinical outcome. This interprofessional approach to education will lead to better outcomes with fewer adverse effects. [Level 5]
