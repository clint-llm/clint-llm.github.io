Clavulanic acid is a medication that can be used in conjunction with amoxicillin to manage and treat bacterial infections, specifically bacteria that are beta-lactamase producers. It is in the beta-lactamase inhibitor class of medications. This activity describes the indications, action, and contraindications for clavulanic acid as a valuable agent in the treatment of beta-lactamase-producing bacterial infections when used with amoxicillin and how the interprofessional team can use this agent to drive positive outcomes in fighting infections.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of clavulanic acid.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of clavulanic acid.
- Outline the appropriate monitoring for patients receiving clavulanic acid.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance clavulanic acid and improve outcomes.
