The differential diagnosis of the herald patch is different than the differential diagnosis of pityriasis roseaÂ because the former is a single lesion while the latter is an eruption. The differential diagnosis for the herald patch includes tinea corporis, nummular eczema, and erythema annulare centrifugum. A helpful distinguishing feature among most of these conditions is the location of the scale within the erythema. The herald patch and erythema annulare centrifugum often exhibit a trailing scale. This is seen as a collarette of scale inside the borders of the erythema. The edge of the scale in tinea often appears to lead the erythema in an annular fashion. Nummular eczema typically has scale throughout the lesion without central clearing.
