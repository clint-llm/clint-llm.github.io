In previously treated differentiated thyroid carcinoma, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) recommendations for the use of FDG PET/CT are almost exclusively for patients with a high risk of metastasis or recurrence presenting with increasing thyroglobulin levels (> 10 ng/ml) and negative radioiodide scan (RAI). ATA recommends further cross-sectional evaluation with calcitonin levels higher than 150 pg/ml in those with medullary carcinoma.

Additional indications include surveillance and treatment response in a previously identified FDG avid tumor, suspicion of metastatic disease secondary to an identified aggressive tumor after total or near-total thyroidectomy, and second-line preoperative evaluationÂ for possible residual disease with negative RAI uptake.
