The differential diagnoses of the disease are numerous. They include other causes of extrinsic allergic alveolitis, such as those occurring after exposure to other organic dust (such as silicon, hay, cotton, and compost dust) and other non-allergic types of pneumonia, such as infective causes.

Examples of hypersensitivity pneumonia that could mimic bagassosis include:

- Farmer's lung

- Suberosis

- Pigeon breeder's/bird fancier's disease

- Fungal pneumonitis

Other differential diagnoses include:

- Asthma

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

- Eosinophilic pneumonia

- Community-acquired pneumonia

- Miliary tuberculosis

- Silicosis

- Pulmonary edema

- Idiopathic interstitial lung disease
