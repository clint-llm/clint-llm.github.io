In all HIV infected patients, regular monitoring of CD4+ cell counts is necessary for the early diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic infections. CD4+ counts also help in the initiation of prophylactic treatment regimens in the appropriate patients. Infection-specific diagnostic tests are listed below.

**Mycobacterium tuberculosis: **All HIV positive patients require testing for LTBI. Tuberculin skin test (TST) is performed and considered positive when there is a greater than 5 mm induration at 48 to 72 hours in HIV positive patients, without any clinical or radiologic signs of TB disease. Limitations include reduced specificity in patients who have received Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination, reduced sensitivity in advanced immunodeficiency and the need to call patients for two visits, to place the test and to read it. Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) are FDA approved, consistent, and have higher specificity (92 to 97%) compared to (56 to 95%) for TST. An incidental finding of fibrotic lesions on chest x-ray should prompt further diagnostic testing for LTBI and active infection. Sputum samples for AFB smear and culture must be obtained, including from asymptomatic patients. The only patient populations excluded from these testings are those with prior active TB who have completed treatment. In HIV positive individuals whose CD4+ counts are less than 200 cells/mm^3, the presence of fibrotic lesions on chest x-ray which are highly suggestive of TB infection must be considered as having an active infection and subsequently, should be started on empiric treatment while performing further testing and awaiting results.

**Coccidioidomycosis:**Isolation of the organism on culture is part of the diagnosis, and so is the visualization of the spherules on histopathologic evaluation of the affected tissue. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis for complement fixation IgG antibody is often used in the detection of coccidioidal meningitis. CSF cultures demonstrate positive results in less than 30% of patients with meningitis. Coccidioidal IgG and IgM serology are seldom positive in individuals with low CD4+ counts. Blood cultures are generally positive in diffuse pulmonary involvement.

**Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia:**Demonstration of the organism in tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or induced sputum samples is necessary for the diagnosis. Giemsa, Diff-Quik, and Wright stains are used to detect the cyst and trophozoite forms but not the cyst wall. Gomori methenamine silver, toluidine blue, and cresyl violet are used to stain the cyst wall. Beta-D-glucan is found in fungal cell walls could be elevated in patients with PCP; however, needs further evaluation of both the sensitivity and specificity.

**Mucocutaneous candidiasis:** Oropharyngeal candidiasis are diagnosed clinically based on the appearance and the ability to scrape off the white plaques. These lesions can be visualized using a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation which reveals yeast forms on microscopy. Endoscopy is necessary to diagnose esophageal candidiasis coupled with the demonstration of Candida yeast forms in tissues along with the isolation of Candida in cultures. Vulvovaginal candidiasis can be diagnosed clinically followed by the demonstration of yeast forms using KOH preparation.

**Histoplasma capsulatum:**Disseminated histoplasmosis is diagnosable by detecting Histoplasma antigen in blood or urine. However, it is not sensitive to pulmonary infections. Peripheral blood smears may show the organisms engulfed by WBCs. The organism grows slowly and hence requires weeks for culture isolation; They have been cultured from bone marrow, blood, respiratory secretions in greater than 85% of AIDS patients. CSF cultures are rarely positive, and hence the diagnosis of meningitis is difficult. Detection of either anti-Histoplasma antibodies or Histoplasma antigen in the CSF is diagnostic and is positive in about 70% of cases.

**Cryptococcus neoformans:**In patients with meningitis or meningoencephalitis, Cryptococcal antigen is easily detected in the CSF, as well as in the serum. Positive blood cultures present in up to 75% of HIV positive patients with cryptococcal meningitis.

**Cryptosporidiosis:** Microscopic identification of the oocytes in stool or tissue as well as their detection by direct immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

**Herpes simplex viruses (HSV):** HSV DNA PCR, viral culture and HSV antigen detection are utilized for the detection of mucocutaneous lesions. All genital lesions must undergo typing as HSV-2 more commonly correlates with genital lesions than HSV-1.

**Microsporidiosis:******These microsporidia can be detected by light microscopy using stains such as Chromotrope 2R, calcofluor white and Uvitex 2B which can help differentiate between the spores of the microsporidia and the cells and debris (e.g., stool). In patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, if the stool testing is negative and the infection is suspected, small bowel biopsy must be considered.

**JC virus infection:** PML diagnosis is by clinical and neuroradiologic clues. MRI findings of white matter lesions which are hyperintense (bright) on T2-weighted images and hypointense (dark) on T1-weighted sequences, in areas corresponding to the clinical deficits present in most cases. PCR can be utilized to detect JCV DNA in CSF. Perivascular mononuclear inflammatory infiltration present on histopathology.

**Cytomegalovirus:** Detection of CMV viremia by PCR occurs in both end-organ disease and without an end-organ state. A negative IgG level helps to look for an alternate etiology for symptoms. CMV retinitis diagnosis occurs with the help of an ophthalmoscopic examination which has a positive predictive value of 95%.

**Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC):** Growth of MAC from cultures of blood, lymph node, or any other sterile tissues or body fluids along with the clinical signs and symptoms are useful in the diagnosis of disseminated MAC infection.

**Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis (TE):**Detection of anti-toxoplasma immunoglobulins G antibodies is noted in a majority of HIV positive patients with TE. Furthermore, a combination of clinical signs with imaging findings on CT or MRI of mass lesions, coupled with the demonstration of the organisms on brain biopsy is necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

**Bartonellosis:** BA lesions have a characteristic vascular proliferation with the demonstration of numerous bacilli on a modified silver stain. Gram stain and acid-fast staining are negative and not helpful. Bartonella species are difficult to culture but have been isolated using EDTA tubes.

**Syphilis:**Direct visualization ofTreponema pallidum by darkfield microscopy, biopsy with silver stain or direct fluorescent anti-Treponema antibody; treponemal tests (FTA-ABS or TP-PA); serologic diagnosis using Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] and rapid plasma reagin [RPR] have been used. Neurosyphilis is diagnosed by CSF examination which may show mononuclear pleocytosis, reactive CSF-VDRL or normal to mildly elevated protein concentration.

**Human papillomavirus infection:** Visual inspection of the warts is usually sufficient to make the diagnosis, although confirmation is obtained via biopsy. There is currently no role for HPV testing in HIV positive women. In these patients, if their cervical Pap test shows ASCUS, ASC-H, LSIL, HSIL they require referral for colposcopy.

**Hepatitis B virus infection:** All HIV positive individuals require testing for HBV infection. Testing, specifically, for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc total), and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) is necessary to identify those who have received preventative vaccination or in the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B. In patients with chronic HBV, HBeAg, anti-HBe and HBV DNA must be tested to evaluate for the levels of replicating virus and progression of liver disease, progression to HCC and responses to therapy, respectively.

**Hepatitis C virus infection:**Detection of anti-HCV in blood is necessary for all patients with HIV.
