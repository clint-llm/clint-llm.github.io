The prognosis of vestibular dysfunction depends greatly upon the etiology. The prognosis for BPPV is good when treated appropriately but often recurs. Ménière disease is characterized by recurrent attacks and progressive disease, which results in both hearing loss and balance issues that lead to disability; over time, the second ear becomes involved in up to 47% of cases, with 78% occurring sequentially rather than simultaneously.
