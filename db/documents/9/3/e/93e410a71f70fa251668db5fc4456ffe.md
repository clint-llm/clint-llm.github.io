A classification of LT ligament injury has been described by Viegas and colleagues which includes 3 levels of disease.

- Grade 1 is a partial or incomplete tear of the LT ligament without VISI deformity.

- Grade 2 is a complete tear of the LT ligament including a lesion within the palmar ligaments with a dynamic VISI deformity.

- Grade 3 is a complete tear of the LT ligament including a lesion within both the palmar and dorsal ligament with a static VISI deformity.

The Mayfield classification is commonly used as a grading system for arthroscopic assessment of carpal ligaments. Severity is described using a grading system of I through IV with an increasing number indicating worse injury. Grade I is attenuation/hemorrhage of ligament without malalignment. Grade II is attenuation/hemorrhage of the ligament with a small step-off of the carpal bones. Grade III is a step-off of the carpal bones with the ability to pass a probe through the gap between carpal bones. Grade IV is a step-off of the carpal bones with the ability to pass a probe through the gap between carpal bones and gross instability.
