Management of phantosmia can be difficult and complex. Little is known about the treatment and management of phantosmia, but the priority would be finding and treating the root cause of the phantosmia. This fact stresses the importance of a thorough workup. Various treatment plans for central causes of phantosmia have been discussed in the literature, including medications such as antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants. For peripheral causes of phantosmia, the goal of treatment would be to inhibit the neuroepithelial receptors in the olfactory mucosa from producing a smell when there is no stimulus present. Methods described in the literature involve applying local anesthetic such as cocaine to the olfactory mucosa or surgically removing the olfactory mucosa.

Studies involving local anesthetic (e.g., cocaine) placed on the olfactory mucosa have not proven to have long-lasting effects.

Laterality of the defective olfactory epithelium was determined by occluding one nostril for a given amount of time, during which the presence of phantosmia was measured. If phantosmia was experienced with one nostril occluded, the contralateral side was chosen for resection of the olfactory mucosa. All three surgical patients experienced long-lasting relief of their phantosmia, two of which exceeded five years on follow-up and 18 months for the third surgical patient.

Advances in nasal endoscopy have made this method of surgical excision of the olfactory mucosa a safer option; however, it should be noted there are risks such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, bleeding, and damage to surrounding structures (e.g., orbital contents, orbital nerve, anterior ethmoidal artery, carotid artery, sphenopalatine artery, skull base, etc.) that are involved with this surgical intervention. For these reasons, surgery is considered only after medical management has been exhausted and symptomatology results in significant quality-of-life impairment. Many efforts to describe management strategies for long-lasting phantosmia have been undertaken.

A recent systemic review of phantosmia treatments, including antiseizure medications, antipsychotic medications, antimigraine medications, surgical resection of the olfactory mucosa, and transcranial stimulation, suggested variable etiology-dependent outcomes. For example, most patients experiencing phantosmia during migraine headaches reported resolution of phantosmia with migraine prophylaxis. In patients for whom olfactory mucosa resection was employed, most experienced symptomatic relief.

Transcranial stimulation was shown to be very effective in providing short-term relief; however, it failed to provide significant long-term symptom amelioration. Overall, the systemic review suggested that in studies involving root-cause directed treatment of phantosmia (i.e., antimigraine, antipsychotic, antiseizure, or surgical therapy), 23/29 (73.3%) patients experienced long-lasting relief of phantosmia symptoms, as compared to only 14/44 (31.8%) of patients receiving observation only.[14]

Despite the promising evidence shown by these studies, there remains a significant deficit in establishing robust treatment guidelines. Notably, there are no randomized controlled studies nor head-to-head trials comparing phantosmia treatments.

In summary, the treatment and management of phantosmia are patient and etiology specific. A thorough workup for the root cause of phantosmia will help guide management. There are limited studies regarding the management and treatment of phantosmia; therefore, future studies are warranted.
