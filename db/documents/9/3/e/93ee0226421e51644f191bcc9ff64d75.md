The initial history can be vague and mimic other conditions. The common presenting signs in an affected child are irritability, peevishness, poor appetite, unexplained drowsiness, weight loss, apathy, painful extremities, and increased sweating. The parents may complain of decreased playfulness owing to muscle atrophy and pain. The initial signs are followed by redness of toes, fingers, and tip of the nose. Photophobia, conjunctivitis, and keratitis are often coexistent.

Other important signs include pruritis, pyrexia of unknown origin, drooling of saliva, degeneration of nails and teeth, swollen gums intention tremors, alopecia, miliaria, generalized weakness, sleep disturbances, and secondary skin infections.

The skin of palms and soles may show vesicular eruption and subsequent desquamation. The palms and feet may be found swollen and shows dusky discoloration. A morbilliform, scarlatiniform, or rubelliform exanthem can be seen along with hemorrhagic puncta. The repetitive scratching of hands may cause lichenification, excoriation, and ulcerating pyoderma. The cutaneous features have been described as ‘puffy, pink, painful, paresthetic, perspiring, and peeling hands’ by one author.

A cutaneous biopsy may show non-specific findings of chronic dermatitis along with hyperplastic sweat glands.
