Proper evaluation is needed by specialists, including an endocrinologist, neurosurgeon, neuro-ophthalmologist and occasionally radiation oncologist, to take care of the pituitary disease.

Patient education is important with instructions of when to seek medical care when there is a diagnosis of pituitary adenoma.
