Sternum fracture is not an uncommon injury. The majority of these patients present to the emergency department and often require close monitoring in an ICU setting. Hence, nurses should be familiar with the management of this fracture and its potential complications. In most patients with a sternal fracture, the outcome is excellent. Recovery mayÂ take 4-6 weeks. The rare patient may develop chronic pain or nonunion. An isolated stable sternal fracture can be managed with conservative care, whereas those with unstable sternum usually require surgical fixation. The elderly may experience prolonged recovery because of pain and osteoporotic bone. These patients should join a physical therapy program to regain their strength and muscle mass.
