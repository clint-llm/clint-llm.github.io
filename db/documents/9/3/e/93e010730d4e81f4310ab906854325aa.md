The main steps in the formation of bile are the uptake of bile acids and ions from plasma across the basolateral (sinusoidal) membrane, transport through the hepatocyte, and excretion via the canalicular membrane.

**Basolateral Membrane**

The sodium-potassium ATPase on the basolateral membrane of the hepatocyte maintains sodium and potassium gradients. Because three sodium ions are expelled from the cell in return for receiving two potassium ions, an electrochemical gradient is formed

**Canalicular Membrane**

The transporter proteins found in the canalicular membrane are primarily members of the ATP-binding cassette protein family
