The following are the brachial plexus blocks in proximal to distal anatomical order of the brachial plexus: interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and axillary.

**Interscalene Nerve Block**

The interscalene nerve block targets the C5, C6, and C7 nerve roots at the root level and is indicated for upper arm surgeries involving the shoulder. The interscalene block spares the ulnar nerve distribution; it should not be used for surgical anesthesia in forearm or wrist procedures.

Position the patient's head turned away from the side of interest. Next, palpate the interscalene groove at the lateral edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. With ultrasound guidance, the 3 nerve roots can be appreciated as three distinct hypoechoic circular structures between the scalene muscles. Ensure all appropriate equipment and needles are ready at the bedside. Finally, cleanse the patient’s neck in a sterile fashion.

A suitable needle should be advanced in-plane, aiming between the C5 and C6 nerve root. A distinct pop should be felt as the needle traverses the fascia encompassing the nerve roots. Confirm the desired position using ultrasound and apply negative aspiration before injecting the desired volume of local anesthetic.

A properly performed interscalene nerve block almost always results in some degree of ipsilateral phrenic nerve paralysis. For this reason, practitioners should avoid or consider risks versus benefits for patients with an underlying respiratory disease, such as advanced COPD. Another potential complication of the interscalene nerve block is Horner syndrome, a triad of ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis.

**Supraclavicular Nerve Block**

The supraclavicular nerve block targets the trunks and divisions of the brachial plexus. This nerve block provides anesthesia for most of the arm excluding the upper medial portion proximal to the elbow.

Position the patient's head turned away from the side of interest. Obtain a circular view of the subclavian artery with ultrasound guidance by placing the ultrasound probe parallel to the clavicle. The brachial plexus, found lateral and superior to the subclavian artery, appears as either three hypoechoic circles resembling a “stoplight” when more proximal (representing the trunks of the brachial plexus) or as a cluster of 5 to 6 smaller hypoechoic circles (representing the divisions of the brachial plexus).

A suitable needle should be advanced to target these structures. Confirm the desired position using ultrasound and apply negative aspiration before injecting the desired volume of local anesthetic. If injected in the correct position, the local anesthetic should spread circumferentially around the nerve bundle, giving the bundle a floating appearance.

Phrenic nerve paralysis and Horner syndrome may complicate a supraclavicular nerve block but occur less commonly than with an interscalene nerve block. However, pneumothorax occurs more frequently with a supraclavicular nerve black than an interscalene nerve block.

**Infraclavicular Nerve Block**

The infraclavicular nerve block targets the divisions and cords of the brachial plexus and provides anesthesia for the hand, forearm, elbow, and lateral upper arm. Unfortunately, it is more difficult to visualize the target structures with this approach; this has caused the infraclavicular nerve block to fall out of favor for most practitioners.

Position the patient's head turned away from the side of interest. Obtain a circular view of the subclavian artery with ultrasound guidance by placing the ultrasound probe inferior and perpendicular to the clavicle. Place a suitable needle almost adjacent to the clavicle, superior to the short end of the ultrasound probe. Direct the needle at the inferior border of the subclavian artery. Confirm the desired position using ultrasound, and apply negative aspiration before injecting the desired volume of local anesthetic. The local anesthetic should spread to the nerves around the subclavian artery and provide a sufficient nerve block.

Complications of the infraclavicular nerve block are pneumothorax, hemothorax, intravascular injection of local anesthetic, trauma to surrounding tissues, and chylothorax if performed on the left side.

**Axillary Nerve Block**

The axillary nerve block is performed at the level of the branches of the brachial plexus and is most useful for procedures involving the forearm. Place the ultrasound probe in the patient's axilla to locate the axillary artery in a cross-sectional view, appearing as a circle. The target nerves surrounding the artery are the radial, median, and ulnar nerves. A suitable needle should be advanced to target these structures. Confirm the desired position using ultrasound, and apply negative aspiration before injecting the desired volume of local anesthetic.

To obtain a complete block distal to the elbow, the musculocutaneous nerve, located in the belly of the coracobrachialis muscle, must be targeted as well.
