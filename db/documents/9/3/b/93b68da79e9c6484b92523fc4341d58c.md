- Ultimately, the success of any kidney stone preventive treatment program will depend on the patient's willingness to follow a long-term course of treatment that will involve someÂ level of dietary modifications, medications, personal sacrifice, and lifestyle change with no obvious immediate or noticeable benefits.

- Patients on treatment may still make stones, albeit fewer than otherwise.

- Patients may cheat on their therapies from time to time, and since they do not seem to pay any immediate price or penalty, many will revert to their previous diets and behaviors.

- Patients may also develop an over-reliance on drug therapy so they can minimize the dietary changes requested.
