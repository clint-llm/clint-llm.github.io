Morvan syndrome is mainly a clinical diagnosis

- The CNS features include encephalopathy, severe insomnia, vivid complex hallucinations, delirium, spatial and temporal disorientation, confusion, amnesia, agitation, and belligerence.

- The ANS features, due to autonomic instability, are excessive sweating, fever, palmoplantar erythema, pruritus, drooling, severe constipation, excessive lacrimation, arrhythmias, hypertension, weight loss, skin and rarely hyponatremia due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion

- The peripheral nervous system (PNS) features are peripheral nerve hyperexcitability resulting in continuous muscle fiber activity, neuropathic pain, areflexia (loss of deep tendon reflexes), and a stocking-type sensory loss. Continuous muscle fiber activity is manifested as neuromyotonia which is clinically seen as myokymia

These comprise most of the possible symptoms of Morvan syndrome. However, it is less likely for an individual patient to manifest all the above clinical features. The varied occurrence of the clinical features of the syndrome may depend on the type of antibody detected either anti-CASPR2 or anti-LGI1 or both or some other antibodies.

The presence of tumors (especially thymoma), weight loss, and additional antibodies directed toward the acetylcholine receptor are found in association with CASPR2 antibodies. Whereas, serum hyponatremia and delusions, as well as myoclonus, are more common in the presence of LGI1 antibodies.
