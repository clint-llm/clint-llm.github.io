Temporary cardiac pacing (TCP) is a type of exogenous cardiac pacing in which an external energy source delivers electrical impulses to stimulate the heart to contract faster than its native rate. This intervention can be used to over-ride a malignant tachydysrhythmia or compensate for symptomatic bradycardia. TCP is typically used for dysrhythmias refractory to pharmacological therapies or cardioversion. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and various techniques for TCP and explains the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in managing patients who undergo TCP.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the common indications for temporary cardiac pacing.
- Review the technique involved in various types of temporary cardiac pacing, including transcutaneous, transvenous, and epicardial.
- Identify the potential complications of temporary cardiac pacing.
- Summarize a structured, interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients undergoing temporary cardiac pacing.
