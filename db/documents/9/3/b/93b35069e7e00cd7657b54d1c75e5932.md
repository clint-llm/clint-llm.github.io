Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is a clinical and imaging diagnosis. Understanding the demographics and clinical presentation can potentially lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, JNA is a slow-growing lesion and can be asymptomatic for a prolonged period depending on its specific pattern of growth and involvement in the patient, thus leading to more advanced disease at initial presentation. The slow-growing nature also leads to the chronicity of symptoms of at least 6 months or more.

Prompt imaging and specialty referral lead to early treatment primarily through surgical resection, utilizing preoperative embolization to decrease blood loss and related surgical complications. Radiation, hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy have predominantly adjuvant roles either in the setting of recurrent or unresectable residual disease, or potentially to reduce tumor size before surgery. At this time, hormonal and cytotoxic drug therapies have limited data regarding efficacy, and further study is warranted.
