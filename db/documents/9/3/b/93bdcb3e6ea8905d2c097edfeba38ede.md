**Prevalence and Incidence**

Many studies in 2010 reveal that cataracts are most common in the White American race, where prevalence ranges from 17 to 18% per 100 people. Blacks were the second-highest affected by cataracts, with a 13% prevalence rate, followed by Hispanics with a prevalence rate of almost 12%.

**Age**

Onset is gradual and progressive commonly in the older age group, typically in the fifth and sixth decade, though cases have been reported in children and the elderly as well.

Recent studies reveal that the disease is more common in women than men, with a male to female ratio of 1 to approximately 1.3.
