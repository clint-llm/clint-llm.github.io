A hysterosalpingogram is an imaging technique in the pathway for diagnosing causes of infertility in females. The initial imaging technique is mainly ultrasonography, but a hysterosalpingogram is used to visualize the intrauterine space and the fallopian tubes' patency. The initial ultrasonography is usually done through a transvaginal route that can be used to detect gross structures like fibroids and polyps. Hysterosalpingography is more sensitive to identifying the abnormalities within the fallopian tubes. After the initial ultrasound imaging, providers can offer a hysterosalpingogram or a hysterosalpingosonogram. Recent research has suggested that a hysterosalpingogram is superior when the primary outcome is pregnancy.

A randomized control trial of 1119 women compared hysterosalpingography with oil or water contrast. Pregnancy and live births were improved in the oil contrast group. Other authors agree but have asked for trials comparing modalities such as ultrasound and laparoscopy.
