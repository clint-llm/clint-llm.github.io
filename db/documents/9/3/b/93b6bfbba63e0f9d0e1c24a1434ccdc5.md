Magnesium toxicity occurs in both sexes as this condition is indirectly developed due to underlying pathology or excessive exogenous intake. However, women are more likely to develop magnesium toxicity as magnesium is universally used to treat pre-eclampsia, which complicates about 3% of pregnancies nationwide. Additionally, magnesium toxicity occurs at a higher rate in the U.S. versus worldwide, likely due to the wider availability of magnesium-containing over-the-counter supplements. The prevalence of hypermagnesemia among hospitalized patients in the U.S. was also found to be 9.3%.
