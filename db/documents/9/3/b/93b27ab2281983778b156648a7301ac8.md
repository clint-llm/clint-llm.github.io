**Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics**

**Route of Administration:**Intravenous

**Onset of action:**Propofol has a rapid onset of action that is dose-dependent and less than a minute.

**Duration of action:**An induction dose of propofol will have a clinical effect for approximately 10 minutes. The prolonged or repeated administration will accumulate in peripheral tissues and will cause an increased duration of action.

**Distribution:**Large volume of distribution.

**Protein Binding:**97% to 99%.

**Metabolism:**Hepatic oxidation and conjugation to sulfate and glucuronide conjugates.

**Clearance:**Hepatic clearance is approximately 60%, with extrahepatic clearance making up the remaining 40%, most of which is via the kidneys.

**Half-life:**Propofol is bi-phasic, with its initial half-life being relatively quick, around 40 minutes, and its terminal half-life usually being 4 to 7 hours. Context-sensitive half-time may be up to 1 to 3 days after a 10-day infusion. The clinical effect of propofol is much shorter in duration.

**Excretion:**Primarily renal.

After a single bolus or short-term infusion, the termination of action is primarily by redistribution, owing to the lipophilicity of the drug. Metabolism and excretion play minor roles in the termination of effects following a single bolus. Prolonged infusions may lead to slower emergence from anesthesia once the tissues and blood have reached a steady-state concentration.
