Most tumors in adults that compress the spinal cord involve the vertebral column and thus compress the spinal cord at the anterior aspect of the cord. Children, in contrast, usually experience compression from a paravertebral mass, which results in lateral or posterior compression.

Pain relief is not immediate in palliative radiation therapy, as cells do not die until the next cell division. Thus, symptom relief may take several days after initiation of treatment.

The principle underlying radiation therapy is to target malignant cells by hindering the cellular response to DNA damage and or replication. Radiation therapy is applied over the course of multiple treatments to reduce toxicity to the normal cells and target rapidly proliferating cells. Radiation acts in two ways:

- 1: To directly effectuate both single and double-stranded breaks to the DNA structure

- 2: To indirectly produce free radicals derived from the ionization of the water component of cells.

Radiation therapy also benefits from the activation of the NFÎºB transcription pathway, which increases the radiosensitivity of the cancer cells.
