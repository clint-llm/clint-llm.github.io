The surgeon should have a detailed discussion with the patient to explain the indications, risks, and benefits, as well as alternatives to enucleation. The patient will need to be aware of potential complications which are discussed in more detail under the complications section. If the patient is on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, aspirin, or anticoagulants, then, if medically possible, these can be discontinued prior to the surgery. The patient's primary care provider will need to be informed regarding any adjustment of anticoagulation medication.
