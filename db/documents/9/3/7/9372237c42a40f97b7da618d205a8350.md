HPV infects the basal cells of the squamous epithelium of the cervix. Once inside the host cell, the HPV DNA replicates as the basal cells differentiate and progress to the surface of the epithelium. The HPV gene expression becomes unlinked to the state of cellular differentiation of infected epithelial cells, and deregulation expression of the early region of the viral genome results in a dramatic increase in the expression of the two HPV oncoproteins (E6 and E7). This results in the loss of the normal cell cycle control of the epithelium, and cells will develop morphologic features with immature "basaloid- type" squamous cells and mitotic figures in the upper half of the cervical epithelium. These features can be seen on colposcopy when acetic acid is applied to the cervix. A biopsy of this area is performed and sent to the pathologist to evaluate the degree of dysplasia present.
