The common differentials include polypharmacy, toxic ingestions, meningitis, sepsis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, and malaria. A detailed medication review can exclude several of these disease processes. Except for heat cramps, neither muscle rigidity nor muscle clonus are signs of heat stroke and can distinguish neuroleptic malignancy and serotonin syndrome. Travel history should be questioned, evaluating exposure to malaria endemic environments and the particular malaria species in that area. However, malaria, sepsis, or meningitis will not be commonly present with the same elevations in core body temperature.
