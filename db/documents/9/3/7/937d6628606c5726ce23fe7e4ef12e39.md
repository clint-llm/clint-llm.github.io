Pathologic fractures occur secondary to altered skeletal physiology and mechanics in the setting of a benign or malignant lesion. Therefore, proper diagnosis, staging, and treatment of pathologic fractures are essential to improve patient outcomes. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of pathologic fractures and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the common symptoms and physical exam findings associated with pathologic fractures.
- Outline the approach to the staging workup for the causative lesion resulting in a pathologic fracture.
- Summarize the surgical approach to fixation for pathologic fractures based on anatomic location and healing potential.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by pathologic fractures.
