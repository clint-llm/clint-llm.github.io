Uterine rupture refers to the complete division of all three layers of the uterus: the endometrium (inner epithelial layer), myometrium (smooth muscle layer), and perimetrium (serosal outer surface). Generally speaking, the term uterine rupture implies that a gravid uterus is involved—though ruptures have been reported in nonpregnant uteri. A uterine rupture can allow a part of the fetus, amniotic fluid, or the umbilical cord to enter the peritoneal cavity or broad ligament. A uterine rupture can cause abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, a change in the contraction pattern, or a nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing.
