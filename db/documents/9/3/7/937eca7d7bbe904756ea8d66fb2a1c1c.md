GLP-1 analog overdoses are few and far between. When they do occur, the symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which have led to acute kidney injury likely secondary to dehydration. Excessive belching and abdominal pain have been reported as well. Serious complications like pancreatitis have not been experienced. There have been rare episodes of hypoglycemia that were corrected without long-term complications.

Several case reports have shown that an overdose of GLP-1 receptor agonists mainly causes GI symptoms but either no or minimal hypoglycemia. These patients are managed supportively according to their symptoms, with intravenous fluids to hydrate the patient and antiemetic medications to control nausea and vomiting.
