Renal cell carcinoma can develop due to genetic or acquired causes. The two most common genetic abnormalities are the Von Hippelâ€“Lindau (VHL) gene and the protein polybromo-1 (PBRM-1) gene. The common acquired causes include long-term dialysis dependence, history of smoking, long-term analgesic use, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes.

Screening should be considered in patients with high-risk characteristics such as VHL syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, long-term dialysis dependence (more than 3 years), especially in young patients, family history of RCC, and personal history of irradiation. Following renal transplantation, the risk of kidney cancer is 15 fold in the first three years and increases thereafter due to immunosuppressive therapy.
