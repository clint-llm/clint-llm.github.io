Chiari malformation type I is described according to the morphology of the hindbrain. Classic features are a greater than 5 mm descent of the caudal tip of cerebellar tonsils past the foramen magnum; however, as little as less than 3 mm caudal cerebellar descent may be seen in a child presenting early with Chiari I.

In Chiari type I, the main cause of pathology is due to tonsillar invagination and direct compression of neurological structures within the foramen magnum/upper spinal cord, with obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and potentially associated syringomyelia. This latter malformation, also termed as Morvan disease, is myelopathy that consists of the abnormal formation of one or more cysts or cavities (syrinxes) containing CSF inside the spinal cord and is detectable in 20% to 85% of Chiari I cases. Secondary features by way of syrinx formation may be further obstruction of spinal canal CSF outflow and further direct compression of neurovascular structures.

Because the foramen of Magendie can be obstructed, the fourth ventricle can result enlarged. Hydrocephalus may occur in approximately 10% of patients. Skeletal associations may include platybasia/basilar invagination, Sprengel deformity, and atlantooccipital assimilation. Syndromic associations include Klippel-Feil, Gorham-Stout disease, Crouzon, and Pfeiffer syndromes.
