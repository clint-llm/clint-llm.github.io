The nose is made up of bony and cartilaginous frameworks. The bony nasal pyramid consists of paired nasal bones and the bilateral frontal processes of the maxillae. Cartilaginous structures include the upper lateral cartilages, which articulate with the inferior edges of the nasal bones, and the lower lateral (or alar) cartilages that make up the nasal tip. Supporting the external nose and continuing beneath the midline of the bony nasal vault is the septum, which is composed of bony and cartilaginous portions. Both the cartilage and the bone of the external nasal skeleton are susceptible to fracture.

Nosebleeds commonly occur with nasal fractures. The blood supply to the nose originates from branches of both the internal and external carotid arteries. Arising from the internal carotid artery is the ophthalmic artery, which in turn gives off the anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries that travel from the orbits medially along the skull base to the superior aspect of the nasal septum. The facial and internal maxillary arteries branch from the external carotid artery. The facial artery further branches into the superior labial artery and the sphenopalatine and greater palatine arteries.

- The anterior ethmoidal artery, which is a branch of the ophthalmic artery

- The sphenopalatine artery, which is a branch of the maxillary artery

- The greater palatine artery, also a branch of the maxillary artery

- The superior labial artery, a branch of the facial artery

This plexus of vessels is clinically significant, as more than 90% of patients presenting with epistaxis will experience bleeding from this area. Trauma to the nasal bones can also cause transection of the anterior ethmoidal artery with resultant brisk, heavy intermittent bleeding. This may require the artery to be clipped and is, fortunately, a very rare occurrence. A blow to the face forceful enough to produce a nasal fracture may also produce fractures of the orbits, maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinus, and cribriform plate as well.

**Classification of Nasal Trauma**

Nasal fractures can be classified on a scale that stratifies the severity of the injury.

- Type I: Injury limited to soft tissue

- Type IIa: Simple, unilateral nondisplaced fracture

- Type IIb: Simple, bilateral nondisplaced fracture

- Type III: Simple, displaced fracture

- Type IV: Closed comminuted fracture

- Type V: Open comminuted fracture or complicated fracture
