Brain positron emission tomography (PET) scans provide functional assessments of different physiological and pathophysiological cerebral changes. PET scans allow us to clinically visualize glucose or amino acid metabolism, dopamine receptors, as well as amyloid and tau deposits in the brain. PET imaging in the context of neuroimaging is used to evaluate tumors, infection, inflammation, various neurodegenerative processes, and seizure disorders. The range of pathologies that can be evaluated for in PET neuroimaging has been gradually growing with new radiotracers showing promise in evaluating diseased brain tissue.
