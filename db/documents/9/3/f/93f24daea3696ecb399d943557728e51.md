Despite advances in medical knowledge, there is no direct cause for brain tumors identified. A combination of genetic and environmental factors is blamed to come into play in the pathogenesis of brain tumors. Multiple known cancer predisposition syndromes show associations with brain tumors, for example, DICER1, Li-Fraumeni, and other neurocutaneous syndromes such as neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Von-Hippel Lindau.

Family history may play a role in the etiology as many studies report an association of brain tumors and siblings.

The parental age at birth may also play a role. Studies show that offspring are at high risk for brain cancer (astrocytoma and ependymoma) in women who are older than 40.

Several studies have suggested a link between infectious exposure during childhood and brain cancer, but this topic remains debatable.

High dose radiation has been linked to brain malignancies. Children who have received radiation for leukemia are known to be at risk for developing brain cancer.

Further elaboration of the pathogenesis of brain tumor is beyond this quick review.
