The BDG is not formed any earlier than 2 months of age because pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is too high at this time to allow passive pulmonary blood flow (PBF) and systemic oxygenation. Timing for an early BDG includes worsening cyanosis following a Stage I repair or residual aortic coarctation, although these patients tend to have a complicated postoperative course secondary to elevated PVR. There are also select patients who do not require a stage I palliation and the BDG is their first operative intervention.

Prior to surgical repair, patients should undergo cardiac catheterization or cardiac MRI to ascertain anatomy and physiology. Prior to surgical intervention, the surgeon should be aware of the patientâ€™s PVR, ventricular end-diastolic pressure, AV valve function, and residual blood flow obstruction at the atrial septum remnant. Anatomic variants must be investigated, primarily alternative venous communications between sinus venous drainage and the myocardium or IVC. These vessels can result in postoperative hypoxemia as venous return from the upper body bypasses the pulmonary circulation. A thorough preoperative evaluation should elucidate multisystemic organ function. Patients treated with anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors should have these medications discontinued prior to surgery. Many institutions will also discontinue aspirin for 7-10 days preoperatively, although it is useful in maintaining BT shunt patency.
