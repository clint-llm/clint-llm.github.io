In patients with gastric cancer that undergo gastrectomies, the complication of a subphrenic abscess can be as high as 4.0%. This usually happens after total gastrectomies and is thought to be caused secondary to leaks in the anastomoses. The treatment is the same for such abscesses as described above, which should include intraabdominal catheter drainage and intravenous antibiotics.
