Injections of the trochanteric bursa are commonly performed to treat pain secondary to greater trochanteric bursitis. The interprofessional approach is critical to maintaining patient safety and optimizing procedure performance.

Communication is essential as each healthcare team member plays a role in facilitating patient care. The nurse should bring in the equipment and medications and place appropriate monitors for vital signs. The imaging technician should know the treatment site to position the fluoroscopy machine appropriately. Any questions or concerns about the medications administered during the procedure should be directed toward a pharmacist. After the procedure, the patient should be monitored for any immediate adverse effects or complications.

The patient should be instructed that pain relief after the procedure will likely be temporary due to the transient effect of the local anesthetic and that it will take several days for the corticosteroids to take effect. In addition, the patient should be educated on common issues after the procedure, such as local site tenderness and any signs or symptoms that warrant medical attention. The patient should also be advised to avoid prolonged submersion in water for 24 hours.

The clinician who performed the procedure should be available to answer any questions or concerns before patient discharge. An interprofessional approach provides the best patient outcomes.
