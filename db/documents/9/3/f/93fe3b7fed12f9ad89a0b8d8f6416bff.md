The need to immobilize the femur is primarily due to fractures and dislocations. Each of these injuries dictates a specific immobilization and stabilization technique. In the acute phase of the injury, application of external devices may facilitate transportation and other treatment necessities of the polytrauma patient. The most common cause of the 2 injuries is trauma which may cause an open or closed fracture, but both can typically be immobilized with the same principles. Later in the course of the treatment, other stabilization options are available. This activity reviews femur immobilization management, and explains the role of the interprofessional team in providing care for patients who require femur immobilization.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications, and contraindications of femur immobilization.
- Describe the equipment and personnel needed for femur immobilization.
- Review the potential complications of femur immobilization.
- Explain the role of the interprofessional team in providing care for patients who require femur immobilization.
