A splenic injury may not always be clinically apparent, and spontaneous splenic rupture or pathologic splenic rupture can occur after negligible trauma or insignificant events.

Ultrasound can be very helpful and highly accurate in the diagnosis of significant splenic injury but is limited in detecting active bleeding, pseudoaneurysm, or early in the evaluation when blood loss is minimal. However, ultrasound at the bedside in the emergency department has been able to visualize as little as 100 mL of free fluid in the abdomen with 90% sensitivity

Splenic injury is classified based on CT findings according to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) Organ Injury Scale. It helps categorizes splenic injuries but does not predict the need for surgical intervention.

Grade 1

- Hematoma, subcapsular, less than 10% surface area

- Laceration, capsular tear, less than 1 cm parenchymal depth

Grade 2

- Hematoma, subcapsular, 10% to 50% surface area

- Intraparenchymal, less than 5 cm in diameter

- Laceration, capsular tear, 1 cm to 3 cm parenchyma depth that does not involve a trabecular vessel

Grade 3

- Hematoma, subcapsular, more than 50% surface area expanding; ruptured subcapsular or parenchymal hematoma; intraparenchymal hematoma 5 cm or greater and expanding

- Laceration, greater than 3 cm parenchymal depth or involving trabecular vessels

Grade 4

- Laceration involving segmental or hilar vessels producing major devascularization  (more than 25% of spleen)

Grade 5

- Laceration, completely shattered spleen

- Vascular, Hilar vascular injury that devascularizes the spleen
