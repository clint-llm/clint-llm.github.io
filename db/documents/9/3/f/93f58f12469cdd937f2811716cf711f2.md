Pleural effusion may be the first presentation of malignancy. The most commonly encountered complaint in a patient presenting with an MPE is dyspnea, occurring in more than half of cases. This results from the alteration of respiratory mechanics in which the diaphragm is displaced caudally, and the chest wall is displaced outward. A cough may also be present due to distortion of the lung. Chest pain due to the involvement of the sensory neurons on the parietal and, occasionally, the visceral pleura can occur.

Physical exam findings include decreased breath sounds over the involved hemithorax, dullness to percussion, and decreased tactile fremitus. The development of pleural effusion should have no bearing on oxygenation as it does not alter V/Q dynamics or result in shunting; if a patient with MPE presents with hypoxia, an alternative explanation such as pneumonia, atelectasis related to the endobronchial lesion or pulmonary embolism should be sought.
