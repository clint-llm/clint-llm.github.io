Like other tumors of the testicle, painless swelling of a testicle is the single most common presentation of Leydig cell tumors.

Unique to Leydig cell tumors, however, are patients presenting with conspicuous clinical manifestations owing to the tumor’s propensity to secrete androgens or (less commonly) estrogen, directly or by peripheral conversion of testosterone.

In prepubertal patients, this can present as precocious puberty, including early development of pubic hair as well as penile and musculoskeletal growth beyond that expected for the child’s age.

Interestingly, the physiologic effects of the elevated levels of circulating androgens in postpubertal men are usually clinically unnoticeable. Therefore, the most common hormone-related presentation of a man with a Leydig cell tumor is gynecomastia.
