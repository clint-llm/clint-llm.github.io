An interprofessional team, including; an emergency department physician, orthopedic surgeon, nurse practitioner, and physical therapist, is essential in the diagnosis and management of LCL injuries. Initial treatment of LCL injuries is always RICE therapy. A proper history and physical, along with an MRI, when indicated,  is the gold standard in diagnosing this injury. Depending on the severity, LCL injuries are manageable nonoperatively or operatively. With appropriate treatment, the prognosis for LCL or PLC injuries is good, but recovery time may exceed four months in high-grade injuries.
