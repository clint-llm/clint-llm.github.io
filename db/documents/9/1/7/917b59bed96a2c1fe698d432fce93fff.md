- Creatinine and liver function tests require measurement at baseline, then one month after the maintenance dose is achieved. Periodically monitor liver function tests in patients managed with tizanidine chronically and in higher doses.

- Monitor blood pressure and heart rate before increasing the dosage because of the risk of severe hypotension associated with the higher dose.

- Monitor the level of spasticity by Ashworth and modified Ashworth Scales.

- In patients with multiple sclerosis, monitor spasticity using MS Spasticity Scale(MSSS-88).
