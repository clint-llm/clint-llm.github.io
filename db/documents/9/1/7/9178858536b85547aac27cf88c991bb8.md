The nerve supply of the hepatoduodenal ligament remains undetermined, but postsynaptic sympathetic nerve fibers may be associated with the vascular structure. The vagus nerve divides into both anterior and posterior branches as it enters the abdominal region. The anterior branch further divides into smaller branches, which travels through the lesser omentum. The vagus nerveÂ also runs through the portal triad, and it may play a role in the parasympathetic nerve supply of the ligament.
