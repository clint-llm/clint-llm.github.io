Pelvic anatomy and physiology are diverse and are treated by several subspecialists, including gynecologic oncologists, colorectal surgeons, urologists, and plastic surgeons. Most vulvar cancers are located superficially and are cured with wide local excision of the primary lesion. The vulva is a catch-all for the external female anatomy. This includes the labia majora and minora, vestibule, introitus, mons pubis, clitoris, Bartholin glands, Skene glands, and ureteral meatus. The vulva functions to protect a womanâ€™s sexual organs and is the heart of much of the female sexual response. This area is supplied by the pudendal nerve, which exits the sacral spine and enters the pelvis just medial to the ischial spine. This nerve provides sensation to the vulva and is responsible for urination, defecation, and orgasm. It divides into three main branches: the inferior rectal nerve, perineal nerve, and the dorsal nerve to the clitoris. The internal pudendal artery, a branch of the internal iliac artery, supplies the vast majority of the external genitalia. The superficial external pudendal artery, a branch of the femoral artery, supplies the labia majora. Venous drainage follows the superficial and deep systems from which they came.

The vagina is an elastic, muscular tube that connects the vulva to the cervix. It is responsible for sexual intercourse and childbirth. It is supplied by the anterior branch of the internal iliac artery, which continues as the vaginal artery. The nerve supply is largely autonomic.

It is also important to understand the anatomic relation of these organs with the pelvic floor muscles, bladder (anterior), and rectum (posterior).
