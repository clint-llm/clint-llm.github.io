Physiologic changes associated with aging lead to an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure (PP), as well as a decreased ability to respond to abrupt hemodynamic changes.

The increased blood pressure seen with aging is most likely related to arterial changes, as aging results in the narrowing of the vessel lumen and stiffening of the vessel walls through a process known as atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis leads to structural alterations, including increased vascular calcification, causing earlier reflected pressure waves during blood pressure wave propagation. The pressure wave arrives back from the aortic root during systole and contributes to the increase in systolic blood pressure. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) tends to increase up to 50 years of age due to the rise in arteriolar resistance. The large artery stiffening occurring later in life contributes to wider pulse pressure, including a decreased diastolic blood pressure. The increase in arteriolar resistance, in combination with large artery stiffening, leads to a significant increase in systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and mean arterial pressure. The most prevalent class of hypertension in patients greater than 50 years old is isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), which occurs de novo or from prolonged HTN.

The decreased ability to appropriately respond to abrupt hemodynamic changes is rooted in many pathophysiological factors, including a change in heart structure and function and a decrease in the autonomic regulation of blood pressure. Left ventricular hypertrophy and a decrease in left ventricle compliance correlate with a reduction in cardiac performance and in the ability to increase systolic blood pressure in response to stress. The autonomic system plays a key role in maintaining blood pressure through physiologic responses to standing, volume depletion, and increased cardiac output during stress. With a decrease in the autonomic regulation of blood pressure, there is a significant impact on physiologic adaption. One example includes the high prevalence of orthostatic hypotension among the elderly population.
