Paraproteinemic keratopathy is often initially misdiagnosed as other corneal pathologies, with misdiagnosis becoming apparent after initial treatment fails. In suspected corneal dystrophy, for example, recurrent disease within a year of penetrating keratoplasty is evidence that a systemic process may be involved. In all cases where systemic gammopathy is suspected, SPEP or UPEP should be obtained, along with further workup as described above. Differential diagnosis is broad and includes:

- Amyloidosis

- Arcus lipoides

- Schneider corneal dystrophy

- Lattice corneal dystrophy

- Gelatinous, drop-like corneal dystrophy

- Granular corneal dystrophy

- Diffuse stromal corneal dystrophy

- Reis-Bucklers corneal dystrophy

- Pre-Descemet corneal dystrophy

- Cystinosis

- Peripheral hypertrophic degeneration

- Limbal stem cell deficiency

- Cornea farinata

- Posterior corneal pigmentation

- Interstitial keratitis

- Salzmann nodular degeneration

- Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) enzyme deficiency
