The right and left coronary arteries originate from the aortic root and supply the myocardium. Coronary blood is predominantly drained to the right side of the heart through the coronary sinus. The coronary sinus lies in the left atrioventricular groove on the posterior aspect of the heart and drains directly into the right atrium. The WBC is usually delivered in an antegrade manner through the aortic sinus (or directly through individual coronary ostia). It can also be delivered in a retrograde fashion through the coronary sinus (after right atriotomy) via a retrograde cannula placed in the coronary sinus through the right atrial appendage. Delivery of the WBC can be intermittent or continuous depending on a number of factors like nature and type of the surgery, surgeon's preference, and technical considerations.
