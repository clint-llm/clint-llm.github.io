# Continuing Education Activity

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a gram-positive bacteria that colonizes the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract. It is known to cause both early onset and late onset infections in neonates. This activity describes the evaluation and management of group B Streptococcus and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of group B Streptococcus infection.
- Review the use of rectovaginal culture for the evaluation of group B Streptococcus infection in pregnant females.
- Outline the use of intravenous penicillin G in the treatment of group B Streptococcus infection.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by group B Streptococcus infection.

# Introduction

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) or Streptococcus agalactiae is a gram-positive bacteria which colonizes the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract

# Etiology

The main risk factor for early-onset GBS infection is colonization of the maternal genital tract with Group B Streptococcus during labor

# Epidemiology

As stated above, GBS colonization has an incidence of 10-30% in pregnancy

# Pathophysiology

The principal route of neonatal early onset GBS infection is vertical transmission from colonized mothers during passage through the vagina during labor and delivery

# Evaluation

The principal defense against early-onset GBS infection is the administration of antibiotic prophylaxis to mothers during labor and delivery. Identification of patients who will benefit from intrapartum prophylaxis is an important aspect of routine prenatal care

GBS bacteriuria is another marker of genital tract colonization

If GBS status is unknown, antibiotic prophylaxis should be initiated in patients with preterm labor (less than 37 weeks gestation), maternal fever during labor (greater than 100.4 F or 38 C), membranes ruptured greater than 18 hours, and/or in patients with a history of a previous child with invasive early-onset GBS infection

# Treatment / Management

Intravenous penicillin G is the treatment of choice for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against Group B Streptococcus. Penicillin G 5 million units intravenous is administered as a loading dose, followed by 2.5 to 3 million units every 4 hours during labor until delivery

Penicillin G and ampicillin should not be used in patients with penicillin allergy. Antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, respiratory distress, or urticaria following penicillin or cephalosporin is guided by antibiotic susceptibility testing

In patients without GBS susceptibility testing with penicillin allergy, vancomycin is recommended for GBS prophylaxis with dosing as described above

Cefazolin 2 gram intravenous loading dose followed by 1 gm every 8 hours may be used in patients without a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, respiratory distress, or urticaria following penicillin or cephalosporin administration

Initiating antibiotic prophylaxis greater than 4 hours before delivery is considered to be adequate antibiotic prophylaxis and is effective in the prevention of transmission of GBS to the fetus. However, antibiotic prophylaxis administered at a shorter interval will provide some protection. If a patient presents in active labor and delivery is expected in less than 4 hours, antibiotic prophylaxis should still be initiated

GBS vaccines show promise to combat early-onset GBS infection, but there are currently no approved GBS vaccines on the market

# Differential Diagnosis

- Bacterial pneumonia

- Cellulitis

- Urinary tract infection in females

- Dermatologic manifestations of necrotizing fasciitis

- Diskitis

- Endometritis

- Epidural abscess

- Infective endocarditis

- Meningitis

- Osteomyelitis in emergency medicine

- Septic arthritis

- Urinary tract infection in pregnancy

- Wound infection

# Prognosis

Since the initiation of universal screening for GBS colonization and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, the incidence of early-onset GBS infection has decreased approximately 80%

Early-onset GBS infection typically presents in the first 24 to 48 hours of life. Symptoms include respiratory distress, apnea, with signs of sepsis

# Complications

Infection and colonization of maternal group B streptococcus (GBS) can result in various adverse outcomes, which include increased rates of febrile morbidity and chorioamnionitis that can lead to maternal sepsis

# Pearls and Other Issues

- In the United States of America, GBS is known to be the most common infectious cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates

- Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is only effective in the prevention of early-onset GBS infection

- The CDC recommends universal screening with GBS rectovaginal culture between 35 to 37 weeks in each pregnancy

- Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended with positive GBS rectovaginal culture, GBS bacteriuria at any time during the pregnancy, or a history of delivery of infant affected by early onset GBS infection

- If GBS status is unknown, antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended during preterm labor and delivery (less than 37 weeks), in the presence of maternal fever during labor, or with prolonged rupture of membranes (greater than 18 hours)

- Intravenous Penicillin G is the antibiotic of choice for intrapartum prophylaxis

- Additional options for antibiotic prophylaxis are ampicillin, cefazolin, clindamycin, or vancomycin

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Prevention of GBS infection during pregnancy requires an interprofessional team effort. All healthcare workers who look after pregnant women should screen these patients for GBS. This may include physicians, physician's assistants, nurse practioners, midwives and/or nurses.

Since the initiation of universal screening for GBS colonization and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, the incidence of early-onset GBS infection has decreased approximately 80%
