Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is a rare genetic disorder that causes significant disability and morbidity. In this disorder, heterotopic ossification starts in the first decade of life, and a majority of such cases develop inflammatory painful soft tissue swellings. This disability progresses from upper to lower end, proximal to the distal end, and a dorsal to ventral side, i.e., from neck, spine, shoulders to elbow, knee, hip, jaw to wrists, and ankle. The wrists, ankles, elbows, knees, hips, and jaw gradually get involved till 40 years of age. There is no definitive management for this life-threatening disorder to date, and various new drugs are being tested in clinical trials. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.
- Review the common presentation of a patient with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.
- Identify the various investigations required for diagnosing fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.
- Explain the current treatment options for patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, along with the complications anticipated.
