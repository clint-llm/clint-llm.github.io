The patients present with visual loss, which may vary from mild to severe. Some patients may have no visual loss but may complain of metamorphopsia.

The simplest method for diagnosing retinal thickening is slit-lamp examination. CME refers to a typical stellate configuration, i.e., radially-orientated perifoveal cysts. It occurs due to the characteristic oblique arrangement of the Henle fiber layer. Edema outside the macular region has a honeycomb appearance as the outer plexiform layer is arranged perpendicularly.

The early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) defined clinically significant macular edema (CSME) as retinal thickening within 500 microns of the macular center; hard exudates within 500 microns of the macular center with associated adjacent retinal thickening; or retinal thickening measuring ≥1 disc area (DA), a part of which lies within one disc-diameter (DD) of the macular center. defined diffuse DME as ≥2 DA retinal thickening with involvement of the macular center; and focal DME as retinal thickening <2 DA without affecting the macular center.
