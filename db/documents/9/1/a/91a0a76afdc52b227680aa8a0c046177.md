Lichen planus is an idiopathic disease. Its pathogenesis is not fully understood, but it appears to represent a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. The prevailing theory is that exposure to an exogenous agent such as a virus, drug, or contact allergen causes alteration of epidermal self-antigens and activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. The altered self-antigens cross-react with normal self-antigens found on basal keratinocytes resulting in T-cell targeting and apoptosis.

A variety of agents have been associated with the development of LP, but aÂ particular note has been made of the link with viruses, especially the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients with LP are 5 times as likely to test positive for HCV as the general population, and those with HCV-seropositivity are 2.5 to 4.5 times as likely to develop LP.

Oral lichen planus is correlated with contact allergies to a variety of metals found in dental restorations including mercury, copper, and gold. Removal of the sensitizing metal resulting in clearance of LP lesions has been described.

A large number of drugs have been associated with LP, but recurrence of lesions following drug rechallenge is rare. More commonly associated drugs include antimalarials, ACEIs, thiazide diuretics, NSAIDs, quinidine, beta-blockers, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors, and gold.
