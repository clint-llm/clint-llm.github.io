The human eye's ability to detect hypoxemia is poor. The presence of central cyanosis, blue coloration of the tongue and mucous membranes, is the most reliable predictor; it occurs at an oxyhemoglobin saturation of about 75%.

There is no set standard of oxygen saturation where hypoxemiaÂ occurs. The generally accepted standard is that a normal resting oxygen saturation of less than 95% is considered abnormal.
