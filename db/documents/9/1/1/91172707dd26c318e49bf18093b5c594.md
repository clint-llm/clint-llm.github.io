Refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) is a type of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that is characterized by anemia and the presence of at least 15 percent ring sideroblasts in the marrow. Generally, patients will have normochromic, normocytic anemia and erythroid hyperplasia. This activity examines when RARS should be considered on differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate for it. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts.
- Review the common presentation of refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts.
- Describe the management of refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts.
- Explain a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts.
