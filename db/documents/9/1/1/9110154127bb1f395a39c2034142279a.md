The visceral components of the pelvis include gastrointestinal and genitourinary structures. The sigmoid colon, rectum, and anus are the terminus aspects of the intestinal tract. The genitourinary viscera include the urinary bladder and urethra; seminal vesicles and prostate (male); and uterus, ovaries, and vagina (females). Pelvic exenteration (PE) refers to an extended en bloc multi-visceral resection of pelvic structures.

A complete PE involves resection of the distal sigmoid colon, rectum, and anus along with the bladder, seminal vesicles, prostate, and urethra in males or the uterus, ovaries, vagina, bladder, and urethra in females. In females, partial pelvic exenterations can be performed as indicated: anterior- resection of the gynecologic and urologic structures with preservation of the rectum and anus; or posterior- resection of the gastrointestinal and gynecologic structures with preservation of the bladder and urethra.

PE was initially described in 1948 for palliative management of recurrent cervical carcinoma.
