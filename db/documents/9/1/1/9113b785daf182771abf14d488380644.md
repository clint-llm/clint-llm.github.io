Absolute contraindications to targeted neurolysis include patient refusal, active infection at the site of injection, and allergy to a chemical neurolytic agent. Bleeding disorders or anticoagulation treatment is considered a contraindication, particularly if injection occurs at non-compressible sites. If a pacemaker is in place and radiofrequency ablation is planned, the proceduralist should consult pacemaker interrogation services.
