Beta thalassemia has a spectrum of clinical presentations. Therefore a precise diagnosis is of paramount importance for optimum patient care. A prenatal diagnosis of beta thalassemia can help prevent the disease. There are non-invasive methods like extraction of DNA from fetal cells in maternal circulation or directly using free fetal DNA in maternal circulation.

Among the invasive methods is obtaining fetal DNA by chorionic villi sampling by ultrasound-guided transabdominal or ultrasound-guided transcervical biopsy. Another invasive method is using amniotic fluid cells to culture fetal DNA. The DNA acquired by amniotic fluid cells is not much, but enough for PCR-based analysis.
