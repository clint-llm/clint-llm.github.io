Laboratory, histopathological, and clinical features are the hallmark of evaluation of papuloerythroderma of Ofuji. Laboratory tests including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, serum IgE, viral titers for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and HIV, RPR, VDRL should be performed. Presence of lymphopenia elevated serum IgE, and peripheral eosinophilia are all consistent with the diagnosis of PEO. Histological evaluation of a punch biopsy should be performed in patients and reveals a perivascular infiltration of inflammatory cells including histiocytes, lymphocytes, and granulocytes. As a result of the similarity in clinical presentation of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and that of PEO, patients should undergo flow cytometry and T-cell receptor clonality studies to rule out the possibility of misdiagnosis and to prevent further delay of treatment in patients with CTCL.
