Human blood vessels and microcirculation systems change with increasing BP. These changes are especially obvious for patients with severe hypertension.Â Hypertension in various stages can prompt fluctuating degrees of cardiovascular dissemination change; a few changes are gentle or reversible (unstable changes, for example, prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension), while others are subjective (chronic changes, for example, stage 2 hypertension and serious hypertension, for which it is difficult to reestablish the ordinary BP level). Subsequently, the cardiovascular circulatory framework will display distinctive reflections for various BP levels.
