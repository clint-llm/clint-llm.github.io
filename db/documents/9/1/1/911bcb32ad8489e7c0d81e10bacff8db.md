If the healing process goes as intended without any complications, the tissue is restored to a relatively similar state as before the injury. Sometimes this process is interrupted, and chronic wounds or infections occur. Wounds that do not heal after 3 months are considered chronic. Chronic wounds may predispose patients to further complications such as disfigurement, sepsis, loss of function, or amputation.

Other times the healing process may be overactive and form excess scar tissue creating complications such as hypertrophic scars and keloids.
