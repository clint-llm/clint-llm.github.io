Keys to remember and avoid in patients with acute hepatitis

- Get a complete history including all medications, herbal or nutritional supplements,Â  travel history, and social history, including alcohol use, IV drug use, and sexual history.

- Consider acetaminophen (paracetamol) toxic ingestion, either intentional or unintentional/accidental.

- Consider extrahepatic or non-hepatitic causes of elevated liver biochemical tests.

- If the patient appears ill, consider acute liver failure looking for encephalopathy and coagulopathy.

- If the patient does not appear ill with no encephalopathy, normal INR, and able to maintain oral fluid intake and nutrition, outpatient follow-up is appropriate.
