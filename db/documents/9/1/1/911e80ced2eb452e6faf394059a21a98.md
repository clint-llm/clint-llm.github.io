In the United States, congenital adrenal hyperplasia is more common in Native Americans and Yupik Eskimos. Among Whites, the incidence is approximatelyÂ 1 in 15,000.

Since all forms of CAH have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, both sexes are equally affected. However, because of the accumulated testosterone or precursor hormones, the phenotypic expression may be different in both genders. CAH is usually obvious at birth or soon after because of the ambiguous genitals, early virilization, or salt wasting. Atypical cases may be recognized around puberty with the presence of virilizing signs or oligomenorrhea in females.
