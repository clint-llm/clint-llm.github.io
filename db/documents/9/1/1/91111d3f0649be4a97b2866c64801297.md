Treatment is typically symptomatic. Children with erythema infectiosum usually feel well during the infection and do not require treatment. If arthropathy is present, NSAIDs can be used. Red blood cell transfusions can be given to patients in aplastic crisis. Mothers with confirmed infection in the one and two weeks of pregnancy should be monitored closely with serial ultrasounds.Â If needed, transfusions can be given to the fetus while in utero.
