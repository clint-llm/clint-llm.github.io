Patients with keratoconjunctivitis typicallyÂ present with a red, irritated eye. Therefore a differential diagnosis should include:

- Conjunctivitis (bacterial, fungal, viral, chemical, exposure, toxic)

- Episcleritis/scleritis

- Uveitis/Iritis

- Endophthalmitis

- Corneal abrasion/ulcer

- Corneal foreign body

- Acute angle closure glaucoma

- Subconjunctival hemorrhage

Urgent conditions to consider from the above list include acute angle closure glaucoma, endophthalmitis, corneal ulcer, corneal foreign body, and uveitis/iritis. Concern for any of these conditions should prompt referral to ophthalmology. Other signs/symptoms that might trigger ophthalmology referral include:

- History of foreign body/trauma

- Elevated intraocular pressure

- An asymmetric/nonreactive pupil

- Marked loss in visual acuity

- Extensive/debilitating pain including an inability to open eye or keep the eye open

- Corneal opacity

- Copious or hyperacute and progressive purulent discharge
