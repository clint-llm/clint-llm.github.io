The first and foremost step in the evaluation of carcinomatous meningitis is obtaining a comprehensive history and physical exam. An accurate neurological exam helps determine whether the involvement is focal or multifocal and leads the clinician to suspect leptomeningeal involvement. CSF evaluation and neuroimaging study is the next step in the diagnosis. A pragmatic approach for both diagnosis and prognosis may require testing of tumor markers as well.

**Cerebral Spinal Fluid**

CSF findings typically include the following:

- High CSF pressure (greater than 25 cmH2O) is observed in about 50% of CM patients.

- Pleocytosis is detected in 33-79% of CM.

- The protein level in CSF is elevated in about 80% of the cases.

- The glucose level in CSF in CM are decreased in about 25-40% of the cases and is called hypoglycorrhachia.

- Initial CSF cytology is positive in 55% of the cases.

The standardization of the method for CSF collection is an indispensable requirement. An appropriate site (producing symptoms preferably) and sufficient volume (minimum 10 ml) are the prerequisites for the spinal tap. Analysis of CSF via lumbar puncture (LP) and CSF tested from an indwelling catheter produces varying results.

Although CSF cytology is the gold standard for diagnosis, immunohistochemical staining of the cells is recommended, particularly if the primary site of the tumor remains unknown. Flow cytometry is a rapid, quantifiable measure of a specific type of cell with certain characteristics such as cancer cells that are associated with specific antigens. It provides a highly sensitive method for the detection of hematological malignancies. FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) is a cytogenetic technique for localizing particular DNA sequences or genes and may yield information on metastatic lesions but with a lower sensitivity.

Tumor markers have a role in making an early diagnosis and monitoring response to treatment. However, it may also be imperative in determining the prognosis. The nonspecific markers include LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), beta-2 microglobulin, and specific markers include AFP (alpha-fetoprotein), BHCG (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin), and CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen). CSF value of more than 1% of the serum level of these markers is diagnostic.

The glucose levels in CSF also have a prognostic value. The probability of CM is less with hyperglycorrhachia, and levels greater than 2.7 mmol/L are associated with better outcomes.

**CSF Flow Studies**

In CM, obstructions in CSF flow are common because of the adhesion of tumor cells in the subarachnoid space and occur in 30 to 70% of the cases.

**Neuroimaging**

Gadolinium-enhanced MRI scan is a pertinent test for the diagnosis of CM.****Radiographic findings may include hydrocephalus and leptomeningeal enhancement of the brain in the T1 weighted image with contrast. T2/FLAIR hyperintensities may be seen in the subarachnoid space. The cerebral convexities, cerebellar folia, basal cisterns, and ventricular ependymal regions are the common areas that display enhancement or nodular deposits in CM.

For solid tumors, the sensitivity of MRI is 76%, and it increases to 95% for spinal MRI in patients presenting with cauda equina syndrome.

MRI shows enhancement in both inflammatory and carcinomatous meningitis. Hence, it is imperative to pair it with CSF cytology. False-positive leptomeningeal enhancement may be seen in patients undergoing treatment due to therapy-induced inflammatory reaction, as seen with radiotherapy and immunotherapy. The prevalence is low (<1%) but still should be considered as a possibility in patients.
