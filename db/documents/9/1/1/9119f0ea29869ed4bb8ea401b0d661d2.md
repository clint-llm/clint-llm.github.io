Although the precise etiology of the syndrome is not known, the most plausible cause responsible for Takotsubo syndrome is the sudden release of stress hormones, such as norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine, causing cardiac stunning. Stunning the heart triggers changes in the cardiac myocytes and coronary perfusion.

Although roughly about one-fourth of patients have no clear triggers, Takotsubo syndrome is typically triggered by an unexpected emotionally or physically stressful event.

Events that have been reported to trigger TC include:

- Domestic abuse or relationship conflict

- Sudden loss of a loved one

- Natural disasters

- An accident or major trauma

- A fierce argument

- Severe financial or gambling losses

- An unexpected surprise like winning a lottery

- Being diagnosed with a serious acute medical condition or medical illness such as a stroke or a terminal illness

- Exhausting physical effort

- Surgery

- Head trauma

- Public speaking

- Extreme fright

- Use of drugs such as cocaine, excessive stimulant use, or inadvertent overdose of catecholamines

- Drug withdrawal

Researchers have no answer for why a specific stressful event will trigger this condition, but a similar event may not do so at a different time. Post-menopausal women are most likely affected by TTS, suggesting a possible role of estrogen deficiency. Patients with certain psychiatric conditions or mood disorders are also more likely to have Takotsubo syndrome. Recently reports have also described patients developing Takotsubo syndrome after a positive emotional experience, the so-called term, Happy heart syndrome.
