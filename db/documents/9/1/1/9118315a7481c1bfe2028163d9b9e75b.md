A medical error has been defined as "an unintended injury caused by medical management" that results in "measurable disability."

Defining medical error as an act of "omission or commission in planning or execution that contributes or could contribute to an unintended result" encompasses all measurable adverse outcomes and "close calls" that can result from errors in planning and execution of healthcare as well as errors of commission.

According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) Committee on Quality of Health Care in the US, an "error is defined as the failure of a planned action to be completed as intended or the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim."

Regardless of the definition, medical errors are associated with high morbidity and mortality and a high economic burden. Medical errors not only affect the patient, their family, and healthcare providers; they also negatively impact support staff, the healthcare facility, and the community.
