There are minimal complications associated directly with IFR; however, they are the same as that of a standard cardiac catheterization with angiography and PCI and include the following:

- Bleeding

- Access site hematoma and pseudoaneurysm

- Acute kidney injury caused by the contrast agent

- Anaphylaxis caused by the contrast agent

- Coronary artery dissection
