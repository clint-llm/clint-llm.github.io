Visual outcome in a patient with endophthalmitis depends on various variables.

- **Nature of endophthalmitis:**Better visual acuity has been reported in cases with culture-negative post-surgical endophthalmitis.

- **Organism:**Endophthalmitis due toStreptococcus,Bacillus,Pseudomonas,Candida

- **Presenting visual acuity:**In the EVS study, it has been noted that presenting visual acuity remains more powerful than microbiological factors in predicting visual outcome and response to vitrectomy.

- **Time to initiation of appropriate therapy:**It is of utmost importance in cases of post-traumatic endophthalmitis, especially with Bacillus species.****In the EVS study, in the group with a vision of light perception only, early vitrectomy resulted in a three-fold increased chance to achieve ≥ 20/40 (33%), a two-fold increased chance to achieve ≥ 20/100 (56%) and was less likely to worsen <5/200 (20%).

- **Systemic stability of the patient:**Immunocompromised patients, patients with endogenous endophthalmitis, have concurrent polymicrobial infections which influence the final outcome.

In the EVS study in post-cataract surgery endophthalmitis, it was noted that only 53% of treated eyes had final visual acuity of 20/40 or better, and 15% had a final visual acuity of 20/200 or worse.

If left untreated or inadequately treated, endophthalmitis progresses to panophthalmitis, requiring evisceration or enucleation of the eyeball. It is noted that patients suffering from a corneal ulcer, endogenous endophthalmitis, and low visual acuity are at higher risk of requiring evisceration or enucleation.
