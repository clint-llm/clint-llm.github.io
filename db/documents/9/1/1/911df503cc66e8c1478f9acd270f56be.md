Patients often can present asymptomatically, but this varies with the severity of hyperaldosteronism. First-occurrence and resistant hypertension are the most common presenting symptoms for these patients, and the sequelae of fatigue, headache, polyuria, and polydipsia commonly occur with it. Metabolic alkalosis observed in these patients is attributable to the same mechanism that happens in contraction alkalosis.

Patients with aldosteronism can be asymptomatic or symptomatic. Blood pressure can range from normotensive to severe hypertension and sometimes refractory hypertension. Sodium reabsorption, volume expansion, and increased peripheral vascular resistance are the causative factors for hypertension in aldosteronism.

Patients with secondary hyperaldosteronism can present with different blood pressure measurements. Renal artery stenosis and coarctation of Aorta have higher blood pressure. Patients with diuretic use have hypovolemia as can patients with heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. Patients with Gitelman’s and Bartter’s syndromes have mild hypotension.

Moderate to severe hypokalemia can cause neuromuscular symptoms such as fatigue, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, paresthesias, and cardiac arrhythmias. Also, antidiuretic hormone resistance in renal tubule due to hypokalemia has been implicated in diabetes insipidus in aldosteronism.****
