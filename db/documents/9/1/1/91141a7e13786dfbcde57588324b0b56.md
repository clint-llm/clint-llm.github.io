DKA is frequently present at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (in approximately 3% percent of children in the United States and Canada) and, along with its complications, is the most common cause of hospitalization, mortality, and morbidity in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

**DKA at initial presentation of type 1 diabetes mellitus:**DKA occurs at the time of diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in approximately 30 percent of children in the United States and Canada.

- Young age (<5 years of age and especially <2 years)

- Ethnic minority

- Low socioeconomic status

- Children living in countries with a low prevalence of type 1 diabetes

- Ethnic minority

- Delayed diagnosis of diabetes

The importance of socioeconomic status was observed in a review of 139 patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus attended at a single center in the United States.

**DKA in established type 1 diabetes mellitus:**In children with an established diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, DKA occurs at an annual rate of 6 to 8%.

The following factors contribute to the development of DKA:

- Poor metabolic control

- Peripubertal and pubertal adolescent girls

- Gastroenteritis with vomiting and dehydration

- History of psychiatric disorders (including eating disorders) or family discord

- Limited access to medical care (underinsured)

- Omission of insulin, including failure of an insulin pump

In a large prospective study in the United States, almost 60 percent of DKA episodes in children with established diabetes occurred in only 5 percent of all children.

**DKA in type 2 diabetes mellitus:**Ketosis and DKA can occur less frequently in children with type 2 diabetes and are usually observed mainly in African American adolescents with obesity.
