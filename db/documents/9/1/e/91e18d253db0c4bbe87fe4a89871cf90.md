Following surgery, patients will require monitoring for intracranial hematoma, venous sinus thrombosis, and mental status. Those discharged without surgery need to be seen in the clinic within 24 to 48 hours to assess the GCS and mental status.

All patients who undergo surgery need to have a repeat CT scan within 6 to 8 weeks to rule out the presence/absence of an abscess. Other reasons to follow up include the presence of seizures and neurological deficits.
