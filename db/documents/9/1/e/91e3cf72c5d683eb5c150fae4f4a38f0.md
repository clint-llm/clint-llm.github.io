Lissencephaly can be caused by non-genetic and genetic factors. Non-genetic factors include viral infections of the mother or the fetus, especially during the first trimester and insufficient supply of oxygenated blood to the brain during fetal development.

Some of the known genetic causes are listed below:

- LIS1

LIS1 (PAFAH1B1) is the most studied. This gene is located on chromosome 17p13.3.

- DCX

DCX is located on the X chromosome.

- ARX

The ARX gene encodes for the aristaless related homeobox protein, which is a transcription factor with an important role in the forebrain and other tissue.

- RELN

RELN gene encodes reelin, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein. The mutation of this gene is involved in lissencephaly associated with cerebellar hypoplasia and hippocampal abnormalities.

- Other genes:

Several genes have established a relationship with lissencephaly. Those genes are VLDLR, ACTB, ACTG1, TUBG1, KIF5C, KIF2A, and CDK5.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been associated with developing lissencephaly by reducing blood supply to the fetal brain. The severity of CMV infection depends on the gestational age. Early infection is more likely to cause lissencephaly because neuronal migration takes place early in the pregnancy.
