The prognosis of magnesium toxicity can include a complete resolution of symptoms without residual effects if diagnosed and treated early. Quality of life, long-term complications, and life expectancy are unaffected if toxic magnesium levels are stabilized early on using calcium gluconate and subsequently lowered using diuretics or dialysis. However, if left untreated, magnesium toxicity has a high mortality rate due to respiratory paralysis and cardiac arrest.
