When acquiring a history on presentation, it is important to note the temporal evolution of the lesions, the location of the lesions, any underlying immunosuppressive condition, and other associated symptoms such as cough, fever, or dysuria. In individuals with the bacteremic form of EG, the source of infection is important to ascertain. For example, productive cough or dysuria may reveal a respiratory or urinary source, respectively. In the non-bacteremic form, it is important to note any trauma that may have introduced the infection via direct inoculation.

The lesions of ecthyma gangrenosum begin as painless, round erythematous macules and patches that develop into central pustules with surrounding erythema. A hemorrhagic vesicle appears at the center of the lesion and evolves into a gangrenous ulcer with a black eschar.

EG can appear anywhere in the body but most commonly affects the anogenital and axillary areas. The gluteal/perineal area is most common (57%), followed by the extremities (30%), the trunk (6%), and the face (6%).
