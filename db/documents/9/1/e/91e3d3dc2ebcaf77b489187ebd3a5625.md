Patients with acalculous cholecystitis are very ill and need to be stabilized before any procedure can be done. In those patients who are unstable, one may consider the placement of a percutaneous drainage tube in the gallbladder by the radiologist. Another option is Stent placement via ERCP to decompress the gallbladder.

Chronic acalculous cholecystitis is treated the same as cholecystitis with stones. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice. An open cholecystectomy can also be performed if there is a contraindication to laparoscopic surgery. Acute cholecystitis must be addressed fairly urgently because rapid progression and deterioration may result if untreated. The best definitive therapy is cholecystectomy, either laparoscopic or open. If the patient is too unstable to undergo major surgery, then percutaneous drainage is needed with possibleÂ definitive cholecystectomy at a later date. Administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is routinely done. However, this is usually not effective. There is minimal penetration of antibiotics into the pressurized gallbladder, but they will help treat any systemic bacteremia.
