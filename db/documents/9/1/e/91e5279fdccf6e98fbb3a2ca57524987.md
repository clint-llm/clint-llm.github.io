Laboratory testing complements the history and clinical examination in elucidating the possible source of infection and revealing evidence of organ dysfunction. Serum levels of lactic acid, liver transaminases, prothrombin time, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine can support clinical findings of hypoperfusion. Other important lab findings include low or elevated white cell counts, elevated bands, thrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and reduced mixed venous blood saturation. Obtaining samples for cultures before initiation of antibiotics is vital in early identification of the pathogen and the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. Both the pathogen and the antibiotic susceptibility help narrow down from broad-spectrum antibiotics to specific agents targeted towards the pathogens. Investigations that do not alter clinical decision making or the clinical course are not usually recommended. If the pretest probability is high for a HAI such as ventilator-associated pneumonia/ VAP, then tests such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin are considered ancillary and not indicated. For patients with HAP/ VAP, recent IDSA guidelines recommend noninvasive sampling with tracheal aspirates as they have been shown to have non-inferior yield when compared to invasive samplings such as quantitative tracheal lavage or bronchoscopy.
