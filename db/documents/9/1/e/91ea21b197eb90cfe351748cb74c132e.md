The first four weeks of life of an infant are considered the neonatal period. During this period many complex physiologic changes occur, and the infant interacts with the different stimuli. Care during this period should be continuous and effective. Newborn care consists of evaluation for the need of resuscitation, a complete physical exam, administration of prophylactic medications and vaccines, adequate feedings, safe sleep, hygiene of the newborn, and other important areas for baby wellbeing.
