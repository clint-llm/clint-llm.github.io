Renal osteodystrophy is a complication of end-stage renal disease that is almost unavoidable due to the imbalance of calcium, phosphorous, and PTH created by the loss of functionality of nephrons in the patient. Presentations vary broadly from asymptomatic to bone fractures along with an increased risk of cardiovascular events due to chronic hypertension. Although most of the patients may present similarly, it is important to note that the etiologies may differ, and so will the treatment protocols. Patients undergoing regularly scheduled dialysis may also not be exempt from this complication. A daily dialysis program may be needed to delay or prevent the onset of skeletal and extraskeletal manifestations.

Although the nephrologist is the key to managing a patient of renal osteodystrophy, it is imperative to discuss the roles of the other members of this treatment team. Communication with an orthopedic surgeon is vital as bone fractures are one of the most common complications. The internist or general clinician looking after the patient on an outpatient basis plays a major role in monitoring the patient's day-to-day symptoms and keeping a close check on any cardiovascular involvement.

If the patient does develop vascular calcifications and its associated symptoms, a cardiologist's opinion may be required. The pharmacist reviews all the medications and flags any nephrotoxic drugs the patient might be prescribed. The dialysis team consisting of the nephrologist, nurses, and technicians, forms the core of the patient's healthcare team. Regular imaging is performed in patients of renal osteodystrophy, and the role of the radiologist comes into play here. The radiological evidence of hyperparathyroidism may be picked up on scans and could help narrow down the differential. A specialist would be required to confirm the diagnosis using bone biopsies.

For patients suffering from chronic renal failure and its related complications, an integrated and interprofessional approach is recommended to reduce patient morbidity and improve outcomes. [Level V]
