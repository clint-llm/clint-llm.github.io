Most MI, regardless of location, present with a similar array of symptoms. Some of the common presenting symptoms include left-sided chest pain radiating to arm/neck, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, palpitation, diaphoresis, and fatigue. People with a history of previous MI can relate current symptoms to previous episodes and tend to seek care sooner. Silent MI refers to a group of patients presenting with no acute signs or symptoms. The prevalence of silent MI is reported as high as 23%.

All patients suspected of having LMI should have a thorough history and physical exam performed. Details regarding the nature of chest pain including onset, aggravating/relieving factors and radiation can help make an important clinical decision. Patients should be examined for signs of excessive lipid accumulation such as xanthoma and xanthelasma.
