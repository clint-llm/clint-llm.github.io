Grading systems are essential for the adequate assessment of thrombus burden to assist management decisions before and during interventions. The TIMI Study Group introduced the most commonly used thrombus grading classification. Their method based on a visual angiographic assessment of the thrombus size using a score that ranges from grade 0 to grade 5.

- Grade 0: No angiographic characteristic of thrombus

- Grade 1: Possibility of thrombus on angiography, decreased density, haziness, irregular lesion contour

- Grade 2: Definite thrombus, significant filling defects, the greatest dimension is 1/2 of vessel diameter

- Grade 3: Definite thrombus with the greatest dimension is greater than 1/2 to less than 2 vessel diameter

- Grade 4: Definite large thrombus with the greatest dimension is greater thanÂ 2 vessel diameter

- Grade 5: Complete thrombotic occlusion
