Since the anti-U1-RNP antibody is the hallmark of mixed connective tissue disease, the assumption is that anti-U1-RNP and its antigen play a role in the pathogenesis of MCTD.

Apoptotic modification and molecular mimicry are the two mechanisms by which these intracellular molecules are believed to become autoantigens.

Amino acid sequence from these non-self proteins can mimic host epitope and induce autoantibody response, a phenomenon known as molecular mimicry. For example, almost 91% of DNA from the serum of patients with MCTD had a human immunodeficiency virus type-1 conserved pol sequence.
