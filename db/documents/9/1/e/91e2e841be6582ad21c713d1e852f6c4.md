Different classifications of GCT have been described based on histology and clinical/radiographic appearance, although they are clinically less useful. Campanacci grading system is as follows:

**Grade I**– Intraosseous lesions with well-marginated borders as well as an intact cortex.

**Grade II**– More extensive intraosseous lesions associated with a thin cortex without loss of cortical continuity.

- IIA – Without pathological fracture.

- IIB – With pathological fracture.

**Grade III**– Extraosseous lesions that extend into soft tissue.
