A constitutionally normal SGA infant must be distinguished from an FGR SGA patient.  The former does not have an increased risk of morbidity and mortality compared to that seen in the latter.  These constitutionally normal SGA infants do not have wasted features of intrauterine malnourishment. The constitutionally normal SGA infants can be differentiated from FGR SGA infants by taking into consideration the height, weight, and ethnicity of the mother.
