Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation is a mode that comes installed on many ventilators. When SIMV was first invented, it required a "tee-piece" assembly modification to an existing ventilator. The "tee" is a corrugated tubing that connects to a heated nebulizer. One limb of the "tee" is open to the air and connected to a patient's port that has a one-way valve. The valve inserts into a hole drilled into the inspiratory limb, or "Y-piece," of the ventilator. This design allows the valve to close when the ventilator is on, delivering a preset tidal volume to the patient. When the patient takes a spontaneous breath, the valve opens and allows for inhalation of gas from the "tee-piece."
