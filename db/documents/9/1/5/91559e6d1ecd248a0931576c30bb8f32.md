The conventional therapy for primary hemochromatosis is phlebotomy. By drawing off red blood cells, the major mobilizer of iron in the body, iron toxicity, can be minimized.

Alcohol should be strictly prohibited in this condition because it can accelerate liver and pancreatic toxicity. Preexisting end-organ damage is rarely reversed by phlebotomy. Treatment for associated end-organ dysfunction, such as insulin for pancreatic dysfunction, is indicated. If hemochromatosis is detected early, treatment prevents end-organ dysfunction, and there is little mortality or morbidity associated with it. However, patients rarely live more than two years after the diagnosis if severe end-organ damage has occurred.

Although chelation is not as effective in hereditary hemochromatosis, it is of more benefit in erythropoietic hemochromatosis, where phlebotomy is not typically an option.

Erythropoietin, in combination with phlebotomy, is sometimesÂ administered to maintain the hemoglobin concentration while forcing iron mobilization.

Patients who have end-stage liver disease may be candidates for liver transplantation. Studies have shown that when compared to non-hemochromatosis causes, patients with iron overload disorders who undergo liver transplantation have lower survival rates.

Since HCC accounts for around 30% of mortality in hemochromatosis, all patients with hemochromatosis would undergo surveillance, with six-monthly ultrasound and alpha-fetoprotein levels.
