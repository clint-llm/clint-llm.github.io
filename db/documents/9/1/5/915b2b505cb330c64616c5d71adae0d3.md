Leukocytosis is treated based on the underlying process. For example, a neutrophilia may be produced from an underlying infection, in which case the clinician will need to perform a detailed history and physical examination and obtain other relevant lab tests and imaging to determine an infectious source and treat, respectively. Medication reconciliation, such as any recent steroid use, should also be completed to investigate drug-induced leukocytosis. Recent physical stress leading to a leukocytosis can also be ascertained from history. Both of these examples, if diagnosed, do not require further intervention. More alarming causes, such as leukemias and lymphomas, should prompt immediate hematology and oncology specialty service involvement for specific imaging and laboratory examination needed to help guide treatment.

Clinicians should be able to recognize hyperleukocytosis, which is a WBC count > 100x10^9/mL. This is seen in patients with acute or chronic leukemias and can be a medical emergency if the patient is symptomatic, at which point they are in leukostasis. Organ failure and hemorrhage is a complication of this disorder, which requires prompt identification and treatment to reduce the number of abnormal cells. Hematology and oncology services should be involved in this patient's care, but the use of chemotherapy, leukapheresis, and medications like hydroxyurea, are all current treatment methods to prevent decompensation.
