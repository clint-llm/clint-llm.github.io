In exudative retinal detachment secondary to uveitis, the prognosis of the disease depends on the severity of inflammation and its response to treatment.

In patients with Coats disease, the prognosis depends on the severity of macular involvement. Some baseline improvement might occur with treatment but rarely returns to normal visual acuity.

Patients with acute central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) may recover completely, but the chances of recurrences are very high. Once the CSCR becomes chronic, the damage caused to the macula because of recurrent detachments may lead to permanent anatomical alterations in the macular area leading to guarded visual recovery.

The prognosis of exudative retinal detachment secondary to choroidal tumors depends on the severity and extent of the tumor, presence or absence of macular involvement, response to treatment, chances of recurrence and toxicity, and complications secondary to treatment (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery).

The exudative retinal detachment secondary to infection such as us tuberculosis, dengue, syphilis, and cat-scratch disease is treated by specific antimicrobial agents with or without steroids. The prognosis is good if the condition is diagnosed and treated early.

Long-standing pathology causes permanent damage to photoreceptors and RPE, and the prognosis is poor even after complete treatment.

Vascular or haematologic causes such as retinal vein occlusion, carotid obstruction (venous overload choroidopathy), familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, and retinopathy of prematurity can cause exudative retinal detachment. The prognosis is excellent if detected early. Timely laser photocoagulation of the ischaemic retina in familial exudative vitreoretinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity prevent retinal detachment with a good prognosis.
