Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) is a progressive incremental improvement of processes, safety, and patient care. The goal of CQI may include improvement of operations, outcomes, systems processes, improved work environment, or regulatory compliance. Process improvement may be "gradual" or "breakthrough" in nature. CQI project development commonly includes defining the problem, benchmarking, setting a goal, then iterative quality improvement projects. Through the iterative process, improvements are made, the effect of the improvements is measured, then the process is repeated until the desired outcome is achieved. Common methodologies for improvement include Lean, Six Sigma, Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles, and Baldrige Criteria.

As the technology for collecting care-delivery data and methods for tracking outcomes becomes more sophisticated and integrated into healthcare, CQI will become more vital to delivering quality care while maintaining profitability, healthcare provider satisfaction, and patient satisfaction. Overall, CQI is a quality initiative that repeatedly asks members of the healthcare team to determine, "How are we doing?" and, "Can we do it better?"
