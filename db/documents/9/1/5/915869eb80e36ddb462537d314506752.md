All the relevant NTM become acquired via inhalation of infected aerosolized droplets. Living in close quarters, coughing, and not using a facial mask are risk factors for transmission. Advanced age, immunosuppression, and the use of corticosteroids are all risk factors for acquiring these organisms. Once the organisms enter the individual, they usually settle in the lower airways; in some cases, the bacteria incite an inflammatory reaction with an influx of lymphocytes. The resulting release of cytokines and other mediators can lead to an infectious process that presents as pneumonia.
