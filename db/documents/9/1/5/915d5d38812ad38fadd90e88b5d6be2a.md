Rotation flaps should be used when other simpler types of closure fail to provide adequate functional or cosmetic results. Rotation flaps, despite their length and arc, can be used in many locations. They are most commonly used for lesions on the lateral face, cheeks, chin, and scalp. Rotation flaps are particularly useful for redirecting tension around a free margin to prevent distortion. Examples of this application include the reconstruction of the eyebrows and lips. There are also several named rotation flaps, such as Tenzel and Mustardé flaps, that are useful in specific situations that will be discussed below.
