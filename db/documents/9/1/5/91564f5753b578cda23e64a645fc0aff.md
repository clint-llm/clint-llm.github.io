Consultation to specialists, such as an allergist or pulmonologist, is appropriate with type I hypersensitivities, especially if adjunctive therapies are not able to control symptoms. Pulmonologists will be beneficial to asthmatic patients as they would be able to appropriately monitor the patient and escalate based on the step therapies, including monitoring of pulmonary function tests. Cooperating withÂ pharmacists to provide more thorough counseling of appropriate use of medications and education on epinephrine auto-injectors is beneficial to patients. Pharmacists can also develop protocols for medication desensitization. Nurses can help educate patients on diet, anaphylaxis, and signs and symptoms to monitor. Nurses can also continue to assess the patient in an acute setting post initial allergic response.
