Hoffa first described the most accepted etiology of Hoffa pad impingement syndrome in 1904, which entailed IFP injury followed by associated hemorrhage, inflammation, hypertrophy, and eventual fibrosis.

The clinical manifestations of other lesions inside IFP are comparable and often include swelling, knee discomfort, restricted range of motion, and an occasional palpable lump.Â Synovial lipomas, pigmented villonodular synovitis, glomus tumors, synovial chondromatosis, synovial haemangiomas, and ganglion cysts are among the possible causes.
