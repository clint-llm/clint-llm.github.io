Scarlet fever and most diseases that are transmitted via close contact can be avoided by using good hand hygiene, covering your coughs and sneezes, regular disinfection of shared fomites, and avoiding others when infected. Reminders in public areas in the form of posters and public service announcements in the media are some of the ways to increase these good hygiene practices. The public also should be aware of the risks associated with the overuse of antibiotic administration which may introduce resistant strains of GAS.
