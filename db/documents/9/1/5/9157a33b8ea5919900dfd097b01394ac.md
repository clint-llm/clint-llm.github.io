Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is an acute or chronic liver injury secondary to drugs or herbal compounds. It is difficult to diagnose because the presentation is similar to many hepatobiliary disorders. The principle treatment is the removal of the offending agent and close observation for resolution. This activity explains the pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Additionally, it reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the evaluation of suspected drug-induced hepatotoxicity.
- Outline the classification of drug induced hepatotoxicity based on clinical presentation, mechanism of toxicity, and histological appearance. 
- Identify the etiologies of drug-induced hepatotoxicity.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interdisciplinary team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with drug-induced hepatotoxicity.
