Toxic exposures to theophylline have decreased significantly since its management for asthma and COPD has declined. From 1985 to 1995 in the United States, theophylline poisoning requiring hemodialysis or hemoperfusion accounted for 49 cases per one million poison center calls, compared to the 6 cases per one million poison center calls from 1996 to 2005. According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, there were 133 exposures to theophylline in 2014. Of these, 14 were in children younger than 6 years old, and 107 were in patients older than 19 years old. There were 2 deaths out of 81 patients treated for theophylline exposure treated at healthcare facilities.
