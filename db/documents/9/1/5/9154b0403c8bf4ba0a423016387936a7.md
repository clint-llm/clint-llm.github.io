Interprofessional team communication and proper care coordination are paramount when caring for sick patients with liver metastases. A hepatobiliary and oncologic team should evaluate pre and postoperative imaging modalities, chemotherapy regimens, and surgical interventions tailored to the patient. Further studies into the histopathological diagnosis of the disease may help direct more targeted preoperative chemotherapy regimens for an easier and more functional hepatic resection. Oncology specialty nurses monitor patients, provide education, and report patient status to the team. Board-certified oncology pharmacists assist in agent selection, dosing, and checking for drug-drug interactions. With an interprofessional approach to care, patients can attain better outcomes in metastatic hepatic disease. [Level 5] Patients with significant disease should receive treatment within a larger hospital system with higher patient volumes and open access to patient information, so all interprofessional team members operate from the same up-to-date data for better care.
