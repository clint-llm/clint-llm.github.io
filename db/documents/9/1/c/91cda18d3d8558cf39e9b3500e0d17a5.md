Dust mite allergy leads to perennial allergic rhinitis; that is, the symptoms of dust mite allergies occur throughout the year. Symptoms are more likely to occur while sleeping at night and early in the morning on waking up because the dust mites inhabit the pillows, bedcovers, mattresses, and blankets. Common dust mite allergy symptoms include:

- Sneezing

- Rhinorrhea

- Allergic conjunctivitis

- Nasal stuffiness

- Itchy nose, mouth or throat

- Itchy skin

- Postnasal drip

- Cough

- Coughing bouts that may be exacerbated by a viral infection

- Lethargy, malaise

- Impaired sleep caused by shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing

If dust mite allergy triggers asthma, the following may also present:

- Dyspnea

- Chest tightness orÂ discomfort

- Wheezing on exhalation

The following risk factors predispose an individual to develop dust mite allergy:

- Childhood or adolescence

- Family history of allergies

- Exposure to a high level of dust mites

The development of allergies to certain foods like shellfish or mollusks can also occur as a result of cross-reactivity.
