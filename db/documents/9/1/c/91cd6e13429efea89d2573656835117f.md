The differential diagnosis is very extensive for patients with tropical sprue. Infectious conditions like Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Strongyloides stercoralis, Cryptosporidium parvum, Isospora belli, and Cyclospora cayetanesis should be ruled out. The other causes for chronic diarrhea that should be looked into include lactose intolerance, short bowel syndrome, and bile salt deficiency. Patients should specifically be evaluated for the diseases causing fat malabsorption, including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, pancreatic insufficiency, and celiac disease.
