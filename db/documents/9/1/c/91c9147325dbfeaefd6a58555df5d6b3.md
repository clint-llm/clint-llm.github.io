Simulation-based medical education is an evolving area of growth in training medical personnel, particularly because of the demand for increased efficiency of training time. Multiple fields of medicine, including clinicians and nurses, are focusing attention on improving simulation education. A focus on high-quality simulation ensures the best outcomes of educational interventions.

Multiple personnel in-training can be involved in the implementation of a medical simulation curriculum, particularly when it comes to training to improve teamwork among nurses, clinicians, and pharmacists. Indeed, communication skills are an important skill to acquire to be an effective leader of a team and enhance teamwork in medicine. Simulation has been used to enhance team communication in pediatric healthcare settings and demonstrate improved patient outcomes.
