Treating opioid withdrawal requires interprofessional teamwork by psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, therapists, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals. The patient is initially stabilized in the emergency department setting before being transferred to an inpatient or outpatient drug detoxification unit. In an inpatient detoxification unit, nurses, therapists, and psychiatrists work together to manageÂ symptoms before a patient is discharged to an outpatient program and follow up with a psychiatrist. Thus, comprehensive care by multiple healthcare professionals is required to treat and manage an opioid withdrawal patient. The keys to working efficiently in a team are having proper communication and respect for the opinion of other healthcare providers. Most importantly, the patient should be actively involved in treatment decisions, and their needs must also be addressed.
