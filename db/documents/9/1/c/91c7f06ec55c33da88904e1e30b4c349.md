Before the regional nerve block, a preoperative evaluation must be carried out according to WHO guidelines. This evaluation should include medical history, physical examination, airway assessment, and analysis of preoperative tests. The current treatment should also be noted, including the consumption of analgesics along with anticoagulants to minimize the risk of bleeding.

The patient should be informed about the risks and benefits of the PENG block. This involves a detailed description of the procedure to obtain informed consent.

Finally, this procedure should be performed in a clinical center equipped with appropriate monitoring equipment.
