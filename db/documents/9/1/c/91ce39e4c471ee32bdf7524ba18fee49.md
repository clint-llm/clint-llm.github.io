Overall the prognosis for mucoceles and ranulas is quite good. Mostly, these lesions present as painless and asymptomatic swellings in the oral cavity with no associated morbidity or mortality. However, some large lesions may interfere with the speech, mastication, deglutition, or even with the respiration depending on the location. With complete excision of the lesion along with the offending gland, the recurrence rate is significantly low. In contrast, other procedures, including marsupialization and aspiration of the cyst, are associated with a higher recurrence rate. In recent pediatric studies, the recurrence rates range from 6%-8% following surgery.
