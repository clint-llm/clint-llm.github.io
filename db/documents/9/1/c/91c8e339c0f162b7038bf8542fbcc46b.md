- The clinician should consider surgery if there is a progression of symptoms, more than six months of issues, compression ratio (cord sagittal /transverse) less than 0.4, or on MRI, the transverse area of the cord is less than 40 mm.

- There should be a consensus statement recommending surgical intervention once a diagnosis of cervical myelopathy has been made.

- The timeliness of intervention is critical. Patients with milder myelopathy and less than six months of symptoms have improved outcomes after surgery.
