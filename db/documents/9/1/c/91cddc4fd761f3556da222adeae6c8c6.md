Central retinal artery occlusion usually presents with sudden onset vision loss in the elderly. Usually, there is a relative afferent pupillary defect in the affected eye.

In lipid storage disorders, there might be evidence of neurodegeneration and visceromegaly. In the early phase, there is a perifoveal white donut-like area around the fovea with a cherry-red spot appearance. In the late phase, there is atrophy of inner retinal layers, the disappearance of the cherry-red spot, and optic atrophy. Family history and examination of family members are of paramount importance. Commotio retinae patients have a history of blunt trauma. Signs of blunt trauma, including hyphema, anterior uveitis, and damage to the seven rings of trauma, may be visible. Retinitis may be associated with intraocular inflammation, vitritis, and retinal necrosis that is more prominently visible on the optical coherence tomography scan.
