Croup is managed by an interprofessional team that includes a pediatrician, emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, and radiologist. The diagnosis can be difficult because there is no specific test for the disorder. The goal of treatment is to decrease airway obstruction. Treatment includes nebulized epinephrine, corticosteroids, and at least 3 hours of observation after the last dose of epinephrine. Supplemental oxygen via blow-by or nasal cannula can also be used for hypoxic patients with croup. The majority of patients can be safely discharged home from the emergency department but the caretaker must be informed about the importance of avoiding smoking in the home. Other factors to consider before discharge are that the caretaker recognizes an improvement in the child’s symptoms, the caretaker has adequate transportation to return if necessary, and there are no significant social issue concerns.
