In 2005, the WHO illustrated that preterm births accounted for about 9.5% of births worldwide. That equates to almost 13 million births. In the United States, the number hovers around 11.4% as of 2013. The rate peaked at 12.8% in 2006 due to increased pregnancy dating by ultrasound, increased use of assisted reproductive technology, and showed preterm labor induction. Since then, it has declined with better fertility practices now in place. The rates of preterm labor vary across the different states in the United States. African Americans have almost twice the rate of preterm labor compared to other racial/ethnic groups.
