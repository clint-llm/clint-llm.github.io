Chorionic villus sampling is a procedure performed to biopsy placental tissue between 10 to 13 weeks gestation for prenatal genetic testing. The primary advantage of chorionic villus sampling is earlier genetic results in pregnancy. This knowledge provides patients with the opportunity to seek counseling for obstetric management and recommendations, early referral to pediatric subspecialists, or earlier and safer methods of pregnancy termination if results are abnormal.
