Concretions are mostly idiopathic and result from degenerative changes in the conjunctiva due to aging.

Secondary causesÂ include:

- An allergic or chronic infective disorder affecting the conjunctival surface such as trachoma, allergic keratoconjunctivitis, atopic keratoconjunctivitis

- Dry eye disease associated with low-grade inflammation: chronic meibomitis or dry eye.

- Recrystallization of certain drops: sulphadiazine.
