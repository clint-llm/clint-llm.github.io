There are various studies in the field of nuclear medicine used in the assessment of mediastinal masses, which have been listed below.

**PET-CT**

PET CT utilizes 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose, a radiopharmaceutical agent for diagnosis and staging of treatment for neoplasms. There are 2 separate acquisitions, PET followed by CT during the study. The CT is used for attenuation correction and anatomic localization. Typically the CT is performed without intravenous contrast. However, the study may be performed with intravenous and oral contrast based on the indication of the examination. PET-CT is useful in most malignant lesions and, with respect to mediastinal masses, is typically used for lymphoma, esophageal, and lung malignancies. Lymphomas are FDG avid, and PET-CT is helpful in staging and restaging of the disease. Thymic tumors can also demonstrate FDG uptake.

**I-131****M****eta-****iodobenzylguanidine****(MIBG) Study**

I-131 MIBG study is used for confirming the presence of a mediastinal pheochromocytoma.
