Treatment of injured extremities involves a multidisciplinary team. A medical professional must first evaluate the extremity, be it a physician or NP/PA in primary care, emergency medicine, orthopedic surgery. A fracture should be excluded, which then involves a radiology tech to perform an x-ray and a radiologist to interpret the images. The extremity should be monitored, involving nurses for wound and splint checks. To improve functional outcomes, patients should start early physical therapy to increase range of motion and strength.
