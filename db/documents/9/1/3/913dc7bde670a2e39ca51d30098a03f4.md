The most concerning adverse reaction with fentanyl is respiratory depression. The treatment approach is by management via mechanical ventilation, using a laryngeal mask airway (LMA), or bag-mask ventilation. Securing the airway is of utmost importance to counteract hypoventilation.

As mentioned earlier, fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 100 times stronger than morphine. Due to its powerful opioid properties, fentanyl diversion for misuse is a problem. Fentanyl is added to heroin to increase its potency or is disguised as highly potent heroin. Many users believe that they are purchasing heroin, but it has been adulterated with fentanyl – which often results in overdose deaths.
