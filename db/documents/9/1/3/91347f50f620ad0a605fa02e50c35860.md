Lung adenocarcinomaÂ is classified into 4 types: adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), invasive adenocarcinoma, and variants of adenocarcinoma. Of these AIS and MIA have better outcomes when resected early. Local spread may involve spread directly to the pleura, diaphragm, pericardium, or bronchi with advanced disease spreading to the mediastinum, great vessels, trachea, esophagus, vertebral column, or adjacent lobe. Lymph node metastasis occurs in peribronchial lymph nodes before moving to mediastinal or subcarinal nodes and then the contralateral lung. Distant metastasis includes extension to a contralateral lobe, pleural nodules, malignant pleural or pericardial effusion, or any distant site such as the brain, bones, or liver. There is a subset of NSCLC that have mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which sensitizes them to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as well as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene rearrangements.
