Conization of the cervix or cold knife cone (CKC) is a surgical procedure used to treat or diagnose cervical dysplasia. It is the excision of a cone-shaped portion of the cervix to remove a cervical lesion and the entire transformation zone. Practitioners can use this procedure when there are a conflicting pap smear and biopsy specimen. It can be used if histological results are significantly less severe than the cytology result or if there is evidence of severe dysplasia, and even if there is stage 1A1 squamous cell cervical cancer. Conization can be done with a scalpel, a laser, or with an electrosurgical instrument typically referred to as a LEEP (Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure). This review will focus mainly on the cold knife cone procedure.
