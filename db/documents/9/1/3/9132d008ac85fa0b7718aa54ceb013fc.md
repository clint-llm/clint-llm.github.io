The pathophysiology of eyelid myokymia remains incompletely understood. Electrophysiologically, a single motor unit discharges rhythmic or semi-rhythmic spurts at a rate of 3Â to 8 Hz, although rates as high as 60 Hz have been noted. These discharges are separated by intervals of 100 to 200 millisecond and are not synchronized in muscles. Although spontaneous discharges may increase with voluntary movements, they do not initiate from such activities.
