Femoral shaft fractures can result from high or low energy mechanisms and are often associated with other serious injuries. The most common causes include automobile accidents, falls from heights, ground-level falls in individuals with osteoporosis, and gunshots. A study from Finland found that 75% of FSFs were caused by high energy mechanisms, 87% of which occurred in MVCs (65% of all fractures). Other less common causes of FSFs are atypical fractures from bisphosphonate use, pathologic fractures through a bone lesion, insufficiency fractures from osteoporosis, and stress fractures from overuse in athletes and military recruits.
