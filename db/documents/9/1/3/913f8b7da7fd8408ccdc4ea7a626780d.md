Isolated pulmonic stenosis is divided in to valvular, subvalvular, and supravalvular obstruction.

Valvular pulmonic stenosis is the most common type. In typical valvular disease, the commissures are partially fused, and leaflets are thin. This structural anomaly results in a dome-shaped or conical outlet seen during systole.

Subvavular pulmonic stenosis is a defect obstructing the infundibular region. A primary cause of fibromuscular narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract may be associated with a double-chambered right ventricle or tetralogy of Fallot.

Supravalvular pulmonic stenosis, also known as peripheral pulmonary stenosis, is a functional obstruction originating from the pulmonary artery. The blockage may occur at the main artery, bifurcation point, at distal branches of the pulmonary artery, or any combination thereof. Supravalvular stenosis is associated with structural defects of atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, and tetralogy of Fallot. Supravalvular stenosis may also be a result of surgical repair of transposition of the great arteries.
