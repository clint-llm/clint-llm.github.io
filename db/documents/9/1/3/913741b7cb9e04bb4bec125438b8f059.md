Patients must be capable self-advocates, accurately describing their symptoms to the clinician, to facilitate the diagnosis of type 1 narcolepsy. While type 1 narcolepsy is an incurable neurological disorder, there are treatment options directed towards symptom management. In patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy, multiple individual pharmacological agents exist for symptomatic management of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness alone, except sodium oxybate, which targets all features of type 1 narcolepsy.
