A CT scan with intravenous contrast was ordered. This was interpreted by the radiologist noting a blind ending. The inflamed appendage is emanating from the small bowel, with an incomplete superior wall and fluid layering in the deep pelvis, concerning for perforated Meckel diverticulum.  Surgical consultation was initiated in the emergency department, and the patient was taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy confirming the diagnosis of perforated Meckel's diverticulum. The subsequent pathology report also noted Meckel's diverticulum with gastric heterotopia and feature consistent with perforation and serositis.
