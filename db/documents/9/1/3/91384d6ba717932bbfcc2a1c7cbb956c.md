Indinavir acts through a competitive inhibition mechanism. The medication binds the active catalytic site of HIV protease, inhibiting the enzyme's ability to cleave polypeptides into active, infectious proteins. This inhibition, in turn, decreases the number of cleaved polypeptides in the blood, which therefore aids in reducing the amount of active HIV RNA in vivo.

**Mechanism of Resistance:**Viral resistance to indinavir is due to mutations that result in the expressing amino acid substitutions in the viral protease and flap mutations.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**Indinavir is rapidly absorbed in the fasting state, and food alters the bioavailability of indinavir. When indinavir is administered with a meal high in calories, fat, and protein, it substantially decreases absorption. However, administering indinavir with light meals does not alter trough concentration and absorption.**Distribution:**Plasma protein binding of indinavir is approximately 60%.**Metabolism:**CYP3A4 is the primary enzyme that metabolizes indinavir. Indinavir is metabolized to one glucuronide conjugate and six oxidative metabolites.**Elimination:**Less than 20% of indinavir is excreted unchanged in the urine. Indinavir has a half-life of 1.8 Â± 0.4 hours.
