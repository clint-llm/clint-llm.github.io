Obesity is a serious global pandemic that requires prompt interventions to avoid the development of complications. While diet and exercise interventions are always discussed first, drug therapy, bariatric surgery, and new gastrointestinal devices can aid patients in achieving weight loss to improve cardiometabolic outcomes. This activity describes in detail the available therapies, beyond dieting, to treat obesity and helps the interprofessional team initiate early treatment, taking into account their patient's preferences.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the neurochemicals, hormones, and signals involved in the homeostatic and hedonistic pathways, which serve as weight loss medication targets.
- Review the drug therapies that are currently FDA approved and pharmacotherapy that is being developed to treat obesity.
- Describe the gastrointestinal devices that are approved by the FDA for the treatment of obesity.
- Summarize the available bariatric surgery techniques performed by an interprofessional team to treat obesity.
