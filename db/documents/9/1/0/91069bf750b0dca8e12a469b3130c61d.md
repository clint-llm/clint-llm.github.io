Hyperbaric oxygen promotes the VEGF-induced enhancement of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). In addition to the scavenger effect of this antioxidant, this catalase may affect the mitogenic and anti-apoptotic actions of VEGF in preserving the integrity of the endothelium, thereby improving blood supply to the ischemic tissues. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy reduced leukocyte adherence on the endothelium of venules and blocked the progressive arteriolar vasoconstriction associated with reperfusion injury.

Fragile tissues may have a greater risk of a total loss of function due to cellular apoptosis following the second hypoxic insult presented by the Ischemia-Reperfusion injury. These tissues include nervous tissue, lung parenchyma, or any other previously damaged connective tissue.
