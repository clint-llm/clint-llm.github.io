Tarsal tunnel syndrome is a relatively rare mononeuropathy of the lower extremities that can be difficult to diagnose. Clinical evaluation, electroneurography (ENG), and electromyography (EMG) are used to diagnose this neuropathy of the posterior tibial nerve, thereby allowing for more accurate treatment and management plans to help alleviate the patientâ€™s symptoms. This activity will briefly discuss the etiology and pathophysiology of tarsal tunnel syndrome in addition to describing how ENG and EMG can be used to identify this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the diagnostic findings of tarsal tunnel syndrome found on ENG and EMG.
- Identify common pitfalls when conducting ENG of the tibial nerve and its branches, and EMG of the intrinsic foot muscles. 
- Review the appropriate recording and stimulation sites of the medial and lateral plantar nerves. 
- Discuss the importance of communicating the findings of the electrophysiological study with the interprofessional team to better enhance patient outcomes.
