Dry skin has many causes, including frequent hand washing, exposure to harsh chemicals, low ambient humidity, and medical conditions like atopic dermatitis, ichthyosis, and psoriasis. The goals of moisturizing the skin are to improve the appearance and function of the skin. In patients with medical conditions associated with impaired barrier function of the skin, like atopic dermatitis, the diligent use of moisturizers is a fundamental component of their treatment.

The choice of moisturizing agents can be adjusted to best fit the needs of a patient. Factors like acne, flaking, hyperkeratosis, itching, or sensitive skin merit consideration when making recommendations of a moisturizing agent.
