Sclerostin was first recognized as a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of osteoporosis by its role in a genetic condition termed sclerostin deficiency. In patients with sclerostin deficiency, high bone mass and resistance to fracture were recognized.

Sclerostin is an osteocyte-derived secreted glycoprotein that binds to low-density lipoprotein receptor proteins LRP5 and LRP6 (low-density lipoprotein receptor protein 5/6), preventing the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway that normally stimulates osteoblasts.

This led to the development of romosozumab, a humanized monoclonal sclerostin-neutralizing antibody (Scl-Ab) that binds to and inhibits sclerostin.

This increases cortical and trabecular bone mass, which is beneficial in treating osteoporosis. Overall, blocking sclerostin results in dual effects 1) an increase in osteoblastic activity, thereby increasing bone formation, and 2) a decrease in osteoclastic activity, thereby decreasing bone resorption. Romosozumab is the first anabolic medication that increases bone formation and decreases bone resorption by inhibiting sclerostin.

With the use of romosozumab, procollagen type 1 N-telopeptide (P1NP) (a bone formation marker) increased 66% to 147% from baseline compared to placebo two weeks after initiation.
