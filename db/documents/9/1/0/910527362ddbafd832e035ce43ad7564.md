The medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) extends from the femur to the superomedial patella and is trapezoidal in shape. It plays a substantial role in stabilizing the medial aspect of the patella, especially in early flexion (0-30 degrees).

Injuries to the MPFL are rare but may occur in athletes during sporting accidents or during a traumatic event. If the patella is dislocated laterally, the MPFL is ruptured more than 90% of the time. Patients are at a significantly higher risk of suffering from patellar instability and potentially another patella dislocation if this occurs.
