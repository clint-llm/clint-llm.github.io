The vascularized fibular free flap is a viable option for the reconstruction of large bony defects. Still, it may not be the ideal reconstructive modality in all scenarios, particularly when the patient suffers from lower extremity vascular disease. This activity reviews the indications and technical aspects of free fibular transfer and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with complex bone and soft tissue defects.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the ideal size of the graft and understand how to prepare the recipient area for vascular graft inset.
- Describe the evaluation for preoperative assessment of vascular patency.
- Review contraindications to free fibula transfer.
- Avoid complications in free fibula transfer.
