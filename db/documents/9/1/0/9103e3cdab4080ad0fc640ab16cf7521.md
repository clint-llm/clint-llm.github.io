The deficient homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase enzyme in alkaptonuria is predominantly concentrated in the liver and kidney but also occurs in the small intestine, colon, and prostate.

Extremely high levels of plasma HGA are partially excreted into the urine. Excess HGA is then oxidized to benzoquinone acetic acid (BQA), which forms melanin-like polymers leading to the hyperpigmented appearance of dark urine.

Ochronosis produces widely variable symptoms both in location and severity, but common consequences of polymer deposition include hyperpigmentation and progressive degeneration of the structural integrity of native tissues. This results in more stiff and brittle tissues that are not able to perform normal connective tissue functions.

Within ocular structures, HGA pigment can be located phagocytosed within macrophages and fibroblasts as well as clumped in extracellular globules and granules associated with connective tissue bundles.

Studies reviewing mean ages of onset of ochronosis estimate that ocular signs can anticipate diagnosis of alkaptonuria by about 15 years. Furthermore, scleral hyperpigmentation can be identified with gross examination without the need for testing equipment.
