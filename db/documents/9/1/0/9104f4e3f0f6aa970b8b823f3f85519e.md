Patients with corrected D-TGA have slightly reduced exercise capacity. Some predictors of poor exercise performance include VSD repair, decreased left ventricular function, and repair before the development of the ASO.Â  Reduced exercise capacity has not been shown to affect activities of daily living.

Studies have also shown that patients who underwent ASO are more likely to have a neurodevelopmental impairment. One center reports that 65% of adolescents who experienced ASO as infants required special education services. The same center also reports that patients with surgically corrected ASO were more likely to have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that children who underwent corrective surgery for D-TGA undergo continued screening and referral for neurodevelopmental impairment.
