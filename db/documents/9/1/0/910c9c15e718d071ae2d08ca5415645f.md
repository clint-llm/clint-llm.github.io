One in 8 women (12.5%) in the United States will develop breast cancer throughout their lifetime. Certain populations are at an increased risk of developing cancer due to genetic or hereditary predisposition. Breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes whose mutations significantly increase the likelihood of developing particular types of epithelial malignancies, namely breast and ovarian cancer BRCA 1 and 2 mutations, have been found to be responsible for between 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases overall BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and makes up roughly half of the cancer cases related to inherited genetic risk

The recognition of a genetic predisposition to cancer, knowledge of risk patterns in high-risk patients, and access to testing have all improved in recent years. Because of this, the ability to identify patients at risk, screen early, and prevent cancer have gained increased attention. The management of patients with a proven mutation of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes is individualized and can include increased surveillance, chemoprevention using tamoxifen, bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy and or bilateral prophylactic mastectomy

Two common cancers linked to the presence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 include ovarian and breast cancers.
