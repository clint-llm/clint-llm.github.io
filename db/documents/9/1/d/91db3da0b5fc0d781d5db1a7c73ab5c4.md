There are three main pathologic categories of testicular seminoma: classical, spermatocytic, and seminoma with syncytiocytotrophoblastic cells. Spermatocytic type is rare, occurs in older men, and appears to have a better prognosis. The syncytiocytotrophoblastic subtype is associated with increased serum βhCG levels. A seminoma with a high mitotic index (>3 mitotic figures/HPF) is designated an anaplastic seminoma. The name implies a more aggressive tumor, but research fails to support that concern.
