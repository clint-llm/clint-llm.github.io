Infants born with fetal growth restriction small for gestational age (FGR SGA) are at increased risk of short- and long-term complications and death. Conditions such as maternal hypertension, kidney disease, infections, malnutrition, smoking, and substance abuse increase the risk of having an FGR SGA infant.

The evaluation of FGR SGA begins during the antenatal period. Pregnancies with FGR SGA fetuses can be detected with fundal height measurement and routine ultrasound exams during antenatal clinic visits. The early detection of fetuses at risk of FGR SGA will help in planning delivery and initial treatment. At birth, infants born FGR SGA are thin with loose peeling skin and decreased muscle mass and may appear shrunken with wrinkled faces. In some, the head is larger than the rest of the body.

Treatment of FGR SGA newborns is primarily focused on preventing and managing complications. Special attention is paid to the newborn’s temperature, and blood glucose is monitored and managed as appropriate. Newborns needing more extensive care are admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit, while those with less need for monitoring can be kept in a mother’s room or a normal newborn nursery.

The rate of death and disability is more in infants born with lower gestational age and birth weight percentile.
