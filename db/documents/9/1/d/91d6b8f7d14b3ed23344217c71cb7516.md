Effective treatment and management of children with WS require an interprofessional team, including:

- **Genetic Counseling:**Upon making the diagnosis, genetic counseling should follow.

- **Obstetrics:**All pregnancies in patients with WS are considered high risk due to the risk of arrhythmia, heart failure, and hypertension.

- **Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery:**At birth, children with WS often need cardiac care for supra-vascular aortic stenosis, which requires open-heart surgery by a cardiothoracic surgeon. Following surgery, patients should be closely monitored by a cardiologist due to the risk of hypertension and arteriopathy that can also lead to pulmonary artery stenosis, mitral valve insufficiency, and renal artery stenosis.

- **Endocrinology:**Endocrinologists often manage hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism, and growth reduction in WS patients.

- **Nephrology:**If renal calculi develop due to hypercalciuria, referral to a nephrologist is made for lithotripsy.

- **Gastroenterology:**Gastroenterology referral is warranted for children with feeding difficulties, as they may require a permanent feeding tube.

- **Nutritionist:**Infants with feeding difficulties often require feeding therapy and consultation with a nutritionist.

- **Psychiatry**: Psychiatric evaluation is recommended to determine the need for medications or psychotherapy to treat comorbid ADHD, OCD, or GAD.

- **Ancillary Services:**Due to neurodevelopmental deficits and intellectual disability, children with WS often require special education programs, occupational therapy (OT), physical therapy (PT), speech therapy (ST), and sensory integration therapies.

- **Dentist and Orthodontist:**Due to the risk of malocclusion and dental abnormalities, referral to an orthodontist and/or dentist is also a recommendation.
