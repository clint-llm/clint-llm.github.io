Insulin resistance is identified as an impaired biologic response to insulin stimulation of target tissues, primarily the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. Insulin resistance impairs glucose disposal, resulting in a compensatory increase in beta-cell insulin production and hyperinsulinemia. The metabolic consequences of insulin resistance can result in hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, visceral adiposity, hyperuricemia, elevated inflammatory markers, endothelial dysfunction, and a prothrombic state. This activity reviews the cause and presentation of insulin resistance and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of insulin resistance.
- Describe the pathophysiology of insulin resistance.
- Summarize the treatment of insulin resistance. 
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by insulin resistance.
