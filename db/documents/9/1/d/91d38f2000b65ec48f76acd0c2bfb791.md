Macroscopically, CP are highly vascular tumors with well-defined hemorrhagic cut surfaces and rarely have an obvious pedicle.

Histologically, like most of the paragangliomas, this tumor is mainly composed of chief cells grouped in clusters or organoid (“Zellbellen”) fashion with surrounding capillary networks. Pigmented CPs were also reported in a few patients.

Malignancy diagnosis is mainly based on metastasis rather than histologic features.
