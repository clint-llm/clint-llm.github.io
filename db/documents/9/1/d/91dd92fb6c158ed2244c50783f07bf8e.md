Shrinking lung syndrome is a rare complication of systemic autoimmune disease, most commonly SLE. This condition presents with exertional dyspnoea with or without pleuritic chest pain. It is rare, affecting approximately 1% of patients with SLE, and can occur at any point in the disease. In those patients with radiographic evidence of an elevated hemidiaphragm and restrictive physiology on lung function testing in the absence of another cause, it should be suspected. Initial treatment is usually with corticosteroids. More intense immunosuppression with disease-modifying and biologic drugs is sought in refractory cases. Most patients improve with treatment.
