The five muscles in the abdominal wall are divided into two groups: (1) two vertical muscles situated near the midline of the body and (2) three flat muscles located laterally and stacked on top of each other. The three flat muscles include the external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis. The flat muscles flex and rotate the trunk. Because the fibers of these muscles criss-cross and interlink with each other, they also strengthen the abdominal wall and reduce the risk of herniation.

**Flat Muscles**

- External Oblique - the most superficial and also the largest flat muscle of the abdominal wall. It runs in an inferior-medial direction and at the midline, its fibers form an aponeurosis and in the midline merge with the linea alba. This fibrous structure extends from the xiphoid process to the pubic symphysis.

- Internal Oblique - located deeper to the external oblique and is much thinner and smaller. Its fibers run superomedial and near the midline form an aponeurosis which contributes to the linea alba.

- Transversus Abdominis - the deepest of the flat muscles and its fibers run transversely. It also continues to the linea alba in the midline. Just beneath the transversus abdominis muscle is the transversalis fascia.

**Vertical Muscles**

- Rectus Abdominis - long paired vertical muscle located on either side of the midline. It is divided into two segments by the linea alba. The lateral border of the muscle is called the linea semilunaris. At several locations, the muscle is intersected by fibrous intersections which give rise to the “six-pack” seen in athletes. The rectus abdominis compresses the abdominal viscera, prevents herniation, and stabilizes the pelvis during ambulation.

- Pyramidalis - vertical muscle shaped like a triangle. It is located superficial to the rectus abdominis and located at the base of the pubic bone. The apex of the triangle attaches to the linea alba.

**Rectus Sheath**

The Rectus Sheath is an aponeurosis formed by the five muscles of the abdomen. It has an anterior and posterior wall for most of its length. The anterior wall is formed by the aponeuroses of the external oblique and half of the internal oblique. The posterior wall is formed by the aponeuroses of half of the internal oblique and transversus abdominis. About midway between the umbilicus and pubic symphysis, there is only the anterior wall of the rectus sheath and no posterior sheath. At this junction, the rectus abdominis muscle is in direct contact with the transversalis fascia. The area of transition at which the posterior wall disappears is the arcuate line.
