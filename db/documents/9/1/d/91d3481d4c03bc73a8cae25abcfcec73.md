LENT, modified LENT, and the PROMISE scores have been developed to predict patients with MPE

The LENT score consists of the following four parameters - pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and Ttmor type

The SELECT score uses the following markers for predicting the 90-day survival in these patients - Sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, Leucocyte count, EGFR status, chemotherapy, and primary tumor type.

It has also been suggested that prognostication in this domain needs to be individualized, emphasizing developing systems that include patient preferences, newer targeted therapy, immunotherapy approaches, and symptom burden within their purview.

Patients with an actionable mutation with non-small cell lung cancer and malignant pleural effusion have been associated with a similar risk of recurrence when compared to those without an actionable mutation.
