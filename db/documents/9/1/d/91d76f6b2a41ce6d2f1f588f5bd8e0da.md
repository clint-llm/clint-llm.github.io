Cyanide, much like carbon monoxide is a cellular asphyxiant. It binds to the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase and blocks the mitochondrial electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation.Â This leads to cellular hypoxia and depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This leads to metabolic acidosis and a shift from aerobic to increased anaerobic metabolism.
