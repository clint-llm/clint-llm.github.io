Although breast cancer is typically synonymous as a disease that commonly occurs in women, it does occur in men as well. This is because although minimal in quantity, men do have breast tissue that has the potential to become malignant similarly to women, albeit much less commonly. While male breast cancer (MBC) is rare, only occurring in 1% of all breast cancers, it does occur, and it is important to be cognizant of its reality and potential. This activity examines when this condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis and how to evaluate it properly. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of male breast cancer.
- Review the workup of a male with a breast mass.
- Summarize the treatment options for male breast cancer.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by male breast cancer.
