**Prognosis of NSCLC**

The TNM stage at presentation in patients with NSCLC has the most significant impact on prognosis. A higher TNM stage correlates with advanced disease and poor outcomes. Other factors indicative of poor prognosis include performance status at the time of diagnosis, anorexia, weight loss, and the presence of liver or skin metastases.

**Prognosis of SCLC**

The extent of disease and the stage at presentation is the most important prognostic factor for SCLC. Patients with the limited-stage disease have a five-year survival rate of 10 to 13%, whereas patients with the extensive-stage disease have a five-year survival rate of 1 to 2%.
