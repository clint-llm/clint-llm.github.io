Surgical reconstruction varies based on the clinical presentation, age, gender, and severity of the deformity.

In men, the most performed surgery is fat grafting to compensate esthetically for the muscle mass deficit. Autologous fat transfer is frequently used to correct chest wall asymmetry in mild to moderate deformity. In some cases, contralateral lipo-aspiration and rarely contralateral breast resection is considered in severe cases. More extensive reconstruction of the chest wall for PS includes autologous or alloplastic graft. Muscle flap, either pedicle or a free flap, can be used for chest wall reconstruction. The latissimus dorsi, due to its proximity, is usually considered a favorable option for muscle flap. However, when the muscle is aplastic ipsilaterally, the contralateral side is another viable option to consider.

Bone graft orÂ prosthesis can also be used to reconstruct the chest wall with or without the use of a concomitant muscle flap.
