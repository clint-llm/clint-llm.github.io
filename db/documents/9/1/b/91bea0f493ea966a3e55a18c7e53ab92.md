In recent years the definition of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), or Devic disease, has been expanded as a specific antibody was discovered in the serum of affected patients. Because of this, the term neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is now used to include optic neuritis with spinal cord manifestations and include other neurologic disorders associated with the serum aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G antibodies (AQP4-IgG).

NMO was first described by Dr. Eugene Devic, who in 1894 described a patient with optic neuritis with accompanying neuromuscular manifestations. That same year, Fernand Gault, who was Devic’s student, published his doctoral thesis presenting a literature review of previous medical cases, including the clinicopathological findings of Dr. Devic’s case.

For years, multiple sclerosis (MS) was the most prevalent identifiable cause of optic neuritis. Recent discoveries have highlighted rarer, more sinister manifestations of optic neuritis such as NMOSD and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), which necessitate additional evaluation and treatment.
