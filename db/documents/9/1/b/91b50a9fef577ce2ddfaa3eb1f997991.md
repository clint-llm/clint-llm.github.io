Poor dental and oral health can potentially lead to numerous issues. Of particular concern is plaque, a biofilm of various bacteria (mainly Streptococcus and anaerobes) that form on the surface of teeth. Brushing alone does not always remove plaque in its entirety. If plaque is not professionally removed regularly, periodontal problems and gingivitis can set in. Plaque can mineralize, eventually leading to tartar build-up, causing gingivitis, halitosis, and dental caries.

Streptococcus mutans is the most important bacteria associated with dental caries.

Nutrition is also of specific concern in the development and growth of teeth. The availability of calcium and phosphate in the diet and the amount of vitamin D in the body are all factors that can lead to changes in the enamel and growth of healthy, normal teeth. Defect calcification occurs when these factors are deficient, leading to abnormal teeth development throughout life.
