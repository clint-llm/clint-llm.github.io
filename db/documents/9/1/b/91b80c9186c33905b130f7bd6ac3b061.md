The diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris is ascertained by obtaining a thorough history and through the use of a biopsy. The biopsy for direct immunofluorescence (DIF) should be taken from normal-appearing perilesional skin or mucosa.

In patients with positive DIF results,Â ELISA testing will show serum IgG against Dsg 1, Dsg 3, or both.
