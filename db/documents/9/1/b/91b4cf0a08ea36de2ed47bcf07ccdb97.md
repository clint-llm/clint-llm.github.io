The best available epidemiologic data on the incidence of subacute thyroiditis is from a study conducted by Fatourechi V et al. in Olmstead County, Minnesota, USA, during the period from 1960 to 1997. The overall age and sex-adjusted incidence of subacute thyroiditis during this period were 4.9 cases per 100,000/year. The most common symptom was pain (96%); even though most patients achieved complete resolution and a euthyroid state, about 15% of patients required continuous thyroid replacement therapy during long-term follow-up, and 1.6 to 4% of patients developed recurrence subacute thyroiditis after the initial episode.

This disease affects women almost 4 to 5 times as often as men and typically occurs between 25 to 35 years. With increasing age, the incidence of subacute thyroiditis decreases. The prevalence of subacute thyroiditis appears to be seasonal, as most cases occur in the summer and fall.
