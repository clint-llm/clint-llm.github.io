The carpal bones are bones of the wrist that connect the distal aspects of the radial and ulnar bones of the forearm to the bases of the five metacarpal bones of the hand. There are eight carpal bones, which divide into two rows: a proximal row and a distal row. The proximal row of carpal bones (moving from radial to ulnar) are the scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, and pisiform, while the distal row of carpal bones (also from radial to ulnar) comprises the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate. These bones make up most of the skeletal framework of the wrist and allow different neurovascular structures and tendons that enter the wrist to reach certain muscle groups and bony structures, respectively and provide the innervation and blood supply necessary for themÂ to function.
