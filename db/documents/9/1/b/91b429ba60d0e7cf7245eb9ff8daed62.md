The etiology of NSCLC can be further categorized into avoidable and unavoidable risk factors. The most well-known avoidable risk factor for NSCLC is inhaled tobacco use. Other causes of lung cancer include alcohol use, environmental exposure to secondhand smoke, asbestos, radon, arsenic, chromium, nickel, as well as exposure to ionizing radiation, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Patients with pulmonary fibrosis have been found to have an approximately sevenfold increase in the risk of developing lung cancer, and this has been shown to be independent of tobacco use.
