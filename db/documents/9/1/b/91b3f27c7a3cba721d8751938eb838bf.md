Overall the function of the ear is hearing and maintaining balance. Sound waves are transmitted to the tympanic membrane by the external ear, then undergo modulation by the ossicles of the middle ear. They are then carried into the inner ear by the oval window that results in mechanical fluid movement within the inner ear that converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy. The electrical input travels to the brain within the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VII), and the information registers as sound in the temporal region of the brain. The ear also maintains balance using the semicircular canals within the inner ear system. The three channels that are at right angles with one-another contain fluid that shifts according to head movement causing depolarization of delicate hair cells. These depolarizations essentially convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and are transmitted to the central nervous system via the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve.

Microscopically, sensory hair cells serve as mechanoreceptors that are stimulated by inner ear fluid movement. The human ear can hear sound waves with frequencies between 20 hertz and 20 kilohertz.
