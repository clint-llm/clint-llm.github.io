Pyoderma gangrenosum is an ulcerative disorder that falls into the category of neutrophilic dermatoses. Pyoderma gangrenosum should not be confused with pyogenic granuloma, a completely separate entity but with an equally ill-fitting name. Despite its name, pyoderma gangrenosum is not caused by infection or gangrene. Pyogenic granuloma is often associated with systemic disease.  The diagnosis is made clinically after excluding other similar skin disorders.
