Hepatobiliary scintigraphy is a diagnostic nuclear medicine procedure which uses radiotracers to evaluate the biliary system and also, indirectly, the liver. The radiotracer used is iminodiacetic acid (IDA) or some close variant which is administered intravenously, bound to albumin, transported to the liver, and excreted into the biliary system. The utility of hepatobiliary IDA or HIDA scan is that the radiotracer follows the bilirubin metabolic pathway and excretion into the bile ducts.

Thus, in the case of acute cholecystitis which is largely caused by obstruction of the cystic duct, radiotracers cannot enter the gallbladder which is demonstrated by gallbladder non-visualization. The hallmark of chronic cholecystitis is decreased ejection fraction measured objectively with maximum gallbladder radiotracer signal and minimum radiotracer signal after administration of sincalide which contracts the gallbladder. Biliary atresia or distal biliary obstruction is demonstrated by the absence of radiotracer in the duodenum. Extrabiliary radiotracer signifies biliary leak, etc.

Ultrasound has been the primary modality for initially assessing gallbladder pathology. In suspected acute cholecystitis sonographic findings (gallbladder wall thickening, cystic duct dilation, pericholecystic fluid) are secondary and take time to develop. A HIDA scan demonstrates cystic duct obstruction which is the underlying primary event and immediately apparent. Scintigraphy is unlikely to supplant ultrasound as the initial modality for right upper quadrant pain because ultrasound is readily available, is portable, fast, requires minimal patient preparation, avoids ionizing radiation, and may offer alternative diagnoses.
