A ryanodine receptor is comprised of four polypeptides, each consisting of around 5000 amino acids, and four FK506-binding proteins, each consisting of approximately 110 amino acids.

In skeletal muscle, calcium release units arrange themselves in triads composed of three different elements: two terminal expansions of the sarcoplasmic reticulum on either side that form a junction with the third component, the t-tubule.

In cardiac muscle, calcium release units arrange themselves in dyads, containing only two elements, a single terminal sarcoplasmic reticulum expansion forming a junction with the surface of the t-tubule membrane.
