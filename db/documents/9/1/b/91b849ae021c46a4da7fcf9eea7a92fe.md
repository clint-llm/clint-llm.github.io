The number of reported cases of peliosis hepatis is rising with advances in imaging modalities and medicine, as well as the number of autopsies performed. Peliosis hepatis is most commonly idiopathic; however, it seems to have developed an association with patients with recent renal transplants. There is no documented difference in incidence between males and females. Although it is more often a condition observed in adults, it can be seen in the pediatric population as well.
