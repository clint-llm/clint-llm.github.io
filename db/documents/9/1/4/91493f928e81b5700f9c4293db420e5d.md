Management of primidone therapy and especially possible overdose requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including nurses, pharmacists, laboratory technologists, and several clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs) in various specialties. Without proper treatment, the morbidity and mortality from primidone overdose are high. Patients who have consumed primidone in excess often require hemodynamic and respiratory support; this could include ventilation, intubation, boluses of isotonic IV fluids, and inotropic infusions. Once the airway of a patient is protected, activated charcoal should be administered to minimize the absorption of orally administered primidone; multiple doses of activated charcoal improve phenobarbital clearance, although no evidence exists that it actually improves clinical outcomes. Urinary alkalinization also enhances phenobarbital clearance in patients with normal cardiac and renal function. Urinary alkalinization has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes, either.

A consult with a mental health professional to evaluate the patient to determine if it was an intentional act and if the patient may be at continued risk for self-harm may be appropriate. The pharmacist should make sure that there are no drug interactions, and the risk of possible drug overdose requires monitoring, open communication, and coordinated action from the clinical team.
