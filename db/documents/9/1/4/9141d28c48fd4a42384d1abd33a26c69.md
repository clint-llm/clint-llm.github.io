The management of patients with Down syndrome is an interprofessional endeavor. Newborns with suspicion of Down syndrome, should have a karyotyping done to confirm the diagnosis. The family needs to be referred to the clinical geneticist for the genetic testing and counseling of both the parents.

Because almost every organ system is involved the child needs to be seen by the ophthalmologist, orthopedic surgeon, cardiologist, dermatologist, gastroenterologist, physical therapist, mental health nurse, ENT surgeon and a behavior specialist.

Parental education is one of the foremost aspects regarding the management of Down syndrome, as parents need to be aware of the different possible conditions associated with it so that they can be diagnosed and treated appropriately. Treatment is basically symtomatic and complete recovery is not possible.

While life span has increased over the past 3 decades, these indivduals still have a shorter life expectancy compared to healthy individuals.
