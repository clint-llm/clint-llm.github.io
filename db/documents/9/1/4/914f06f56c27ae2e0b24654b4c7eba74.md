Overall the development of anemia increases the risk for mortality in many clinical diseases such as chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and malignancy. This is seen in the publication of landmark trials such as TRICC, TRISS, and TRACS as their goals were to see what was the lowest level of anemia that could be tolerated without increasing mortality.

The prognosis for hemolytic anemias again varies on the cause of the illness as well as how early it is diagnosed and managed appropriately.

Studies have shown that patients with SCD had poorer outcomes. Specifically, hemoglobins of less than 8 g/dL are more likely to have complications during admissions, such as strokes, and increased mortality.

Patients who are diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia with marked anemia at onset are at increased risk of multiple relapses as well as more often seen to be refractory to multiple lines of treatment.

As the main treatment for G6PD deficiency is the avoidance of oxidative stressors, the disease is rarely fatal. However, these patients are more predisposed to sepsis and complications from infections.
