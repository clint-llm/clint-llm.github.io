**Anesthesia**

- The skin overlying the injection area can be anesthetized with localized infiltration of 1% lidocaine and a high gauge needle. Alternatively, rapidly evaporating coolants such as ethyl chloride work to provide short-acting anesthesia of the skin at the point of injection. These techniques can be used in combination to anesthetize the skin and underlying soft tissue to increase the comfort of the procedure.

**Position**

- The patient should be seated upright with the affected arm in a relaxed position.  With the patient in a chair with armrests or on a stretcher with the head of the bed elevated and guardrails up, if possible, this ensures that the patient is in a comfortable position to facilitate access to the GH joint.  Also, with the patient seated or lying down, this can be protective and prophylactic against any falls that may occur during a potential vaso-vagal syncopal episode.

**Technique: Anterior Approach**

After prepping, sterilizing, and draping the skin, the most important step in the shoulder arthrocentesis technique is the proper identification of landmarks which will determine the point of entry into the joint. These landmarks include the humeral head, distal clavicle, and coracoid process. The point of entry is medial to the humeral head and inferior/lateral to the coracoid process. Insert needle perpendicular to the skin and into the joint space as depicted in the figure. If you chose to identify your landmarks before the sterilization process, using a skin impression or marking pen at the insertion site can maintain an accurate position during the prepping and draping of the skin.

While drawing back on the plunger to check for intra-articular blood or synovial fluid. Once the syringe is filled, a hemostat can be placed on the needle's hub to facilitate the removal of a syringe filled with synovial fluid to be sent for analysis and placement of an additional syringe (if needed) to draw off any additional fluid. This same syringe exchange technique can attach a syringe filled with local anesthetic and or injectable steroids as indicated. The skin is then cleaned, and a bandage is placed.

**Technique: Posterior Approach**

Utilizing the same preparation technique noted above, the posterior approach is commonly utilized for aspiration/injection to the GH joint.  The entry point is two fingers’ breadth inferior and medial to the acromion's palpated posterolateral border. The needle is directed anteromedially, with the opposite hand palpating the coracoid process.  The coracoid serves as a directional reference point to help guide the clinician's needle trajectory.
