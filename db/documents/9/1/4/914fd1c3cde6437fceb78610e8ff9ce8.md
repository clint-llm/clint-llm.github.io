Lumbar disc herniation results from several changes in the intervertebral disc including reduced water retention in nucleus pulposus, increased type 1 collagen ratio in the nucleus pulposus and inner annulus fibrosus, destruction of collagen and extracellular material, and an upregulated activity of degrading systems such as matrix metalloproteinase expression, apoptosis, and inflammatory pathways. Ultimately, resulting in a local increase in inflammatory chemokines and mechanical compression applied by the protruding nucleus pulposus on the exiting nerve.

The pressure exerted by the herniated disc on the longitudinal ligament and the irritation caused by the local inflammation results in localized back pain. The lumbar radicular pain arises when disc material exerts pressure or contacts the thecal sac or lumbar nerve roots, resulting in nerve root ischemia and inflammation. The annulus fibrosus is thinner on the posterolateral aspect and lacks support from the posterior longitudinal ligament, making it vulnerable to herniations. Due to the proximity of the nerve root, a posterolateral herniation is more likely to result in nerve root compression.

In LDH, the narrowing of the space available for the thecal sac is attributable to several factors such as protrusion of the disc through an intact annulus fibrosus, extrusion of the nucleus pulposus through the annulus fibrosus while maintaining continuity of the disc space, or obliteration of the disc space continuity and sequestration of free fragments.
