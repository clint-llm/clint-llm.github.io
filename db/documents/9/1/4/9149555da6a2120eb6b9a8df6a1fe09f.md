The common presentations of stroke are headache, aphasia, hemiparesis, and facial palsy.

- Headache is more common in a large hematoma.

- Vomiting indicates raised intracranial pressure and is common with cerebellar hematoma.

- Coma occurs in the involvement of the reticular activating system of the brainstem.

- Seizure, aphasia, and hemianopia are seen in lobar hemorrhage. A prodrome consisting of numbness, tingling, and weakness may also occur in lobar bleed.

- Contralateral sensorimotor deficits are the features in hemorrhage of the basal ganglia and thalamus.

- Loss of all sensory modalities is the main feature of thalamic hemorrhage.

- Extension of thalamic hematoma into the midbrain can cause vertical gaze palsy, ptosis, and unreactive pupil.

- Cranial nerve dysfunction with contralateral weakness indicates brainstem hematoma.

- Usually, pontine hematoma produces coma and quadriparesis.

Cerebellar hemorrhage produces symptoms of raised ICP, such as lethargy, vomiting, and bradycardia. Progressive neurological deterioration indicates the enlargement of hematoma or an increase in edema.

The clinical features of subarachnoid hemorrhage are severe headache described as a thunderclap, vomiting, syncope, photophobia, nuchal rigidity, seizures, and decreased level of consciousness.
