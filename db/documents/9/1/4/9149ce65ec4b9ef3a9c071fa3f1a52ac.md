Autonomic dysfunction is a prevalent health problem that remains underdiagnosed, undertreated, and underappreciated across healthcare systems. In most cases, patients tend to have a late diagnosis when their symptoms are chronic and long-standing. The lack of acknowledgment from the general population and the medical community, diagnostic testing set in the development, and a finite set of extensively tested and validated drugs to offer, among other causes, make the field one of the most promising for research.

Autonomic dysreflexia is a severe, potentially life-threatening condition affecting the cardiovascular system of patients exposed to various risk factors - ranging from painful/noxious stimuli to more subtle conditions (e.g., bowel or bladder obstructions). It can lead to cardiac ischemia, brain hemorrhage, seizures, and even death. Therefore, clinicians should remain cognizant, depending on the specific patient and clinical constellation of symptoms.
