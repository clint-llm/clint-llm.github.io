Spider nevi may be encountered by the primary care provider or nurse practitioner. It is important to know that spider nevi are benign lesions and no treatment is generally required, except for cosmesis. There are several treatments available to treat spider nevi but with all of them, scarring and recurrence is a problem. In many cases, spider nevi regress spontaneously. The prognosis for patients with spider nevi is generally excellent unless they have underlying end-stageÂ liver disease. (Level V)
