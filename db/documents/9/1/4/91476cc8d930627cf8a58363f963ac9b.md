The EPA recommends that all home sellers/buyers test their homes for radon levels. Some areas with higher radon levels require testing by law. Thirty-four states have laws addressing radon and radon toxicity. Twenty-nine states require the discussion of radon levels and recent measurements during the sale of a house. Nine states require all new construction to be radon-resistant.

Ultimately, the primary remedy to radon toxicity is public awareness and prevention. When buying a home, asking questions about radon exposures and levels is important, especially in states with higher radon levels. If one already has a home and there is a concern for increased radon levels, reaching out to a contractor to measure radon levels is a simple start. The EPA’s website provides an array of resources to find more information about radon zones in various regions and about resources for homeowners.
