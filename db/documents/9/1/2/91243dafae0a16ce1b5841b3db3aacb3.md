Correct catheter and sheath size, appropriate balloons, and optimal contrast delivered by the support staff are crucial for procedural success. Unfractionated heparin should be given to achieve the therapeutic activated clotting time of 250 to 300 seconds. Astute ECHO technicians should be available to monitor pericardial effusion during the procedure. Vascular access sites should beÂ monitored for any concern for bleeding. In addition, physicians should be notified immediately if any complications are noted.
