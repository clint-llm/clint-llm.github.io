The mainstay of treatment involves the cessation of the causal agent and the use of immunosuppressants or immunomodulators to turn off the host autoimmune response. Pemphigus can be life-threatening and requires intensive and prompt use of systemic corticosteroids for induction at a dose of 1mg/kg body weight. Immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, or cyclophosphamide are also used in severe disease. The use of an anti-CD-20 antibody, rituximab, has also shown to be a promising therapy for refractory pemphigus in a number of cases by targeting the aberrant B cells. Some cases also suggest an exacerbation of disease after the treatment with rituximab. Overall, there is a lack of well-controlled clinical studies on the proper treatment of drug-induced pemphigus, but the mainstay of the therapy continues to consist of a combination of corticosteroids and an immunosuppressive agent such as azathioprine.
