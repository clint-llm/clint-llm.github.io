The FDA stipulates that those patients who have a known hypersensitivity to inamrinone should not receive the drug. Given that the drug contains sodium metabisulfite, the FDA includes administering inamrinone as a contraindication if the patient has a known hypersensitivity to bisulfites. Sodium metabisulfite allergy can lead to contact dermatitis.

Additionally, clinicians should not give inamrinone to patients with aortic or pulmonic valvular disease.

It should be administered with caution if the patient is taking disopyramide due to the drug combination’s potential to induce severe hypotension.
