Asymptomatic hypotension should not receive drastic interventions. However, if symptoms are present, the treatment of hypotension should focus on reversing the underlying etiology. Noninvasive imaging or hemodynamic indices of low cardiac output or systemic vascular resistance are not diagnostic but may help to classify hypotension. Therefore electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and chest X-ray may assist in the workup. In a trauma case with hypotension and no apparent blood loss, an extended focused assessment with sonography in trauma (e-FAST) exam may be beneficial to identify the presence of intracavitary bleeding. It is important to monitor urine output to verify those fluid resuscitation efforts are sufficient with an output of 0.5 to 1.0 mL/Kg per hour. Along with fluid resuscitation, it is important to monitor fluid electrolytes and replace them as appropriate to avoid inducing an abnormality. Orthostatic vital signs may be beneficial to diagnosis also. If a medication is suspected to be the source, discontinue the medicine. In acute shock conditions, rapid fluid resuscitation with the cessation of bleeding is key. Vasopressors may be indicated if the mean arterial pressure is less than 65 mm Hg. If sepsis is suspected, serial blood cultures and early antibiotics are essential. If anaphylaxis is suspected, intramuscular epinephrine is essential. Adding steroids for treatment of distributive shock when a patient's vasopressor requirement is continually increasing, and appropriate fluid resuscitation has been done will assist in maintaining blood pressure as well.
