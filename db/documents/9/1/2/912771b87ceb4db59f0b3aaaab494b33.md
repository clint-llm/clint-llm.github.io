Pulmonary hypertension has a diagnosis delay of more than two years from symptom onset, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion. A stepwise evaluation and referral to expert centers should be done in a timely manner for prompt diagnosis of PH, its underlying cause, and aggressive therapy, as the disease can confer high morbidity and mortality.

Patients should be aware of typical symptoms of the disease, such as shortness of breath on exertion, weight gain, and even subtle symptoms, such as fatigue, loss of appetite, chest pain, belly pain, and tiredness. They should be vigilant of such symptoms, especially if they have a family history of PH. There can be a delay in diagnosis, and patients may have to visit multiple doctors across various institutions before finally arriving at the diagnosis. This can lead to anxiety and frustration. Patients may have to undergo extensive testing, including blood tests, lung function tests, sleep studies, echocardiogram, and even a right heart catheterization. Management involves adhering to a low-salt diet, exercise, oxygen therapy, and medications such as diuretics and/or anticoagulants. Patients with PAH may require subcutaneous or intravenous drug therapy and need specialized education to manage those medications.
