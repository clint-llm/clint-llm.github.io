The diagnosis of nonorganic functional hearing loss can only be made when other organic pathologies have been excluded. Subjective audiological testing usually reveals a pattern coherent with sensorineural hearing loss.

Causes of organic sensorineural hearing loss include:

- Noise exposure

- Trauma

- Infection

- Ménière disease

- Autoimmune disease

- Perilymph fistula

- Otosclerosis

- Genetically-inherited hearing loss

- Tumor

- Exposure to ototoxic agents

- Metabolic dysfunction

As the onset of nonorganic functional hearing loss is often sudden, causes of sudden sensorineural hearing loss must also be excluded. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss can be due to ototoxicity, vascular occlusion, autoimmune diseases, viral infection, and even acoustic neuroma.

Auditory processing disorders, auditory neuropathy, and cortical auditory disorders should also be considered in the differential diagnosis.

The diagnosis of nonorganic functional hearing loss is likely to be made when there is great variability in audiological test results, with objective audiological tests showing an absence of pathology in the auditory system. A history of recent psychological stress usually precedes the onset of symptoms. Inconsistent and suspicious behaviors during the examination may alert the clinician to suspect nonorganic functional hearing loss.
