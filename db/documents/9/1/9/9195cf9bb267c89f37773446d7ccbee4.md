Most vaccines have adverse reactions, as is the case with any drug or medication. For example, BCG vaccination may provoke fever, vomiting, hematuria, lymphadenitis, and redness at the injection site. Hib vaccine has few adverse reactions, and none of them are dangerous. These reactions include redness, warmth, swelling, and fever over 101 F (38.3 C). A rare and lethal adverse reaction secondary to vaccination is the Guillain-Barre syndrome.
