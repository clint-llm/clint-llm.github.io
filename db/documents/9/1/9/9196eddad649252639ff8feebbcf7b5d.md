Monitoring fexofenadine involves monitoring for improvement or worsening of symptoms with use. Because of fexofenadine's close relationship with cardiotoxic terfenadine, patients with underlying cardiac conditions may need to be monitored with periodic EKG to watch for QT-prolongation and arrhythmias.

A study out of Vietnam compared fexofenadine and levocetirizine for chronic urticaria. The study found that doses two times the recommended dosing showed improved urticarial symptoms without increasing adverse effects. The most common side effects noted were fatigue and drowsiness, which occurred at the same rates in patients taking the recommended dose rather than the higher dose. This same study mentions a European study in which dosing was quadrupled and had similar adverse effects.

Monitor the quality of life using chronic urticaria quality of life questionnaire (CU-Q2oL) and the impact of fexofenadine therapy resulting in reduced urticaria symptoms by urticaria activity score (UAS7).
