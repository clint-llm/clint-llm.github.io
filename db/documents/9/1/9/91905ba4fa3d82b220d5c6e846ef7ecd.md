Vasculitis has several mimics, so careful evaluation of differentials is necessary when evaluating such patients. Conditions that can mimic vasculitis include infections such as infective endocarditis, histoplasmosis, and gonococcal infection. Â Since the treatment of vasculitis requires the use of immunosuppressive drugs, it is necessary to perform a full infection screen in all patients with suspected vasculitis. Coagulopathies like antiphospholipid syndrome & thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, neoplasms like atrial myoma, lymphoma, and several drug toxicities like cocaine and levamisole can present with symptoms similar to vasculitis.
