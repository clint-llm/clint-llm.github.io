Multiple myeloma is a clonal plasma cell proliferative disorder characterized by the abnormal increase of monoclonal paraprotein leading to evidence of specific end-organ damage. The consequences of undiagnosed disease are severe. This activity reviews the underlying cause, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of multiple myeloma. The importance of early recognition, treatment, and an interprofessional approach is highlighted in this activity.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of multiple myeloma.
- Review the appropriate steps in evaluating a patient suspected of having multiple myeloma.
- Summarize the first-line therapy options for multiple myeloma.
