The use of mechanical thrombectomy is considered the standard of care for large vessel occlusion. The MR CLEAN trial (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands) published in 2015 was a large multicenter randomized trial that compared patients who underwent intraarterial treatment plus usual care with those who underwent standard medical treatment.

Intraarterial intervention, including mechanical thrombectomy, resulted in a higher rate (13.5%) of functional independence in acute ischemic stroke than in the control group, supporting the safety and efficacy of an intraarterial intervention. However, subsequent trials have shown that intracranial hemorrhage's risk due to intraoperative complications remains a concern. Improvements in health-related quality of life and cognitive function are additional outcomes observed in long term follow-up for patients suffering an ischemic stroke.
