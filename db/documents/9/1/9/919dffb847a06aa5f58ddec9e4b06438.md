Nociceptive neurons are dedicated to detecting noxious stimuli and alerting the brain when an injury is likely or imminent. Since pain is such an essential homeostatic mechanism for preserving health and avoiding morbidity, the person cannot easily ignore these sensations initially detected by nociceptive neurons or neural circuits. When nociceptors, or their secondary neural circuitry, are overstimulated, they are capable of producing disabling sensations of pain and damage in otherwise healthy tissues. Often, the increased activity of otherwise-unaffected nociceptors is physiologic; such is the case when an inflammatory state may sensitize thermal nociceptors and allow them to depolarize upon contact with sub-noxious temperatures.

Allodynia refers to a state where nociceptors have become indiscriminately sensitized, such that they depolarize in the presence of sub-noxious stimuli.
