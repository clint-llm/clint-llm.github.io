Fluoroscopy is using the C-arm to get live or static images of the foot. This can be used in the clinic or in the operating room. There are multiple reasons to use fluoroscopy procedures in the assessment of the foot. Diagnostic injections into the multiple joints of the foot, stress examinations to evaluate for ligamentous instability, and intra-operative evaluation of deformity correction are all examples of reasons to use fluoroscopy.

The anatomy of the foot involves 30 joints and 26 bones that can be difficult to identify from surface landmarks alone. Using fluoroscopy and positioning the foot correctly, you can accurately identify your location.
