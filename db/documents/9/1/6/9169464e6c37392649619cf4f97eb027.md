Benzocaine is relatively safe and low-risk when applied topically. However, one of the more life-threatening side effects is methemoglobinemia, which is characterized by cyanosis, hypoxia, and dyspnea that do not improve with oxygen administration. This effect occurs due to benzocaine's ability to metabolize into nitrobenzene, which reduces the oxygen-binding capacity of hemoglobin by the oxidation of iron (Fe2+ to Fe3+). OtherÂ adverse effects include hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, convulsions, drowsiness, dizziness, edema, and allergic reactions.

Children and the elderly population are more prone to hypersensitivity reactions due to benzocaine. Therefore, benzocaine should be used with caution as it may cause tenderness, itchiness, and edema to the applied area. Though benzocaine is a relatively low-risk medication, some patients may experience sensitization to the drug. Topical benzocaine usage is not recommended in patients that have deep wounds, lesions, or severe burns.

Benzocaine topical spray is dosed for ages 12 and older as needed, a maximum of four times a day.
