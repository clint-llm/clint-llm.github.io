A serum ferritin level is an inexpensive and widely available way of assessing transfusion iron overload. A patient with thalassemia with a ferritin measurement of more than 2500 ng/dL has an 80% greater chance of cardiac-related mortality.

MRI is the gold standard for long term monitoring of liver and cardiac iron levels. Cardiac T2* MRI has a better prognostic value to predict cardiac risk.

Liver biopsy is the standard of care when MRI is not available. However, patient compliance and risk of bleeding have limited its use.

Most guidelines also recommend baseline testing for free thyroxine (T4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), calcium, phosphate, 25-OH vitamin D, fasting blood sugar (FBS), echocardiography, bone mass densitometry, and follow-up once a year.
