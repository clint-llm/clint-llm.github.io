Despite the well-documented phenotype of patients with nail-patella syndrome, this rare genetic condition can make for a challenging diagnosis as there are potentially multiple clinical manifestations, and diagnosis can be delayed into adulthood. Additionally, there are potentially serious complications of NPS if patient symptoms are not addressed. Due to these challenges, patients would likely benefit from an interprofessional healthcare team of pediatricians, primary care physicians, medical geneticists, nephrologists, radiologists, and orthopedic surgeons who collaborate to perform screening for complications, treat symptomatic complaints as they arrive, and ensure appropriate referral to subspecialist providers when medically warranted.
