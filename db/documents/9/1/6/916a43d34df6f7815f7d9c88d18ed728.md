Patients with specific phobias report various physical and emotional symptoms. Based on these symptoms, practitioners utilize screening tools to diagnose patients with claustrophobia. Physical symptoms include, but are not limited to, difficulty breathing, trembling, sweating, tachycardia, dry mouth, and chest pain. Emotional symptoms include, but are not limited to, overwhelming anxiety or fear, fear of losing control, an intense need to leave the situation, and understanding the fear as irrational but an inability to overcome it.

People with claustrophobia tend to feel the fear of what might happen in a confined space which leads to the sense of oxygen not being adequate. Thinking about it or being confined may trigger a fear of being unable to breathe adequately, running out of oxygen, and being restricted. When anxiety levels exceed, the person may begin to experience:

- Sweating and chills

- Increased heart rate and high blood pressure

- Dizziness and lightheadedness

- Dry mouth

- Hyperventilation

- Hot flashes

- Nausea

- Headache

- Numbness

- A choking sensation

- Chest tightness/pain and difficulty breathing

- An urge to urinate

- Confusion

Not all people with claustrophobia will present with all these features, as the presentation can be variable.
