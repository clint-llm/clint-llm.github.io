Most cases of lens-induced inflammation undergo cataract extraction with good postoperative outcomesâ€”preoperative antiglaucoma medications and topical and systemic steroids aid in controlling intraocular pressure and inflammation. Complete removal of lens matter during surgery is important. Postoperative use of topical steroids and antiglaucoma medications may be needed for a longer time than routine cataract surgery. Posterior segment evaluation is mandatory after surgery as preoperatively, and the media is hazy due to dense cataracts.
