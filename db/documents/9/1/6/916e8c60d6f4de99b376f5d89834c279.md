Quite often, in practice, the primary care providers must be familiar with the entity of familial short stature (FSS) as it is frequently encountered. Indeed, they should be prepared to try to convince anxious parents that rGH treatment has not been approved for FSS. This is in contrast to some cases of ISS, where some studies have (not conclusively) demonstrated benefit.

The laboratory medicine personnel should be provided with a summary of the child's clinical history. Coordination between the laboratory staff and the provider will help conduct tests such as GH stimulation more accurately.

Occasionally, genetic tests may be needed, and extensive counseling on testing, avoidance of unnecessary procedures, and adaptation to the environment will need inter-professional communication with the provider, laboratory, nurses, and clinical psychologists to improve outcomes and enhance team performance.
