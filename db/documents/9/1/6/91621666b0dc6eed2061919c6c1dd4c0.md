Anticholinergic toxicity is commonly seen in the emergency department but is rarely fatal. According to the 2015 annual American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) report, there were just under 14,000 exposures reported to poison control centers that year, none of which led to mortality. However, in prior years, up to 51 cases have been reported as fatalities. This activity describes the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation and highlights the treatment and management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the causes of anticholinergic toxicity. 
- Outline the presentation of a patient with anticholinergic toxicity.
- Discuss the current treatment and management options for anticholinergic toxicity.
- Summarize how an interprofessional team can coordinate care to provide the best outcomes in patients with anticholinergic toxicity.
