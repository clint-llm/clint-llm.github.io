The differential diagnosis may include several conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis, intertrigo, allergic contact dermatitis, inverse psoriasis, granular parakeratosis, Darier disease, and Hailey-Hailey disease. All these dermatoses must be excluded before a drug eruption is to be diagnosed.

SDRIFE can also mimic other specific drug reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and fixed drug eruption (FDE).

However, AGEP and DRESS characteristically demonstrate a widespread rash with accompanying systemic symptoms. FDE can be easily differentiated from SDRIFE as it characteristically presents as asymmetrical acral, genital and mucosal patches or plaques which are usually round or oval with residual hyperpigmentation.
