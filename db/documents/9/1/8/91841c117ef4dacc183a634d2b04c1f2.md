The prognosis of pituitary adenomas depends on its being functioning or non-functioning. The non-functioning adenomas and prolactinomas have an excellent prognosis if treated promptly with surgery and/or medical therapy. Functioning adenomas like Cushing's disease and acromegaly are associated with several other co-morbidities and complications. There is increased mortality especially in patients with Cushing's disease with delays in medical or surgical treatment.
