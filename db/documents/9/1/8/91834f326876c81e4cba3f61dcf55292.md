The prognosis of anhidrosis varies depending on the type of anhidrosis. Anhidrosis associated with a genetic syndrome is generally lifelong. In the setting of drug-induced anhidrosis, it is usually reversible with the discontinuation of the medication. Anhydrosis secondary to a treatable cause is generally reversible and has a favorable prognosis.
