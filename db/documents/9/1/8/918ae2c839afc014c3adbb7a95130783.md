Nurses practicing in a state or territory should be familiar with the NPA. Nurses are responsible for knowing the laws affecting their practice as most boards maintain ignorance of the law is no excuse for non-compliance and substandard nursing practice. NPAs are laws and rules in the NPA designed to protect the public from unsafe practice, which may include standards of practice for all nursing levels (PN/VN, RN, or APN).
