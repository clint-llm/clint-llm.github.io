It is prudent for the clinician considering stimulant therapy for any condition for which it is indicated to perform a careful assessment of the patient by using a targeted cardiac history (eg, patient history of previously detected cardiac disease, palpitations, syncope, or seizures; a family history of sudden death in children or young adults; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; long QT syndrome) and a physical examination, including a careful cardiac examination. This approach is appropriate for adults and children.
