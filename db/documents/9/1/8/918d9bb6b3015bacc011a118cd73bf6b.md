Standard audiometry equipment should be available for OAE, ABR, tympanometry, and comprehensive age-appropriate audiometric equipment. Examples of age-appropriate testing will be described below in further detail. Visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) is most appropriate for children under age two who can sit upright unassisted and demonstrate good head and neck control to turn the head toward a sound stimulus. This most often occurs at approximately six months of corrected age.

From age two until age 5, or until the child can more meaningfully participate in an evaluation, conditioned play audiometry (CPA) is the recommended evaluation approach. Standard pure-tone audiometry (PTA) is utilized after age 5, or sooner if the child can participate. Acoustic reflex testing is often employed in evaluating adults and older children, although it is not frequently used to evaluate newborns and young children.
