The maximum safe dose of pegfilgrastim has not been established. The highest dose studied in clinical trials has been 300 mcg/kg. There have been instances of accidental overdoses occurring in patients. In one such case, the patient was a 79-year-old male who self-administered pegfilgrastim for eight days in a row. He experienced no symptoms during this time but was monitored closely by his doctor three times a week, during which he only complained of bone pain. In another overdose case, the patient was a 69-year-old male who self-administered a 36 mg overdose of pegfilgrastim. He was admitted to the hospital, where clinical staff observed leukocytosis, bone pain, and rhinorrhea. Due to the current lack of appropriate treatment for pegfilgrastim overdose, the best course of action for overdose is prevention, by vigilant monitoring for signs and symptoms of toxicity.
