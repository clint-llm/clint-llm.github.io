An interdisciplinary approach is needed to manage complex conditions like cervical discogenic pain syndrome. An interprofessional team, including a physiatrist, pain specialist, physical therapist, primary care provider, along with other healthcare professionals, can help to enhance patient-centered care. Primary care providers are the base of support. They provide initial education to patients and their families about their diagnosis. Education can lead to early conservative intervention to resolve pain. A physiatrist can help guide and manage therapies administered by physical therapists and can communicate with pain specialists and surgeons for patients with refractory pain for further intervention.
