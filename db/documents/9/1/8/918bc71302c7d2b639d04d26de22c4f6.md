The measurement of BNP and NT-pro-BNP are both accepted assays for the diagnosis and management of heart failure. This test is via a standard blood draw.

An assay for the mid-regional pro-ANP (MR-pro-ANP) is available and appears to have utility in the diagnosis and management of heart failure since it is more stable than ANP.
