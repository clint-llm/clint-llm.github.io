All patients suspected of possible phenytoin overdose should be evaluated with a broad differential in mind. Fingerstick glucose should be obtained on all patient as well as a pregnancy test on all female patient of child-bearing age. An ECG is recommended on all suspected phenytoin overdose patients, especially patients that have received parenteral phenytoin. Laboratory work should be obtained including a complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), liver function test (LFT), total serum phenytoin concentration, and serum albumin. Urine toxicology, as well as acetaminophen, salicylic acid, and alcohol levels, should also be obtained to complete the toxicologic workup.
