As social and highly developed mammals, humans communicate through numerous means to convey information such as speech, written word or symbols, touch, and gesture. A key gesture for visual and spoken communication is through facial expression. Since birth, a human begins to convey thoughts and feelings by any range of universal facial expressions (e.g., smiles and frowns). These expressions are expressed worldwide, across all races and overcome language barriers. As such, the organs through which humans communicate visual expression are a finely coordinated neuromuscular complex. The platysma is often an overlooked muscle of facial expression due to its location on the neck, but it contributes nonetheless.
