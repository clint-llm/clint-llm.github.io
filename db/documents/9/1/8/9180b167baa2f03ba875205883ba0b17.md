The various tests included under pretransfusion testing are mostly serological, with some assistance from molecular methods in rare instances. The methods available for serological testing are based on test tube methods, column agglutination (CAT), or solid phase. The principle involved is the detection of antigen and antibody reactions by observation of agglutination or hemolysis in vitro.

The AHG (antihuman globulin) phase detects the red cell antibodies, usually IgG in nature, that do not produce direct agglutination by bridging red cells to complete the microscopically detectable lattice. These AHG reagents are usually IgM antibodies directed against the Fc portion of those IgG molecules.
