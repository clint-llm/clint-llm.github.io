As severe TBI is a progressive and complex entity with significant morbidity and mortality,Â  it is important that hospitals have protocols in place regarding initial and continuing evaluation and management of these patients. Such protocols should involve physicians, nurses, and other staff in the departments of the emergency department, trauma surgery, neurosurgery, and neurology. Pharmacists, case managers, social workers, physical and occupational therapists, and ethics teams may also have vital roles in both the inpatient and outpatient care of these patients, and they should be involved in treatment and care planning as early as possible.
