Patients undergoing splenectomy need to be vaccinated against encapsulated organisms. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae are the three most common organisms that patients are at risk for developing an overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI). The overall lifetime risk for developing OPSI is approximately 5%, with mortality reaching up to 50%.

Patients typically present with nonspecific symptoms, which include fatigue, muscle aches, vomiting. Following, patients deteriorate within hours. Patients undergoing elective splenectomy should receive vaccinations against these organisms approximately two weeks prior to surgery to allow an adequate immune response. Patients who undergo splenectomy for traumatic injuries should receive vaccination approximately two weeks after surgery. However, individuals often receive vaccines prior to discharge due to noncompliance and loss of follow-up in this patient population.
