In addition to the complications associated with ESRD, each form of this disease has certain complications that should be addressed as well to improve the patient quality of life as the following:

- ADTKD-UMOD is associated with hyperuricemia and gout

- ADTKD-REN is associated with hypo-proliferative anemia, hyperuricemia, mild hypotension, mild hyperkalemia

- ADTKD-HNF1B is associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young, abnormal liver function test of unclear etiology, genito-urinary tract malformations, hyperuricemia with gout, and hypomagnesemia

- ADTKD-SEC61A1 is associated with anemia and neutropenia with abscess formation
