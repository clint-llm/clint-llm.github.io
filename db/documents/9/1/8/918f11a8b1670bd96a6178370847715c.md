The evaluation of the neonate with jaundice starts with a detailed history, including birth history, family history, the onset of jaundice, and maternal serologies. Color of stool and urine presence of pruritis should be assessed for infants evaluated for jaundice and may provide a clue to the type of jaundice. The American Academy recommends universal screening of all newborns for jaundice and identifying risk factors for developing severe hyperbilirubinemia.

To assess for jaundice, newborns should ideally be examined in daylight. However, the clinical assessment may be unreliable, especially if a newborn has received phototherapy or has dark skin.
