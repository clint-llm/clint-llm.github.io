Most children who have swallowed a foreign body do not require invasive treatment. Asymptomatic, previously healthy children who have swallowed low-risk foreign bodies typically will do well. Patients/caregivers should be instructed on the signs and symptoms of subsequent potential complications.

Foreign bodies that are lodged in the esophagus are most commonly removed endoscopically.

Medical management of foreign body ingestion is not recommended. Emetics, muscle relaxants, and meat tenderizers are typically ineffective, and are potentially dangerous, in the treatment of children with esophageal foreign bodies.
