In addition to managing the underlying cause, prenatal management includes weekly maximum vertical pocket measurements and nonstress tests, which have demonstrated to decrease the occurrence of unexplained fetal death. Fetal growth should undergo serial assessment. Maternal hydration status also plays a vital role in management, particularly in cases of isolated oligohydramnios in the third trimester.

Although there is some controversy surrounding the timing of delivery in cases of isolated oligohydramnios, the current recommendations support delivery at 37 weeks gestation, assuming membranes remain intact.
