Of all cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis, only 6.3% are from ICVT, and ICVT accounts for less than 1% of all cerebral infarctions. One systematic review of 47 case reports/case series found that the mean age of diagnosed patients was 41and 68% of these patients are women.

In general, cortical vein thrombosis, isolated cortical vein thrombosis, and cerebral venous thrombosis affect patients younger on average than patients diagnosed with arterial strokes. Women are also at a higher risk than men.
