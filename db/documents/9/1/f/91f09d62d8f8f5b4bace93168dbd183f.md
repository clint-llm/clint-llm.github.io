The SIA typically perfuses the 1 and 2 intercostal spaces, which can become clinically significant if the internal thoracic or anterior intercostal arteries become compromised. Additionally, in cases of coarctation of the aorta, the SIAs may give rise to mediastinal collateral arteries that bypass the coarctation and help to supply arterial flow to the descending aorta. The anterior intercostal arteries also serve to provide collateral flow to the descending aorta in cases of coarctation.
