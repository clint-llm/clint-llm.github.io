The history and physical examination give a lot of clues in identifying a person with prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis, which is caused by decreased renal perfusion. Events such as diarrhea, vomiting, sepsis, dehydration, or bleeding that leads to tissue hypoxia can indicate a risk of acute tubular necrosis. Hospitalized patients with events such as hypotension, sepsis, intraoperative events, use of nephrotoxic agents such as radiocontrast media or nephrotoxic antibiotics help in identifying the clinical picture causing AKI and acute tubular necrosis.

Physical findings such as tachycardia, dry mucous membrane, decreased skin turgor, and cool extremities are findings that can be present in patients with volume depletion and hypotension. Fever and hypotension are common manifestations of sepsis. Muscle tenderness is present in the setting of rhabdomyolysis. Intraabdominal hypertension that causes abdominal distension due to abdominal compartment syndrome also impedes renal perfusion and raises the concern for acute tubular necrosis.
