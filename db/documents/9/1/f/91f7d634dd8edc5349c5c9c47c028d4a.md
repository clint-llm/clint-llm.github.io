Exenatide is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any component of the drug or formulation.

This medication should not be used for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis or in type 1 diabetic patients. Exenatide is not recommended for use in end-stage renal disease or severe renal impairment (CrCl less than 30 mL/min).Â There is inadequate evidence to support the use of exenatide in patients who are pregnant. Use during pregnancy should be limited to cases where the risk outweighs the benefit. There also is no evidence to support the safety or efficacy of exenatide in pediatric patients.

Patients with a history of pancreatitis should avoid the use of exenatide. Avoid using exenatide in patients with a personal or familial history of medullary thyroid carcinoma. The extended-release formulation of exenatide has a black box warning concerning medullary thyroid carcinoma since treatment in mice has resulted in tumor formation. It is currently unknown if exenatide results in the same outcome in humans. Therefore, patients should receive counsel on the symptoms of thyroid tumors, including but not limited to a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, or persistent hoarseness.

Due to the prevalence of gastrointestinal adverse events, the recommendation is that patients with severe gastrointestinal disease avoid using this medication.
