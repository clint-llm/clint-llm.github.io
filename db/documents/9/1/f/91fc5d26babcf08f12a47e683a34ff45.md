Managing decubitus ulcers should always be done with an interprofessional approach. Usually, a general surgery consultation is necessary for patients with sacral decubitus ulcers, especially for those with deep ulcers. A wound care specialist or a dermatologist is involved in non-healing ulcers. If any associated medical conditions affect the wound healing process, an internal medicine specialist should have involvement in the management of the case. Patients who have contractures or have spastic paralysis have regular physiotherapies.
