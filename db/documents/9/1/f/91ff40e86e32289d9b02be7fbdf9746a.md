Pneumonia is the most frequent cause of parapneumonic effusions and empyema thoracis. Empyema may result as a complication of cardiothoracic surgery. Trauma can also lead to infection of the pleural space. The infecting organism may have spread from blood or other organs into the pleural space.

Both viruses and bacteria can cause parapneumonic effusions, but it is the latter that is the most common cause of empyema thoracis.

**Risk Factors**

There are risk factors for empyema like age and comorbidities such as diabetes, alcoholism, GERD, advanced age and repeated hospitalization for pneumonia.

**Bacteriology**

Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus are responsible for about 70% of aerobic gram-positive cultures. Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Haemophilus species are the commonest in gram-negative culture. Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus species are the commonest anaerobic organisms. In empyema thoracis associated with aspiration pneumonia mixed bacterial florae containing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria are common. The common organism in cases of empyema thoracis complicating surgery is S. aureus.

A very common cause of infection of the chest cavity is trauma. Any hemothorax that is not adequately evacuated can result in an empyema. Other causes include mediastinitis, ruptured esophagus, pericarditis, pancreatitis, and subdiaphragmatic abscesses.
