There are several reasons behind cerebellar dysfunction. An etiological evaluation is necessary for the diagnosis of cerebellar dysfunction and treatment. Cerebellar dysfunction has a tremendous impact on patients, especially on the quality of life, gait and balance problems, morbidity, and mortality. The role of rehabilitative strategies is critical for most underlying etiologies. A collaborative multidisciplinary approach can provide comprehensive patient care, enhance team performance, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
