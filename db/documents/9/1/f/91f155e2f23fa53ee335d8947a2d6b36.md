The pathophysiology underlying postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome is heterogeneous, encompassing excess sympathetic tone, impaired peripheral autonomic function, volume dysregulation, cardiovascular deconditioning, and autoimmune dysfunction.

The mechanisms as mentioned earlier are not mutually exclusive but instead overlap in a complex interaction of cause and effect. Affected physiologic systems include neuropathic, cardiovascular, renal, immune, and hematologic; this widespread implication of complex systems have added a certain degree of difficulty in constructing a comprehensive framework in the understanding of POTS. Common symptoms include chronic fatigue, dizziness, sleep disturbance, headache, tremors, tachycardia, anxiety, depression, gastrointestinal disturbances, syncope, and vision changes.
