Rituximab is a relatively safe and well-tolerated drug, and its off-label use has increased dramatically over the years. Patients should be well educated about the benefits and risks of rituximab therapy.

Hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) are commonly seen with rituximab infusions. These can be reduced through premedication and titrated infusions. Priming the IV line with rituximab can have a positive impact. Reducing the HSR rate can reduce the cost for cancer centers, improve patient safety and satisfaction, and prevent delays in treatment. Nurses have a key role to play as members of the multidisciplinary team involved in the care of these patients. Care should be coordinated between the oncologist, nurses, and pharmacists.

Recent evidence has shown a comparable clinical efficacy of subcutaneous and IV rituximab. SC rituximab allows faster delivery of the drug, reduced dosage errors, and drug wastage. Faster delivery time allows more patients to be scheduled. Cancer centers should consider the subcutaneous route for most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma, and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. The subcutaneous route could also be an alternative for patients with poor IV access.
