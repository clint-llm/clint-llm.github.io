The vascular supply to the tibialis posterior is predominantly via the posterior tibial artery, which arises from the popliteal artery. The popliteal artery courses posterior to the knee and primarily splits into the anterior tibial and posterior tibial arteries.

The posterior tibial artery courses in the deep posterior compartment of the lower leg, deep to the soleus, and superficial to the deep muscles, including the tibialis posterior. The posterior tibial artery, which gives off the fibular (peroneal) artery, continues inferiorly through the posterior compartment of the lower leg. It supplies muscular branches to all of the muscles in the posterior compartment, including the posterior tibialis muscle. The posterior tibial artery then continues to the foot behind the medial malleolus along with the tibialis posterior tendon, flexor digitorum longus tendons, tibial nerve, and flexor hallucis longus.

The posterior tibial artery gives off the fibular (peroneal) artery, which courses deep to the flexorÂ hallucis longus and gives off muscular branches to supply some of the posterior compartment before entering its primary destination, the lateral compartment of the lower leg.
