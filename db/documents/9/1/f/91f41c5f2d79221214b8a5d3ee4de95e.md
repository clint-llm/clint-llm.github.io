**Factors Affecting Gait Pattern and Analysis**

Gait is a biological characteristic of a person, and the gait pattern is simply the manner or style in which a person usually walks. It is highly influenced by many factors (internal as well as external). Walking is often not a conscious behavior and can be used for differentiation if not for identification. Some of the factors that tend to affect the gait and hence the forensic gait analysis are as follows:

- **Footwear:**It causes gait pattern variability. Some footwears can cause increased hip movement, which results in long stride length, while some may reduce the stride length.

- **Fatigue:**Fatigue causes depletion of energy, which affects the gait cycle, thus influencing the gait pattern. The speed of walking also decreases when the person is low on energy.

- **Use of knee brace:**The use of a knee brace also affects the gait of a person.

- **Sex:**Studies have revealed that the sex of a person can be assessed from the gait pattern, which supports that sex affects the gait pattern.

- **Speed:**The gait pattern shows changes between the normal walking pattern and the person's running pattern.

- **Disease/disorders/medical conditions:**This is one of the common factors affecting a person's gait. A typical and at time-specific gait pattern in the person suffering from such condition is evident, e.g., Parkinsonian/Parkinson's gait in Parkinson's disease.

- **Directed gait:**Directional gait is walking under the instruction. For example, in marching, everyone shows a similar gait.

- **Age:**Age is one of the factors which influence the gait pattern. Walking depends on muscle strength, which gradually changes as the person grown up. The variations in muscle strength affect gait.

- **First trimester during pregnancy:**It is believed that during pregnancy, the gait pattern shows changes. A study has shown that foot angle exhibits changes during the first trimester of the pregnancy.

- **Location:**The location where the person is walking also affects the gait because when a person walks on a surface different than usual, he or she will focus on the walking, which makes him conscious and will affect the walking pattern.

- **Camera:**The type of camera used is also shown to affect gait analysis. The angle and positioning of the camera are also found to be crucial. The quality of recording received for comparison, if not clear, may result in misinterpretation or inconclusive results.

- **Lighting conditions:**The angle of light, the direction of light, the direction of movement of the person also affects gait pattern analysis.

Including the factors mentioned above, a few more can affect an individual's walking pattern, such as emotional mind state, music, talking, load carriage, attire, etc.
