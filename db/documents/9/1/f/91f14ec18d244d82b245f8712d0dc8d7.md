There are a few contraindications to performing tympanocentesis, and they are as follows:

- Uncooperative patient: Tympanocentesis is a relatively safe procedure; however, absolute patient cooperation is required to achieve its purpose, either diagnostic or therapeutic.

- A patient with an intact tympanostomy tube.

- An intratympanic tumor: Patients with intratympanic tumors such as globus tympanicum, facial neuromas, and meningiomas should not have tympanocentesis performed on them.

- Acute otitis externa: This is a relative contraindication for tympanocentesis.

- Vascular Abnormalities: Patients with vascular abnormalities such as a known anomaly of the jugular bulb should not have tympanocentesis.

- Suboptimal visibility of the important landmarks and the tympanic membrane is also a contr indication for tympanocentesis.
