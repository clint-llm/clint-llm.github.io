To ensure the patient receives optimal care, it is absolutely essential that every member of the care team document and communicate all interventions made. This will enable trauma surgery, burn surgery, and emergency department teams to access all the necessary information when the patient arrives at a certified burn center. A team of nurses must be present to assist with Foley and intravenous catheters, while trained personnel will handle central and arterial catheter placement as required. It is crucial to document hourly all administered fluids, vital signs, and urine output, with any significant changes reported to both critical care and burn providers. This regular update schedule must be followed to empower interprofessional teams to make informed decisions and prevent complications related to inappropriate fluid resuscitation.
