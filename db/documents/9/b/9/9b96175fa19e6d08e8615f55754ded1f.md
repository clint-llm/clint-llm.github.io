Appendicitis is probably the most well-known misdiagnosis of patients with Y. enterocolitica infections, thus the term pseudoappendicitis. Other differential diagnoses to rule out would be inflammatory bowel disease, Meckel's diverticulitis, mesenteric lymphadenitis, ischemic colitis, and sigmoid diverticulitis. There are many infective causes of similar symptoms that must be ruled out. These include various parasitic infections, Giardiasis, salmonellosis, shigellosis, and Clostridium difficile colitis.
