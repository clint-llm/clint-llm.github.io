Pseudotumor cerebri/idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a disease that can beÂ missed or misdiagnosed given its overlapping features with many other disease processes. Therefore, it is essential for the diagnosing physician to work closely with neurology, ophthalmology, and radiology to provide patient-centered, evidence-based care. Nurses should be aware of pupillary changes that often occur with an elevation of intracranial pressure - a prompt referral to a neurologist/neurosurgeon is necessary when the patient has unequal pupils, papilledema and/or focal neurological deficits.
