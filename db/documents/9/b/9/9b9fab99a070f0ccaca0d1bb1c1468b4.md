# Continuing Education Activity

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disease involving surfactant accumulation within the alveoli resulting from decreased clearance, rather than increased production. This condition can be congenital, secondary, or autoimmune. Autoimmune PAP is the most common pathophysiologic mechanism accounting for 90 percent of documented cases. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and complications of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and addresses the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. 
- Describe the presenting features of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. 
- Describe the evaluation of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. 
- Describe how enhanced coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid recognition of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and subsequently improve the evaluation, enhancing detection of pathology and allowing for treatment when indicated.

# Introduction

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) was first described in 1958 by Samuel H. Rosen et al.

# Etiology

Autoimmune PAP is a direct consequence of antibodies against GM-CSF

Secondary PAP is caused by any disease that reduces the functionally effective alveolar macrophage population

Hereditary dysfunction in one of many proteins responsible for surfactant regulation causes Congenital PAP

# Epidemiology

PAP is a rare lung disease

In autoimmune PAP, males are more commonly affected than females at a 2:1 ratio

Secondary PAP has been reported with a slightly younger median age at time-of-diagnosis; 37 years to 45 years

# Pathophysiology

**Surfactant**

Surfactant is a key component within alveoli that prevents end-expiratory collapse by decreasing alveolar surface tension at the air-liquid interface SFTPA, SFTPB, SFTPC, and SFPTD

**GM-CSF**

GM-CSF is a crucial cytokine involved in host defense of pulmonary bacterial, viral, and fungal infections

In 1994, researchers discovered that GM-CSF is important in the pathophysiology of PAP when GM-CSF knock-out mice demonstrated PAP-like disease

**Autoimmune PAP**

GM-CSF levels are normal in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in autoimmune PAP

**Secondary PAP**

In secondary PAP, it is believed that the underlying hematological disease causes either a reduction in the number of alveolar macrophages or a reduction in the functional quality of these macrophages

**Congenital PAP**

In congenital PAP, surfactant accumulation is a consequence of a genetic mutation resulting in dysfunctional GM-CSF receptor activation CSF2RA and CSF2RB respectively CSF2RA have been reported in young children (newborn to 9 years) with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance CSF2RB are less common and have been reported from newborns up to 36 years old SLC7A7 mutations lead to dysfunctional arginine transport and dysfunctional alveolar macrophages SLC7A7 is a target of GM-CSF, which upregulates it, the GM-CSF pathway does not seem to be altered in this disease or lead to PAP

Whatever the inciting factor, all of these pathways lead to the same end: accumulation of lipoproteinaceous material in the alveoli due to dysfunctional clearance by alveolar macrophages or type II epithelial cells.

# Histopathology

The initial gross description of lungs from PAP patients during autopsy revealed multiple yellow-grey nodules measuring from a few millimeters to 2 centimeters throughout the lung

# History and Physical

Clinical presentation of PAP varies from indolent to emergent and symptoms are often non-specific

A majority of patients are smokers (53% to 85%)

# Evaluation

Given that the clinical presentation of PAP is nonspecific, diagnosis of this disease demands appropriate serological, radiological, and bronchoscopic evaluation.

**Radiography**

Chest radiography may demonstrate bilateral alveolar opacities in a peri-hilar and basilar distribution without air-bronchograms

**Biomarkers**

Several biomarkers have been studied in PAP, including surfactant protein A, B, and D levels, cytokeratin 19, serum carcinoembryonic antigen, serum lactate dehydrogenase, GM-CSF levels, anti-GM-CSF antibodies, and KL-6

**Pulmonary Function Testing**

Pulmonary function testing is not necessary for diagnosis, nor is it specific for PAP; however, the most common pattern on spirometry is a restrictive pattern

**Bronchoscopy**

When PAP is suspected, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage is the gold standard for diagnosis

**Lung Biopsy**

Biopsies are not necessary for a diagnosis of PAP but can be helpful

# Treatment / Management

**Whole Lung Lavage**

The current standard of care for autoimmune PAP is whole lung lavage (WLL)

**GM-CSF Replacement Therapy**

Clinical trials for GM-CSF replacement therapy were performed in the late 1990s

**Immunomodulation Therapy**

Systemic corticosteroids were trialed in autoimmune PAP but were ineffective, and they were found to increase the risk of pulmonary infections

**Secondary PAP**

The only proven therapy for secondary PAP is the treatment of the underlying disease

**Congenital PAP**

WLL may benefit patients with congenital PAP, but is not curative

# Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis includes diseases that share restrictive physiology and diffuse interstitial changes on computed tomography. Although a “crazy paving” pattern on computed tomography is suggestive of PAP, it can also be associated with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, alveolar hemorrhage, lipoid pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia, pneumocystis pneumonia, radiation pneumonitis, drug-induced pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, non-specific interstitial pneumonitis, or bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. Acute silicosis can present with the same clinical and pathologic findings as PAP. Acute silicosis can display radiographic “crazy paving,” milky BALF with foamy macrophages, and PAS-positive amorphous material within the alveolus on biopsy. The similarities between acute silicosis and PAP emphasize the importance of a thorough occupational history for recent silica exposure.

# Prognosis

Disease course varies, and the prognosis is unpredictable. When treated with whole lung lavage, the 5-year survival of autoimmune PAP is 95%

# Complications

Patients with PAP are at an increased risk of developing an opportunistic infection with approximately 5% of PAP patients developing one Nocardia and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are the 2 most commonly reported opportunistic infections in PAP Histoplasma, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Blastomyces Acinetobacter, Coccidiodies, Mucorales, and Streptomyces

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis is a rare disease that is difficult to diagnose and treat. an interprofessional team effort of specialty trained clinicians and nurses is required to successfully provide the best care for these patients. [Level V]
