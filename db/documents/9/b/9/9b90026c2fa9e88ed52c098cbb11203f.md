Angioedemaâ€™s underlying pathophysiology involves increases in vascular permeability and vasodilation that is histamine, bradykinin or complement-mediated, resulting in fluid extravasation into interstitial tissues. Active C1-INH is decreased through catabolism or binding that renders it inactive. The decrease of C1-INH causes deregulation of the complement pathway, leading to increased vascular permeability, mast cell degranulation, and increased bradykinin levels. Neutralizing autoantibodies to C1-INH are present in the majority of patients.
