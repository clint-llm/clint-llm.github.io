**Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Carpal Tunnel Release**

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a clinical condition that occurs secondary to a compression neuropathy affecting the median nerve as it transitions from the forearm to the hand via the carpal tunnel.  In refractory cases that have failed nonoperative treatment/management, a carpal tunnel release is performed. The majority of carpal tunnel releases are performed with an open surgical approach, although the endoscopic procedure has been somewhat increasing in popularity but remains controversial.

**Technique
**

Landmarks are identified and marked with a skin marker. A longitudinal incision is made with the distal extent marked by the intersection of Kaplan’s cardinal line and the radial border of the fourth digit. The incision extends proximally and just distal to the wrist crease.

The dissection is carried down through the subcutaneous tissue and palmar fascia to expose the transverse carpal ligament (TCL). The palmaris brevis muscle typically lies directly on top of the TCL. Incise and feather the palmaris brevis muscle. Utilizing a combination of self-retaining and manual blunt retractors/elevators, expose the TCL for meticulous incision.

The ulnar aspect of the TCL, just radial to the hook of the hamate, is sharply incised both proximally and distally. Care is taken to protect the median nerve. Release the distal forearm fascia proximally as this can be a secondary site of compression. Assess the median nerve before closure.

Use 3-0 nylon to close the skin and dress the wound in a soft dressing. After the procedure, the patient is encouraged to elevate the wrist to reduce swelling. Pain, swelling, and stiffness is a common post-procedure, and wrist soreness may last from weeks to months. Complications are rare but include the standard complications of bleeding, infection, and nerve injury.

**Other Wrist Reconstruction Procedures**

Other reconstructive procedures are considered in the setting of various clinical conditions and complex deformities. These conditions include but are not limited to:

- Scaphoid lunate advanced collapse (SLAC)

- Scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse (SNAC)

- Other degenerative wrist conditions

- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Pisotriquetral arthritis
- DRUJ abutment/arthrosis

Procedures utilized in the appropriate clinical setting include:

- Proximal row carpectomy (PRC)

- Scaphoid excision and 4 corner fusion

- Total wrist fusion

- Total wrist replacement
