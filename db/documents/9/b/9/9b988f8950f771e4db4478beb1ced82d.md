No absolute contraindications exist to the use of tetracaine, aside from prior evidence of severe allergic response. Relative contraindication to use is the previous administration of a local anesthetic. One should carefully note when a patient has received such medications as in cases of postoperative pain relief when local anesthetic infiltrate has been used concerning the duration of the effect of different agents. Since the advent ofÂ liposomal bupivacaine, which may exercise its effect for up to 72 hours, it bears mention that concurrently administered local anesthetics may combine to precipitate toxic symptoms.
