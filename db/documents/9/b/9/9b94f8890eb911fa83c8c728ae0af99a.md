There is not a minimum toxic dose listed. It is advisable, to begin with, the therapeutic dose and to monitor patient response carefully. There is not enough research to verify the efficacy or safety of abciximab use in pediatric patients.

Approximately 5% of those treated with abciximab will develop bleeding, but due to inpatient administration, an overdose is highly unlikely. There have been several case reports describing gastrointestinal bleeding and thrombocytopenia as adverse effects.Â  Bleeding at infusion sites is the most common adverse effect and would likely worsen at toxic concentrations. Infusion with COX inhibitors or other antiplatelet drugs increases the risk of toxicity and adverse effects.

In the event of toxicity or adverse effects, transfuse the patient with platelets with severe thrombocytopenia. If the patient becomes hypotensive, deliver a fluid bolus.

No antidote exists for reversing abciximab.

Hemodialysis may be useful to remove toxic concentrations of the drug successfully.

Toxic/adverse effects of abciximab are quality for admission criteria due to the need for continuous monitoring of hematologic stability.

Important questions and considerations to ask about or explain to the patient before use include:

- Has the patient used any anticoagulants in the last seven days

- Information about treatments if bleeding occurs

- Information about monitoring for lab abnormalities

- Importance of rest after the infusion

- Instruction to avoid bruises and lacerations after the infusion

- Instruction to return to the hospital with any new signs of bleeding or syncope
