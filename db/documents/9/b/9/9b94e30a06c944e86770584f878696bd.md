Myocardial stunning does not usually require any treatment. However, if severe myocardial dysfunction presents, temporary inotrope use would be indicated.

Nisoldipine as a calcium antagonist has been recommended to improve the functional recovery of reperfused myocardium only when given before ischemia.

The observation that marked reduction of free radical generation and contractile function by antioxidant therapy began at the time of reperfusion supports the concept that myocardial stunning is a manifestation of reperfusion injury.

Treatment of hibernating myocardial is to reperfuse the hypoperfused myocardium with blood. Hibernating myocardium has abnormal wall motion which normalizes after nitrates, inotropes, PESP (post-extra-systolic potentiation), PTCA (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) and CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting).
