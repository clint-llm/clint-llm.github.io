According to DSM-5, a complication associated with drug use is an increased riskÂ for infectious diseases. Screening tests for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses are positive in approximately 80% to 90% of injection opioid users. HIV is also positive for many injection drug users. HIV rates have been reported as high as 60%, specifically for opioid users in some parts of the United States and the Russian Federation, but it might be low at 10% in other areas.Clostridium botulinum, although rare, are serious complications of injection opioid users. Tuberculosis is also a serious problem with injection drug users, especially heroin drug users. Infection is usually asymptomatic and usually indicated by a positive tuberculin skin test. Users who snort heroin or other opioids develop irritation of the nasal mucosa, which can sometimes lead to perforation of the nasal septum. Sexual side effects are also common. Male opioid drug users often experience erectile dysfunction, and females have disturbances in menses and irregular reproduction. Physiological disturbances and low birth weight can also be seen in infants born to women who use opioids.
