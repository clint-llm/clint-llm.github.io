The goal of audiogram interpretation is to determine the type and degree of a patient’s hearing loss.

**Summary of Hearing Loss Categories**

The three types of hearing loss are sensorineural (SNHL), conductive (CHL), and mixed (MHL) hearing loss.

In sensorineural hearing loss, the hearing loss occurs due to damage to the inner ear and CNS higher auditory pathways and tends to be permanent but may be reversible in some situations. On an audiogram, pure SNHL is indicated by overlapping of the lines representing air conduction and bone conduction without the presence of any air-bone gaps >10 dB HL. SNHL may occur with processes such as inner ear (sensory) or vestibulocochlear nerve (neural) pathology, which is seen with presbycusis, noise exposure, infection, Ménière’s disease, aminoglycoside toxicity, and vestibular schwannoma, among many others.

Conductive hearing loss occurs due to abnormal transmission of sound through the outer or middle ear without damage to the inner ear. An air-bone gap is noted on the audiogram, which is present when the difference between air conduction and bone conduction thresholds at a specific frequency is greater than 15 dB HL. With a pure CHL, the bone conduction thresholds should be normal, but the air conduction thresholds indicate hearing loss. CHL may occur due to cerumen impaction, otitis media, tympanic membrane perforation, ossicular disruption, and a foreign body in the ear, among other causes.

Finally, mixed hearing loss is a combination of SNHL and CHL, meaning there is abnormal sound conduction and damage to the inner ear and/or retrocochlear structures. This type of hearing loss presents on an audiogram as both a decrease in the bone line as well as an air-bone gap. Mixed hearing loss results from many different pathologies, including otosclerosis, a disease in which both the ossicles (CHL) and the inner ear (SNHL) are affected due to abnormal bone growth.
