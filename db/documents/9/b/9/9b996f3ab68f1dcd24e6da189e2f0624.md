A non-contrast CT head remains the gold-standard imaging modality in the initial diagnosis of ICH, as it is easily accessible and fast.

Acute ICH is noted on CT of the head as an area of hyperdensity within the parenchyma, with surrounding hypodensity, which would indicate perivascular edema. Approximate volumes of the clot can be calculated by multiplying the maximum depth, height, and length of the clot in centimeters and dividing this by two.

As clot expansion and rebleeding is a major immediate risk in ICH affecting up to 38% of patients with ICH

Vascular lesions causing the ICH is most often suspected in young patients with risk factors, but radiological hints include the presence of SAH, calcification within the hematoma (hyperdense on CT), hematoma shape, and its location to major territorial vessels.
