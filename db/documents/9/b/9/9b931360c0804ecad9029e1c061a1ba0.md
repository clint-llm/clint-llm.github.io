Since this disease is caused by GBCAs exposure in patients with severe renal impairment, optimization of the medical therapy could slow down the progression to end-stage kidney disease, especially after an acute kidney injury. Patients with this condition should be informed that there are no proven treatments that could cure the nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), and the current therapies could only relieve some symptoms. However, if the disease progresses and visceral fibrosis develops, medication adherence may improve the patients' quality of life.

For patients with severe kidney disease, health care providers should discuss and guide patients on the potential risks of GBCAs. Providers should discuss the MRI study's risks and benefits over the alternative use of contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scan, producing a loss of residual renal function and precipitating dialysis initiation.
