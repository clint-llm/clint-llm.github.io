A prospective study of 51 pediatric patients at a poison-control center proposed that less than 250 mg/kg of amoxicillin overdosages are not associated with significant clinical symptoms(Product labeling FDA).

**Clinical Features**

- Interstitial nephritis resulting in oliguric renal failure has been reported in a small number of patients after overdosage with amoxicillin.

- Crystalluria leading to renal failure has been reported after amoxicillin overdosage in adult and pediatric patients.

**Management**

- In case of overdose, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically.

- Maintain airway, breathing, and circulation.

- Clinicians should ensure adequate fluid intake to reduce the risk of amoxicillin crystalluria.

- Renal impairment appears to be reversible with the cessation of drug administration.

- Amoxicillin may be removed from circulation by hemodialysis.
