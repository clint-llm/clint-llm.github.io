Melanocytes are special dendritic cells derived from the neural crest that has the ability to spread over the entire surface of the body. This spreading ability could help account for melanoma’s ability to metastasize across tissue plains and through blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics. This metastatic passport helps make melanoma more lethal than other skin cancers that are limited to adjacent spread. Although the foot receives less solar exposure, pedal melanoma is more lethal than even more proximal thigh melanoma. Although the 5-year survival rate for melanoma of the calf is 94%, the 5-year survival rate for foot melanoma is 77%. Acral melanoma has a significantly poorer prognosis than the other subtypes of melanomas.
