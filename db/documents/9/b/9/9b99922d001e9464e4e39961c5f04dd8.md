Injury to the greater petrosal nerve from surgery, tumors, or skull fractures can result in ipsilateral xerotic keratitis due to decreased lacrimation, which increases the risk of corneal dryness and xerophthalmia, corneal ulceration, or corneal infection.

Degeneration of the greater petrosal nerve from facial nerve lesions at or before the geniculate ganglion may cause the lesser petrosal nerve to develop parasympathetic collaterals to the lacrimal glands. The lesser petrosal contributes parasympathetic fibers to the parotid gland to aid in salivation; thus, with these collaterals, there will be simultaneous lacrimation on salivation.

Cluster headaches with parasympathetic dysfunction involving the greater petrosal nerve have been described. These include Horton headaches and Sluder neuralgia that present with nasal secretions/rhinorrhea, mucosal congestion, and hyperlacrimation.

Tumors of the nerve, albeit rare, have also been reported. These include schwannomas, which present with xerophthalmia, facial paralysis and conductive hearing losses, and neuromas.
