An interprofessional approach to suprapubic catheters

Suprapubic catheterizationÂ is sometimes needed when drainage via the urethra is not possible. While the procedure is usually performed by a urologist, the nurse is usually in charge of monitoring the catheter and the urine output. Nurses need to know the potential complications of this procedure such as bowel injury and must regularly examine the abdomen. In addition, the patient needs to be monitored for signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Patients who are confused may pull and try to remove their suprapubic or urethral catheters. Techniques and methods to secure catheters from such attempts are well described elsewhere.
