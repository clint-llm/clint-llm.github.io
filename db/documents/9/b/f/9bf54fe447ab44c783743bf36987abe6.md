The most common complications of inflammatory breast cancer are from local and distant metastasis. They include severe pain, including bone and nerve pain. Metastasis to the bone can also lead to hypercalcemia resulting in kidney stones, neurological complications like confusion, coma, memory problems, and arrhythmias. About half of the patients with metastatic breast cancer have liver lesions. It can cause significant abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. As the disease progresses, the patient will have a poor appetite and weight loss. Metastasis to the brain may affect vision, behavioral and memory problems and causes progressive worsening headache.

Chemotherapy related complications include oral ulcers, nausea, and diarrhea. Surgery-related complications include risk of surgery, risk of anesthesia, infection, poor healing, and cosmetic appearance. Lymphedema is a dreadful complication of axillary lymph node dissection. Radiation therapy can cause severe pain and scarring.

Inflammatory breast cancer causes significant stress on the social and economic life of the patient and their families.
