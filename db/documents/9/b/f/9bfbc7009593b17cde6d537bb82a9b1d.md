The lens is a transparent structure made up of fibers (modified epithelial cells) enclosed in a membranous structure called lens capsule. Lens matter consists of two main parts:

- Cortex (superficial part) - containing younger fibers

- Nucleus (deeper part) - containing older fibers

Many degenerative processes denature and coagulate lens proteins present in lens fibers by different mechanisms, which result in loss of transparency and, ultimately, cataract formation.

- Disturbances occurring at any level of lens growth (congenital cataract)

- Fibrous metaplasia of lens epithelium (subcapsular cataract)

- Cortical hydration between lens fibers (cortical cataract)

- Deposition of certain pigments, i.e., urochrome (nuclear cataract)

All these processes ultimately lead to an opaque lens behind the pupil, making it extremely difficult for the patient to carry on with routine activities.
