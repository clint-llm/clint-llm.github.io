Patients with bowel necrosis can present with a variety of symptoms secondary to the underlying etiology of their disease, varying from severe abdominal pain to altered mental status and septic shock. The differential should include sources of infection such as pyelonephritis, cholangitis, diverticulitis, causes of shock including septic, cardiogenic, hemorrhagic, and distributive as well as causes of bowel necrosis such as acute versus chronic ischemia, perforation, thrombotic emboli, and obstruction.
