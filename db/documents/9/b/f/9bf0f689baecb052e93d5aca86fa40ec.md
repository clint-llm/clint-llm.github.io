Conventional pulse oximeters diagnose hypoxia. However, recent developments in certain pulse oximeters now can also assess other parameters such methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin levels, total hemoglobin, and even oxygen levels above 100% saturation. With the display of the pulse wave activity parameters, volume status in intubated patients, as well as respiratory rate, can be displayed in certain pulse oximeters by looking at the pulse pressure variation with the respiratory cycles

The use of an index of perfusion has been used to diagnose the success of increased blood flow after sympathectomy.
