Systemic corticosteroids, which are the backbone of pemphigus vulgaris treatment, are well known for causing osteoporosis and other complications. Corticosteroids have been reported to cause fractures in 30 to 50% and cause osteonecrosis in 9 to 40% of patients receiving long-term therapy.

A case-control study by Namazi et al. looked at the incidence of P-wave dispersion (PWD) in patients with PV. The authors reasoned that atrial fibrillation can be predicted by the presence of PWD and hypothesized that atrial fibrillation might be higher in PV patients. Patients were excluded if they had obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiopulmonary disease. The authors stated the limitations of their study included a small sample size of 90 patients, and the use of corticosteroids was higher in the patients with PV. Regardless of those limitations, the incidence of PWD confirmed by electrocardiogram (ECG) was higher in the PV group than in the control group.
