The pathophysiology of this condition is one of neurological insult. For there to be signs and symptoms,Â first, there must be enough injury to the nerves. Seddon and Sunderland developed one way to understand this nerve compromise by examining the injury micro and macroscopically. Nerve compromise has 3 main categories; neurapraxia, axonotmesis, and neurotmesis. During the neurapraxia state, there is no macroscopic damage, but there is functional damage. Most are self-resolving with physiotherapy. The other 2 categories, viz. axonotmesis and neurotmesis, are more serious cases as there is macroscopic damage, with neurotmesis having the less ideal prognosis, usually resulting in a non-functional neuroma. The most common findings at all stages of neurological degeneration would be dermatome and myotome abnormalities specific to nerve roots.
