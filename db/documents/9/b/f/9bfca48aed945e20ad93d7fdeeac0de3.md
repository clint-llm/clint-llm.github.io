The nasal cavity is comprised of 2 air-filled spaces on either side of the nasal septum. Three conchae, or turbinates, divide each side of the cavity. The turbinates are rich in glands and have an abundant blood supply. The choanae are located at the posterior segment of the nasal cavity and open into the nasopharynx. The nasal cavity assists in respiration, olfaction, conditioning of inspired air, and immune defense. The large, humidified surface area of the nasal cavity makes it an ideal location to adjust the quality of inhaled air before oxygen exchange in the lungs. Nasal mucus protects the epithelium from external particles, particularly in times of inflammation. The unique sensory capability to smell is due to specialized nerve endings within the olfactory nerve. The nasal cycle leads to a spontaneous alternation of congestion and decongestion between the left and right sides of the cavity.
