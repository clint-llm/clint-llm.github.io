Today an interprofessional team approach is being recommended to establish measures to prevent fractures in patients with osteoporosis. This interprofessional team should include clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), nurses, physical and occupational therapists,  pharmacists, and other allied healthcare workers such as social workers. Evidence shows that an interprofessional approach can help improve post-fracture osteoporosis by early identification of patients, documenting their disease state, and making appropriate referrals. Such an approach has been shown to be cost-effective in avoiding the cost of secondary fractures. In addition, patient referral to the endocrinologist, geriatrician, or rheumatologist can increase the number of patients treated with medications and, thus, improve outcomes. Pharmacists can perform medication reconciliation, verify agent selection and dosing, and offer patient medication counseling. Unfortunately, a significant number of patients still do not get such treatment because they are lost to follow-up. Today, prior to the discharge of a patient with a fracture, the nurse should ensure that the patient has the appropriate referrals, resources, and a dedicated social worker with whom they can follow up. [Level 3]

**Outcomes**

There continue to be significant deficiencies in the healthcare system concerning communication and follow-up of patients with fractures. Although there is a clear focus on preventing fractures and falls, this has not translated into better care for patients with osteoporosis. Thus, today many healthcare institutions have created a dedicated fracture liaison nurse to ensure that no patient with a fracture is missed.
