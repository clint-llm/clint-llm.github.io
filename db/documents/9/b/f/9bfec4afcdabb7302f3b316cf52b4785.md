Among the traumatic causes of CSF leak, blunt trauma is more common than penetrating injuries, affecting the anterior skull base more frequently than the middle or posterior skull base.

Among the non-traumatic causes of high-pressure CSF leaks, there is generally thinning and resorption of the bone at the skull base and thinning of the dural layer, which over time results in communication with the subarachnoid space. One such condition is idiopathic intracranial hypertension, frequently in young to middle-aged obese women and is associated with sellar floor erosions resulting in spontaneous CSF rhinorrhoea. Similarly, among the non-traumatic causes with normal ICP, there is usually a congenitally bone and dura defect or one secondary to infective or inflammatory pathologies.
