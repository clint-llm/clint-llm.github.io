Stercoral colitis is a rare condition that has been poorly described in the literature. Most cases are seen in elderly patients, bedbound patients secondary to dementia or stroke, patients with chronic opioid use, and occasionally younger patients with psychiatric conditions.

Chronic constipation is more common in the elderly, with a prevalence of one-third of adults aged 60 to 110. This is linked to many risk factors, including tooth loss or improperly fitting dentures, lack of proper diet,Â inadequate fluid intake, decreased amount of physical activity, and increased amount of daily pharmaceuticals taken by elderly patients. Women also experience constipation more frequently than men.

Children are also often affected by chronic constipation, particularly during specific stages of life. These stages include weaning, toilet training, and transitioning to school. Pediatric patients with a history of constipation are also at risk of developing stercoral colitis.
