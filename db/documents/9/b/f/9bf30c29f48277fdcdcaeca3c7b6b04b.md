A majority of cases are managed primarily by observation with emphasis placed on parental reassurance. Guidance can be provided to parents in improving sleeping postures for children. Some children lie prone with the hips and knees fully flexed and the foot rotated internally under the hips. This may exacerbate the deformity. Parents can be counselled to encourage better sleeping positions that do not exacerbate the deformity

Those with tibial torsion should be reassured that it is normal for developing children to have increased internal angles as they grow in age. Physiologic progression slowly returns somewhat towards the midline after the second decade. Again, parental reassurance is emphasized, as the patient is observed for spontaneous resolution by 5 years of age. Like metatarsus adductus, it is uncommon to have chronic issues with any persistence of internal tibial torsion. Rare cases that cause cosmetic or functional deformities may be considered for surgical correction by a distal tibial derotational osteotomy.

Akin to the other common physiologic conditions mentioned above, the natural course for femoral anteversion is also spontaneous resolution over time. Femoral anteversion has the longest course, resolving around 11 years of age. Persistence may also be seen in a small number of patients, with the rare likelihood of developing symptoms or complications. The mainstays of management are observation and to reassure parents of the natural course of decreasing anteversion. There are no recommended non-operative treatments, and the only notably effective surgical management is femoral derotational osteotomy. Becuase of the high likelihood of complications from surgery, it is only considered for those older than 11 years old, with severe functional sequelae or cosmetic deformities.
