The eyelid is composed of 7 tissue layers unique to this facial region. Superficial to deep, the layers are skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles of protraction including the orbicularis oculi, orbital septum, orbital fat, muscles of retraction, tarsus, and conjunctivae. The skin of the eyelid is much thinner than the skin found elsewhere in the body.

Multiple nerves supply the eyelid. The superior lid is innervated by the infratrochlear, supratrochlear, supraorbital, and lacrimal nerves of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V division V1). The innervation of the lower eyelid is via the infratrochlear and infraorbital nerve of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V division V2).

The arterial supply of the eyelids is composed of the internal carotid artery by way of the ophthalmic artery and its supraorbital and lacrimal branches and the external carotid artery via the angular and temporal branches of the facial artery. Anastomoses of the lateral and medial palpebral arteries create the blood supply to the upper and lower eyelids. These arteries are branches of the lacrimal and ophthalmic arteries.
