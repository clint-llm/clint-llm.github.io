Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy occur most often during the last month of pregnancy and only rarely appear in the postpartum period. The rash consists of itchy small erythematous and edematous papules and plaques usually first start in the stretch marks, typically with periumbiliÂ­cal sparing. The lesions can coalesce to form larger urticarial abdominal plaques often surrounded by blanched halos. The eruption spreads over a matter of days, to the trunk and the extremities, but rarely involves the face, palms, or soles.
