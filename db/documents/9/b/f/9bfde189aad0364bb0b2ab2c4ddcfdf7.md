The differential diagnosis is extensive and includes a wide range of processes that can lead to radial nerve compromise. This includes traumatic causes, with humeral fractures being a very common cause of radial nerve injury. Additionally, severe blunt trauma, crush injuries, puncture wounds, and stab wounds are other common causes. Anterior glenohumeral shoulder dislocation can rarely lead to radial nerve injury as well and should be considered in any patient with physical exam findings consistent with this. Iatrogenic injury can be seen in any surgery or injection involving anatomy associated with the path of the radial nerve. Internal compression by growing cysts, masses, tumors, muscle hypertrophy, and fibrinous tissue can also cause nerve palsy. Rarely, repetitive overuse and neurologic diseases can cause isolated palsies as well, with some patients even being found to have acute ischemic strokes after presenting with isolated symptoms.
