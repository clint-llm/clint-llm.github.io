In the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS), 7.6% of patients had a left ventricular aneurysm in a total population of 15000 patients. The LV aneurysm was found in 22% of the anterior wall myocardial infarction within 3 months of infarction. Ventricular wall aneurysm is associated with high cardiac mortality that can be around 67% and 80% for 3 months and 1 year, respectively.
