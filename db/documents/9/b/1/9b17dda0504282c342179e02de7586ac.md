Meissner corpuscles can be identified on skin biopsy specimens under traditional light microscopy. Immediately after excision, the biopsied specimen is placed into a fixative solution of neutral buffered formalin that forms crosslinks between lysine residues to preserve tissue structure. The specimen is then placed into a small cassette before being infiltrated by paraffin. After the wax cools and hardens, the tissue-containing paraffin block is sliced into thin sections by a microtome. The sections may then be stained according to previously-described protocols for hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemistry, or immunofluorescence.

Historically, the silver impregnation technique was recommended for staining of peripheral nerve endings, including Meissner corpuscles.

Two-photon excitation microscopy is a novel fluorescence imaging technique enabling high-resolution visualization of living tissue near the skin surface, including Meissner corpuscles.in vivo over a prolonged period to evaluate the mechanical response and structural changes of the corpuscles. A limitation of this visualization method is the inability to highlight other components of the receptors, such as the collagenous capsule or Schwann cells.
