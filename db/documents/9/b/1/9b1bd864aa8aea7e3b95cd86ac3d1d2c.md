Ommaya reservoir is a ventricular access device with an intraventricular catheter system for the purpose of chronic access to the intrathecal space. Ommaya reservoir is a highly effective implant that provides long-term access to the cerebrospinal fluid and has simplified administration of antimicrobials, antifungals, antineoplastic, and analgesic medications directly into the brain. This activity illustrates the technique of Ommaya reservoir insertion and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of Ommaya reservoir insertion.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to Ommaya reservoir insertion.
- Review the potential complications and clinical significance of the Ommaya reservoir.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance Ommaya reservoir insertion and improve outcomes.
