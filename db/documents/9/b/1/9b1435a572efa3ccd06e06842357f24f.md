One of the diseases that highlights the importance of normal airway resistance is asthma. Asthma develops due to chronic inflammation of the conducting airways, particularly the bronchi and bronchioles. This chronic inflammation results in contraction and hypertrophy of the airway smooth muscle, increased mucus production, and thickening of the lamina reticularis (a layer of connective tissue that surrounds the airways). Asthma is characterized as an obstructive lung disease because these maladaptive changes to the airways result in narrowing or even complete occlusion of the airway lumen, which leads to an increase in airway resistance that obstructs air from exiting the lungs.

The increased airway resistance associated with asthma is responsible for many of the signs and symptoms a patient will experience during an asthma exacerbation, including wheezing, dyspnea, chest tightness, and air trapping. Air trapping within the distal segments of the lungs is due to an inability to produce enough expiratory pressure to overcome the airway resistance of the more proximal bronchi and bronchioles. Since this airway resistance cannot be overcome, the air gets trapped in the distal segments of the lungs.
