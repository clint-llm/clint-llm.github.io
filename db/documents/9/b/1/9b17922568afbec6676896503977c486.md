The purpose of a medical evaluation in suspected physical abuse is to obtain a detailed injury history, identify occult injuries, and screen for medical conditions that may mimic or predispose the child to injury.

History: Document how the injury occurred, the last time the child was normal/injury-free, the child’s developmental level, and risk factors for abuse. A history that should raise concerns about abuse include:

- The absence of a history

- Unexplained delay in seeking care

- A history that is not consistent with the injuries or the child’s developmental abilities.

A thorough skin examination is vital as injuries may be located in hidden or protected areas. Note the general appearance, behavior of the child, and growth parameters which may indicate signs of neglect. Inspect the scalp for trauma, the mouth, and dentition for caries and oral/frenulum injuries, perform an abdominal exam, the range of motion of the extremities evaluating for fracture/limited motion, and a neurologic exam to assess tone and mental status.
