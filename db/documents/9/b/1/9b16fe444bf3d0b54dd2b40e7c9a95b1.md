Ocular larva migrans (OLM) is caused by larval migration through the posterior segment of the eye and is a leading infectious cause of blindness in children in developed countries. OLM classically presents with unilateral vision loss in a child, most often between the ages of five to ten. The exam may demonstrate uveitis, retinitis, choroiditis, or endophthalmitis based on the location of the parasite. The infection can also result in secondary glaucoma. Histologically, eosinophilic abscesses with surrounding granulomatous reactions are the expected manifestations.

Visceral larva migrans (VLM) is caused by larval migration through both solid and hollow organs in the abdomen and should be considered in any child presenting with fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and eosinophilia. An exam may be notable for hepatosplenomegaly, which can serve as a clue for clinicians that the presentation is not simple viral gastroenteritis. Lung involvement can result in bronchospasm and wheezing.

Central nervous system disease is rare but can be severe and range from eosinophilic meningitis to fulminant meningoencephalitis, presenting with seizures, encephalopathy, or neuropsychiatric symptoms.
