The femoral head is the most proximal portion of the femur and is supported by the femoral neck. It articulates with the acetabulum of the pelvis. The femoral head is nearly spherical (two-thirds) but has a medial depression known as the fovea capitis femoris that serves as an attachment point for the ligamentum teres. This structure has clinical significance as there is a major concern for avascular necrosis to the femoral head associated with hip fractures and dislocations.
