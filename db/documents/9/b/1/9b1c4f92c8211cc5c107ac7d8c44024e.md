Treatment is based on the severity of symptoms.  Mild disease is treated with lifestyle modifications.  Patients should be strongly advised to avoid strenuous exercise and heavy lifting.  First lime medical treatment for symptomatic HOCM is beta blockers though cardiac selective calcium channel blockers may be used. ACE inhibitors and nitrates should be avoided as these medications decrease afterload which would lead to worsening LV outflow tract obstruction.

Surgical intervention is reserved for patients who are resistant to lifestyle and medical management or those who have outflow gradient of 50mmhg or more. Septal myectomy is the surgical treatment of choice in young healthy patients.  Alcohol septal ablation is a newer percutaneous technique usually limited to older patients for whom an open procedure would be considered risky.
