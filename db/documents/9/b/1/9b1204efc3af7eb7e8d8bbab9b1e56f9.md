Hereditary galactokinase deficiency is a rare metabolic disorder that usually produces no dramatic disease manifestations in the early weeks and months of life. Unexplained hyperbilirubinemia in the early neonatal period is a common presentation.

Another frequently noted clinical feature is pseudotumor cerebri, which can be due to increased cerebrospinal fluid osmotic pressure from increased galactitol concentration.

Galactokinase deficiency has been reported in patients with congenital hyperinsulinemia. This information becomes significant because severe hyperglycemia goes undetected by bedside glucometer in patients with associated galactokinase deficiency due to the accumulation of galactose.
