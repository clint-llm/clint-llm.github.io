It is very crucial to understand the difference between pediatric and adult airway anatomy and physiology before planning for the tracheostomy.

The first anatomical difference is that the head of the pediatric patient, which is relatively larger than the body size with prominent occipital protuberance. The larger occiput, along with short neck, makes positioning during tracheostomy relatively difficult in pediatric patients. The tongue in infants and children is larger, while the mandible is smaller in size. Cross-sectional studies of the airway reveal that adult airway is more elliptical than that of the child.

The vocal cords do not lie at right angles to the trachea; instead, they are inclined at anterior-inferior to the posterior-superior direction. The epiglottis in pediatric patients is more U shaped and may lie across the laryngeal inlet. The airwayÂ is narrowest at the level of the cricoid cartilage for children, while for adults, it is at the level of the vocal cords.
