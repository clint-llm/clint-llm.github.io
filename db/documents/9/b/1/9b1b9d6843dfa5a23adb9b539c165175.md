Any observed lesion of the vulva requires a biopsy for diagnosis.  Benign lesions include common dermatopathology such as lichen simplex, lichen sclerosis, or lichen planus.  Vulvar lesions may also result from infection such as vestibulitis, candidiasis, or herpes.  Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia is a preinvasive lesion that may appear similar to these more common changes of the skin or typical malignancies such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, Paget disease, or melanoma.  Treatment without biopsy confirmation risks progression and delays the diagnosis of potential malignancy.
