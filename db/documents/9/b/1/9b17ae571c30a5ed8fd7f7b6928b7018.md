SI joint injection may be performed by an interprofessional team that includes a pain specialist, radiologist, orthopedic surgeon, rheumatologist and sports physician. It is important to be aware of the anatomy of the SI joint and utilize imaging modalities to achieve higher success. Patients should be educated that the SI injection is not curative and repeat injections may be required. All healthcare workers who perform SI injections should know how to manage the complications that may arise during and after the procedure.
