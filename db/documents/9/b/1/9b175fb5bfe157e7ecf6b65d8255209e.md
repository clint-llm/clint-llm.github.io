The most known adverse effect of vitamin B6 supplementation is sensory neuropathy, but this pathology rarely occurs below toxic doses–which is 1 gm/day or more for adults–and there is no evidence of its occurrence in doses lower than 100 mg/day for less than 30 weeks in adults.

There are no reported adverse effects caused by dietary concentrations nor by regular supplemental doses of vitamin B6, while higher doses below levels of toxicity may cause indigestion, nausea, breast tenderness, photosensitivity, and vesicular dermatoses.
