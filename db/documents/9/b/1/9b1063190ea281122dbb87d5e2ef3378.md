In general, the differential diagnosis of a sellar mass includes pituitary adenomas, pituitary hyperplasia, either physiologic (pregnancy) or pathologic (resulting from end-organ insufficiency), lymphocytic hypophysitis, and in children, craniopharyngiomas and intracranial germ cell tumors.

In a specific setting where the patient has elevated TSH and low thyroid hormone levels with a pituitary mass, the patient can either have pituitary hyperplasia as a result of the primary hypothyroidism, or they may have a non-functioning pituitary adenoma in addition to primary hypothyroidism. A TSH-secreting adenoma should not be discounted, as even though one would expect elevated thyroid hormones in addition to an elevated TSH, there may be concomitant primary hypothyroidism and thus follow up imaging and thyroid biochemistry becomes important to differentiate these entities.
