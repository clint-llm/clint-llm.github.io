Balance gives an individual the ability to achieve physical movement and further carry out the activities of daily living.

Many factors can lead to impaired balance depending on the individual's condition. Limiting factors include muscle strength, motor coordination, poor cognition, and poor sensory organization, all of which may be affected in some way with a neurological condition.

In individuals with lower limb amputation, their gait is significantly affected. Studies have shown that balance strongly correlates with the gait performance of amputees. Hence, the better balance, the better walking ability, and better quality of life.

For individuals with Parkinson disease, their postural instability is a major disease characteristic that worsens balance and can further lead to decreased independence and physical ability.
