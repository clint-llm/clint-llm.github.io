There are various important considerations for clinical practice concerning the arterial supply of the lower extremity. The following conditions are essential for the clinician to understand and incorporate into differential diagnoses when evaluating conditions affecting the pelvis and lower extremities.

**The Corona Mortis**

A meta-analysis of 21 studies demonstrated the presence of the corona mortis in nearly half of the hemipelves analyzed.

**Legg-Calvé-Perthes Disease**

Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease highlights the tenuous blood supply to the femoral head and neck. This is an idiopathic disorder of the hip that results in avascular necrosis of the femoral head. This condition develops in children, typically between 5 and 8 years of age. The etiology remains a source of debate, although some researchers have identified genetic links and coagulopathies that may play a causal role in this condition. Children with this condition present with mild hip pain, a limp, and limited range of motion. When these symptoms present under six years of age, nonoperative management with physical therapy has equal outcomes compared to surgery. Patients six years and older seem to benefit from surgical intervention.

**Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head**

In addition to Legg-Calvés-Perthes disease, there are many other causes of avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Etiologies include but are not limited to fracture, dislocation, coagulopathy, and sickle cell disease. However, the true etiology of the necrosis is often unknown. Risk factors such as smoking, hyperlipidemia, glucocorticoid usage, genetic predisposition, and autoimmune disease may be present. Surgical procedures that spare the head of the femur are generally preferred in younger patients, although arthroplasty is often necessary.

**Popliteal Artery Laceration (Knee Dislocation)**

Knee dislocations are considered surgical emergencies because of the risk of neurovascular complications. Popliteal artery injury is reported to occur in 7.8 to 11.1% of patients with knee dislocations. Patients with vascular injuries also demonstrate an increased risk of other medical and surgical morbidities. There is significant variability in the reported rates of vascular injury in knee dislocations. Still, assessing patients for these complications remains important, especially in the context of high-energy trauma.

**Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)**

Peripheral arterial disease is a significant cause of morbidity and a predictor of mortality, especially in diabetic patients. The atherosclerotic process due to diabetes mellitus results in decreased ability to walk secondary to pain (intermittent claudication) and sensory deficits. Early medical and surgical intervention can help patients have better outcomes.

**Compartment Syndromes**

The lower leg is the most prevalent site of compartment syndrome, especially in the context of tibial shaft fractures. This condition may occur in any of the four compartments of the lower leg; it most commonly occurs in the anterior compartment. Timely identification of the development of compartment syndrome is vital to prevent the destruction of tissues.

The terminology of compartment syndrome is complex. Anterior compartment syndrome most commonly involves the distal leg and not the thigh. Despite the common use of anterior compartment syndrome, the terminology should be anterior compartment syndrome of the leg. A variant is the anterior crural compartment syndrome.

Physical findings of compartment syndrome may be remembered by the mnemonic of the five Ps:  pulselessness, pain, pallor, paresthesias, and paralysis. Because the deep fibular nerve innervates the anterior compartment and supplies sensation only to the area between the big toe and the second toe, if other paresthesias are present, alternative diagnoses should be considered.

Manometric measurement of pressure within the anterior compartment can help to identify the presence of an anterior compartment syndrome.

Measuring the pulse of the dorsalis pedis artery can help identify the presence of an anterior crural compartment syndrome of the leg. However, this is not an infallible test; in 5% of patients, the dorsalis pedis artery is a branch of the fibular artery. Surgical treatment of anterior crural compartment syndrome consists of making vertical slits in the fascia that attaches to the anterior aspect of the tibia and fibula and should be performed within six hours of injury. After 36 hours, the loss of vascular function and resultant necrosis indicate that fasciotomy may not be helpful.

Fractures of the tibia are the most common cause of acute anterior compartment syndrome. Other causes commonly involve soft tissue injury, including burns, crush injuries, thrombosis, bleeding disorders, intense athletic activities and injuries, and penetrating trauma.

A milder variant of anterior compartment syndrome is chronic exertional anterior compartment syndrome.

**Talus Fracture**

Approximately 80% of the talus is covered with articular cartilage and has no true muscle or tendinous attachment. It receives blood in a retrograde fashion. Blood supply is often disrupted with talar neck fractures, with a higher risk of delayed union and nonunion. Displaced talar neck fractures are better treated with surgical fixation to minimize these risks.

**The Jones Fractures**

Fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal have a propensity towards nonunion secondary to avascular necrosis. This result occurs because there is an avascular watershed zone between the most proximal aspect of the base, known as the proximal tubercle, and the diaphysis.
