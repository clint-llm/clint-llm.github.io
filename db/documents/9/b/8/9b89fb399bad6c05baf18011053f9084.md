In the United States, herpes zoster affects about 1 per 1000 individuals annually. However, in the over 60-years population, the incidence is closer to 1 per 100 individuals. The incidence in older adults is lower in those who have received either the live attenuated or inactivated recombinant zoster vaccines. Among patients diagnosed with herpes zoster, some epidemiological studies estimate about 8 to 20% are complicated by HZO, with many of those cases resulting in ocular involvement.
