Motor neuron injury arising as a result of derangement of multiple interlinked intracellular processes that have been attributed to genetic mutations leading to impaired protein homeostasis (SIGMAR 1M, CHMP2B,c9orf72), aberrant RNA metabolism (SETS, FUS, ANG), mitochondrial dysfunction (SOD1, CHCHD10, TARDBP), dysregulated vesicle transport (SOD1, ALS2, FIG4), impaired DNA repair (NEK1, C21ORF2, SPG11), oxidative stress (SOD 1, ALS2, TARDBP2 mutation), which have all been implicated in the development of neurotoxicity.

Out of the processes mentioned above, the two which have been postulated as being central to the etiopathogenesis of the neuronal injury include defects in protein homeostasis and RNA metabolism.

These processes lead to the failure of the motor neuron axon in maintaining its projections leading to retraction of the axon and ultimately resulting in denervation of the target. This leads to denervation of the neuron when the lower motor neuron and loss of supraspinal control of the upper motor neuron, hypertonia, and spastic weakness when the upper motor neuron is involved.
