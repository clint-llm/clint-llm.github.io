Epithelial downgrowth is a potentially visually devastating complication of intraocular surgery or trauma characterized by invasion of epithelial cells and growth into intraocular structures. This article will review the etiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnostic modalities, and management options of epithelial downgrowth. It will review the role of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of epithelial downgrowth.
- Outline the appropriate diagnostic studies for epithelial downgrowth.
- Review the management options for epithelial downgrowth, from noninvasive measures to complete surgical excision, as well as their risks and limitations. 
- Outline the importance of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and management of epithelial downgrowth to improve outcomes and reduce complications.
