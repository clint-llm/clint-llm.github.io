An FOBT card that does not turn blue is considered a negative test. If the card turns blue, this is positive and requires further gastroenterological workup.

Normal fecal blood loss can approach 1.5 mL of blood per day based on radio chromium (51Cr-labeled red cells) methods.

Peptic ulcers, hemorrhoids, and diverticula are also causes of fecal occult blood loss; bleeding from these conditions is highly variable. Of all the methods available, heme-porphyrin testing is more likely to detect small amounts of blood loss from the upper gastrointestinal tract, such as that seen due to aspirin.

FOBT is performed to detect gastrointestinal bleeding and is most often used as a screening test for colorectal cancer, one of the most common cancers in many parts of the world.

FOBT is also a critical investigation in patients with iron-deficiency anemia to rule out gastrointestinal bleeding as the cause of anemia. Since bleeding from any part of the gastrointestinal tract can cause iron deficiency, it is important to select the appropriate test.
