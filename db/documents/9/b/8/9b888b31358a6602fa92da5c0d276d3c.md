The management of patients with shock calls for a collaborative, interprofessional approach. Clinicians must react promptly to the emergency and determine the precise cause of shock. Nursing will be on hand to assist at every step of the way, assisting with measures such as intubation and administering medications. Pharmacists must rapidly prepare and deliver the needed drugs and yet still verify that dosing and interactions do not present a problem. Depending on the etiology, various specialists may also be called in on the case. Each area will need to act and react as the situation dictates. WIth interprofessional cooperation, these patients will stand a better chance of recovery from shock with minimal deleterious effects. [Level 5]
