Proteus mirabilis, part of the Enterobacteriaceae family of bacilli, is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobe with an ability to ferment maltose and inability to ferment lactose. P. mirabilis also has swarming motility and the ability to self-elongate and secrete a polysaccharide when in contact with solid surfaces; this allows for attachment and easy motility along surfaces (e.g., medical equipment). The flagella of P. mirabilis are what allow for its motility; not only does this help support colonization, but it also has been associated with its ability to form biofilms and is suggested to contribute to resistance to host defenses and certain antibiotics.

Proteus is found abundantly in soil and water, and although it is part of the normal human intestinal flora (along with Klebsiella species, and Escherichia coli), it has been known to cause serious infections in humans.
