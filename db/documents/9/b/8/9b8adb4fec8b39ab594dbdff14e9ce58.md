The equipment needed is normally quite standard but is by surgeon preference â€” a scalpel of varying sizes, a minor orthopedic set, which contains a variety of instruments. Needles of varying sizes can be beneficial for triangulation. An ultrasound machine or image intensifier is used for intraoperative identification (foreign body material dependant). Also needed are sutures for closure and a variation of dressings. For smaller foreign bodies, surgeons may request magnification loupes.
