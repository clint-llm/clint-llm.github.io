ANAs bind to various molecular compounds with the cell's nucleus, including nucleic material and proteins. Antibodies may bind to double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), and studies suggest thatÂ antibodies are formed during the incomplete removal of cellular material during apoptosis.

Antibodies to Jo-1 prevent histidine binding to tRNA during protein synthesis by targeting histidyl-tRNA synthetase.
