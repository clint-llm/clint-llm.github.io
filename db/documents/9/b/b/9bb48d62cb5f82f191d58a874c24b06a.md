Docusate is an emollient stool softener (surfactant laxatives). By lowering the surface tension of the oil-water interface of the stool, it allows the passage of water and lipids into the stool mass. As a result, the stool softens and passes easily through the intestinal tract.

Numerous systematic reviews have investigated the efficacy of docusate and found no significant evidence to support its use.
