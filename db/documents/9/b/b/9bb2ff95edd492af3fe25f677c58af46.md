ALA is considered a safe drug generally. A daily dose of 200 to 2400 mg/day of ALA is deemed safe without side effects. However, there is no reported safety dose in children.

There was a case in which a 20-month-old was admitted to the emergency room with vomiting, lethargy, involuntary movements for several hours. He was believed to have accidentally ingested four pills of 600 mg ALA, and the ingested drug amount was calculated as 226 mg/kg. He was later diagnosed with status epilepticus because of prolonged convulsions for half an hour. In the follow-up, he received treatment with midazolam infusion up to 0.8 mg/kg/h and 5 mg/kg maintenance doses of phenytoin to control seizures continuing for one hour in addition to intravenous hydration and HCO3 administration. In the following few days, he became conscious without further seizure recurrence.

In the last two decades, there have been very few reported cases of ALA toxicity in humans. Most of these cases occur in children and are treatable. Even though there is no established lethal dosage of ALA for humans, studies have shown that a high dose of 121 mg ALA/kg body weight/day was associated with alterations in liver enzymes and the function of the liver.
