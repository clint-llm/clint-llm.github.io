For the large majority of burns, the differential diagnosis is very narrow. When history is available, and the patient has distinct physical findings, the diagnosis is quite evident. However, in patients that are unable to give a clear history or in patients that are presenting after a period of time, there are some disease presentations that have overlap in terms of symptomatology and treatment requirements. Each of these affects the function of skin and underlying tissues to the extent that treatment in a burn care unit is appropriate.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome is hypersensitivity erythema with a sudden onset and unknown cause.

Erythema multiforme is associated with symmetrical target lesions without blisters involving the extremity. The mucosa is spared. This usually occurs after an upper respiratory infection. Necrotizing fasciitis presents with acute necrosis of the fascia and muscle. It will cause sloughing of skin. It is caused by various bacteria, is rapidly progressive, and carries high morbidity. There are case reports of it presenting on the face as well.

Treatment of these patients will often mimic that required for burn patients in that the burn care unit provides the necessary environment for treatment. Topical therapy is necessary. Medications have to be closely monitored. An emergency escharotomy may be necessary for full-thickness lesions. Morbidity and mortality are improved in these cases when care is provided by personnel familiar with these principles.
