Typical equipment is used that would be needed for any airway management situation. Intravenous (IV) access to deliver sedation and, if part of the protocol, neuromuscular blockade, is critical, as are oral and nasal airways, a bag valve mask (BVM), oxygen supply, suction, and an intubation kit, including various sizes of endotracheal tubes and Mac and Miller blades. The provider should anticipate complications while intubating and have extra materials on hand, for example, IV fluids for hypotension caused by some induction agents, and airway adjuncts such as laryngeal mask airways (LMA) or King tubes for patients who cannot be intubated.
