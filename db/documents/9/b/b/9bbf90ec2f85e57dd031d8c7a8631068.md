Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a disease that causes bilirubin to build up in the blood. Crigler-Najjar syndrome results from an abnormal gene that runs in families. The severity of the disease process differs between two types of Crigler-Najjar syndrome. Therefore, the differentiation of type I and II helps to monitor the need for further interventions. The screening of family members and close relatives is suggested. Patient education depends upon the understanding level of parents. Information about signs and symptoms should be delivered to the parents so that early diagnosis and treatment are possible, which prevents complications and improves outcomes. Parents should beÂ informed and educated about the pros and cons of different tests and treatments. Parents should be encouraged to choose the best option for their child. They have the right to select any available intervention.
