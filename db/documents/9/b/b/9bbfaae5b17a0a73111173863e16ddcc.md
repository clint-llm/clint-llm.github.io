Most patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria will not develop symptomatic urinary tract infections and will have no adverse consequences from asymptomatic bacteriuria.  Specifically, children, patients with diabetes, older patients, patients with spinal cord injuries, and patients with indwelling urinary catheters do not benefit from treatment with antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Treatment in these patients does not decrease the incidence of symptomatic urinary tract infections or improve survival. However, it does increase the likelihood of adverse effects from antibiotics and the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

In contrast, treatment of pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria has been shown to be beneficial. Antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy decreases the risk of pyelonephritis, low-birthweight infants, and preterm delivery.  In addition, patients undergoing urologic procedures in which mucosal bleeding is expected, such as with resection of the prostate, and patients who are in the first three months following renal transplantation probably should be treated. There is evidence that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in these patients decreases the risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection.

Treatment should be guided by the results of urine culture and sensitivity. Amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefuroxime, cephalexin, and nitrofurantoin are considered safe for use in pregnancy.
