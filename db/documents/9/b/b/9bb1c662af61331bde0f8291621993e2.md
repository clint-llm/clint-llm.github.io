OCA is a relatively new pharmacologic agent for use in populations with pathologies with few available pharmacologic treatments. It is imperative to educate clinicians, administrators, patients, and all healthcare professionals regarding its use and indications. The lack of long-term trials and data also merits continuing medical education for professionals and patients alike, as there may be new data and evidence regarding long-term treatment outcomes and adverse events. Therefore, a proper physician practice with differing dosages, patient monitoring, and treatment discontinuation is necessary. Also, it is important to monitor patient comorbidities such as concomitant renal failure, progressive liver fibrosis leading to clinical stigmata of cirrhosis, and biliary ductal obstruction.

Current FDA guidelines approve OCA for the treatment of PBC in patients who have failed treatment or are unable to tolerate UDCA. The FDA recommends routine monitoring of patients on OCA for PBC disease progression with laboratory and clinical assessments to determine whether dosage adjustment is needed. Patients with progression from Child-Pugh Class A to Class B or C will need a dose reduction. Close monitoring is also recommended for patients at increased risk of hepatic decompensation, including but not limited to those with worsening liver function tests and coagulation testing such as INR. The physicians and health care unit must use their discretion in prescribing OCA and closely monitor and share outcomes with their patients to make an informed team decision regarding dose adjustments and continuing the medication if adverse events occur and after they resolve.

The clinical trials on the efficacy of OCA against PBC, PSC, NAFLD, NASH, and Type-II diabetes have all shown promising results. These reports suggest that OCA, whether administered either as a monotherapy or in conjunction with conventional therapy, may effectively manage and treat these diseases. The efficacy of OCA against various other hepatic and pancreatic-related disorders warrants more studies.
