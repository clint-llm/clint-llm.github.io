The FDA recognized the combination of acetylsalicylic acid (250 mg), acetaminophen (250 mg), and caffeine (65 mg) as safe and effective in treating acute headaches, especially migraine, and was also considered effective by the American Headache Society (Level A). This combination is well-tolerated in episodic tension-type headaches and considered superior to acetaminophen; all components in this combination medication are considered safe during breastfeeding and can be taken orally for acute migraine attacks. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse events, and other key elements of acetaminophen/aspirin/caffeine therapy in the clinical setting as it relates to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients with migraine headaches and its related conditions and sequelae.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action and administration of aspirin/acetaminophen/caffeine.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of aspirin/acetaminophen/caffeine.
- Summarize the therapeutic place for aspirin/acetaminophen/caffeine in a headache pain control regimen.
- Review the importance of coordinating and collaborating among various disciplines in an interprofessional health team to coordinate care and management to enhance outcomes for patients receiving aspirin/acetaminophen/caffeine therapy.
