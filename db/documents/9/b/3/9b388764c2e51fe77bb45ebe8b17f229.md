Mohs surgery is appropriate for skin cancers with a high risk of recurrence and when tissue conservation is essential.Â The Mohs Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) guidelines were developed to assist clinicians in determining if a specific tumor would be appropriately managed by Mohs surgery. A Mohs AUC mobile phone app is available for download to mobile devices. These criteria were based on areas of the body, patient characteristics, and tumor characteristics.

Mohs surgery is particularly suitable for areas of the body in the "H" area:

- Central face, eyelids/canthi, eyebrows, nose, lips, chin, ear, and periauricular area

- Genitalia

- Hands, feet, ankles, and nail units

- Nipples/areola

Higher-risk patient characteristics include:

- Immunocompromised

- Genetic syndromes (basal cell nevus syndrome, xeroderma pigmentosum)

- Prior radiated skin

- Patient with history of high-risk tumors

Tumor characteristics include:

- Positive margin on recent excision

Aggressive features that are high risk for recurrence of BCC:

- Aggressive histologic subtype: morpheaform, infiltrating, micronodular

- Perineural involvement

- Metatypical/keratotic

Aggressive features of SCC:

- Poorly or undifferentiated (characterized by a high degree of nuclear polymorphism, high mitotic rate, or low degree of keratinization)

- Perineural/perivascular

- Spindle cell

- Breslow depth 2 mm or greater

- Clark level IV or greater

While the Mohs AUC can be helpful in determining if a specific lesion is appropriately managed with Mohs surgery, it does not exclude the validity of alternate modalities in treating the same lesion (e.g. curettage, electrodesiccation & curettage, or excision).
