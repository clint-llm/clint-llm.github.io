The prisms are used in ophthalmology for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes. Prisms are made of glass or plastic material. These are available in different models such as loose prisms, prism bar, trial set prisms, or Fresnel prism. Prisms of different powers are available in different models. Prisms in a trial set range from Â½ to 12 D. Prism bars range from 1 to 40 D. Fresnel prisms range from 1 to 40 D. Loose prisms range from 1 to 60 D.

**Diagnostic Indications**

- Prisms are used in many ophthalmic devices such as slit lamp biomicroscope, applanation tonometer, gonioscope, keratometer, pupillometer, phoropter, ophthalmoscopes, operating microscope

- Objective measurement of squint by prism cover test (Krimsky method), simultaneous prism cover test, modified Krimsky method

- Subjective measurement of squint by Maddox rod

- Measurement of fusional reserve amplitudes

- Assessment of torsion

- Four prism diopter test for microtropia

- To detect abnormal retinal correspondence

- To assess the likelihood of diplopia after proposed squint surgery

- Prism adaptation test

- To assess head posture after nystagmus surgery

**Therapeutic Indications**

- Building up fusional reserve in patients with convergence insufficiency

- Building up divergence capacity in patients with divergence insufficiency

- To relieve diplopia in patients with small vertical squints, decompensated phorias, or paralytic squints to relieve diplopia in primary or reading positions.

- To decrease the velocity of nystagmus by simulating convergence in nystagmus patients

- To increase the field of vision in patients with hemianopia

- Fresnel prisms are prescribed in patients with bitemporal hemianopia, glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, brain injury, and stroke

- As for reading glasses for bedridden patients
