Loss of the skin's thermoregulatory function in cases of hypohydroticÂ ectodermal dysplasias (EDs) gives rise to episodic hyperthermia over the first three years of life with increased mortality. In childhood, hypohydrotic ED- asthma, recurrent URTI, and atopic dermatitis are common complications. Dental caries, loss of dentition can lead to difficulty in feeding. Mental retardation, growth retardation, disability due to skeletal deformities are common complications of many variants of EDs such as EEC. The presence of ankyloblepharon, recurrent inflammation of the lacrimal apparatus, can cause ocular surface complications and interfere with the visual function. Genitourinary anomalies may predispose to early renal failure. Recurrent respiratory and cutaneous infections due to underlying immune deficiencies can increase mortality and morbidity. Scarring alopecia secondary to erosive scalp dermatitis may occur in the AEC syndrome.
