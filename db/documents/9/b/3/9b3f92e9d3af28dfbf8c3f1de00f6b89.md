Patients should be educated that dermatofibromas are benign entities and do not necessarily require excision. However, although the clinical history and exam and imaging studies may favor a dermatofibroma, a definitive diagnosis can only be made on pathologic examination. Patient requests or desires may also influence the decision to excise vs. choosing surveillance.
