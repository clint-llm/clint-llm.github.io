There are over 470 species of sharks throughout the world, and sharks generally prefer shallow waters in temperate and tropical regions. These regions are the most common sites for divers and surfers to become victims of shark-related injuries, though these injuries are rare. Nevertheless, when shark attacks occur, they cause an extreme degree of mutilation even with a single bite. When shark bites do not result in death, massive blood loss, amputation, and vital organ puncture can occur. The frequency of shark attacks continues to increase due to an increased number of humans venturing into sharks' natural habitat. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of shark attack injuries and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of shark attack injuries.
- Outline strategies for preventing shark attacks. 
- Explain the treatment options available for shark attack injuries.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving coordination and communication to advance the management of shark attack victims and improve outcomes.
