Cutaneous cylindromas are rare entities which affect females nine times more frequently than males and are more common in Caucasian populations. When they occur as solitary lesions, they are usually the sporadic type. Sporadic forms are more likely to occur in older patients. Multiple occurring lesions are more likely to be syndromic and will often manifest at an earlier age.
