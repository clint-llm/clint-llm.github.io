Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is an independent predictor for major cardiovascular events.

Shockwave intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) is a novel technique evolved from the established therapy for renal and ureteral calculi that utilizes a percutaneous device to produce acoustic pressure waves resulting in the delivery of energy to break superficial and deep calcium deposits and aid with the subsequent deployment of a vascular stent.

The feasibility and safety of IVL in the peripheral vasculature was shown in the Disrupt Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) studies and the Disrupt Below the Knee (BTK) study.
