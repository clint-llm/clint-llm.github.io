Histopathologically, dysplastic nevi have 4 characteristic features that help distinguish them from other nevi or melanoma. These features include intraepidermal lentiginous hyperplasia of melanocytes, cytological atypia of melanocytes, lamellar and concentric fibroplasia (stromal response), and architectural atypia. Compound dysplastic nevi often have a “shoulder sign” in which the epidermal component extends beyond or “shoulders” the dermal component.

The cytological atypia is random and includes enlarged dark nuclei with large nucleoli. This atypia is often graded from mild to severe. However, this is very subjective, based on the dermatopathologist reading the slides. Cytological atypia is not exclusive to dysplastic nevi and may be seen in any nevus. Many studies have been performed looking at inter- and intra-observer concordance between dermatopathologists in diagnosing dysplastic nevi concerning cytological atypia grading. The results have been mixed and may vary widely from one dermatopathologist to another dermatopathologist, but it is speculated that an individual dermatopathologist’s grading will likely remain constant over time.
