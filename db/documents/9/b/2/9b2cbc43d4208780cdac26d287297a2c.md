An anterior segment surgeon generally does SFIOL surgery. However, in cases with posterior segment complications such as macular edema and retinal detachment, a retinal surgeon should be involved in management. Optometrists play a critical role in ascertaining if a high degree of astigmatism or refractive error is present after surgery, which leads to the diagnosis and management of complications such as IOL tilt and dislocation. In addition, a thorough systemic evaluation by an interprofessional team such as the general physician, pediatrician, and cardiologist is necessary if a syndromic cause for ectopia lentis is suspected, leading to better patient care and enhanced outcomes.
