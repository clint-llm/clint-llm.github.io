The patients usually present with sudden onset, pressure like radiating chest pain, which generally lasts for 5-20 minutes. The symptoms are recurrent and present in a similar way during each episode. If the symptoms do not respond to initial medical treatment, the patient can develop myocardial infarction or even sudden death. The classic presentation mimics typical angina pectoris, however resting pain with no pain between the episodes can be used to differentiate from classic angina pectoris.

Physical examination should be performed to get baseline cardiovascular status to compare during the episodes. The patient can develop tachycardia, hypotension, or third heart sound during the episode, and return to baseline after the episode. If the right coronary artery is involved, the patient can develop bradycardia and hypotension because of the involvement of the nodal system and disruption of the blood supply to the right ventricle.
