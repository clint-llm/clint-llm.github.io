Good interprofessional teamwork is crucial for successful abdominoperineal resection. Operative planning and successful treatment of rectal cancer require a multidisciplinary approach involving surgeons, radiologists, oncologists, and histopathologists. Cancer nurse specialists and stoma care nurses play a pivotal role in the overall care of the patient and provide psychological support, expert advice, and specialist symptom control. In addition, enhanced recovery protocols have greatly improved patient outcomes by standardizing post-operative care and integrating surgeons, anesthesiologists, pain specialists, nursing staff, physical and occupational therapists, social services, and hospital administration.
