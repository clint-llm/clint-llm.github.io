Spontaneous pneumomediastinum typically develops in a three-step process called the Macklin phenomenon:

- Increased intra-alveolar pressure results in alveolar rupture

- Air dissects into peribronchial and perivascular sheaths

- Air progressively spreads into the mediastinum and surrounding tissue

Intra-alveolar pressure may increase from excessive vomiting or coughing, strenuous physical exertion, or Valsalva maneuvers (e.g., childbirth). Airway disease, such as asthma and COPD, causes bronchial constriction, which predisposes patients to airway injury due to baseline increased alveolar pressures. Forceful inhalation during illicit drug use may cause changes in intra-alveolar pressure or direct barotrauma, which similarly increases the risk for pneumomediastinum.

Secondary pneumomediastinum is typically caused by trauma to the trachea or esophagus. Penetrating trauma (i.e., stab wounds) or blunt trauma (i.e., motor vehicle accident) may cause tracheal or esophageal injury. Though not well described, blasts may also cause secondary pneumomediastinum.
