The clinical presentation of the various clinical entities causing posterior uveitis can overlap. Sometimes lesions of age-related macular degeneration, multiple leaking central serous retinopathy, posterior scleritis, intraocular malignancies can be confused with lesions of posterior uveitis. The infective chorioretinitis lesions can be distinguished from white dot syndromes by their fundus appearance, and ICGA and FFA give conclusive evidence in most cases.Â In newborns with congenital infection, exclude TORCHeS. Other less common congenital infections simulating toxoplasmosis include West Nile virus fever, acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis, and, more recently, Zika virus, the latter particularly in the setting of microcephaly. Tumors such as retinoblastoma and congenital anomalies of the retina or choroid such as retinochoroidal coloboma and persistent hyperplastic vitreous are also considerations in the differential diagnosis in children**.**
