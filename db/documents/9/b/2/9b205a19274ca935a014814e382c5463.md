The Dix-Hallpike maneuver aims to identify benign positional paroxysmal vertigo (BPPV). This disease process is thought to be caused by free-floating debris (often in the form of a calcium carbonate stones, termed otoliths) in the semicircular canals of the inner ear. Three canals make up this system, each forming a loop filled with endolymph and lined with hair cells. During normal rotational movement of the head, the fluid endolymph remains relatively motionless while the canals and the hair cells move. The hair cells are mechanically pushed by the resistance of the endolymph, opening mechanically gated ion channels that trigger an action potential indicating rotational movement. Each of the three canals is oriented slightly differently, with the anterior and posterior canals in the vertical plane, set to detect movement in the sagittal and coronal planes, respectively, and the lateral canal 30 degrees off from the horizontal plane, detecting movement to the left or right in the horizontal plane.

Benign positional paroxysmal vertigo is typically thought to be caused by dislodgement of a piece of calcium carbonate from the otoconial membrane within one of the canals, physically displacing hair cells on movement and creating persistent action potentials until the response is fatigued, generally within 30 to 60 seconds. This results in the sensation of movement and nystagmus characteristic of vertigo in brief paroxysms with positional changes of the head. The posterior canal is affected 90% of the time in benign positional paroxysmal vertigo, and lateral canal pathology causes approximately 8% of cases. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver is the gold standard for diagnosing benign positional paroxysmal vertigo caused by a posterior canal otolith. The patient is positioned recumbent with the head back and toward the affected ear, causing the otolith to progress superiorly along the natural course of the canal. Typically, after a five to 20-second delay, this will cause vertigo and rotary or up-beating nystagmus, which will resolve within 60 seconds.
