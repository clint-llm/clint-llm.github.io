**Vitamin D deficiency**is, by far, the most common cause of nutritional rickets.

Based on the biochemical profile, rickets can be classified into calcipenic, phosphopenic, and rickets due to inhibited mineralization.

- Deficiency of calcium results in **calcipenic rickets,**and vitamin D deficiency is the most common etiology for calcipenic rickets. Calcipenic rickets may result from inadequate dietary calcium intake, which is reported in a few developing countries.

- **Phosphopenic rickets**, on the other hand, is caused by conditions that cause chronic low serum phosphate levels, either from impaired intestinal absorption or, more commonly, from increased renal loss. Phosphate is abundant in our regular food, so phosphate deficiency does not usually occur from dietary insufficiency in healthy individuals. In premature children, dietary phosphate deficiency can result in osteopenia of prematurity. Low serum phosphate levels occur in (1) conditions that increase the production or decrease degradation of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a hormone that reduces the reabsorption and increases the excretion of phosphate in the renal tubules. (2) increased urinary phosphate loss due to mutations that cause inactivation of sodium-dependent phosphate transporters in the kidneys. Both conditions increase the urinary phosphate loss resulting in chronic hypophosphatemia. Both calcipenic rickets and phosphopenic rickets are characterized by hypophosphatemia, which eventually causes the clinical and radiological bone changes characteristic of rickets (rachitic changes).

- **Inhibited mineralization rickets**occurs when there is a defect in growth plate mineralization in the presence of normal calcium and phosphate concentrations. It may result from several predisposing factors including, hereditary hypophosphatasia, medications (first-generation bisphosphonates), and toxicities from aluminum and fluoride.

**Genetic causes**of rickets may be classified broadly into two types: vitamin D-dependent rickets (calcipenic type), and congenital hypophosphatemic rickets (phosphopenic type).

****Vitamin D-dependent rickets:************This group is characterized by defects in either synthesis of the active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D), or defect in vitamin D receptor (VDR), or vitamin D-VDR interactions.

- **Vitamin D-dependent rickets type I A (VDDR1A):**This type is previously known as hereditary pseudo-vitamin D deficiency. It is inherited by an autosomal recessive mutation in the CYP27B1. In this form of rickets, 25-hydroxyvitamin D cannot be converted to 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D due to a deficiency in the 1-alpha hydroxylase enzyme, which is required for vitamin D biosynthesis in the kidney.

- **Vitamin D-dependent rickets type I B (VDDR1B):**This type is also referred to as vitamin D hydroxylation-deficient rickets. It is a rare condition inherited by an autosomal recessive mutation in the CYP2R1 gene. In this form of rickets, vitamin D cannot be converted into 25-hydroxyvitamin D and later to 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, due to a deficiency in the 25-hydroxylase enzyme, which is another enzyme that required for vitamin D biosynthesis present in the liver.

- **Vitamin D-dependent rickets type II A (VDDR2A):**This type of rickets is also known as hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition. It is characterized by end-organ resistance to the active form of vitamin D. VDDR2A is caused by VDR gene mutations, and these mutations alter the VDR, often preventing the receptor from interacting with 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D. As a result, VDR cannot regulate gene activity, even with normal amounts of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D in the body.

- **Vitamin D-dependent rickets type II B (VDDR2B):**This is an unusual form of vitamin D-dependent rickets. It is caused by overexpression of a nuclear protein that interferes with normal vitamin D function, and the exact pathogenesis is unclear.

****Congenital hypophosphatemic rickets:****

- **FGF-23-dependent hypophosphatemic rickets:**It is characterized by an abnormality in phosphatonin, which regulates phosphate homeostasis. It is further classified into three forms, X-linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (most common type), autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets, and autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets.

- **FGF-23-independent hypophosphatemic rickets:**This type of rickets is not phosphatonin-dependent. Yet, FGF-23 levels are fairly normal. It is characterized by a pathology in the renal tubules that causes phosphate transport defects.

The main causes of rickets worldwide in older infants and toddlers are due to vitamin D deficiency, either due to nutritional deficiency or due to insufficient sun exposure. A study revealed 89% of the patients with rickets had no or minimal sun exposure.
