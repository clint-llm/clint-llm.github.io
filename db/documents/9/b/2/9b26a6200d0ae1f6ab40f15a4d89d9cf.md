The workup of suspected IgA pemphigus includes a skin biopsy to detect positive histologic and immunologic findings on direct and indirect immunofluorescence mentioned earlier.

Direct immunofluorescence is considered an early screening tool for the diagnosis of IgA pemphigus. With the use of direct immunofluorescence, one can detect the absence or presence of IgA autoantibodies on epidermal cell surfaces. Moreover, direct immunofluorescence can be used to differentiate IgA pemphigus from classic pemphigus by demonstrating minimal to no acantholysis. Indirect immunofluorescence can be a useful tool in detecting circulating IgA autoantibodies in a patient’s serum.

Histology of IgA pemphigus is useful in demonstrating the hallmark finding of intraepidermal neutrophilic infiltration. Specimens of blistering skin will show little to no acantholysis, with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate located either in the upper epidermis, mid, or lower epidermis based on the subtype of IgA pemphigus (SPD versus IND).
