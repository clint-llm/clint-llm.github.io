The bier block may be done by a nurse anesthetist, anesthesiologist, pain specialist, or even an interventional radiologist. All healthcare workers who perform the Bier block should be aware of the potential complications. According to the ASA Closed Claims Project from 1980-1999, there were only three reported cases of death or brain damage associated with IVRA. Some rare, but reported, severe adverse effects include local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST), preictal behavior, seizures, and cardiac arrest. Other less severe complications include the potential for nerve damage, compartment syndrome, skin discoloration or petechiae, and thrombophlebitis. The most common adverse event encountered during IVRA is tourniquet pain. It is important always to have resuscitative equipment in the room where the procedure is being performed.
