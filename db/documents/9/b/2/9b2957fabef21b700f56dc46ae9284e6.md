In general, the public of endemic areas must be made aware of the transmission of Echinococcus and that they should avoid contact with dogs. Once infected, the patient should receiveÂ education regarding the complications of echinococcal cysts. All the treatment options should be discussed thoroughly with the patient as to why one is superior to others. The clinician ought to inform the patient that these cysts tend to recur despite proper medical or surgical management. Finally, if cysts are amenable to drug therapy, strict compliance is key to eradicating the parasitic infection.

Endemic areas can benefit from mass screening using ultrasound as it will limit the disease in such areas.
