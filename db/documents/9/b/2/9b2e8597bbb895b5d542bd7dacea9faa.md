Patients with epithelial and stromal rejection may be asymptomatic or simply have mild ocular discomfort. In contrast, patients with endothelial rejection will usually present with visual disturbance and iritis symptoms. Epithelial rejection, diagnosed by a linear opacity stained with fluorescein, comprised up to 10% of all rejection episodes in one series and occurred on average three months after grafting.

If examined early after rejection symptoms begin, anterior chamber cell infiltration without flare or graft abnormality will be seen. When symptoms start later, the signs, in succession, are aggregated alloreactive cells adherent to graft endothelium, evident as keratic precipitates, endothelial line with precipitates, and localized edema corresponding to a rejection line or total graft edema. Visible graft precipitates on slit-lamp biomicroscopy imply focal and variable, but irreversible, endothelial cell loss, compromising endothelial pump function and resulting in stroma edema in those grafts with severe inflammation or low endothelial cell density before rejection onset.

On detailed slit lamp examination, the typical clinical signs of corneal graft rejection are rejection lines in the epithelium, subepithelial focal infiltrates, corneal edema, patchy stromal infiltrate, Khodadoust endothelial line, presence of keratic precipitates, neovascularization. A corneal graft is labeled immunological failed if the rejection episode doesn't clear even after 2 months of intensive treatment.

**Clinical Features of Various Types of Graft Rejection**

S. No

Type of Rejection

Clinical Presentation

1.

Epithelial

Epithelial rejection line starting from graft host junction and extending to donor graft, quiet eye, no corneal edema, no anterior chamber reaction. The time of onset is usually 3 months (1-13 months). The line stains with fluorescein or Rose Bengal. The suture infiltrates can also be seen, which progress centripetally known as Kay's dots. The average time of resolution is 1 to several weeks. Epithelial rejection is usually self-limiting, but some cases can have a persistent epithelial defect. Epithelial rejection rings have also been reported

2

Hyperacute stromal

Circumciliary congestion, patchy stromal infiltrates, stromal edema, and stromal haze, The patients can present with peripheral stromal haze. The infiltrate can also be seen as an abscess at the graft host junction more confined to the limits of the graft. The mild form is treatable. The severe form leads to necrosis, descemetocele, and frank perforation. Crystalline deposits in the stroma have also been reported.



3

Chronic stromal

There is a predominance of subepithelial infiltrates on the graft and is noticed late, usually between 2-5 months. They are usually present below the Bowman's layer in the donor graft. The rejection shows a prompt response to steroids.



4

Stromal and Endothelial rejection in a regraft

It starts from the host cornea, diffuse cells, and flare, but there is an absence of an endothelial rejection line. In the early stages, the stomal and endothelial components can be differentiated, but the differentiation is lost as the rejection progresses. The rejection needs prolonged steroid therapy.

5

Chronic focal

The patient presents with pain, redness, and blurred vision. The time of onset can vary from 8 months to 35 years. Epithelial and stromal edema, KPs at the back of the cornea, Khodadoust line, mild anterior chamber activity. This is more common in young patients, and the rejection rate is inversely proportional to the extent of vascularity.



**Unique Characteristics of Stromal Graft Rejection**

- The rejection band migrates away from the vascularized cornea.

- The rejection episode is followed by infiltration of blood vessels deep in the stroma

- Occasionally it can masquerade as a corneal abscess in densely vascularized corneas.

- The stromal haze involves the host cornea the areas adjacent to the corneal vascularization

**Classification of Endothelial Rejection**

- **Possible –**Graft edema builds up slowly, but there are no signs of inflammation or rejection

- **Probable**- Signs of inflammation present with anterior chamber reaction, KPs on endothelium, graft edema but no endothelial rejection line.

- **Definite-**All the above clinical features along with endothelial rejection line

**Characteristics of Graft Rejection in a Regraft**

- Usually noticed within two weeks of regraft (immune sensitization)

- The rejection episode is quiet and usually seen after 1 month of clear cornea

- There is a higher risk and high incidence of graft failure in a previously grafted eye

- The higher the graft number higher is the risk of rejection

- Absence of endothelial rejection line despite the uveitic episode

- Early involvement of the margin of the host cornea

- Intensive and prolonged corticosteroid therapy is needed to reverse an episode
