Lhermitte's sign (LS) is not a disease but more of a sign or symptom. The sign is suggestive of a lesion or compression of the lower brainstem or the upper cervical spinal cord. It is a paroxysmal sensation or neuropathic pain that can develop as a result of direct or indirect demyelinating lesions in the brain and/or spinal cord and is triggered by the flexion or movement of the neck. More specifically, the neck motion activates ascending spinothalamic tracts at the cervical level that has been sensitized by the underlying process that caused the cervical spine lesion.

Other etiologies that have been shown to cause this sign, in addition to multiple sclerosis, include conditions like Bechet's disease, transverse myelitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), herpes zoster, Arnold-Chiari malformation, tumor progression causing spinal cord compression, radiculopathy, cervical spondylitis, transverse myelitis, syringomyelia, vitamin b12 deficiency, nitric oxide toxicity, subacute combined degeneration of the cord, radiation myelopathy, and chemoradiation. It is preferentially present in patients with cervical demyelinating lesions and abnormal nerve conduction studies. It is not a sensitive or specific sign for any of the disorders mentioned. Neck flexion irritates demyelinated tracts in the posterior column, causing the electric sensation experienced by patients.
