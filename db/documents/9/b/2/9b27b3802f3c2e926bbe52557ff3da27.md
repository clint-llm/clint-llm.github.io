Hearing loss is generally categorized as sensorineural, conductive, or mixed. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) occurs with dysfunction within either the cochlea or any component of the neural pathways leading to and including the auditory cortex. Conductive hearing loss occurs due to disruption of sound conduction through the middle ear, the external ear, or both. Mixed hearing loss occurs due to both SNHL and conductive hearing loss.

Bone conduction evaluation is useful in differentiating between these three categories of hearing loss in patients whose diagnoses are uncertain, who require assessment of treatment progression, or who are predisposed to developing hearing loss and thus require periodic screening. Appropriate BC evaluation methods (PTA, ABR, or tuning fork tests) vary depending on the patientâ€™s age and ability to communicate, as well as the suspected mechanism of hearing loss and degree of diagnostic certainty required. Of note, some diagnoses may require further tests, including tympanometry, computed tomography, and otoacoustic emissions, none of which directly involve BC evaluation.

**Sensorineural Hearing Loss**

Common causes of SNHL include:

- Presbycusis

- Chronic metabolic and autoimmune conditions - e.g., diabetes

- Infection - e.g., meningitis, viral encephalitis

- Syndromic and nonsyndromic congenital disorders

- Ototoxic medications - e.g., platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents, loop diuretics, aminoglycoside antibiotics

- Neoplasm - e.g., vestibular schwannoma

- Head trauma

- Noise-induced hearing loss

**Conductive Hearing Loss**

Common causes of conductive hearing loss include:

- Congenital anatomic abnormalities - i.e., defects occurring anywhere from the pinna to the footplate of the stapes

- Cholesteatoma

- Obstruction - e.g., earwax, foreign body

- Tympanic membrane perforation - e.g., barotrauma

- Acute otitis media

- Otitis media with effusion

- Scarring of the middle ear - often related to recurrent infection or trauma

- Otosclerosis

- Ossicular discontinuity

- Neoplasm
