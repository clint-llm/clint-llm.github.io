Numerous drugs are undergoing clinical trial investigations. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) target downstream KIT signaling. A study evaluating the effect of multi-kinase inhibitor DCC-2618 on proliferation indicated a promising result that the agent can reduce the proliferation and survival of neoplastic mast cells. Therefore it can play a role in advanced systemic mastocytosis.
