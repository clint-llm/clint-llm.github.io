Evaluation for hereditary fructose intolerance usually begins with a test for reducing substances in a patient's urine with suggestive symptoms. The dipstick test for glucose is usually negative. Confirmatory testing can include genetic testing or measurement of aldolase activity in a liver biopsy sample. The high sensitivity and the non-invasive nature of aldolase B molecular genetic testing make it a favorable option. Molecular testing approaches exist and include single gene sequencing, multi-gene panels, and genomic testing.
