Unintentional CO poisoning is a leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States. The majority of these patients present to the emergency room. If the diagnosis is delayed, the outcomes can be abysmal. An interprofessional team approach to CO poisoning is necessary to prevent high morbidity. Once the diagnosis is made, it is necessary to consult with several health specialists including the physician in charge of the hyperbaric chamber. The key treatment is the administration of oxygen and close monitoring of the patient for mental status changes, arrhythmias, cardiac ischemia, and hypotension.

Once the patient is treated, the nurse plays a vital role in educating the patient and the family about installing CO detectors in the home. If the poisoning was an attempt at suicide, a mental health consultation should be obtained prior to discharge.

**Outcomes**

CO poisoning is very unpredictable in its outcomes. Even with prompt treatment, close to 40% of patients develop residual neurocognitive impairment. Patients need to be followed up for a few months to determine if a full recovery has occurred.
