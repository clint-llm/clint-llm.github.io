- Shock is a clinical manifestation of circulatory failure and is associated with high morbidity and mortality.

- There are broadly four types of shock: distributive, cardiogenic, hypovolemic, and obstructive.

- An accurate diagnosis requires a good understanding of underlying pathophysiology, clinical, biochemical, and hemodynamic manifestations of the different types of shock.

- Serum lactate level is a useful risk stratification tool in managing undifferentiated shock.

- Timely diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapy are of paramount importance as it can prevent progression to the reversible shock, multiorgan failure, and death.

- Treatment includes hemodynamic stabilization and correction of underlying etiology of shock.
