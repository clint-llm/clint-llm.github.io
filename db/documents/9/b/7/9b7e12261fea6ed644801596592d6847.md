**Telomere**

A telomere structure consists of repeats of non-coding nitrogenous bases (5'-TTAGGG-3'). In mammals, telomeres are highly conserved, indicating that this nuclear sequence remains relatively unchanged throughout the course of evolutionary biology.

The telomere is associated with six proteins that collectively create the Shelterin complex. This complex helps to create the final end cap structure of the chromosome. The associated proteins are described as follows: telomere repeat binding factor 1 (TERF1 or TRF1) regulates the telomere length. Telomere repeat binding factor 2 (TERF2 or TRF2) stabilizes the T-loop. Protection of telomeres 1 (POT1) inhibits DNA damage response at the single-stranded telomere overhang.

**Telomerase**

The synthesis of a telomere involves a reverse transcriptase telomerase, which functions as an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. Telomerase is present in germline and stem cells and has enhanced activity in cancer cells. This enzyme is responsible for elongating telomeres by de novo addition of TTAGGG sequences onto 3' chromosome ends to prevent replicative cellular senescence.

While the telomerase core complex mainly consists of the two main components, hTERC and hTERT, essential supportive proteins exist for the proper functioning of the entire telomerase structure. Tcab1, Gar1, Nhp2, Reptin, and Pontin, are proteins that are required for telomerase assembly and the proper recruitment of chromosomes.
