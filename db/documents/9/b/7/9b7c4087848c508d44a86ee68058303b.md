The supratrochlear nerve block is a special procedure, which can be utilized to relieve pain in the mid-forehead region. It can provide anesthesia for complex laceration repairs and trigeminal neuralgia, among many others. Unlike local infiltration, this regional nerve block does not distort local anatomy and can achieve significant analgesia with a minimum amount of local anesthetic. This activity describes the supratrochlear nerve block and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients who undergo supratrochlear nerve blocks.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the classic indications for a supratrochlear nerve block.
- Review the contraindications for a supratrochlear nerve block.
- Identify the common complications of performing a supratrochlear nerve block.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients receiving a supratrochlear nerve block.
