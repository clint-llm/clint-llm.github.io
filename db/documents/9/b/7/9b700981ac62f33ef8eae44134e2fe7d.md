Auto-brewery syndrome or gut fermentation syndrome is a condition in which ethanol is produced through endogenous fermentation by fungi or bacteria in the gastrointestinal (GI) system, oral cavity, or urinary system. Patients with auto-brewery syndrome present with many of the signs and symptoms of alcohol intoxication while denying the intake of alcohol and often report a high-sugar, high-carbohydrate diet. Several strains of fermenting yeasts and rare bacteria are identified as pathogens. This activity reviews the etiology and pathophysiology of auto-brewery syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its diagnosis and management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of auto-brewery syndrome.
- Review the evaluation of auto-brewery syndrome.
- Describe the treatment and management options available for auto-brewery syndrome.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with auto-brewery syndrome.
