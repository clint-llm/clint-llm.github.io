Children diagnosed with childhood disintegrative disorder rarely reveal an underlying neurological or medical cause. Complete medical and neurological examinations are done, and tests to exclude reversible  causes of the condition:

- Complete blood count

- Urea and electrolytes/glucose

- Liver function test

- Thyroid function test

- Heavy metal levels

- HIV testing

- Urine screening for aminoaciduria

- Neuroimaging studies (MRI or CT scan)

- Electroencephalogram (EEG)

These tests are usually done during the initial assessment in secondary care. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and neuroimaging studies are done to exclude the alternative diagnosis.

**DSM V criteria**

- Deficits in social interaction and communication

- Restricted interests, repetitive behavior, and activities

- These symptoms impair everyday functioning
