There is a very low frequency of hydatiform moles. In North America and Europe, the frequency has been described as 60 to 120/100,000 pregnancies for hydatiform moles. The frequency has been shown to be higher in other countries of the world. Certain risk factors increase the prevalence of molar pregnancies:

- Extremes of maternal age:
            
              
- Greater than 35 years old carries a  five to ten-fold increased risk risk
              
              
- Early teenage years, usually less than 20 years old

- Previous molar pregnancy increases the risk 1% to 2% for future pregnancies

- Women with previous spontaneous abortions or infertilities

- Dietary factors including patients that have diets deficient in carotene (vitamin A precursor) and animal fats

- Smoking
