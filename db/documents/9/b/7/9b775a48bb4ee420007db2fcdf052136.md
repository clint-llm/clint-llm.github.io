5-FU has many adverse drug effects when used systemically. The most common adverse effect reported in patients receiving systemic 5-FU treatment was diarrhea. Other common adverse effects include vomiting, nausea, and dehydration. More concerning side effects that require monitoring in patients receiving systemic 5-FU chemotherapy include neutropenia, pyrexia, pulmonary embolism, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. Leukopenia, leading to an immunocompromised state in these patients, can result in secondary pneumonia or sepsis.

The systemic side effect profile of topically applied 5-FU is minimal due to limited absorption. The most common adverse effect of the topical application of 5-FU is localized skin irritation, leading to ulceration and predisposing patients to infection. Other side effects of topical 5-FU therapy include pruritis, pain, erythema, crusting, and eczematous skin reactions.
