Patients typically present with “intestinal angina.” Postprandial abdominal pain occurring within 15 to 30 minutes and lasting up to 4 hours that is associated with a fear of eating, ultimately results in weight loss. Additional nonspecific symptoms include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, diarrhea, or constipation. The majority of patients will have a history of symptoms related to diffuse atherosclerotic disease, such as angina, transient ischemic attacks/cerebrovascular accidents, or lower extremity claudication. Physical exam may reveal diffuse mild abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding, but is more often normal. An abdominal bruit may be audible in up to 50% of patients, but is neither specific nor sensitive.
