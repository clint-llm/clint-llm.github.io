Patients affected with PAS-2 can face multiple challenges and may feel a significant burden due to the complexity of this disease. An interprofessional team approach for care and follow up of PAS-2 patients should be used because of the involvement of multiple endocrine and non-endocrine organs, and this team should be led by an endocrinologist. Interprofessional communications between different physicians taking care of the PAS-2 patient can be significantly improved by involving a case coordinator who can improve the quality of care. This can also prevent overtreatment and undertreatment. Treatment of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome in an interprofessional setting can improve outcomes.
