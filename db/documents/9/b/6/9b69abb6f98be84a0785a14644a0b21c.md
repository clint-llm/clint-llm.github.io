The skin flap in which the supraclavicular nodes lie within is mainly supplied by the supraclavicular vessels, which usually branch from the transverse cervical artery. When harvesting the lymph nodes without the skin paddle, they primarily receive blood supply the transverse cervical vessels. The transverse cervical artery originates from the thyrocervical trunk of the subclavian artery. After that, it courses transversely under the inferior belly of the omohyoid muscle and anterior to scalene muscle and the phrenic nerve as it reaches the levator scapulae muscle to give its branches. The transverse cervical artery offers various branches that pass through the supraclavicular nodes and supply them.
