When tachycardic rhythms fail to respond to pharmacologic treatment or present with or deteriorate into unstable manifestations, synchronized cardioversion is the treatment of choice. This activity reviews the guidelines for the provision of emergency synchronized cardioversion to victims of sudden cardiac arrest.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the approach to the management of tachycardic rhythms.
- Identify the difference between defibrillation and synchronized cardioversion.
- Describe the technique of synchronized cardioversion in treating unstable tachycardic rhythms.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team in performing synchronized electrical cardioversion.
