No precise test can accurately diagnose LBD. Usually, a thorough workup, including the following, is useful to reach an alternative working diagnosis or rules out similar conditions:

- Detailed history and examination

- Assessment of mental function

- Blood tests (e.g., vitamin B12 levels, chemistry panel, thyroid profile, syphilis, HIV) to rule out other causes of dementia

- Imaging studies (e.g., CT scan, MRI scan, SPECT scan, PET scan)

- Cerebrospinal fluid examinations have no significant role when conducted in these patients

- Sleep evaluation for REM sleep behavior disorder

Imaging studies are not helpful because the changes in the brain often mimic those seen in patients with vascular dementia.

The Lewy body composite risk score has been developed to assess patients with LBD. The checklist covers 10 questions that deal with motor symptoms, balance, stiffness, and non-motor symptoms.

Due to the incomplete specificity in the clinical diagnosis and the pathological definition of the disease, a postmortem biopsy or autopsy is the only method to secure a definite diagnosis.
