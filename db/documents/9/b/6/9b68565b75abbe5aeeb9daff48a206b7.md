Tobramycin is a potent and effective aminoglycoside antibiotic approved for treating complicated infections with various indications. Due to its weak binding affinity to the rRNA of eukaryotes, the drug can cause serious adverse events in patients.

Active participation and coordination among interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians and pharmacists, are essential to minimize adverse events and facilitate early detection. Implementing preventative measures to mitigate the risk of toxic adverse effects is paramount. This includes regularly assessing a patient's renal function and ensuring adequate hydration, which can help prevent acute kidney injury. The ordering clinician should collaborate with the pharmacy department to obtain dosing information, evaluate potential drug interactions, and gather tobramycin-specific antimicrobial spectrum data. The clinical nursing staff is responsible for administering the medication, closely monitoring for any adverse events, and assessing the effectiveness of the treatment. Effective communication and collaboration among the healthcare team members will ensure that any issues or concerns are promptly addressed and reported to the clinicians. This interprofessional coordination not only improves patient outcomes but also helps minimize adverse events associated with tobramycin therapy.

In the face of rising antibiotic resistance, the healthcare team must exercise judicious prescribing practices regarding tobramycin. The appropriate and limited use of tobramycin ensures its continued efficacy in the community.

To ensure appropriate prescribing practices, involving a board-certified infectious disease pharmacist with access to the latest antibiogram data is beneficial. Their expertise can help guide the selection and optimal use of tobramycin based on local resistance patterns. This is a vital aspect of antibiotic stewardship, emphasizing responsible antibiotic use.

The antibiotic stewardship program necessitates open communication and feedback among healthcare professionals, including medical microbiologists, infectious disease specialists, pharmacists, and infection prevention and control teams. Collaborative efforts in monitoring and optimizing antibiotic use can help combat antibiotic resistance and enhance patient care.

By implementing these strategies, the healthcare team can contribute to preserving the effectiveness of tobramycin and other antibiotics, ensuring their continued efficacy in treating infections and improving patient outcomes.

Caution is required when prescribing tobramycin to patients with neuromuscular junction disorders due to its potential to decrease acetylcholine. However, in complicated systemic infections, the interprofessional team can assess risks and benefits to consider tobramycin as a valuable treatment option. [Level 5]
