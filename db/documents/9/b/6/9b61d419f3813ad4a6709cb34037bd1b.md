Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful qualitative and quantitative analytical technique used to identify and quantify a wide range of clinically relevant analytes.

Most mass spectrometry data are presented in units of the mass-to-charge ratio, or m/z, where m is the molecular weight of the ion (in daltons) and z is the number of charges present on the measured molecule.

Sample preparation is critical to successful MS, particularly when dealing with complex matrices, such as are commonly encountered in clinical chemistry. This typically involves one or more of the following steps: (1) protein precipitation followed by centrifugation or filtration, (2) solid-phase extraction, (3) liquid-liquid extraction, (4) affinity enrichment, or (5) derivatization.

Mass spectrometers convert molecules into ions which are then manipulated by electric and magnetic fields.

- **Ion source**: a sample is put into the mass spectrometer, which is then ionized by the apparatus.

- **Mass analyzer**: ions are sorted in the device based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z).

- **Detector**: ions are measured and displayed on the mass spectrum chart.

Atoms and molecules must first be ionized before they can be accelerated through the mass spectrometer and detected.

A chart will be generated to analyze the mass spectrometer's results. The mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) is on the "x-axis," while the relative intensity is on the "y-axis."
