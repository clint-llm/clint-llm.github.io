There can be many different causes of blindness. The leading causes of blindness worldwide are cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and trachoma.

- **Cataracts**, a condition that causes yellowing and hardening of the lens in the eye, is the leading cause of blindness worldwide in developing and developed countries.

- **Age-related macular degeneration**, a condition that damages a part of the retina known as the macula, is the leading cause of blindness in Caucasians and those aged 65 and older.

- **Glaucoma**, a condition that damages the optic nerve, is the leading cause of blindness in African Americans.

- **Diabetic retinopathy**, a condition due to systemic diabetes, is the leading cause of new blindness in adults between 25 and 64 years of age.

- **Trachoma**is also on the list of leading causes. However, thankfully, the incidence is decreasing due to public health action.

The number of persons with reduced vision due to uncorrected refractive error exceeds that of those with the conditions mentioned above, however, uncorrected refractive errors can be easily treated or "cured" with proper vision correction.

Estimates are that approximately 90% of the visually impaired population live in developing countries or low-income circumstances and about 80% of all visual impairment worldwide can be prevented, treated, or cured with proper access to eye care.
