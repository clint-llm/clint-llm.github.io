There are two varieties of polycystic kidney disease based on inheritance: autosomal dominant (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive (ARPKD) types. These two forms have distinct clinical and genetic features.

ADPKD is a multisystem progressive cystic disorder. It is characterized by bilateral renal cysts, which progressively lead to fibrosis and architectural distortion of kidneys, and progressive renal failure.[

Cystic dilatation of renal tubules characterizes both ADPKD and ARPKD. ADPKD shows cysts of varying sizes which may show coarse calcifications and renal calculi. Cysts in ARPKD are mostly microcystic. Cysts in ADPKD can arise from anywhere along the nephron, most commonly from the collecting tube. However, cysts in ARPKD arise exclusively in the collecting tubule.
