The most commonly utilized histological stains for ear research are the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. This stain contains both acidic and basic dyes, which allows for a general visualization of anatomical structures and different cell types. Regarding the ear, the H&E stain provides for the study of the middle and inner ear structures in pathological models. The dyes can give relevant information about reactive inflammation and structural changes.

The trichrome stain contains three different dyes and is useful for distinguishing structures in samples. This stain can differentiate muscle from connective tissues like collagen and helps analyze reactive changes in response to inflammation.

Immunohistochemistry lets the researcher identify the specific location of proteins in samples. This technique has been used to detect markers for apoptosis, neural tissue, and changes in protein expression in pathologies such as otosclerosis.
