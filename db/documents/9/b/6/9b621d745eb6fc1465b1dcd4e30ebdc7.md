Constipation is a common complaint encountered in clinical practice, with a prevalence of 16% in all adults and 33% in adults older than 60 years. There is no universally applicable definition of constipation. Most physicians consider constipation as infrequent bowel movements, typically less than three per week. However, patients report constipation with a broader set of symptoms that may include difficulty passing stool, harder stool consistency, abdominal cramping, and incomplete stool evacuation.

The non-pharmacological management of chronic constipation starts with patient education and modifying dietary and lifestyle habits. It is essential to clarify to patients that not having a daily bowel movement is not abnormal or necessary. Increased physical activity is associated with lower rates of constipation.

There are different classes of laxatives used in the treatment of constipation:

- Bulk-forming laxatives (methylcellulose, psyllium)

- Osmotic agents (polyethylene glycol, lactulose, magnesium citrate)

- Stimulant laxatives (Bisacodyl, Senna)

- Surfactants/stool softeners (docusate, liquid paraffin)

- Lubricants (mineral oil)

- Prokinetic agents (tegaserod, cisapride)

- Newer Agents 
- Linaclotide: guanylate cyclase-C agonist stimulates peristalsis through increased fluid secretion and reduced visceral hypersensitivity.
- Lubiprostone: chloride channel activator stimulates intestinal secretion and improves motility.

Docusate or dioctyl sulfosuccinate is available in two salt preparations for the oral route - docusate sodium and docusate calcium. Docusate carries a "Human Over The Counter" (OTC) drug label and has the marketing status of  "OTC monograph not final" under the U.S National Library of Medicine, DailyMed resource. The FDA has not found the drug to be safe and effective, and the medication is not on the FDA list of approved drugs.

There no FDA-approved indications for docusate.

According to the product monograph, indications for docusate include avoiding difficult or painful defecation when peristaltic stimulants are contraindicated.

Docusate eases the passage of hard stools. This property can be helpful in patients with painful anorectal conditions or cardiac comorbidities. Stool softening occurs within 12 to 72 hours following initiation of therapy.

Docusate sodium is also used off-label as a ceruminolytic.
