Erb palsy should be differentiated from other injuries such as Klumpke injury, clavicular fracture, cervical ribs, osteomyelitis of the humerus or clavicle, and septic arthritis of the shoulder.

-In the case of Klumpke injury, there is paralysis of the forearm and hand muscle due to injury in C7, C8, and T1.  The neonate presents with a "claw hand" due to injury to the flexor muscles of the wrist, fingers, and forearm pronator. It also affects the intrinsic muscles. The neonate injury also may be associated with Horner syndrome due to the affection of T1, which will affect the dilators of the iris and elevators of the eyelid.

-A clavicular fracture can cause pseudoparalysis, which can be mistaken for Brachial plexus injury.

-Cervical ribs may predispose to Erb palsy by the stretching of nerves around the cervical rib or through concentrated pressure when the shoulder is forced against the cervical spine

-Osteomyelitis of the humerus or clavicle and septic arthritis of the shoulder can occasionally lead to a BPI, most likely due to thrombophlebitis of the vasa vasorum or an arterial embolism causing ischemic nerve damage.
