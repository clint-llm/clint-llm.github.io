Gunshot wounds are complex, violent, traumatic injuries commonly encountered in forensic practice. These injuries are caused by penetration of the body with projectiles ejected from a barrel due to the ignition of gunpowder. The study of these injuries is also called wound ballistics.

The injuries caused by the projectile can affect the permanent cavity, the damaged tissues along the path followed by the projectile, as well as the temporary cavity, the tissue surrounding the permanent cavity that is subject to temporary forces including radial acceleration, shear, stretch, and compression. While the forces causing the temporary cavity act for a brief period, the results could be longstanding.

The Forensic Pathologists examining a gunshot wound should document the type, size, shape, site, and location like in any other injury. Also, they are required to investigate and deliberate the cause and manner of the injury, the entry and exit characteristics, distance and direction of fire, and the vitality of the wound. Gunshot injuries may result in death due to hemorrhage, organ damage, and wound infection. This information can be extremely important in determining the manner of injury, especially in fatal wounds, to assist medico-legal and criminal investigation on whether the injury was suicidal or homicidal.

It is also essential to identify the path taken by the projectile to help determine the prognosis, workup, and treatment of gunshot wounds.
