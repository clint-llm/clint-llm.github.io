The greater trochanter is located at the neck of the femur and is characterized by its lateral quadrangular projection. The greater trochanter is the primary attachment site for the strong tendons facilitating hip abduction. The muscles of hip abduction are the tensor fascia latae, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus muscles.

The greater trochanter has four facets: anterior, lateral, posterosuperior, and posterior. The anterior facet is the site of insertion for the gluteus minimus tendon; the lateral facet is the site of insertion for the gluteus medius anterior tendon; the posterosuperior facet is the site of insertion for the gluteus medius posterior tendon.

Several bursae around the greater trochanter cofacilitate abduction with the abductor tendons; these include the subgluteus maximus, subgluteus medius, and subgluteus minimus bursae. Colloquially, the "trochanteric bursa" refers to the subgluteus maximus bursa located lateral to the greater trochanter between the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius muscles and deep to the ITB and fascia lata.

The superior gluteal nerve (L5 and S1) innervates the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus muscles.

Trochanteric bursitis may be caused by gluteal muscle overuse or injury, obesity, leg length discrepancy, direct trauma, or inflammation due to tendinopathy or tear of the gluteus medius or gluteus minimus muscles.
