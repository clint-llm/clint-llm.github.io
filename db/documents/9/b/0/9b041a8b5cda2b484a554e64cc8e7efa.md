Lymph nodes are the most usual sites of solid tumor metastases.

Indications for regional or radical lymphadenectomy depend on position and type of malignant tumor. The four most common examples of lymphadenectomy are radical neck dissection for thyroid as well as head and neck cancers, axillary lymph nodes for breast cancer, total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer, and D2 lymph node dissection for gastric cancers.
