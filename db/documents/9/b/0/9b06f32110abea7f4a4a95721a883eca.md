Human brain development starts during the third week of gestation and continues throughout the early childhood and late adolescent stages. The ectoderm, one of the three germ layers of the embryo, contributes to the development of the nervous system. The notochord and somites, although not directly involved in the formation of the nervous system, play a critical role in the migration and patterning involved in the development of the nervous system. During the third week of gestation, the formation of the neural plate marks the beginning of the development of the nervous system. Through the process of neurulation, a neural plate formation begins a foundation for the development of the neural tube. Along the neural plate midline the neural groove forms. On either side of each groove, a structure called neural fold forms. This groove continues to deepen until week 4. At the same time, the neural folds start to fuse, which extends both rostrally and caudally. At this stage, the neural groove becomes a neural tube, leaving the two ends of the tube open (neuropores). It is from the neural tube that the brain continues to develop. The primary brain vesicles (prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon) form from the rostral neural tube. The primary vesicles continue to develop into a different part of the brain. Prosencephalon becomes telencephalon, eventually becoming adult structures such as cerebral cortex, amygdala, pituitary, basal ganglia, and hippocampus. By the end of the eighth week of gestation, the foundation of the basic structures of the brain and CNS have formed.

The PFC is among the last structures to fully develop. During the early embryonic stages of growth and development, the cells of the PFC characteristically demonstrate significant proliferation followed by synapse elimination later in the stages of development. The extensive connectivity during early childhood undergoes pruning as a result of environmental interactions. Although the size of the brain approaches adult size by age 6, the cortex continues to develop through adulthood and adolescence.
