Cat scratch disease was historically thought to be transmitted through a scratch or bite from infected cats. Cats and the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis act as vectors for transmission of cat scratch disease.Pediculus humanus has been reported to be the predominant vector responsible for the transmission of trench fever caused by Bartonella quintana. Bartonella bacilliformis occurs by the bite of the female sandfly Lutzomyia.

Once inside the body, Bartonella targets CD34+ cells which are specialized white blood cells that act as precursors for endothelial cells which are cells that line blood vessels and other tissues. After its entry into the cell, it prevents the cell from self-destructing and also creates a vacuole a protective cyst around itself.

An endotoxin called lipid A which is commonly found in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria is the primary virulence factor for Bartonella. The ability of the organism to invade erythrocytes and endothelial cells plays a major role in the pathogenesis of the disease process. The organism alters the immune system in such a way that makes the host susceptible to infections by other bacterial pathogens. After this acute phase, the organism invades the endovascular, lymphatic, and other organ systems of the body contributing to multiple presentations of the disease.
