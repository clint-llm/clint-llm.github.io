Other travel-related infections such as typhoid, viral hemorrhagic fevers (such as Ebola, Lassa fever, etc.), hepatitis, dengue, and other arboviruses, enteric fever, avian influenza, tuberculosis, MERS-CoV infections, HIV, meningitis, and encephalitis can resemble malaria. Non-tropical infections such as bacterial pneumonia, septicemia, and influenza should be excluded.

Cerebral malaria can mimic bacterial meningitis, measles, (locally prevalent) viral encephalitis, toxic syndromes, and intracranial vascular or mechanical events.
