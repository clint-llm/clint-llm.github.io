In areas with poor access to advanced testing, this test serves as a valuable diagnostic tool to diagnose infections such as endemic typhus. Adequate training on testing techniques and clinical significance will allow the use of this test in patients and healthcare facilities with limited resources, thereby improving patient outcomes. The interprofessional team members should at least be familiar with this test and understand its value and results, leading to improved diagnosis and enhanced case management.
