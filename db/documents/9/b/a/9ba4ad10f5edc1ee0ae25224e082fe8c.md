Many medications are known to increase photosensitivity, which can increase the risk for skin cancer. These medications include but are not limited to tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), thiazide diuretics, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, retinoids, and St. John's wort.

Increasing research is being conducted on oral agents that can prevent or treat skin cancer. Low-dose capecitabine has been researched for the secondary prevention of nonmelanoma skin cancers in solid organ transplant recipients.
