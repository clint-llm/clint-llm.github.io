Data published by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) confirms a significant decline in the number of reported deaths from byssinosis between 1979 to 2010; however, comprehensive epidemiological data are lacking. Based on some older data, the quoted prevalence of byssinosis in the United Kingdom about 4%.

Outside of North America, byssinosis is not rare at all. In countries where cotton industries flourish, such as India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, byssinosis is common. In addition to the cotton industry, exposure to jute, hemp, and flex also cause byssinosis. The general population in these countries also smokes heavily which tends to exacerbate the symptoms. Despite modernization and introducing better working environments, byssinosis still is common in many parts of Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Turkey, and Sudan.
