The formation of digits in the hand occurs at a cellular level. The spaces between each digit form in a distal to proximal direction by two distinct processes of apoptosis and lysosomal enzyme-mediated cell death. In the early phases of cell death, the interdigital mesenchyme expresses high levels of caspase-activated DNases and normal levels of lysosomal DNases. In other words, apoptosis occurs at much higher levels than the enzyme-mediated lysosomal degradation. Apoptosis occurs when different death stimuli, or pro-apoptotic proteins, stimulate the mitochondria within the cells. The mitochondria release cytochrome C, which combines with different factors within the cell to create the “apoptosome.” This leads to the activation of many different caspases that ultimately activate the DNases. The fragmented cells are removed by phagocytosis. During the late phases of cell death, genes encoding superoxide dismutase and catalase are down-regulated. In other words, apoptosis occurs at very low levels, and enzyme-mediated lysosomal degradation occurs at high levels. Reactive oxygen species and cathepsins induce lysosomal-mediated cell death.
