Signs and symptoms include sudden onset of pain, redness, and swelling of an arm or leg. Ecchymotic lesions may develop. Typically, aÂ rash or sore develops where a heparin shot was given. Patients may experience weakness, numbness, or problems, or painful extremity movement.

The most common symptom of HIT is enlargement or extension of a blood clot or the development of a new blood clot. This may take the form of clots either in arteries or veins. Venous thrombosis may occur in the arm or leg in the form of deep vein thrombosis and the lung in the form of a pulmonary embolism; the latter most often originates in the leg and migrates to the lung.

In those receiving heparin IV, a complex of symptoms may occur. These include chills, fever, hypertension, tachycardia, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Others may develop a skin rash consisting of red spots.
