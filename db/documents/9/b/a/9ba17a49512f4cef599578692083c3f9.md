When should osteoporotic compression fractures be high on the differential diagnosis? Both men and women are subject to vertebral compression fractures. However, one in four women with vertebral fractures goes undiagnosed.

The acute trauma patient will undergo CT of the spine after securing the airway, ensuring breathing and hemodynamic stability. A full neurological evaluation, including rectal tone, is undertaken to assess spinal cord injury and classified under the ASIA scale. Intubated patients who are unable to participate in the exam will be evaluated based on reflexes and responses to painful stimuli. The basis for evaluation for vertebral fractures is in the clinical guidelines.

Back pain is often the chief complaint among patients diagnosed with vertebral erosion due to infection or bone disease. Palpating over the spine can identify areas of concern and warrant further imaging studies.
