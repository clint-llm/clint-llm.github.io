Nasopalatine duct cysts present as well-circumscribed radiolucencies noted in the anterior maxilla. Oftentimes, the nasal spine is superimposed on the image, giving the lesion a “heart-shaped” appearance. Clinically, these lesions can present as painless, firm swellings on the anterior hard palate crossing the midline with or without drainage.

Nasolabial cysts present as an asymptomatic swelling approximating the nasolabial region of the midface. They range from 1 to 5 centimeters in diameter.

Palatal cysts of the neonate are small, white to yellow nodules adjacent to the palatal midline.

Oral lymphoepithelial cysts present as yellowish-white nodules with relatively smooth surfaces. Most lesions present on the ventral surface or lateral borders of the tongue or the floor of the mouth but can be discovered on any oral mucosal surface associated with the Waldyer ring.

Epidermoid cysts present most commonly on the floor of the mouth as an asymptomatic slow-growing mass. They are typically not discovered until becoming large in size.
