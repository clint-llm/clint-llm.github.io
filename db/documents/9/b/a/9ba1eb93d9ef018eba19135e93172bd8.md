The coronary venous system generally receives minimal attention in the medical literature. Even though the coronary sinus is a major access site for many invasive cardiology procedures, healthcare professionals rarely encounter diseases related to the coronary venous system. The exception is congenital malformations. Coronary sinus thrombosis is a rare and severe condition that is usually a post-procedural complication following invasive right heart instrumentation. Sometimes the condition occurs spontaneously. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of coronary sinus thrombosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of coronary sinus thrombosis
- Review the presentation of coronary sinus thrombosis.
- Describe the treatment and management options available for coronary sinus thrombosis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of coronary sinus thrombosis and improve outcomes.
