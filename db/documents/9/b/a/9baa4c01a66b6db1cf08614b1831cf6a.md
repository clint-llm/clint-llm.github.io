Symptoms of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction can include mild to moderate symptoms of chest tightness, wheezing, coughing, and dyspnea that occurs within 15 minutes after 5 to 8 minutes of high-intensity aerobic training.

Risk factors include a personal or family history of asthma, a personal history of atopy or allergic rhinitis, exposure to cigarette smoke, participating in high-risk sports (see epidemiology), living and practicing in areas with high levels of pollution, and female gender. Some small studies suggest sugar-sweetened beverages may increase risk by increasing inflammation and adiposity.
