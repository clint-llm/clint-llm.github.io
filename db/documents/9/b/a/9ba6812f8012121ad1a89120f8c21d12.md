Cavernous sinus thrombosis is so rare that incidence data is difficult to estimate. Since cavernous sinus thrombosis comprises approximately 1% to 4% of cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis (CVST), which has an annual incidence of approximately two to four per million people per year, with a higher incidence in children, one can estimate that the annual incidence of cavernous sinus thrombosis might be approximately 0.2 to 1.6 per 100,000 per year.

A male or female predominance in cavernous sinus thrombosis is uncertain. Despite a 3:1 female predominance in cerebral venous thrombosis, this may not be the case for cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Weerasinghe reported a 2:1 male to female ratio in 88 septic adult cases. Similarly, Thatai et al. and Smith et al. report a slight male preponderance in 35 and 12 cases, respectively.

Historically, cerebral venous thrombosis has been reported to be more common in children and neonates than in adults, although the effects of routine vaccination and frequent use of antibiotics (such as for otitis) on this relationship are uncertain.

The incidence and mortality may be decreasing likely due to the availability and use of antibiotics.
