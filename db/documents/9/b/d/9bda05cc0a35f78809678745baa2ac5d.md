This is an autoimmune disorder and affects neonates born to mothers with autoimmune myasthenia gravis. Neonatal MG occurs due to the transplacental passage of antibodies directed against various neuromuscular junction antigens. The most common antigen isÂ the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Another important antigen is the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSKR).
