Before initiating therapy, patients with IPAH should undergo vasoreactivity testing to determine if the patient would have a response to calcium channel blockers (CCB). The test involves administrating a vasodilator (nitric oxide, epoprostenol, adenosine) during right heart catheterization and is considered positive if the mean pulmonary artery pressure decreases by 10 mmHg and to a value less than 40 mmHg. Additionally, the patient’s cardiac output should increase or remain unchanged and without a drop in systemic blood pressure. These patients may benefit from calcium channel blockers such as dihydropyridine, nifedipine, or diltiazem.

For patients classified as WHO Class II, endothelin-blocking antagonists such as ambrisentan or bosentan, in addition to phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors sildenafil, are recommended (strength A recommendation). For WHO Class III, in addition to ambrisentan or bosentan plus sildenafil, intravenous (IV) epoprostenol or inhaled iloprost can be used (strength A recommendation). Epoprostenol IV and inhaled iloprost are both prostacyclin analogs causing dilation of pulmonary vessels, inhibiting platelet aggregation, and smooth muscle proliferation. If there is an inadequate clinical response, therapeutic alternative for prostacyclin analog for WHO Class III patients include subcutaneous treprostinil (strength B recommendation). Tadalafil may also be an option if the patient does not tolerate sildenafil.

For patients classified in WHO Class IV, intravenous epoprostenol is the mainstay therapy. If an inadequate clinical response remains, combination therapy, including prostanoids, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and endothelin-blocking antagonist, merits consideration. Further options for end-stage or rapidly progressive IPAH patients include atrial septostomy and/or lung transplant. Other adjunctive therapies to be considered on a case-by-case basis include oxygen and diuretics to maintain euvolemia.
