The xiphoid process is used as a landmark to determine the correct location for hand placement during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). It is essential while performing CPR not to compress at the xiphoid process as this bone is very soft, which may lead to fracture of the xiphoid and can lead to severe trauma to underlying vital organs such as the liver, heart, and diaphragm.

Xiphoid syndrome is an uncommon condition presenting as painful swelling and discomfort around the xiphoid process and the epigastric region. There are limited research and case presentations related to the xiphoid syndrome. However, case studies describing this syndrome have documented that patients complain of tenderness and light pressure over the xiphoid process.

The diffuse nature of pain in the xiphoid syndrome can be explained as pain referred from the inflamed joint itself, the xiphesternal joint, or radiating from the structures attached to the body of the xiphoid. Because xiphoid syndrome is an uncommon and under-described syndrome, patients can go undiagnosed for many years. Several case reports discuss the use of local anesthetic or steroidal injections around the xiphoid process leading to improvement of the symptoms of xiphodynia.
