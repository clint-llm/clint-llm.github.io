Scraping from the surface of the lesion will show sclerotic bodies. They are brownish septate cells seen singly or in clusters. The surface is scraped, and 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) is added to the scrapings, which the examiner then viewed under the microscope.

Histopathology will show pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia of the epidermis. The dermis shows granuloma composed of epithelioid cells and Langhans giant cells. There can be collections of eosinophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Within the giant cells and also free in the tissue, dark brown thick-walled ovoid or spheric spores (sclerotic bodies/medlar bodies/copper pennies) are visible. In culture, the colonies of all species are dark grey-green to black and velvety or downy with a black reverse. Three forms of conidial production exist; acropetal budding, production of phialides, and sympodial conidiation.
