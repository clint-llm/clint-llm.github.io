Auscultation is not a very sensitive technique to make a diagnosis of an innocent murmur. When a murmur is detected on a routine physical exam, aÂ thorough patient exam is necessary. The decision to obtain an echo depends on physical findings and patient symptoms. In general, when a patient is designated to have an innocent murmur, close follow up is required to ensure that the murmur either disappears or that no cardiac symptoms develop.
