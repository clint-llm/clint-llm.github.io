Currently, there is a paucity of evidence for the optimal management of Irukandji syndrome, both from an individual patient standpoint, as well as a population. More research is required and will likely require collaboration between multiple specialties, including, but not limited to, marine biologists, ecologists, medical practitioners, toxicologists, and social scientists.

An early warning system to detect Irukandji-causative species is currently in development by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the Australian Governmentâ€™s federal research agency, employing methods such as advance cameras, traditional net sampling, and statistical models using historical environmental data from the Australian Venomous Jellyfish Database (AVJD) to help predict when stings are at greatest risk of occurring. (Condie et al. 2018)

At the local level, properly developed and implemented emergency medical service protocols in regions where Irukandji syndrome is likely to occur can allow for prompt treatment for patients in the pre-hospital setting. Patients with Irukandji syndrome are best managed by an interprofessional team approach.

Advances in scientific evidence, detection modalities, and regional protocols will likely decrease disease incidence, improve patient outcomes, and lessen the socio-economic impact.
