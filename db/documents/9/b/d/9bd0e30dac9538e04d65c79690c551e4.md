Clinicians should suspect Heyde syndrome in any patient who presents with the triad of aortic stenosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and evidence that supports the presence of AVWS. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes any number of etiologies that can manifest as one or several of the symptoms without meeting the complete triad required for the diagnosis of Heyde syndrome. Notable examples include:

- Gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the absence of aortic valve diseases, such as peptic ulcer disease, diverticular disease, or gastrointestinal malignancy.

- Aortic valve disease in the absence of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as isolated aortic stenosis/sclerosis, aortic calcification

- Disorders of hemostasis, such as hemophilia, VWF deficiency, thrombocytopenia, or clotting factor disorders. Both acquired and inherited disorders should be considered.

Aortic stenosis and gastrointestinal angiodysplasia are common findings, especially in older patient populations. As such, these conditions may coexist incidentally without causing any VWF-related disorders of hemostasis. Therefore, clinicians should perform a further assessment in patients who present with these findings.
