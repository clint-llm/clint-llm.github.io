The rhombic flap is a random-pattern local flap that relies on blood supply through the subdermal plexus. Anatomically this plexus is located at the junction between the reticular dermis and the subcutaneous layer. From this plexus, arterioles pass superiorly to supply the dermis and epidermis via the dermal and subepidermal plexuses.

To successfully transpose and advance the flap from an area of relative skin laxity, careful orientation is advised. This involves awareness of the lines of maximal extensibility (LMEs) and the relaxed skin tension lines (RSTLs) or Langer lines. The rhombic flap should be orientated so that the short diagonal axis of the flap is perpendicular to the RTSLs.

Particularly in the head and neck region - attention to preserving divisions between aesthetic subunits is important for cosmesis. Placement of incisions in existing creases and in borders between subunits functions to leave the least conspicuous scar.
