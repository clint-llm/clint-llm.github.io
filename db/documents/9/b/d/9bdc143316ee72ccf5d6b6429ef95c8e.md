The extensor hallucis longus muscle inserts into the dorsum of the base of the distal phalanx of the big toe. However, several variants exist that may possess one or more accessory tendinous slips that insert into other neighboring bones or tendons. These physiologic variants are clinically significant because the extensor hallucis longus muscle can be used in tendon transfer surgeries to correct conditions such as hallux varus, talipes equinovarus, and clawed hallux associated with a cavus foot.

- Pattern 1 (65%): single tendinous insertion on the dorsal aspect of the base of the distal phalanx of the big toe

- Pattern 2 (26.7%): muscle-tendon terminated in two tendons

- Pattern 3 (8.3%): muscle terminated in three tendinous slips

Knowledge of the extensor hallucis variants is crucial for radiologists and surgeons to prevent adverse surgical events in tendon transfer surgeries.
