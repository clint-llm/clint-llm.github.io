Globe rupture can either occur due to an object penetrating the ocular tissues or by blunt trauma. Blunt trauma can cause an acute rise in intraocular pressure and cause a rupture in the location where the eye is the weakest. In eyes that have not had surgery, the rupture is most commonly posterior to the extraocular muscles where the sclera is the weakest. In eyes that have had previous intraocular surgery, the rupture is often at the prior incision site. The eye also commonly ruptures at the limbus in blunt trauma. In clinical models, pressures of greater than 7000 mm Hg may be needed to rupture the globe.
