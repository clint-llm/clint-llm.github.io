There is no agreement among the anesthesiology community exactly what the standard of care for blood glucose levels should be, but there is consensus to aim for blood glucose levels below 180 mg/dL; more aggressive goals may cause hypoglycemia. Recent metanalysis revealed there is no difference in mortality in patients treated with very tight glucose control (BG less than 110 mg/dL), tight glucose control (111 to 150 mg/dL), and liberal blood glucose control (BG less than 220 mg/dL).
