Acetaminophen has been associated with fatal hepatic necrosis if taken at doses more than 4 g per day, especially with the ingestion of another acetaminophen-containing product. Furthermore, large doses may cause difficulty with breathing. In overdose, activated charcoal should be the first attempted intervention before N-acetylcysteine (NAC). For patients presenting for 4 hours or later, the serum acetaminophen level should be obtained promptly.

Hydrocodone intake may lead to life-threatening respiratory depression, especially if taken together with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants. In case of overdose, the first step is to protect the airways and place the patient on invasive ventilation assistance, if needed. The opioid antagonists, nalmefene or naloxone, are specific antidotes for respiratory depression. Opioid antagonists should be avoided in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression. In addition, there is a high risk of precipitating acute opioid withdrawal in an individual who is physically dependent on opioids.
