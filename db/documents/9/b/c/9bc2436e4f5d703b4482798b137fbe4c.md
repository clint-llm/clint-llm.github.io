Urogenital Schistosomiasis is an endemic disease causing a variety of chronic issues in millions of people in Africa and the Middle East. It is easily treatable with praziquantel if there is a high index of suspicion, particularly in endemic areas. The WHO has several easily accessible resources for healthcare providers to utilize in the diagnosis and treatment of UGS and FGS. One such resource is the WHO Pocket Atlas for FGS, available on their website.

Healthcare providers in non-endemic countries must also remember to consider Schistosomiasis in the evaluation and treatment of individuals presenting with acute or chronic symptoms who have previously traveled to endemic countries.

Healthcare professional and organizational initiation of community or school-wide mass treatment programs in endemic areas would considerably reduce disease burden.  Mass treatment of urogenital Schistosomiasis may also be a cost-effective way to reduce HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa.
