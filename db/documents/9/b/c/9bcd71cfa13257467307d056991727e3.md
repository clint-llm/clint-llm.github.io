- A true lateral mammogram can be useful to distinguish benign calcifications from malignant calcifications, such as milk of calcium deposits.

- Diffuse, scattered, similar bilateral findings favor a benign result.

- Focal pain is not a sign of malignancy though ultrasound can serve as a reassurance tool for patients.

- Thermoablation is currently under assessment as a treatment option for benign and malignant lesions.

- The American Society of Breast Surgeons has raised a warning in the assessment and has released a statement for the use of ablative treatment.

- The statement concludes that ablative techniques are currently investigational and should not be performed in the United States unless part of a clinical research trial.
