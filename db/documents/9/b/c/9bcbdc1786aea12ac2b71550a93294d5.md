Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis can be diagnosed clinically due to the characteristic appearance of the lesions. A skin biopsy can be performed if there is doubt. Dermoscopy can be a useful tool for evaluating disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis.

Nicola et al. proposed dermoscopic features seen in porokeratotic lesions.

- A white border circumscribing the lesion

- Homogenous central white scar-like area

- Brownish globules or dots

- Vascular structures: pinpoint vessels or irregular linear vessels crossing the lesion
