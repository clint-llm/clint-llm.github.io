EEG is the key tool for the diagnosis of epilepsy. Surface EEG provides the best overview of the approximate location of the epileptogenic zone. The interictal and ictal EEG findings are essential for the confirmation and classification of the disorders. Invasive EEG is used only used if the zone cannot be located with non-invasive diagnostic methods, and there is a good chance of finding essential localizing information, and the area is potentially resectable. Intracranial EEG with subdural or intraparenchymal electrodes can localize the seizure focus and map the areas where it is required to plan the surgery.
