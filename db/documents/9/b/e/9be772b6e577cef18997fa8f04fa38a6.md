Duplex ultrasound is an integral tool for medical diagnosis and therapy. Duplex ultrasonography combines the principles of anatomic and flow ultrasonography to deliver diagnostic information to the interpreter. Doppler ultrasonography refers to the utilization and application of the Doppler effect to sound wave information to interpret movement or flow within tissues. It is important to have a basic knowledge of the physical principles of ultrasound technology in order to effectively perform and interpret duplex ultrasounds. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications and the advantages of ultrasound in clinical practice and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing ultrasounds.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for ultrasound.
- Explain the physical principles of ultrasound imaging.
- List the limitations of ultrasound.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care and improving patient outcomes with the utilization of ultrasound imaging.
