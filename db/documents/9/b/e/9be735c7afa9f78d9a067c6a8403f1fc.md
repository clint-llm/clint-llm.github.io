Since the first reported cases of COVID-19 from Wuhan, China in December 2019 and the subsequent declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the WHO after it spread to more than 100 countries, this highly contagious infectious disease has spread to 218 countries so far with more than 90 million cases, and more than 1.93 million deaths reported globally. It is well-known that elderly patients aged >65 years and patients with specific underlying medical comorbidities (severe obesity, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, being a smoker, post-transplant patients on chronic immunosuppressants) are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection.

Similarly, the severity of infection and mortality related to COVID-19 differ between different ethnic groups
