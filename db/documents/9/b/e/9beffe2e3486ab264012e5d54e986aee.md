Tobacco use has been cited as the cause of approximately 90% of all lung cancers. Patients that currently smoke with 40 pack/year smoking history have twenty times the likelihood of developing lung cancer than a non-smoker. This risk can increase if further environmental or lifestyle exposures are compounded with tobacco use, such as asbestos exposure.

Worldwide, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in men and the second most common in women. There is a wide variation in lung cancer incidence of different populations based on the prevalence of tobacco use in various countries. The incidence of lung cancer directly relates to the increase or decrease in the rate of smoking in different populations. For example, in the United States, the age-adjusted mortality rate is projected to decrease by 79 percent between 2015 and 2065 due to decreased rates of tobacco use and anti-smoking campaigns.
