Electroencephalogram (EEG) is essential in the diagnosis of seizures and psychogenic non-epileptic spells. It is important to distinguish between pathologic activity and similar-appearing normal physiologic findings. Various terminologies are used, such as: "normal variants," "benign variants," "pseudo-epileptiform patterns," or "epileptiform patterns without proven relation to seizures." Benign epileptiform variants in an electroencephalogram should be identified to assist primary care providers, neurologists, and nurses provide optimal care.

Recognition of these EEG waveforms should be part of an interprofessional team approach to diagnosis and interpretation. While the neurologist has the ultimate say in diagnosis, input from other clinicians, NPS and PAs, and even rad techs can be informative to arrive at an accurate clinical picture, which will improve patient care and outcomes.
