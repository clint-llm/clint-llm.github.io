Delayed bowel movement or passage of flatus is the hallmark of postoperative ileus. Common symptoms include abdominal distension, bloating, diffuse, persistent pain, nausea, vomiting, inability to pass flatus, and intolerance to an oral diet. Physical exam findings are also typically non-specific, but often patients can have distended, tympanic abdomens on exam associated with absent or sluggish bowel sounds. Tenderness or rebound tenderness should be further investigated for other more serious causes.
