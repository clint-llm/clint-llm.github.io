It is possible for keloids to appear spontaneously without predisposing cutaneous trauma, but most patients present with a history of surgical incisions or trauma to the skin. A mature scar should be flat and light-colored, but improper wound healing can lead to the formation of hypertrophic scars or keloids. Hypertrophic scars are elevated, erythematous, and occasionally pruritic but confined to the borders of the initial injury. Keloids are similar to hypertrophic scars in that they are elevated, erythematous, and sometimes pruritic but differ from hypertrophic scars in that they expand beyond the original borders of injury and can invade surrounding tissue.Â  The resulting keloid causes not just a physical disturbance, but can also lead to functional impairment, cosmetic distortion, and psychological distress.

Keloid lesions can be classified into minor or major types. Minor keloids are small and focal scars with an elevation of less than 0.5 cm, while major keloids are larger and can have an elevation greater than 0.5 cm. Both types can invade surrounding tissue and continue to grow years after the initial injury. They generally do not regress on their own and can recur after surgical excision. Keloids can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most commonly seen on the neck, earlobes, chest, shoulder, upper back, sternum, knees, and ankles.
