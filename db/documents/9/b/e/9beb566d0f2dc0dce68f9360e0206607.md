The primary cause of abnormal pap smears is associated with infection by human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV serotypes 16/18 are the most common strains that cause cervical cancer.

The carcinogens in the smoke disseminate throughout the body and are identifiable in cervical mucus. These carcinogens can alter the oncogene balance within these cells results in cancerous growth. Research also shows that women who have a high number of full-term pregnancies are at an increased risk of developing cervical cancer.

Additionally, patients who have HIV or are immunocompromised have an increased risk of acquiring HPV, which can lead to cervical cancer. Both of these reduce the ability of the immune system to clear the virus.

From a more historical reference, children who had their mother take diethylstilbestrol (DES) during the pregnancy are at elevated risk of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix.
