# Continuing Education Activity

Ophthalmomyiasis is a clinical condition wherein the larvae of different flies either inhabit the ocular surface or get inside the eye. This clinical condition arises out of the accidental encounters of flies carrying larvae and is more commonly reported amongst shepherds or those involved in animal husbandry. To avoid the morbidity and rarely mortality associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the clinical features and treatment of ophthalmomyiasis and highlights the role of early diagnosis to avoid its complications. A well-coordinated communication between the interprofessional team and the ophthalmologists helps treat the condition at the earliest opportunity.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors of ophthalmomyiasis.
- Summarize the epidemiology and pathophysiology of the disease.
- Describe the common clinical presentations of ophthalmomyiasis, close differentials, and management.
- Outline the complications and the interprofessional team’s role in improving patient care in patients with ophthalmomyiasis.

# Introduction

Maggot infestations of humans are not uncommon. Ocular surface infestation is a well-known fact and has been reported from different parts of the world.

The disease is often underreported and adds to morbidity. Considering the rarity of the disease, the presentation of the disease needs to be known to have a strong suspicion. It was considered to be associated with poor hygiene.

# Etiology

The type of ophthalmomyiasis depends on the nature of larvae. Facultative parasites require dead necrotic tissues, whereas obligate parasites require vital living tissues and tend to penetrate intraocularly.

1. Oestrus ovis (sheep botfly)

2. Phaenicia lucilia

3. Dermatobia hominis

4. Musca domestica

5. Hypoderma tarandi (cattle botfly)

6. Fannia (latrine fly) and alliphora, Lucilla, Sarcophaga, Gasterophilus, Callitroga, Cuterebra Dermatobia, Wohlfahrtia, Oedemagena, Chrysomya bezziana and Cochliomyia.

Oestrus ovis larvae are the commonest cause of ophthalmomyiasis externa. Larvae of Dermatobia hominis, Chrysoma bezziana, Hypoderma tarandi, Cephenemyia trompe are found to be responsible for ophthalmomyiasis interna.

# Epidemiology

Ophthalmomyiasis is primarily seen in people working closely with animals, like people involved in animal husbandry and farmers.

At times accidental encounters with gravid female flies result in the darting of larvae into the conjunctival sac.Oestrus ovis and Dermatobia hominis have been reported from India, Afghanistan, Iran, America, France, South Africa, and the Middle East.Rhinoestrus purpureus and Rhinoestrus usbekistanicus are similar to Oestrus ovis and are responsible for external ophthalmomyiasis in Russia and Siberia.

Most of the cases of ophthalmomyiasis are seen in the tropical and subtropical regions and are largely responsible for external ophthalmomyiasis. However, ophthalmomyiasis have also been reported from the Nearctic areas (northern Canada). The Hypoderma tarandi and Cephenemyia trompe are the flies responsible for ophthalmomyiasis interna and are primarily seen in Nearctic circumpolar regions. Other predisposing factors for ophthalmomyiasis are open surgical wounds, old age, debilitating conditions, and poor general health.

# Pathophysiology

The direct encounter with flies carrying larvae is the primary cause of ophthalmomyiasis externa. The flies drop the larvae over the ocular surface during this encounter. The most common cause of external ophthalmomyiasis globally is Oestrus ovis, and it reaches the human eye either by flies or by contaminated hands.

Even for ophthalmomyiasis interna, the mechanism of reaching the ocular surface largely remains the same; however, in ophthalmomyiasis interna, cephaloskeleton and proteolytic enzymes secreted by the larvae may play an important role in ocular penetration. It is said that there exists a symbiotic relationship between the larva and the bacteria it carries. The larvae produce toxins and kill the tissues around and make the proteins available for proteolytic digestion by the bacteria. The proteolytic degradation, in turn, provides nutrition to the larvae.

These facilitate penetration of the larvae intraocularly.****The larvae can also reach ocular tissues via the hematogenous route.

# Histopathology

On histopathological examination of the larva, translucent to clear ovoid segmented structures are noted. Multiple rows of spicules at each segment and the terminal hooks are also noted on histopathological examination.

# History and Physical

In ophthalmomyiasis, the patient will often have a history of working closely with animals like goats, sheep, reindeer, and caribou, depending on the geographical location.Oestrus ovis, a history of the fly hitting the eye may be elicited. In external ophthalmomyiasis, the patient can present with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute bacterial or viral conjunctivitis.

The external ophthalmomyiasis caused by Dermatobia hominis results in eyelid nodular swelling simulating chalazion. The chalazion-like lesions have small larvae protruding from the center of the lesion on the palpebral conjunctiva.

The patients with ophthalmomyiasis interna often present with photopsia, pain, and floaters.

Orbital myiasis is considered the most dangerous, with a potential for intracranial spread. This is mainly seen in severely debilitated patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, old age, and poor general health.

# Evaluation

Patients with ophthalmomyiasis externa can be misdiagnosed as viral/ bacterial conjunctivitis. A thorough examination of the fornices is mandatory. The larvae of Oestrus ovis are photophobic and tend to hide in the fornices.Dermatobia hominis has a central hole through which larva can be seen.

In cases of ophthalmomyiasis interna, a dilated fundus examination aids in the diagnosis. Clinically, multiple subretinal tracks can be seen, which are evident on optical coherence tomography as hypo-reflective areas.

Fundus autofluorescence may reveal the subretinal tracks. For specific diagnoses, entomologists are involved. The first instar larva of Oestrus ovis contains hooks located more anteriorly attached to the cephalo-pharyngeal skeleton. For orbital myiasis, the imaging of orbit, brain, and paranasal sinuses is necessary. The larva should be sent for entomological examination in 70% ethanol.

# Treatment / Management

The external ophthalmomyiasis is usually self-limiting.

Ivermectin 1% solution in propylene glycol and ivermectin with 0.6% povidone-iodine was used as a larvicidal agent in an in-vitro study. Both the agents are effective larvicidal agents; however, the ivermectin 1% solution with 0.6% povidone-iodine kills the larvae as early as 10 minutes.

In cases of ophthalmomyiasis interna, a living subretinal larva can be killed by photocoagulation outside the macular area.

In ophthalmomyiasis interna caused by onchocerciasis,

The subretinal fly can sometimes exit the eye through the optic nerve. In the meanwhile significant decrease in vision can be noted. Treatment of optic nerve involvement with systemic ivermectin and steroids may help with visual restoration.

Intracranial spread is the most feared complication of orbital myiasis.

In orbital myiasis topical 4% xylocaine and turpentine oil, packing is indicated to immobilize the larvae. Subsequently, the larvae are removed manually. The patient is also started on oral and topical antibiotics.

# Differential Diagnosis

The ophthalmomyiasis externa mimics adenoviral conjunctivitis. The punctate hemorrhages due to microtrauma by larval spines are very similar to those seen in adenoviral conjunctivitis.

The anterior ophthalmomyiasis interna and anterior uveitis both present with severe anterior chamber reaction. However, in the anterior ophthalmomyiasis interna, the larva can also be seen in the anterior chamber.

The posterior ophthalmomyiasis can often be confused with isolated exudative retinal detachment. So a case of exudative retinal detachment should be thoroughly examined, especially in the endemic zones with a history of exposure.

Diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis (DUSN) is an important differential diagnosis of ophthalmomyiasis interna (posterior). The subretinal tracts are usually thinner, and the causative organisms here are nematode larvae.

Usual presentation in the acute phase is vitritis, disc edema, and crops of white retinal lesions with possible detection of a moving nematode.****Such nematodes must be neutralized by laser urgently as these may move rapidly and may be undetectable later.****In the late phase, there are features of unilateral retinitis pigmentosa characterized by the pallor of the optic disc, retinal arteriolar attenuation, and pigmentary changes in the retinal periphery.

Tunga penetrans (chigoe flea) burrow into the skin and may mimic Dermatobia hominis larvae.

# Prognosis

The external ophthalmomyiasis is a self-limiting condition and usually does not cause any significant damage to the ocular surface directly or cause any sequelae.

Despite extensive involvement of the retinal pigment epithelium, visual symptoms may be less, and good visual recovery is possible.

# Complications

The complications can vary from minor ocular symptoms to permanent visual loss. It can also cause disfigurement and can also cause death.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

The people working in close association with animals should be watchful about any ocular symptoms. They should consult ophthalmologists at the earliest if ocular symptoms arise. The development of ocular symptoms following an encounter with a fly should not be taken lightly.

Prevention has always been better than cure. Good personal hygiene can avert significant complications caused by ophthalmomyiasis. Previously efforts were made to let sterilized flies mate with fertile male flies in an attempt to control the ophthalmomyiasis outbreaks caused by flies. Ivermectin controlled-release capsules can also be used to prevent an animal infestation with bot fly and thus subsequent ophthalmomyiasis.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Ophthalmomyiasis can be treated efficiently and effectively if identified in time. Usually, the patients are from the countryside, and the earliest point of contact is vision center optometrists. The prompt identification of symptoms in high-risk groups should be referred appropriately to the ophthalmologists. Open communication between these professionals facilitates early identification and treatment of the condition and spreads awareness.

Awareness among healthcare workers serving in the areas with more commonly reported cases is the only way to mitigate the impact of the disease. Synchronized activity between sensitized health care workers and ophthalmologists can decrease morbidity significantly. Better communication between a parasitologist and the treating physician helps make an accurate diagnosis and can also help formulate a customized treatment depending upon the species identified.
