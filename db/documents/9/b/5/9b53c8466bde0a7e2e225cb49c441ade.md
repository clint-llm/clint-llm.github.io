Rectum is the continuation of the sigmoid colon, and it is a tubular structure that begins at the level of S3 and changes into the anal canal at the anorectal hiatus formed by the innermost fibers of puborectalis. It has two major flexure, i.e., sacral and anorectal flexures. It also has three additional lateral flexures. Levator ani muscle provides support to the rectum inferiorly. The fascia of Waldeyer anchors it to the curve of sacrum posteriorly. Laterally, it is supported by the lateral ligaments of the rectum. Denonvillers fascia supports it anteriorly in males and the rectovaginal fascia in the case of females.

**Relations:**

The rectum is related posteriorly with sacral plexus and sympathetic trucks. Anteriorly, it is related to the urinary bladder, prostate, seminal vesical, and rectovesical pouch in males and uterus, cervix, vagina, and the pouch of Douglas in females. These sacs contain sigmoid colon and coils of the small intestine. The anal canal is supported by fibromuscular structures, including the perineal body in front and the anococcygeal body from behind.
