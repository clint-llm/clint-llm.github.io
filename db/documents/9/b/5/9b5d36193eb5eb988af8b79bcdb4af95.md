The evaluation and examination of the ocular and systemic health prior to refractive procedures is usually the gold standard in clinical careÂ because the age of most presbyopic subjects increases the risk for chronic age-related ocular and systemic morbidities.

Some presbyopic subjects may not know their systemic and ocular health status and may be presenting for the first time to the hospital.

Thorough clinical history, which normally initiates the rapport between the patient and the practitioner, can aid in determining the last patient check-up, essential underlying clinical conditions, and ocular risk factors, as well as giving insight into ulterior testing that may be needed for proper diagnosis and treatment.
