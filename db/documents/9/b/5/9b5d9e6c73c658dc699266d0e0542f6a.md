Performing surgery in the cavernous sinus is challenging given the fact that it contains vital neuronal structures and elevated risk of hemorrhage. Direct exposure of the cavernous sinus is possible, but it is considered to be a morbid procedure, even for experienced neurosurgeons. However, other approaches such as a transorbital pathway may provide found to be less morbid. The transorbital pathway provides less-invasive access to the cavernous sinus. This approach provides the entire lateral wall of the cavernous sinus to be exposed, without entering its neurovascular compartment, while also providing a favorable angle for performing procedures. Also, this angle allows for procedures to be performed without injuring cranial nerves, temporal lobes, or having to open venous spaces, and the procedure has proven to be quick. Although the transorbital pathway is an unfamiliar approach and requires proper equipment for retraction, it has demonstrated to be feasible and safe in more than 1500 orbital decompressions. The transorbital pathway may provide access to the inside of the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus in a minimally invasive manner; however, more surgeries are needed to provide more clinical advantages and disadvantages of this novel approach.
