The alveolar nerves separate into the superior alveolar nerves and the inferior alveolar nerves. The superior alveolar nerves originate from the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve. The superior alveolar nerves divide into the anterior, middle, and posterior superior alveolar nerves. While the inferior alveolar nerve originates from theÂ mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, the alveolar nerve will branch into the mental nerve. All of these alveolar nerves and their subdivisions will contribute to sensory innervation to the face and mouth.
