Both the American Urogynecologic Society and the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons agreed upon a consensus document for staging pelvic organ prolapse at the 1996 International Continence Society.

The technique measures compartment prolapse relative to the anatomic landmark of the hymen. Prolapse points proximal to the hymen are given a negative value, whereas positive values are given to points that protrude past the hymen. 6 points are delineated, including two on the anterior vaginal wall (Aa, Ba), two on the vaginal apex (C, D), and two on the posterior vaginal wall (Ap, Bp). Points Gh, Pb, and TVL describe the genital hiatus, perineal body, and total vaginal length, respectively.

Previously used, the Baden-Walker Halfway system is an alternative grading system for pelvic organ prolapse.
