Among the many functions of fascia considered in detail are its ectoskeletal role (acting as a soft tissue skeleton for muscle attachments), its importance for creating osteofascial muscle compartments, assisting venous return in the lower limb, decreasing stress concentration at entheses, and acting as a protective sheet for underlying structures. It is essential to recognize the continuity of fascia between regions and appreciate its vital role in coordinating muscular activity and acting as a body-wide proprioceptive organ.

**Protective Function**

In multiple areas of the body, the fascia provides support for the underlying nerves, vessels, and lymphatics. An anatomic relationship that illustrates this principle is seen within the carpal tunnel, as the flexor retinaculum overlies the carpal tunnel protecting the median nerve.

**Myofascial Force Transmission**

Myofascial force transmission occurs when a muscle produces force toward a tendon and joint and transmits that force to the connective tissue within and around the muscle. Due to the intimate relationship between muscle and fascia, the fascia plays a role in force transmission. When a muscle produces force, the force is transmitted toward the joint's direction and towards the muscle's surface. The connective tissue overlying the surface of the muscle is involved in transmitting this force. The myofascial connections can play a role in up to 30% of force transmission.****At the macroscopic level, force is transmitted from the muscle to the surrounding connective tissue. At the microscopic level, cellular changes occur involving the various cells making up the fascia. Fibroblasts, one of the principal cells within the fascia, respond to the increased force by increasing cellular signaling and gene expression. These changes lead to increase cell proliferation and connective tissue remodeling.

**Vascular Support Function**

Interestingly, the deep fascia is more abundant within the lower limbs than the upper limbs. It is hypothesized that this abundance of fascia in the lower limbs serves as a "compression device" to increase the venous return from the lower limbs to the heart. This distinct role is seen in specific pathologies such as deep vein thrombosis that can form after long periods of inactivity. Without adequate muscle contraction, the blood becomes stagnant, fulfilling one factor of the Virchow triad, leading to thrombus formation.

Compartment syndrome describes a pathology where fascia restricts blood flow to the muscle leading to ischemia. In cases where a fasciotomy is required, the decreased fascial tension due to surgically incised tissue may lead to chronic venous insufficiency. These pathologies illustrate how fascia contributes to vascular support, specifically in the lower limbs.
