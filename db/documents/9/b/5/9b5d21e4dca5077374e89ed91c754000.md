Cytarabine is a pyrimidine analog and is also known as arabinosylcytosine (ARA-C). It is converted into the triphosphate form within the cell and competes with cytidine to incorporate itself into the DNA. The sugar moiety of cytarabine hinders the rotation of the molecule within the DNA. The process of DNA replication ceases, specifically during the S phase of the cell cycle, making it a specific drug for rapidly dividing cells, such as those seen in cancer. DNA replication and repair also halts due to the inhibition of DNA polymerase by cytarabine. This drug must act for a time equivalent to one cell cycle to effectively inhibit the replication of tumor cells. Hence the bolus dose of cytarabine is given every 8Â to 12 hours to maintain optimum intracellular levels.

**Pharmacokinetics**

The absorption of cytarabine is not effective when taken orally due to high first-pass metabolism. When administered subcutaneously, intrathecally, or intravenously, it has a high bioavailability. It has a low plasma protein binding capacity and, thus, a high volume of distribution. It can cross the blood-brain barrier and hence has an off-label use in primary CNS lymphomas. Cytarabine metabolism primarily occurs in the liver. It has an active metabolite- azacytidine triphosphate; and an inactive metabolite- uracil arabinoside, which is cleared by the kidney.
