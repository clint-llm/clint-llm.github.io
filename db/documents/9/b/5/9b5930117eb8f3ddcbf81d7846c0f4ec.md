The mortality rate of meningococcal infection can be as high as 50% in untreated patients. Early and aggressive treatment can reduce the mortality rate to approximately 10 to 14%. Early administration of antibiotics is imperative in determining a good outcome of meningococcal infection. Even with treatment, however, long-term complications can still occur in 11 to 19% of survivors. Complications of meningococcal disease include chronic pain, skin scarring, limb amputation, and neurological impairment ranging from hearing and visual impairments to motor function impairments. Hearing impairment and amputations occur in approximately 3% of cases, arthritis occurs in 10% of cases, and post-infection inflammatory syndrome occurs in 6 to 15% of cases.

Similar to other causes of bacterial meningitis, patients who survive meningococcal infections should follow up routinely. Hearing tests within four weeks of hospital discharge is recommended. Orthopedic follow-up and prosthetic fitting are necessary for patients who suffered limb amputations. Patients may even suffer from psychological and psychiatric complications, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and behavioral abnormalities that may need to follow up with psychology and psychiatry.
