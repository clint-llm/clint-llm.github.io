Vaccinations exert their effect on the human body via priming our active immune system. Following the administration of the tetanus toxoid, the immune system is stimulated and responds to the antigens present in the vaccine. TH2 and B cells are activated, which then produce immunoglobins against the toxoid, allowing for adequate protection against future infections. This process requires multiple dosages to achieve a high immune response; however, it bears mentioning that there is no chance for the toxoid to exhibit its pathogenic features as it is an inactivated vaccine.
