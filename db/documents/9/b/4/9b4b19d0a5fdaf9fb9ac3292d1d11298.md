The patient may have a history of previous abdominal surgeries, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, or a hernia at a certain point in time. The most common presentation includes complaints of abdominal pain, distention, nausea, and vomiting. The abdominal pain may be progressive or intermittent in nature. It may be associated with constipation or obstipation with or without flatus and even loose bowel movements.

The bowel sounds may be reduced and high pitched. Abdominal tenderness on physical examination may be diffuse or focal with the presence of distention. There may be signs of peritonitis such as rebound, guarding, and rigidity and signify late findings that may be present depending on the time of presentation. Evaluation for hernias, surgical scars, masses including in the rectum, and fecal impactions may demonstrate the possibleÂ etiology. There may be signs and symptoms of dehydration and sepsis as well.
