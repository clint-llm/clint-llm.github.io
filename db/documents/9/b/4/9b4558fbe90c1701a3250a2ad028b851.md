Benign cysts are typically mobile within the glandular breast tissue, chest wall, and skin and are rubber-like in texture. Except for inflammatory type cysts, discomfort and tenderness experienced by a patient are either absent or mild. Most patients present with multiple cysts upon further clinical and diagnostic evaluation.

Various subtypes of cysts are known, including hyperplastic fibrous cysts, adenosis, and papillomatosis. These types of cysts are usually found in the upper outer quadrants of the breast, as well as in the central margins. The texture upon evaluation ranges from a firm texture to multiple subcentimeter cysts.

Fibroadenomas present in varied sizes with a common oval-shaped, well-defined margin. As with cysts, fibroadenomas are mobile upon evaluation and are often multiple, occurring either simultaneously or over a specified period.

Nipple discharge is associated with ductal ectasia, intraductal papilloma, or in rare instances, carcinoma.

The finding of an intraductal papilloma is associated with a single duct presenting a bloody, sudden discharge with a small palpable nodule in the retro areolar region. Multiple ducts presenting with nonspontaneous, green, yellow, clear discharges are a common feature with duct ectasia.
