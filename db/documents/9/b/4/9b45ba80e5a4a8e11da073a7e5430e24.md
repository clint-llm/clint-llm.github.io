The use of radiofrequency ablation for intractable pain is based on the premise that the transmission of radiofrequency currents near nociceptive pathways will interrupt pain impulses. The thermal energy associated with radiofrequency ablation leads to tissue destruction, targeted at the nerves responsible for transmitting and/or modulating the sensation of pain. Today, there are multiple types of radiofrequency ablation procedures. These include pulsed radiofrequency ablation, water-cooled radiofrequency ablation, and cryoneurolysis. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques involved in performing radiofrequency ablation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for radiofrequency ablation.
- Describe the technique involved in performing radiofrequency ablation.
- Review the complications of radiofrequency ablation.
- Explain a structured, interprofessional team approach to provide effective care and appropriate surveillance of patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation.
