Splenic infarction occurs when the blood supply to the spleen is compromised resulting in tissue ischemia and eventual necrosis. It may be the result of arterial or venous occlusion. The infarction may be global or involve a small segmental area of the spleen depending on which vessel is occluded. Typical presentation includes left sided abdominal pain in a person with an underlying hematologic disorder, hypercoagulable state, blood-borne malignancy, blunt abdominal trauma, or embolic illness. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and treatment of splenic infarction and how the collective effort can improve patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Recall the presentation of a patient with a splenic infarct.
- Describe the pathophysiology of splenic infarct.
- Summarize the treatment options for splenic infarct.
- Identify the value of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure that patients with splenic infarction get vaccinated against encapsulated organisms, which can enhance outcomes.
