The cavernous sinus is part of the brainâ€™s dural venous sinus and contains multiple neuro-vasculatures. It is situated bilaterally to the sella turcica and extends from the superior orbital fissure anteriorly to the petrous part of the temporal bone posteriorly, and is about 1 cm wide and 2 cm long. The venous blood that flows to the cavernous sinus is from the superior and anterior ophthalmic veins, superficial middle cerebral vein, and sphenoparietal sinus. The communication between the left and right cavernous sinuses is made by the intercavernous sinuses anterior and posterior to the infundibulum of the pituitary gland.
