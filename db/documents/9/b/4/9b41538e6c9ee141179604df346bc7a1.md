Clavulanic acid use is always in conjunction with amoxicillin in its salt form clavulanate potassium. Amoxicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic that disrupts bacterialÂ cell wall synthesis. It binds to penicillin-binding proteins that are present on the inside of the bacterial cell wall, and this inhibits the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer in the cell wall.
