Crohn disease is a serious chronic inflammatory disorder that is difficult to diagnose and manage. Besides the GI tract, the disease affects many other organs leading to high morbidity and even premature death. The current consensus is that this disorder should be managed by an interprofessional team dedicated to the management of inflammatory bowel disease.

The diagnosis and management of Crohn disease require an interprofessional team that includes a nurse practitioner or provider assistant, internists, hematologists, gastroenterologists, general surgeons, dietitians, stoma nurses, and a pharmacist. The disorder affects many organs in the body and hence the appropriate specialist should be consulted early on in the disease course.

A nurse practitioner or provider assistant should follow the patient throughout the course and monitor the course of the disease. Any change in the symptoms should be immediately reported to the team. A dietitian should educate the patient on foods to eat and what to avoid. A stoma nurse should educate the patient on the cleaning of the skin and managing everyday problems with this method of stool evacuation.

The pharmacist should educate the patient on the different medications, their benefits, their adverse effects, and the importance of compliance.

Many different providers see these patients as they may develop extraintestinal problems. The patient should be urged to undergo tests to screen for skin and colon malignancies. Finally, most patients develop depression and severe anxiety and hence a mental health nurse should provide continuous counseling.

The disorder is usually managed with medications but complications require surgery. Most patients have relapses and remissions and need lifelong follow-up. The prognosis for most patients with Crohn disease is guarded and the quality of life is poor.
