Working in an interprofessional healthcare team requires collaboration, cooperation, commitment, and communication. It should integrate care into teams to provide reliable and continuous care. All healthcare professionals, including nursing and allied, should be monitored for core competencies to meet the needs of the 21st-century healthcare system. They should be encouraged to employ evidence-based practice and participate in research and learning activities.

The institution should engage a monitoring team to apply quality improvement to identify the hazards and errors in care, implement safety protocols, and compose interventions to change care systems. Education is the key to patient-centered care to recognize and respect patients' differences, value their preferences, relieve pain and suffering, help decision-making, advocate disease prevention, and promote a healthy lifestyle.
