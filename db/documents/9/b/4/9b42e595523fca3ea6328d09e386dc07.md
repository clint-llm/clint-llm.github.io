Headaches are the most common initial presenting symptom of patients with glioma. The pathophysiology of headaches is theorized to be the result of tumor growth that places a mass effect on surrounding tissue. The mass effect, in turn, leads to pressure in the microvasculature and leads to edema. Depending on the location of the tumor in the brain, the mass effect leads to signs of a brain tumor. For example, frontal lobe tumors can present with behavioral changes while dominant temporal lobe tumors can present with receptive speech problems. Other symptoms related to mass effects include nausea, vomiting, and change in vision, Seizures are the second most common symptom of presentation. The pathophysiology of seizures is attributed to tumor irritation to the cerebral cortex that leads to focal or generalized seizures. Other presenting symptoms of gliomas are tingling sensations, weakness, difficulty ambulation, and in rare cases, patients can present in a comatose state due to hemorrhage within the tumor which leads to an acute herniation syndrome.
