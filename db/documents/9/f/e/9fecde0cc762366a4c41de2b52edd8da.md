The pathogenesis and etiology of anencephaly remain poorly understood but are believed to have a multifactorial origin comprised of both nutritional and environmental risk factors.

**NUTRITIONAL FACTORS**

Folate is a coenzyme that facilitates the transfer of one-carbon units, which are then in various reactions, such as purine and pyrimidine synthesis, as well as methylation reactions.

- Medications that block folate absorption

- Malabsorption of folate

- Increased bodily demand for folate

- Insufficient intake of dietary folate

Folate is involved in the process of methylating homocysteine and cytosine. It also contributes to the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines. Consequently, a lack of folate leads to an inability to properly build proteins and DNA and also alters the expression of some genes.

**ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS**

Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are a known cause of NTDs. Use of AEDs, such as valproate, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, alters folate absorption, leading to decreased levels of folate in the blood. Of note, valproate is considered the most teratogenic AEDs, especially when combined with lamotrigine.

Diabetes complicates pregnancies by increasing the risk of the fetus developing congenital birth defects (diabetic embryopathy).

Hyperthermia during the first trimester can alter anterior neural tube closure and correlates with anencephaly. Possible causes of hyperthermia in the mother include the use of saunas or hot tubs, exercising in an environment with increased temperatures, and febrile illness.

Excess Vitamin A has shown to be teratogenic in pregnant rats due to decreased protein synthesis.
