The Gs subunit of the beta-1 adrenoreceptor upon activation upregulates adenylyl cyclase which converts ATP to cAMP. With the increased presence of cAMP, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates calcium channels, thus increasing cellular calcium influx. Increased concentrations of intracellular calcium increase inotropy in the heart through calcium exchange in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. PKA also phosphorylates myosin light chains which lead to contractility in smooth muscle cells.
