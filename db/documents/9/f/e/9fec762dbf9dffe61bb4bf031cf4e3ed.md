Many manual medicine practitioners use high-velocity low amplitude (HVLA) thrust techniques to treat spinal somatic dysfunction.  A common indication for the use of HVLA OMT is "joint fixation," described as a condition where any two bones in a joint either become misaligned or fixated (stuck). HVLA therapy used in the cervical region may be effective in resolving the neck, shoulder, and head pain.

The use of HVLA therapy of the cervical spine is indicated to treat motion loss with associated somatic dysfunction. It is hypothesized that fibrous adhesions develop in zygapophyseal joints during periods of relative immobility, restricting motion within the joint. HVLA therapy is thought to improve symptoms consistent with musculoskeletal joint restriction due to cavitation and adhesions of the zygapophyseal joints.  HVLA is typically used for patients with local or radiating neck pain in non-acute phases.  To that extent, it is also used to treat patients with cervicogenic headaches. Studies suggest that mobilization or manipulation of the cervical spine may be beneficial for individuals experiencing cervicogenic headaches.
