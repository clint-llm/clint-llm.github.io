Every healthcare team member must take precautions during laser surgery of the upper airway to avoid harm to themself, the patient, or other operating room personnel. Wear proper protective equipment, which includes a high-efficiency mask and wavelength-specific protective eyeglasses.

To decrease the risk of airway fire:

- Use the lowest concentration of oxygen possible

- Avoid using nitrous oxide as an anesthetic (at high temperatures, it can release oxygen and act as an oxidizer)

- Limit laser use to short pulses and the lowest power

- Activate the laser only when the tip of the laser source is visible, and the endotracheal tube is out of reachÂ of the source.

- Cover the patient's face and chest with wet towels, and protect the eyes with wavelength-specific eye protection

- Have saline-filled large (e.g., 50 ml) syringes within reach during procedures with a high risk of ignition

- Know the nearest location of a fire extinguisher and a water source
