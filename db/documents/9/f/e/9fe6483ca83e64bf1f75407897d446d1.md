The primary causes of spinal shock are accidental or intentional spinal cord trauma, with collisions remaining a common cause. The most common area of spinal cord injury is the cervical spine. Primary causes of spinal shock are usually a result of high-impact, direct trauma. Decreased blood flow to the spinal cord can also produce spinal shock; for example, a hypotensive patient in the medical intensive care unit (ICU) or a post-angiography patient with a clot causing occlusion of arteries that supply the spinal cord can have the same presentation. Secondary causes of spinal shock include mechanical cord compression, hypotension, hypoxia, fever, and hyperglycemia.
