Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA), consists of the presence of digital clubbing, increased periosteal activity of the tubular bones, arthralgias, and joint effusion and is characterized by abnormal proliferation of the skin, soft tissues, and osseous tissues in the distal parts of extremities. There are two forms of the disease - primary and secondary. Primary HOA (PHO), also called pachydermoperiostosis, comprises of digital clubbing, periostosis, and pachydermia and is a rare genetic disease, while secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is associated with a variety of pulmonary, cardiac, and other conditions. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology and progression of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.
- Review the components of a proper evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, including any indicated imaging studies.
- Summarize the management options available for hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.
