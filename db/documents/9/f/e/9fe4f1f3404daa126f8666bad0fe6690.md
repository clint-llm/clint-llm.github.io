- PCFCL is the most common primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma.

- Lesions occur on the head, neck, or trunk in middle-aged to older males.

- Lesions on the legs have been shown to act more aggressively.

- Unlike systemic Follicular Lymphoma, it shows negative or weak BCL2 expression by immunohistochemistry and is negative for BCL-2 rearrangements by FISH.

- PCFCL lymphoma is not graded.
