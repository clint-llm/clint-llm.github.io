Phosgene is a hydrophobic (low water solubility) molecule and therefore resists degradation into HCl and CO2 in the upper airways. For this reason, phosgene migrates to the lower airway units, including the alveolar sacs and respiratory bronchioles, where histopathologic changes will occur. These changes may include the destruction of the alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelium characterized by infiltration of the alveolus with inflammatory cells and proteinaceous fluid. Fibrin accumulation with alveolar macrophages may be present in patients who survive the initial insult.
