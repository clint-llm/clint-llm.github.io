There are three primary anterior knee fat pads, such as the quadriceps suprapatellar, pre-femoral suprapatellar, and infrapatellar retro-patellar tendon (Hoffa's fat pad), all of which may experience symptomatic impingement.

The IFPÂ can become one of many causes of anterior knee pain when it becomes inflamed, leading to impingement at the tibiofemoral joint or the lateral aspect of the patellofemoral joint, known as Hoffa pad impingement syndrome.

A normal IFP attaches to the proximal patellar tendon, the inferior pole of the patella, anterior horns of the medial and lateral menisci, transverse meniscal ligament, and periosteum of the anterior tibia.
