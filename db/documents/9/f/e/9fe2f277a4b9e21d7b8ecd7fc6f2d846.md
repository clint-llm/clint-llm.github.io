Prevention of fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies and toxicities relies on a diverse team of healthcare professionals. The interprofessional team involves physicians, medical assistants, dieticians, pharmacists, and patients. For example, a pediatrician must recognize risk factors for vitamin-D deficiency in a neonate, including being exclusively breastfed and having darker skin. Nurses, who often spend the most time with patients, are in a position to recognize abnormal signs and symptoms in high-risk patients and report their findings to the physician. Their watchful eye is vital in catching alarming symptoms early, such as headaches and seizures caused by vitamin-A toxicity. Primary and tertiary prevention of fat-soluble vitamin excess or deficiency is carried out by dieticians and nutritionists, who play an essential role in modulating a patient’s diet and ensuring the meeting of their dietary needs.

Pharmacists are responsible for ensuring that other members of the interprofessional team are aware of the potential risks of medications that may lead to vitamin excess or deficiency. Finally, the role of the physician is to follow proper screening protocols, recognize signs and symptoms of fat-soluble vitamin abnormalities early, order the correct labs, and work to coordinate the other members of the patient’s team optimally.
