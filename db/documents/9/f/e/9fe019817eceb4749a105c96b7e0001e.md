Hypertension is associated with significant cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Some common complications associated with poorly controlled hypertension are ischemic and ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and chronic kidney disease. Hence, several studies have been done to determine which antihypertensive medications improve cardiovascular mortality and also to determine the target blood pressure in patients with multiple comorbidities.Â This article presents summary information about landmark hypertension trials.
