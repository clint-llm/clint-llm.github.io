First-degree atrioventricular (AV) block is a condition of abnormally slow conduction through the AV node. It is defined by ECG changes that include a PR interval of greater than 0.20 without disruption of atrial to ventricular conduction. This condition is generally asymptomatic and discovered only on routine ECG. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of first-degree heart block and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the pathophysiology of first-degree heart block.
- Describe the ECG changes observed in the evaluation of first-degree heart block.
- Review the management of patients with first-degree heart block.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to enhance outcomes for patients affected by first-degree heart block.
