Patients will need to understand the nature and severity of their condition and the treatment options based on the precise nature of their abscess. If the abscess is pressing on the spinal cord, they will need surgery and instruction on how to proceed post-laminectomy. If the abscess is causing neurological symptoms or cauda equina syndrome, they will need to understand the emergent nature of this condition and have emergent treatment. Post-surgical rehabilitation will require the patient to comply with all therapeutic activities. If surgery is unnecessary, they will be instructedÂ regarding how to proceed with their antibiotic regimen. Spinal dermal sinus tracts should be operated on as soon as possible.
