The "dawn phenomenon" refers to periodic episodes of hyperglycemia experienced by patients with diabetes in the early morning hours. This clinical entity differs from the Somogyi effect in that it is not preceded by an episode of hypoglycemia. This activity will describe the disease process, outline an appropriate evaluation strategy, and review treatment options for the dawn phenomenon. It will also explain the importance of an interprofessional approach to evaluation and education for optimizing control of the patient affected by the dawn phenomenon.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the patient populations affected by the dawn phenomenon as well as the prevalence of this abnormality.
- Explain the pathophysiologic processes that produce the dawn phenomenon and the reasons that patients without diabetes are not affected.
- Outline a diagnostic evaluation for the dawn phenomenon that includes the use of continuous glucose monitoring systems.
- Summarize the importance of a collaborative approach to diagnosis and management for the dawn phenomenon, with the aim of improving outcomes for patients as far as glycemic control and thereby prevention of long term adverse events.
