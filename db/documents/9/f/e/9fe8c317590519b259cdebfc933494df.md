Injuries of the pectoralis major muscle are rare. Although the injury typically occurs while lifting weights, specifically while performing a bench press, it has also been known to occur in several other sports. Several factors, including delay in care and recognition of the injury, can delay appropriate treatment and result in worse outcomes for the patient. Specific treatment of this injury depends on the severity of the injury, the patientâ€™s activity level, and daily living needs. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment and reviews the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.
