The prognosis in cystic renal diseases depends on extrarenal manifestations and risk for renal failure.

ADPKD will progress to renal insufficiency in patients older than 30 years and end-stage renal failure in 50% of patients. The common cause of death in ADPKD includes renal failure, hypertensive nephropathy, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

In ARPKD, severe renal insufficiency will develop around 5 to 20 years of age. General death causes are from pulmonary disease and renal failure,Â usually within six weeks.

In JNPHP and MCKD, renal failure will occur within 5 to 10 years.

Acquired cystic renal disease is progressive, but regresses after transplantation.
