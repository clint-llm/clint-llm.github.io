Lithium has a very narrow therapeutic index, and toxic levels are when the drug is above 2 mEq/L, which is very close to its therapeutic range. Lithium toxicity can cause interstitial nephritis, arrhythmia, sick sinus syndrome, hypotension, T wave abnormalities, and bradycardia. Rarely, toxicity can cause pseudotumor cerebri and seizures. Lithium toxicity has no antidote. Treatment for lithium toxicity is primarily hydration and to stop the drug. Give hydration with normal saline, which will also enhance lithium excretion. Avoid all diuretics. If the patient has severe renal dysfunction or failure, or severely altered mental status, then start with hemodialysis. 20 to 30 mg of propranolol given 2 to 3 times per day may help reduce tremors.
