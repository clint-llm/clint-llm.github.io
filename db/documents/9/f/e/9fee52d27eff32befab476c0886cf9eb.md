Buprenorphine, a synthetic opioid, treats pain, and opioid use syndrome. It was developed in the late 1960s. It is a synthetic analog of thebaine, which is an alkaloid compound derived from the poppy flower. It is a Schedule III drug, which means that it has some potential for moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of buprenorphine, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team for the treatment of patients where pain control or opioid misuse is an issue.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of buprenorphine.
- Outline the indications for the use of buprenorphine.
- Explain the potential adverse effects of buprenorphine.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance pain control and limit opioid misuse and improve outcomes when using buprenorphine.
