The prognosis for DI is excellent after the primary cause is treated. Hypernatremia can lead to cerebral herniation due to an increase in intracranial pressure. When DI has been diagnosticated in trauma patients, the majority recover in 2 to 4 days, and the remaining few recovers during a 6-month timeframe, which provides good patient outcomes. Permanent DI after TBI has a prevalence of 6%.

For acute SIADH secretion, the prognosis is related to the level of hyponatremia and its response to treatment. Hyponatremia is a major contributing factor to severe morbidity and mortality. The management of SIADH secretion is complex, and water restriction does not always correct the hyponatremia requiring further investigations and second-line treatments.
