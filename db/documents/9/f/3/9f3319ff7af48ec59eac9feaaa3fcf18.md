Schwannoma is the most common of all nerve sheath tumors in approximately 89% of cases. About 60% of benign schwannomas are vestibular schwannomas.

The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States shows that non−malignant nerve sheath tumors account for 8.6% of all central nervous system tumors reported, with no gender predominance, but a higher incidence in whites.

The incidence of vestibular schwannomas in the USA is 1.2 cases per 100,000/year. The median age of patients is 55 years.

Spinal schwannoma incidence is 0.24 cases per 100,000/year. Spinal schwannomas are more common in white males, usually affecting persons between the ages of 65 and 74.
