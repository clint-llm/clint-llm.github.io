**PTSD**

Patients are subject to a variety of somatic and mental health comorbidities. The directionality and degree of overlap between diagnoses are complex. One study in OIF/OEF veterans with PTSD found that compared to veterans without mental health conditions, they had more medical diagnoses, the most common being lumbosacral spine disease, headache, lower extremity joint problems, and hearing loss.

PTSD and AUD have been linked over decades of research. Men have a higher prevalence of AUD, and women of PTSD, but individuals with either disorder are likelier to have the other. SUDs were four times more likely (55 to 75% rate) with PTSD in Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.

Similarly, depression and PTSD are associated. One study found that 36% of depression patients had positive PTSD screens. Those with both have higher medical illness burdens, worse prognoses, lower social support, higher SI rates, and prolonged treatment.

TBI and PTSD also have known comorbidities and are an area of extensive research. The largest studies of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans show an overlap rate between 5 to 7%. In those with mild TBI (mTBI), PTSD frequency ranged from 33 to 39%. As many as 23% of returning OIF/OEF veterans suffered TBI, the vast majority being mild. However, even mild cases can lead to somatic, cognitive, or behavioral alterations which confound PTSD symptoms. Whether treatments for mTBI or PTSD alone are helpful is still unknown. There is some concern that PTSD pharmacotherapies may exacerbate the cognitive symptoms of PTSD. Cognitive limitations, impaired emotional regulation and impulse control, and pain from TBI may limit PTSD treatment effectiveness and patientsâ€™ ability to engage in therapy.

**Depression**

MDD comes with a constellation of symptoms which can lead to further complications. Weight gain and fatigue are common symptoms of depression. Studies show an odds ratio of 1.18 linking depression and obesity.

**Suicide**

Suicide attempts and completions are traumatic events that can affect the breadth of people and lead to long-term concerns. Friends and family members may experience a variety of emotions towards the patient, including anger, guilt, betrayal, anxiety, or helplessness. Post-suicide interventions can help family and friends understand suicide victims and reduce their inappropriate assumption of responsibility.

**Substance Use Disorders**

Psychiatric symptoms, including distress, often precedes and worsens cravings. Comorbid psychiatric disorders make SUDs more severe and difficult to treat. Among OEF/OIF veterans with SUD, 82 to 93% had another mental health disorder. Those with a SUD were three to four times more likely to have PTSD or depression. Less than 1% had an isolated diagnosis of SUD. Dually-diagnosed veterans were more likely to be homeless and require disability benefits. Lower quality of life, poorer relationships, and aggression are also more common.
