Knowledge in handling infectious substances is necessary for all health care professionals. Nurses and allied health professionals may be required to transfer substances to the lab or even dispose of them. In medical clinics, the nursing staff often handles medical waste from vaccinations, medication injections, biopsy specimens, etc. Therefore, all healthcare professionals must be somewhat familiar with biosafety regulations. These workers are not required to have the knowledge of the laboratory techs and environmental service workers who are directly responsible for packaging and shipping infectious substances. However, knowing the basics decreases the risk of unintentional exposure.
