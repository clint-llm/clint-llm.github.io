The clinical picture is driven by the PBF as well as the presence ofÂ valvular abnormalities and aortic arch obstruction. In the first few days after birth, the critical congenital heart defect (CCHD) screen in these patients show pre-and post-ductal oxygen saturation less than 95% with mild or unnoticeable cyanosis. Unscreened infants present within the first two weeks for evaluation of a heart murmur or with symptoms of CHF resulting from increased blood flow to the lungs. These infants exhibit poor feeding, lethargy, tachypnea, costal-sternal retractions, grunting, nasal flaring, tachycardia, or hepatomegaly.

The cardiac exam will be notable for an ejection click and systolic murmur, single loud second heart sound, and a diastolic murmur if truncal valve regurgitation is present. Peripheral pulses may be bounding due to excess runoff into the pulmonary arteries. During diastole, an increased pulmonary vascular flow may correlate with higher pulse pressures.

Valvular insufficiency and stenosis are common phenomena. Valvular regurgitation, seen in 50% of patients, can worsen symptoms of CHF. Concurrent critical coarctation, seen in 10% of TA patients, can lead to cardiovascular collapse with patients presenting in shock or even death.
