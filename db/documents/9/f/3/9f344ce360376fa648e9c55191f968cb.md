Space readiness = geography + processes + people + equipment + system integration

Process for designing in-situ simulation to assess readiness:

- Form an interprofessional team

- Team members create/refine process maps and workflows

- Team members perform a needs assessment and prioritize potential issues that may arise in new space

- The simulation team andÂ interprofessional team collaborate to determine program objectives

- Leaders/team members allocate appropriate resources (time, space, equipment, personnel scheduling) to ensure productive participation by all relevant parties

- The simulation team develops in-situ scenarios using process-based objectives, ideal workflows, and realistic stressors

- The simulation team assures the incorporation of elements highlighting safe design principles

- Dry-run scenarios with representative front-line personnel

- Pre-brief participants, emphasizing full immersion and a psychologically safe environment

- Run and debrief the scenarios maintaining focus on objectives

- Gather and record observations and participant feedback

- Evaluate findings using both qualitative and quantitative methods

- Generate recommendations based on analysis to assure readiness

- Repeat as needed

Safe design principles:

- Control and eliminate sources of infection

- Minimize environmental hazards

- Optimize adjacencies

- Support patient/family involvement in care

- Ensure standardization

- Reduce communication breakdown

- Reduce noise

- Enhance visibility

- Reduce staff fatigue

- Automate where possible
