Patients need to understand that successful treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome is only the initial step that must lead to long-term abstinence to be successful. Abstinence is not likely unless the patient enrolls in a long-term treatment program. These programs can include individual counseling, group meetings, and long-term medications to reduce the risk of relapse.
