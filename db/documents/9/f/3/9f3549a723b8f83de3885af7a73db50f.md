Endoscopically Barrett's esophagus is classified into short-segment (â‰¤3 cm) or long-segment (>3 cm) disease.

The Prague classification further categorizes the endoscopic lesion based on the degree of circumferential disease (noted by the letter C and a number indicating the length in centimeters) and the degree of esophagus segment length extending proximally (noted by the letter M and a number indicating the length in centimeters). A lesion noted to be Prague classification of C3M2 would mean that the Barrett esophagus extends circumferentially for 3 cm above the squamocolumnar junction and has "tongues" of Barrett esophagus extending 2 cm above the squamocolumnar junction.
