Successful PC requires an understanding of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic components of the biliary system. The intrahepatic biliary ducts are part of the hepatic lobules portal triad consisting of a biliary duct, hepatic artery, and portal vein. They are typically not easily visualized in traditional imaging studies until pathologically enlarged. The extrahepatic biliary components include the right and left hepatic duct, common hepatic duct, cystic duct, gallbladder, and common bile duct. It is important to understand potential congenital anomalies when performing cholangiography. Pertinent anomalies include aberrant biliary ducts, aberrant cystic duct insertion, choledochal cysts, diverticulum, and the anomalous junction of the biliary ductal and pancreatic ducts**.**Choledochal cysts are classified using the Todani system. Type I (80 to 90%) are fusiform cysts in the extrahepatic biliary ducts. Type II (3%) are true diverticulum seen within the intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts. Type III (5%) is a choledochocele. Type IV cysts are multiple ductal cysts subdivided into type A, both intrahepatic and extrahepatic fusiform cysts, and type B, multiple extrahepatic cysts. Type V is multiple intrahepatic cystic dilations, also known as Caroli disease.
