Intravenous antibiotics should be administered in a timely fashion once a patient is suspected of IE or a cardiac abscess. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics until further characterization of infective species should be monitored for at least 6 weeks of therapy in this patient population.

Surgery consult and the time of surgical intervention are of high importance when approaching a patient with a cardiac abscess. There is increased morbidity and mortality in patients in whom surgery is delayed. Thus early surgery is recommended. Surgery for these patients aims toward the eradication of the infection and correction of hemodynamic abnormalities.

However, some patients with periannular extension of infection or myocardial abscess could potentially be treated without surgical intervention. These patients include:

- Patients with smaller (less than 1 cm) abscesses

- Patients who do not have complications of heart block, an echocardiographic progression of abscess during antibiotic therapy

- Patients who do not have valvular dehiscence or insufficiency

It is recommended that patients who do not undergo surgery are monitored closely with serial TEE repeated at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy.
