Classically, cor triatriatum presents in infancy with signs and symptom of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary venous obstruction. Due to low cardiac output, children can show poor growth and weight gain, feeding difficulties, respiratory distress, and tet spells. In childhood and adulthood, the signs and symptoms of pulmonary venous hypertension and right heart failure dominate as the membrane calcifies, and the opening becomes smaller and smaller decreasing cardiac output even further. Mitral valve regurgitation and atrial fibrillation impose serious dangers. Most patients presentÂ with the following features

- Dyspnea and orthopnea

- Easy fatigability

- Hemoptysis

- Exercise intolerance and shortness of breath

- Palpitations

Atrial fibrillation can cause systemic thromboembolism and present as pulmonary embolism or stroke. The left atrial enlarges due to backing up of blood and can present as life-threatening arrhythmias.

Cor triatriatum sinister that presents for the first time in adulthood is rare but possible. It presents similarly to mitral stenosis, but the absence of loud S1 and an opening snap helps to distinguish between the 2. Chest x-ray showing pulmonary congestion with an absence of left atrial enlargement is characteristic of cor triatriatum. A continuous gradient on Doppler echocardiography confirms the diagnosis.

**Physical Exam**

The physical exam findings are due to the right heart failure and pulmonary congestion.

- Accentuated pulmonary component of second heart sound

- A soft mid-systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border with a wide and fixed splitting of an atrial septal defect.

- Right ventricular heave

- Rales at the lung base

- Diminished peripheral pulses

- Hepatomegaly and right upper quadrant tenderness

- Ascites

- Peripheral edema

- Distended peripheral veins

- Distended jugular venous and elevated jugular venous pressure

- Pallor

- Poor weight gain
