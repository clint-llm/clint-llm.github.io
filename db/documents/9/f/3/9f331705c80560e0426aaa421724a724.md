The SNCA gene encodes synuclein, which is made up of 140 amino acids. The resulting amino acid sequence can code for alpha helixes via binding to negatively charged lipids or beta-sheets with prolonged incubation. The protein is made up of three regions: an amino terminus, central hydrophobic, and a carboxyl terminus. The amino terminus regions lead to the alpha-helix shape with apolipoprotein lipid-binding motifs. The central hydrophobic regions can lead to beta-sheet configurations. Lastly, the carboxyl terminus is generally unstructured.

Alpha-synuclein is present in living structures in a perennial balance between the soluble state and a state in which it links to the membrane. Membrane bonding occurs thanks to the presence of phosphatidylinositol or phosphatidylserine; at the brain level, the protein binds to small vesicles (about 40-nm in diameter). Alpha-synuclein can create different polymorphic aggregates, which have been called strains.Â This aggregation capacity, most likely, is one reason for the different types of synucleinopathies found; each strain recruits other proteins differently, always creating different dysfunctional patterns.

Beta-synuclein is made up of 134 amino acids, while gamma-synuclein is made up of 127 amino acids, which bind membrane phospholipids.
