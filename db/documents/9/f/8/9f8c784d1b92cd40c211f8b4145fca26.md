Granulosa cell tumors are rare ovarian neoplasms derived from the sex cords/ovarian mesenchyme with an indolent course and long natural history. Unlike epithelial ovarian cancers, these tumors are detected early, often in young females that usually manifest with abdominal distension or pain or rarely with features of hyperestrogenism/virilization. There is a high chance of late recurrence, and hence lifelong follow-up is indicated. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of granulosa cell tumors of the ovary. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of granulosa cell tumors of the ovary.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of granulosa cell tumors of the ovary.
- Discuss the management options available for granulosa cell tumors of the ovary.
