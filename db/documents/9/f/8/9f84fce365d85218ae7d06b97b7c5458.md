Churg-Strauss syndrome or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is thus a pleiotropic systemic vasculitis with a dual face of manifestations- based on eosinophilic damage or ANCA associated small and medium vessel injury.

The dichotomy has made it challenging to identify a gold standard for diagnosis and has also made prognosis somewhat variable. Pharmacologic treatment, irrespective of a mechanism of injury,  is still tied to early recognition. Treatment with immunomodulators with the use of plasma exchange or IVIG is reserved for more refractory cases.

It responds well to treatment but is also characterized by a high remission rate and a lingering persistence of difficult to control asthma and systemic manifestations affecting the quality of life.
