Cellular communication is a complex process involving various biochemical steps and many different messenger molecules between cells and organs.

The interaction between a messenger molecule and the target cell is just the beginning of a complex cascade of events that happens intracellularly. Most cellular messengers exert their effect through the interaction with a specific receptor coupled to the lipid membrane. There are also intracellular receptors that interact with lipophilic molecules that diffuse through the lipid membrane in both directions without the help of transport proteins.

Examples of cellular messengers are

- Extracellular messengers: cytokines, autacoids, hormones, growth factors, catecholamines, histamine, serotonin, neurotransmitters, eicosanoids, nucleotides, and extracellular vesicles

- Intracellular messengers: cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate, calcium, phosphatidylinositols, nitric oxide (NO), and diacylglycerol
