Brachial plexitis is a condition characterized by acute onset of shoulder pain followed by weakness and/or sensory loss of the shoulder and/or upper extremity. Dreschfeld first described it in 1887. Multiple reports further described the condition. The most important one out of these was the report of 136 patients by Parsonage and Turner in 1948. It was this report that strongly characterized the clinical history of the condition. 
This activity reviews the pathophysiology and etiology of brachial plexitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of brachial plexitis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of brachial plexitis.
- Summarize the treatment options for brachial plexitis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by brachial plexitis.
