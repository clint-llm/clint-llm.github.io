Triphasic waves are abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms seen in association with multiple clinical conditions, including encephalopathy and structural brain lesions, among others. They are nonspecific, high amplitude sharp/sharply contoured waves with three distinctive phases. The main phase is surface positive with a high amplitude (greater than 70 microvolts), preceded by a low amplitude negative deflection and followed by a slow rising broad negative deflection. They were initially believed to be pathognomonic of hepatic encephalopathy; however, they can be seen in any metabolic encephalopathy (in fact, more common with renal than hepatic conditions) and some other conditions. They may be considered a subset of generalized periodic discharges (GPDs).

This EEG pattern was first described by Foley in 1950. It was an EEG recording of a patient with hepatic encephalopathy. The author described the waveforms as "blunted and spike waves."
