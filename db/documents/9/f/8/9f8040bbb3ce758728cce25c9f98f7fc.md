No laboratory workup is required for the diagnosis of erysipelas. Leukocytosis, elevated ESR and C-reactive protein are common but will not change the management or the treatment plan for most otherwise healthy individuals. Blood cultures have a low yield and are not routinely obtained; however, consider blood work and culture in the immunocompromised, ill-appearing patient. Also, consider extensive workup in patients who may be intravenous drug abusers, patients with prosthetic heart valves, and those with other intravascular devices. Patients who are septic will require full workup and resuscitation.
