The etiology can be broadly classified into infectious and non-infectious. Infectious agents include Neisseria gonorrhea, Chlamydia trachomatis, and less commonly, herpes simplex, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Mycoplasma genitalium. Neisseria and chlamydia primarily infect the columnar epithelium of endocervix, whereas HSV and trichomonas affect the squamous epithelium of ectocervix.

Non-infectious causes include mechanical and chemical irritants. Surgical instruments or foreign objects like pessaries, condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, or tampons can cause mechanical trauma. Chemical irritants cause allergic reactions and include soaps, laundry products, spermicides, latex, vaginal douches, and contraceptive creams.

Systemic inflammatory diseases like lichen planus and Behcet syndrome have also been implicated in cervicitis. The hypoestrogenic state seen with natural or surgical menopause can mimic cervicitis. This is due to the atrophy of the vaginal and uterine lining.
