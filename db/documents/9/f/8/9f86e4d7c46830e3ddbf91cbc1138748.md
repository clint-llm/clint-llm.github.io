Contrecoup brain injury has multiple manifestations in addition to the primary one of contralateral intracerebral hemorrhage, which is used to define contrecoup injury in most cases.

The essential factors in contrecoup injury are an impact on the head and some form of acceleration, deceleration, rotational stress, or angular stress. Several of these factors are necessary to cause contrecoup injury.

Acceleration, deceleration, and rotation injury such as might occur in shaken baby syndrome in the absence of impact directly to the head is not noted to cause contrecoup injury.

Prognosis is favorable in about half of the cases.
