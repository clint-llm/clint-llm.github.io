The triple arthrodesis is a versatile procedure useful in many pedal conditions and gait disturbances. The term "triple" arthrodesis refers to a fusion procedure of three joints of the hindfoot; the subtalar joint (talus and calcaneus), the talonavicular joint, and the calcaneocuboid joint.  Due to the procedure's predictability, it is often used as a definitive treatment for many pedal deformities and offers patients the ability for pain-free, propulsive gait.  In one study following patients who underwent a triple arthrodesis, 95% of patients were satisfied with the outcome after 44 years.
