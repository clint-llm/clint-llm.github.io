Nurses participate in the evaluation of neonates after maternal reports of decreased fetal movement. Interventions may include applying an external fetal heart monitor, monitoring for contractions, assessing maternal vital signs, and assessing for rupture of maternal membranes. The nurse may also be involved in the care of the woman during further ultrasound assessment of the fetus (biophysical profile) and in communicating the assessments to the patient and her family as well as the primary care clinician.

The nurse in labor and delivery may need to assist in the induction of labor of the patient or cesarean delivery of a compromised fetus if the evaluation is not favorable or reassuring. Communication with all parties is a very important role of the nurse as well as providing empathy and assistance to the patient and family when the pregnancy/birth are not as planned or expected. This can help improve patient outcomes for both mother and baby.
