The wrist is a joint complex comprised of three other joints: the radiocarpal joint, the ulnocarpal joint, and the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). The radiocarpal joint is a synovial joint formed by the articulation between the distal radius and the scaphoid, lunate, and triquetrum as well as the soft tissue structures that hold the joint together.
