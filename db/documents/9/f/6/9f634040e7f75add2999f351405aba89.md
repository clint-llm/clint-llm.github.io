There are several techniques for resection of the thymus gland and its associated pathologies. The previous gold standard technique involved a median sternotomy; however, recent minimally invasive techniques have garnered more interest due to several key advantages. Robotic thymectomy was shown to have lower operative blood loss rates, fewer postoperative complications, and reduced hospital stay than the open approach. Advantages have also been seen in oncologic resection with high rates of negative margins.
