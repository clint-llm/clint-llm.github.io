There are various etiologies of TT syndrome and MEMs as a broader category, ranging from idiopathic, vascular, demyelinating disorders, traumatic, tumor, or infectious. There have been documented instances of bilateral TT syndrome due to multiple sclerosis. However, the process by which tinnitus is produced is not yet completely understood. Tonic tensor tympani syndrome (TTTS) has been described to cause TT spasms leading to tinnitus and hyperacusis. TTTS is believed to be an involuntary condition due to an overlying anxiety disorder, which causes a reduction in the threshold required to trigger the TT muscle reflex.
