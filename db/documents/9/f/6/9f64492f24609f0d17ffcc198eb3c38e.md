Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting neuroendocrine tumor. It is 1 of the 3 types based on secreting catecholamine.

- Norepinephrine secreting tumor

- Epinephrine secreting tumor

- Norepinephrine and epinephrine secreting tumor

Tumors secrete only norepinephrine, usually present with sustained hypertension. Norepinephrine and epinephrine secreting tumors present with paroxysmal hypertension. Only epinephrine can cause hypotension instead of hypertension.

Due to catecholamine release, there is an increase in heart rate, systemic vascular resistance, inotropic effect, and a decrease in venous compliance. In pheochromocytoma, there is orthostatic hypotension, as it is a volume-depleted type of hypertension.
