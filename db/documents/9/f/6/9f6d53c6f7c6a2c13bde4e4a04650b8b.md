There is currently no procedure or treatment option to repair mutations in the P53 gene as P53 is not a drug target yet. In general, radiation therapy should be avoided in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome as individuals are at high risk of radiation-induced secondary cancers. Similarly, exposure to computed tomography (CT) scans or X-rays should be avoided.

No evidence suggests that individuals with LFS diagnosed with cancers should be treated uniquely from other patients with the same cancer. However, in breast cancer, complete mastectomy rather than lumpectomy which is usually followed by radiation therapy is generally preferred because of the risks of second breast cancers or radiation-induced neoplasms.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome patients are prone to anxiety, depression, and clinically relevant distress. Psychological monitoring is recommended and providing support is very important.
