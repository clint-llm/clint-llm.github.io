**Corneal Abrasion and Foreign Body**

Corneal abrasions may be caused by any number of objects including fingernails, contact lens wear, plant branches, and foreign objects blown or thrown into the eyes. Lack of eye protection can result in high-speed projectile objects penetrating the cornea resulting in more serious damage.

**Corneal Perforation**

Corneal laceration and perforation can be accidental, however more oftenÂ involve activities that cause high-speed projectiles such as saws, angle grinders, and pounding metal objects, with or without eye protection. It is important to elicit from the history the type of object i.e. wood or metal and estimated projectile speed.

**Ocular Burns**

Exposure-related burns of the eye can be categorized into chemical (acid and alkali burns), radiation burns from ultraviolet (UV) sources, and thermal burns. Alkali corneal injuries are more common than acid due to the prevalence of household cleaning agents containing ammonia and lye. Acidic burns are typically work-related injuries involving industrial processes, but can also be intentional assault.
