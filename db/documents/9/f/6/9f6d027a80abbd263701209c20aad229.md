The excision of 3′ nucleotides to produce DNA 3′ termini suitable for downstream events is a critical step in DNA replication, repair, and recombination pathways. The 3′ to 5′ exonucleases play an important role in DNA repair pathways to excise mismatched, fragmented, modified, or even normal nucleotides from DNA 3′ termini.

The most important role of TREX1 is to maintain host innate immune tolerance to cytosolic self-DNA by degrading a range of substrates to prevent the initiation of autoimmunity.
