Conservative treatment of minor local infections includes warm compress and over-the-counter or prescription topical antibiotics such as bacitracin or mupirocin. Oral antibiotics such as cephalexin or clindamycin provide coverage for streptococcus and staphylococcus. If concerns for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus exist, then oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole confers adequate coverage. Infected piercings of the high ear involving the cartilaginous structures are likely to be caused by Pseudomonas and are treatable with a fluoroquinolone like ciprofloxacin.

Removal of the piercing jewelry is requisite, and the placement of a loose loop suture through the piercing can be used to maintain the piercing patency throughout the duration of infection treatment. Oral piercings tend to have a lower infection rate but when present are treatable with amoxicillin/clavulanate. The recommended duration of treatment for local cellulitis is five days, but therapy duration extension is possible if there is no sign of symptomatic improvement.
