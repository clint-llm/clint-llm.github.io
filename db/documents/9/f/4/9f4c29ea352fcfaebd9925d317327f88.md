Boundaries of the sphenopalatine foramen

- Superiorly: the body of the sphenoid

- Anteriorly: the orbital process of the palatine bone.

- Posteriorly: the sphenoidal process of the palatine bone.

- Inferiorly:Â  the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone.

Location

The foramen can be found at the posterior-superior-medial corner of the maxillary sinus, just deep to the attachment of the middle turbinate, but exists in a variety of locations:

- Class I (35 to 82%): the opening is purely into the superior meatus (e.g., above the middle turbinate)

- Class II (15 to 56%): opening spans the ethmoidal crest (e.g., at the transition of the middle and superior meatus)

- Class III (2 to 9%): openings exist on both sides of the ethmoidal crest.

Shape and size

- Studies that have examined the shape of this foramen have reported that it can appear in various shapes, including square, oval, triangular, and piriform deep grooves that extend superiorly and inferiorly from the foramen.

- In adults, the sphenopalatine foramen measures roughly 6 mm and 5.5 mm in the vertical and horizontal planes, respectively.

Endoscopic landmarks for sphenopalatine foramen localization

- The posterior wall of the maxillary sinus: within 1 cm anterior to the sphenopalatine foramen

- Maxillary line: 3.7 cm anterior to the sphenopalatine foramen

- Anterior head of the middle turbinate: 3.4 cm anterior to the sphenopalatine foramen

- Inferior turbinate horizontal lamina: 1.3 cm inferior to the sphenopalatine foramen

- Basal lamella: 1.2 cm anterior to the sphenopalatine foramen

- Choanal arch: 0.9 cm posterior to the sphenopalatine foramen

- Nasal floor: 1.8-2.7 cm inferior to the sphenopalatine foramen

- Ethmoid crest (i.e., crista ethmoidalis): a sharp bony projection that characterizes the anterior portion of the sphenopalatine foramen

- NOTE: Females have statistically shorter distances to the sphenopalatine foramen from the nasal floor, maxillary line, choanal arch, and anterior head of the middle turbinate.

Accessory foramen

- Approximately 80 to 90% of individuals have one sphenopalatine foramen per side, while around 10 to 20% of individuals may possess an accessory sphenopalatine foramen, which is typically located anteroinferior to the sphenopalatine foramen. This arrangement is thought to be dictated by the embryologic development of the sphenopalatine artery, which can be highly variable in terms of its number of branches as well as the location of the branch points. Nevertheless, no variables or characteristics show any association with the presence of an accessory sphenopalatine foramen.

Contents of the sphenopalatine foramen

- Sphenopalatine artery (SPA) - a terminal branch of the internal maxillary artery (branch of the external carotid artery). The sphenopalatine artery is the dominant blood supply to the posterior mucosa of the nasal cavity.

- Posterior superior lateral nasal nerve - a branch of the nasopalatine nerve that provides sensory innervation to the lateral wall of the nasal cavity

- Nasopalatine nerve - a derivative of the pterygopalatine ganglion that is considered part of the parasympathetic nervous system.
