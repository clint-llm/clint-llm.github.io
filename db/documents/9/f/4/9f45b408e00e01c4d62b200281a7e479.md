Surgical debridement is the treatment of choice for most cases of fungal sinusitis,

Oral corticosteroids are beneficial in many acute and chronic fungal sinusitis (AFS) and improve symptoms by suppressing inflammation and lowering circulating IgE levels, although their prolonged use is discouraged.

Systemic antifungals are not ideal therapy for AFS but can be an adjunct treatment for invasive fungal rhinosinusitis. Amphotericin B may be the first drug of choice in the treatment of invasive fungal sinusitis because of its broad coverage of Mucor species and Aspergillus. The use of some azole antifungals could also be beneficial, but concurrent management by an infectious disease specialist is warranted.

Fungal immunotherapy is also an alternative treatment for AFS as it can desensitize the body to fungal antibodies.

As mentioned above, most cases of invasive fungal sinusitis are secondary to the deficient immune system. Therefore, one must address the cause of the immunodeficiency for optimal care.

Saprophytic fungal sinusitis does not require surgical intervention. It is manageable through nasal douching, which is cleansing of the nasal sinuses with saline.
