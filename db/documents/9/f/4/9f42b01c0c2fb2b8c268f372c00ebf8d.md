Though not synthesized in the body, histidine has an extensive metabolic pathway for breakdown and conversion to its various byproducts. The biosynthesis of histamine from histidine occurs via vitamin B-dependent decarboxylation reaction by histidine decarboxylase that occurs in multiple types of cells located throughout the body, particularly in the brain and stomach. Histamine synthesis is continuous and, once made, is stored in granules, awaiting activation signals for release.

Histidine is a significant catalytic residue in the enzymes of many classes of biological reactions. Its efficiency at shuttling protons greatly enhances catalysis. Histidine is particularly important in acid-base catalysis due to its amphoteric properties. Another type of reaction catalysis histidine residues participates in are elimination-addition reactions in the body, as well as hemolytic and redox reaction.

One excellent example of histidineâ€™s involvement as a catalytic residue is provided by serine esterases, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, acetylcholinesterase, and the various enzymes in the blood-clotting cascade. In these cases, histidine lies between a catalytic aspartate (which serves as a specific base), pulling a proton from the imidazole group, thereby making the imidazole group a better base to abstract/polarize the hydrogen ion from the active-site serine hydroxyl.
