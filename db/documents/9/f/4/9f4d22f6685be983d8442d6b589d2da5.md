Patients with lung lesions often first come to the attention of the primary care provider and nurse practitioner. Because there is always the possibility of malignancy, these patients should obtain a referral to an interprofessional team that includes an oncologist, thoracic surgeon, radiologist, and a pulmonologist. If observation is deemed to be the management plan, the most important facet is to ensure that the lesion is not malignant. No matter how technically skilled the radiologist is interpreting lung lesions, the definitive diagnosis is only possible with a biopsy. If observation is the chosen course, serial CT scans are recommended to ensure that the lesion is not growing.
