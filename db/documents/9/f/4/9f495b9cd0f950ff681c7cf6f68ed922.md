Though the anatomy of the triangles of the neck is fairly well-defined, there are many documented naturally occurring variants. One such variation involves the course of the spinal accessory nerve, which is associated with both the anterior and posterior triangles. The nerve exits the cranial cavity through the jugular foramen and descends alongside the internal jugular vein, only briefly passing through the borders of the carotid triangle. It is generally accepted that the accessory nerve crosses laterally to the internal jugular vein at the level of the third cervical vertebra on its path to innervate the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. However, one study of 207 neck dissections found that the nerve crossed medially to the vein in six cases. Some cadaveric studies have even reported an incidence as high as one-third of individuals with the nerve passing medial to the vein.

There also exists another rare variant of the spinal accessory nerve in which the nerve splits into a superior and inferior division within the anterior triangle. Another similar study demonstrated this variant in three of 133 neck dissections. In such cases, the superior division enters the sternocleidomastoid and supplies its motor innervation, while the posterior division follows an extended course through the carotid triangle before it passes deep to the sternocleidomastoid and through the posterior triangle to supply the trapezius.
