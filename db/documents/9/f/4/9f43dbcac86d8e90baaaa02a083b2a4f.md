# Continuing Education Activity

Anti NMDA receptor encephalitis is commonly confused with schizophrenia. Most of the available data on this illness is through published case reports. Although it has been newly recognized and understood, it is thought to be the more common cause of suspected demonic possession in childhood described throughout history as childhood-onset schizophrenia is very rare. Since there is more awareness about the symptoms, the pervasiveness of this form of encephalitis as a diagnosis has increased. This activity is an attempt to highlight the presentation, timeline of symptoms, key to diagnosis, and treatment of Anti NMDAR encephalitis in the pediatric population. Diagnostic clarity would expedite treatment leading to better outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the clinical presentation in the various stages of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. 
- Identify the diagnostic clues to anti-NMDAR encephalitis.
- Summarize the available treatment options for management in the pediatric population.

# Introduction

Following the first report of pediatric anti-NMDAR encephalitis in China in 2010,  anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis is now recognized more frequently and commonly in the pediatric population. It is the second most common etiology for acute demyelinating encephalitis after mixed disturbance encephalitis surpassing all viral etiologies for encephalitis.

# Etiology

Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is an immune-mediated neuroinflammatory disease characterized by autoantibodies against the GluN1 subunit 2B (NR2B)/NMDA subunit 2A (NR2A) subunits of the NDMA receptor in the hippocampus causing the symptoms. Initially, it was diagnosed as a paraneoplastic disease most commonly associated with ovarian teratoma.

Another confirmed association has been seen with herpes simplex encephalitis.

In the California encephalitis project, it was found out that anti-NMDAR antibodies were produced in children post-infection with mycoplasma.

# Epidemiology

Despite being recognized only 13 years ago and having an incidence of only 1.5 per million population per year, more than 1000 cases have been reported until now. It affects most age groups and both genders, with more incidence seen in females (75% cases).

# Pathophysiology

NMDAR is an excitatory glutamate receptor that, when activated, allows the passage of sodium and calcium ions through the channel. Activation occurs by the removal of magnesium plug, leading to glutamate and glycine binding to their respective sites.

Evidence suggests that these antibodies are produced in the CNS by antibody-producing cells that cross the blood-brain barrier.

Iizuka et al. postulated that NMDAR is present in high density in the frontotemporal area, which atrophies in anti-NMDAR encephalitis leading to changes in behavior, learning, and memory.

# History and Physical

Anti-NMDAR encephalitis has four clinical stages.

- Prodromal phase (phase 1): this stage is characterized by fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and upper respiratory tract infection-like symptoms.

- Illness phase (phase 2): During this stage, MRI abnormalities or pleocytosis can be seen, which decreases over several weeks without any visible changes in the symptoms.
- Psychiatric phase- This phase lasts for 1 to 2 weeks. Children present with behavioral changes, irritability, tantrums, coma, manic symptoms, behavioral outbursts, sleep dysfunction, and hyperactivity.
- Neurological phase- This phase lasts for weeks to months. Children present with seizures (focal, motor, complex partial), dystonia, or status epilepticus.

- Recovery phase (phase 3): Recovery has been described in the reverse order of the presentation of symptoms.

- Late phase (phase 4): The majority of the patients make a full recovery of cognition and behavioral abnormality at the time of hospital discharge.

# Evaluation

Every child should be tested for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and other viral etiology testing can be based on time of year and geographical location. Diagnostic clues for diagnosing anti- NMDAR encephalitis are shown in figure 1. Confirmation of the clinical diagnosis requires demonstration of IgG antibodies against the GluN1 subunit of NMDAR in the serum or CSF sample.

Brain MRI demonstrates bilateral T2 or FLAIR signal hyperintensities in hippocampi, frontal cortex, medial temporal lobe, cerebellar cortex, spinal cord, and medulla oblongata.

Electroencephalography shows a slow continuous rhythmic and disorganized activity in delta and theta range superimposed seizures, as 90% of patients have a slowing of EEG at some point during the illness.

# Treatment / Management

Autonomic dysfunction, hyperventilation, cardiac arrhythmia, or hyperkinetic crisis can occur in children presenting with neurological symptoms. These children should be managed in the ICU. First-line treatment involves teratoma resection (if present), immunotherapy comprising of corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins or plasma exchange, and supportive care.

Clonidine, trazodone, and benzodiazepines help to reverse sleep disturbances. Phenobarbital, trihexyphenidyl, and opioids can treat extreme agitation.

Psychotic and behavioral symptoms are managed using typical or atypical antipsychotics. Severe dopamine blockage can exacerbate dyskinetic movements. The development of neuroleptic malignant syndrome may occur, which can complicate and misdiagnose anti NMDAR encephalitis. Quetiapine is the drug of choice for treating psychosis. Valproate works as an excellent mood stabilizer and also offers seizure prophylaxis. Gabapentin and lithium can also be used for mood dysregulation.

If children show no improvement with any of the above treatment modalities, mechanical ventilation, and ketamine or propofol infusion can be considered. Children under the age of 5 years are at a higher risk of precipitating propofol infusion syndrome. Vigilant laboratory surveillance is needed in children receiving propofol for longer than 24 hours.

Resting tachycardia is one of the most common autonomic and hemodynamic instability seen in the pediatric population suffering from anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

In the third week, placement of tracheostomy and gastrostomy tubes have shown to improve patient safety and also allows to switch to lesser sedation. Once feasible, it becomes of the utmost importance, that a comprehensive rehabilitation program is begun.

# Differential Diagnosis

The condition can be presented to either a neurologist or a psychiatrist. The following should be considered as differentials: Drug abuse, post-infectious syndromes (viral, Mycoplasma, pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with Streptococcal infections). Acquired reversible autistic syndrome in acute encephalopathic illness in children, immune-mediated chorea encephalopathy syndrome in childhood, acute diffuse lymphocytic meningoencephalitis, acute reversible limbic encephalitis, acute juvenile non-herpetic encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), inborn errors of metabolism (including urea cycle disorders), environmental toxins and medication overdose, rheumatological conditions such as neuropsychiatric lupus and primary psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia. Due to the extensive differential diagnosis, the patient’s diagnostic workup should be individualized.

# Prognosis

In the research, Dalmau showed that 75% of the patients with NMDAR encephalitis recover entirely or with mild sequelae while the other 25% have severe CNS deficits or eventually die.

In a study using the data obtained from 382 patients aged between 1 to 85 years, Balu et al. devised a five-point predictions score, Anti-NMDAR encephalitis 1-year functioning status (NEOS) score.

# Complications

Early identification and treatment have been shown to cause less damage to the hippocampus, yet the optimal time window between symptom onset and treatment initiation is still not identified.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

A careful look at the symptoms and identification of IgG antibodies in CSF is vital to prevent misdiagnosis in patients presenting with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. No specific biomarker exists to predict the outcomes for this encephalitis. Therefore, the dissemination of knowledge about this disorder is required for better patient outcomes.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Child neurologists must work in a timely manner to facilitate early screening and diagnosis. Management of patients in ICU requires a multidisciplinary approach from a team comprising of neurologists, psychiatrists, nutritionists, and physical therapists. Arrangements should be made for social workers, pastoral care, and child life experts to be actively involved in care as children and families find that helpful.

Anti NMDAR encephalitis can be easily diagnosed using serum or CSF sample testing. An index of suspicion should be raised in children, presenting with personality changes, abnormal movements or postures, seizures, autonomic instability, or hypoventilation. It poses considerable difficulty in early diagnosis and treatment. Management may also prove to be clinically challenging as it involves treating both the cause and the symptoms.

The recovery is slow; hence, long-term monitoring is required by an interprofessional team consisting of doctors, and social workers would help decreasing morbidity tremendously. A continuous follow-up by the rehabilitation and neurology team is essential. A psychiatry consultation might be needed for both patients and family members in order to cope during the recovery. Interdisciplinary communication and collaboration are quintessential to good patient outcomes with this condition.
