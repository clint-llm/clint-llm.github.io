Treatment modalities for VPD include speech therapy, prosthetics, and surgery.

- **Speech therapy**is the mainstay of treatment for patients with mislearned articulation as well as those with poor compensatory mechanisms from VPD. In addition, patients who undergo surgical intervention should continue speech therapy to further enhance their speech outcomes.

- **Oral prosthetics**are custom-made by prosthodontists and anchored to the maxillary teeth to provide soft palate elevation. They are usually poorly tolerated by patients and often used as a temporary measure or for poor surgical candidates.

- **Surgery**is the definitive treatment for anatomic causes of VPD with the goal of creating a functional seal between the nasal and oral cavities while avoiding airway obstruction. Operative repair usually takes place after age 3-4 years when patients are cooperative with instrumental diagnosis.

- **Palatal muscle repositioning maneuvers**lengthen or readjust the orientation of palatal muscles. The Furlow double-opposing Z-plasty was originally used for primary cleft palate repair but has the added benefit of lengthening the palate by reorienting the levator veli palatini muscles in a transverse fashion.

- **Pharyngeal flap**is ideal for the sagittal closure pattern and involves elevating a midline, superiorly-based flap of mucosa and superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle from the posterior pharyngeal wall and suturing it to the posterior soft palate.

- **Sphincter pharyngoplasty**is ideal for the coronal closure pattern and involves elevating bilateral, superiorly-based flaps of palatopharyngeal mucosa and muscle. The flaps are rotated 90 degrees and the distal ends sutured to the contralateral posterior pharyngeal wall or to each other to create two horizontally overlapping arms.

- **Posterior pharyngeal wall augmentation**involves expanding the posterior pharyngeal wall with a graft or alloplastic material in order to decrease the distance between itself and the soft palate. Several materials have been described such as cartilage, fascia, acellular dermis, calcium hydroxylapatite, hyaluronic acid, fat, and silicone.
