The only definitive treatment of ACD is the identification and removal of the offending agent, and all patients with suspected or confirmed ACD should be advised of this. First-line medical therapy includes topical steroids when ACD is confined to less than 20% of the body, and oral corticosteroids when greater than 20% of the body is involved.  If ACD involves a delicate area such as skin folds or eyelids, topical calcineurin inhibitors or PDE4 inhibitors may also be effective. Upon identification of the allergen, strict avoidance is necessary to prevent a recurrence.

For severe cases, topical immunomodulators like tacrolimus may be beneficial. Some patients may benefit from phototherapy using UV A plus psoralen. Rarely in severe cases, one may require immunosuppressive agents like mycophenolate.

In cases of chronic or recalcitrant ACD, use patch testing to identifying the causative agent.
