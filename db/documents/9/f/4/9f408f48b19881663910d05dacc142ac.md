Malaria is an infection caused by Plasmodium species endemic to most parts of Africa, South America, East Asia, and parts of Europe and the Middle East. At least 10 to 30 thousand of the 125 million travelers to these areas are infected each year. All visitors to endemic areas should receive counseling on malaria risk, mosquito bite avoidance, and tailored chemoprophylaxis based on their medical histories and travel plans. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of chemoprophylaxis of malaria and highlights the role of the healthcare team in improving care for patients with potential exposure to this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe common options for malaria chemoprophylaxis.
- Identify common adverse events associated with antimalarial drugs.
- Outline the critical differences in malaria prophylaxis amongst special populations.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with potential exposure to malaria.
