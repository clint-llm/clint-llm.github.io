The patient with AR pupil will show small, irregular pupils with light-near dissociation: absent light reflex, prompt constriction with near accommodation. Symptoms are usually bilateral and have a gradual onset of months to years. The pupils will initially have a sluggish response to light, progressing eventually to a complete absence of the light reflex. Close examination may show an atrophied iris with loss of the radial folds and crypts. Additionally, pupils will exhibit slow dilation with atropine (or other mydriatics).

Other findings to correlate the diagnosis of AR pupil are those suggestive of late-stage syphilis, such as:

- Tabes dorsalis: The posterior columns of the spinal cord and its dorsal root become affected in this stage of syphilis.

- These patients suffer from sensory ataxia – lack of coordination due to a loss of sensory input into the control of movement (not from cerebellar pathology) and lancinating pains – the sensation of sudden, brief, severe pains over the face, back, limbs that can last from minutes to days.

- Those patients afflicted with tabes dorsalis often have pupil irregularities, 50% of which will be the distinctive AR pupil.
