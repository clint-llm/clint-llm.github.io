Dextrocardia occursÂ as a result of abnormalities in the embryological development of the heart. The heart is the first organ to develop in an embryo. The fetal heart develops from an embryonic heart tube, which is formed by the fusion of the endocardial tubes. The heart tube attaches to the cranial aspect to the arterial trunk, and the caudal aspect is connected to the venous channels. Once the heart tube is formed, the next important step in the development of the heart is looping. Looping determines the position of the ventricle in relationship to the atria. The heart tube may loop to the right (termed as D loop) or loop to the left (termed as L-loop). With a D-loop, the morphologic right ventricle lies to the right of the left ventricle, whereas, with an L-loop, the morphologic right ventricle is positioned to the left of the left ventricle.
