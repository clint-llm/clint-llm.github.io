A caudal block is a type of central neuraxial block, most commonly used in pediatrics to provide analgesia for surgeries up to the umbilicus, and in adults for chronic low back pain management. Caudal blocks can be performed by using the blind technique or with increasing accuracy via ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance. This activity describes the anatomy, indications, contraindications, and approach to performing caudal anesthesia, and highlights the role of the healthcare team in enhancing care for patients who undergo caudal anesthesia.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of caudal anesthesia.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to caudal anesthesia.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of caudal anesthesia.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance caudal anesthesia techniques and improve outcomes.
