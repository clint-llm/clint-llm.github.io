Multimodal pain control is an important modality to control pain in the post-operative period in all patients undergoing surgery or various other procedures. This is especially important in orthopedic surgeries, which often require extensive dissection and fixation of complex periarticular fractures and joint replacement procedures. Multimodal pain control is the use of multiple analgesic medications, opioids, and non-opioid and non-pharmacologic interventions to decrease pain at varying locations in the pain pathway. This allows the patient to benefit from several different medications that may potentiate one another, mitigate side effects of certain drug classes, and decrease the amount of use of opiates post-operatively.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize multimodal pain control and its benefits
- Review different drug classes utilized for managing pain with multimodal pain control, specifically in the orthopedic post-operative patient.
- Explain recommendations determined by evidence-based support of post-operative pain control after orthopedic surgery.
- Outline the benefits and effectiveness of multimodal pain control for the interprofessional team to make an informed decision about incorporating this into their practices.
