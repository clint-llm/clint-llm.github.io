Polycythemia vera is a myeloproliferative disorder associated with a Janus kinase-2 (JAK2) mutation that causes the neoplastic proliferation of the hematopoietic progenitor cells. It causes elevated red blood cell production along with secondary white blood cell and platelet production. Disease complications are associated with increased blood viscosity, including thromboses. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of polycythemia vera and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of polycythemia vera.
- Describe the presentation of polycythemia vera.
- Outline treatment recommendations for polycythemia vera.
- Review the importance of collaboration among the interprofessional team to achieve correct diagnosis and management to improve outcomes in patients with polycythemia vera.
