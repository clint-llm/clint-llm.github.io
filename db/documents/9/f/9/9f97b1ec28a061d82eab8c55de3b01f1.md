Contraindications to hydrocodone/acetaminophen include patients with severe respiratory depression, acute or significant bronchial asthma, gastrointestinal obstruction, and anaphylactic reactions due to components of the formula.

As per the manufacturer's label, several drugs interact with hydrocodone/acetaminophen and caution should be used when they are coadministered.

- **CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 Inhibitors:**The coadministration of hydrocodone and acetaminophen with CYP3A4 inhibitors (erythromycin, ketoconazole, and ritonavir) may lead to an increase in the plasma concentration of the hydrocodone and this may result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects may be more pronounced when CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors are coadministered with hydrocodone and acetaminophen.

- **CYP3A4 Inducers:**The coadministration of hydrocodone and acetaminophen with CYP3A4  inducers (rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin) may lead to a decrease in the plasma concentration of hydrocodone, and this may result in decreased efficacy.

- **Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants:**The coadministration of hydrocodone and acetaminophen with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, due to its additive pharmacologic effect, may lead to an increase in the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, severe sedation, coma, and death.

- **Serotonergic Drugs:**The coadministration of hydrocodone and acetaminophen with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin, and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists) or with drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, monoamine oxidase inhibitors) may result in serotonin syndrome.

- **Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics:**The coadministration of hydrocodone and acetaminophen with other opioid analgesics (butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine) may lead to reducing the analgesic effect of opioids and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

- **Muscle Relaxants:**The coadministration of hydrocodone and acetaminophen with muscle relaxants may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action and may induce a higher degree of respiratory depression.

- **Diuretics:**The coadministration of hydrocodone and acetaminophen with other diuretics may reduce the efficacy of diuretics due to the induction of antidiuretic hormone.

- **Anticholinergic Drugs:**The coadministration of hydrocodone and acetaminophen with anticholinergic drugs may increase the risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation.
