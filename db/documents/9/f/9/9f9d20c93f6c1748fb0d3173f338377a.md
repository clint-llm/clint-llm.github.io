**Viral Hepatitis**

**Hepatitis A**

The incubation period of hepatitis A virus is approximately four weeks. Acute infections of hepatitis A virus are more severe with higher mortality in adults than children. Symptoms include malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. Relapses are not common, and the infection does not result in chronic hepatitis. Also, only less than 1% of cases result in fulminant hepatic failure.

**Hepatitis B**

The incubation period of an acute hepatitis B virus infection is approximately 12 weeks, with a majority of patients experiencing mild illness and less than 1% experiencing fulminant hepatic failure. After acute infection resolves, the majority of adult patients and a small percentage of infected infants develop antibodies against the hepatitis B surface antigen and end up recovering fully. However, a small percentage of adult patients and the majority of infected infants end up developing chronic infection. About 10% to 30% of carriers become symptomatic from chronic infection. They can also have extrahepatic manifestations of the disease. About 20% of chronic hepatitis patients end up developing cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation, while 5% end up developing hepatocellular carcinoma.

**Hepatitis C**

The incubation period of hepatitis C virus is approximately eight weeks. Most cases of acute hepatitis C infection are asymptomatic; however, about 55% to 85% of patients develop chronic hepatitis C and liver disease, and 30% of those patients end up developing cirrhosis.  Patients who are infected with the hepatitis C virus and have a chronic infection are at high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Close to 20,000 deaths annually are attributable to chronic hepatitis C infection as a contributing cause of death.

**Hepatitis D**

The incubation period for hepatitis D virus is approximately 13 weeks. Hepatitis D virus infection causes hepatitis only in persons with acute or chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Symptoms are similar to acute hepatitis B virus infection, but patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and hepatitis D virus infection tend to progress more rapidly to cirrhosis than those patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection alone. Also, patients already infected with the hepatitis B virus may develop superinfection if also infected with the hepatitis D virus.  Superinfection can result in fulminant hepatic failure.

**Hepatitis E**

The incubation period for hepatitis E virus is approximately 2 to 10 weeks.  Acute hepatitis E virus infection is less severe compared to acute hepatitis B virus infection, but pregnant females infected in the third trimester have a greater than 25% mortality associated with hepatitis E infection.

**Hepatitis G**

The incubation period of hepatitis G is approximately 14 to 20 days. The clinical picture can be similar to the picture of mild hepatitis infection with other hepatitis viruses, and patients can have normal or low aminotransferase without jaundice. The elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is not proportional to the degree of viremia in hepatitis G, unlike hepatitis C, where patients with high viral load can have a higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels.

**Autoimmune Hepatitis**

Autoimmune hepatitis typically results in high levels of gammaglobulin and circulating autoantibodies. Many patients have a family history of other autoimmune disorders or have responded in the past to immunosuppressive therapy. The pathogenetic mechanism is not entirely understood, but studies have shown that patients who develop autoimmune hepatitis sometimes have a genetic predisposition to the disease in susceptible individuals, who may develop the disease secondary to a viral infection or an idiosyncratic reaction to the drug, which can act as an inducing mechanism.

**Alcoholic Hepatitis**

The pathogenetic mechanism of alcoholic hepatitis is complex and multifactorial.  It results from interactions between ethanol metabolism, inflammation, and innate immunity, which end up causing hepatocyte death by necrosis or apoptosis from oxidative stress.  Studies have shown cytokines and tumor necrosis factors playing a role also in causing hepatotoxicity.
