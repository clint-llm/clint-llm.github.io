The correct number of sedation-trained healthcare professionals must be acquired before starting treatment. Typically, this is the dental surgeon and one dental nurse. This allows the dentist and their dental assistant to focus on the therapy while the remaining sedation nurse monitors the patient. These team members will have completed further training providing them with an additional qualification. They should also be trained in basic and immediate life support, eg, managing medical emergencies or using airway adjuncts.
