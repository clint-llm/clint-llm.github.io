The inferior gluteal nerve innervates the gluteus maximus muscle. This muscle is primarily responsible for hip, torso extension, and returning from a squat position. The gluteus maximus muscle has a broad base origin from the posterior surface of the iliac crest down to the lateral border of the coccyx with fascial insertion onto the sacral multifidus and gluteus medius and inserts itself into the gluteal tuberosity of the femur and portions of the iliotibial fascia. Bartlett and colleagues examined the gluteus maximus muscle during different active movements and found that sprinting far superseded climbing, walking, and running. They compared this muscular pattern to that of apes and found that among different insertional patterns, humans had more gluteus maximus activation during sprinting, suggesting an evolutionary adaptation.
