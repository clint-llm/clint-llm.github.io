Various branches of the ophthalmic artery provide the eye's blood supply, including the central artery of the retina, short and long posterior ciliary arteries, and the anterior ciliary arteries. Six to 12 short posterior ciliary arteries arise from the ophthalmic artery as it crosses the optic nerve. They supply blood to the ciliary processes. Two long posterior ciliary arteries pass through the posterior portion of the sclera at a close distance to the optic nerve. They supply blood to the choroid and ciliary muscle. Seven anterior ciliary arteries supply the conjunctiva, sclera, and rectus muscles. Six extrinsic eye muscles move each eye: the superior rectus, inferior rectus, lateral rectus, medial rectus, superior oblique, and inferior oblique. These muscles are important for moving the eyes as they place an image on the fovea to get maximum resolution.

The ciliary muscle also contracts and relaxes its longitudinal fibersÂ to increase and decrease the size of the pore in the trabecular meshwork. The trabecular meshwork is responsible for aqueous humor drainage in the anterior portion of the eye. Changing the pore size can impede or facilitate aqueous humor flow in the canal of Schlemm.
