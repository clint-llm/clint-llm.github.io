**Initial Management**

The management varies with bleeding severities as described below:

- **Critical bleeding:**Pericardial, intracranial, intraocular, intraspinal, retroperitoneal, or intramuscular bleeding with compartment syndrome or any other bleeding leading to hemodynamic instability. Immediate treatment with platelet transfusion, intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), and glucocorticoids is required. The platelet count is typically <20,000/microL and often <10,000/microL. However, it can also occur with a higher platelet count (e.g., between 20,000 and 50,000/microL) and require similar treatment. Other reasons for bleeding should also be investigated and treated, as thrombocytopenia is unlikely to be the only reason for the bleeding. It is often treated in the intensive care unit.

- **Severe bleeding:**Bleeding that does not meet the definition of critical bleeding but leads to a fall in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL. Requires urgent treatment with IVIG and glucocorticoids. Like critical bleeding, the platelet count is typically <20,000/microL and often <10,000/microL. It is also often treated in the intensive care unit.

- **Minor bleeding:**This is bleeding that does not meet any of the above criteria; minor skin bleeds, for instance. These patients require close observation. The general management of treating minor bleeding and severe thrombocytopenia with or without bleeding is similar. Most patients with minor bleeding (platelet count is often <50,000/microL) and those with platelet counts <20,000/microL are treated. Patients with platelet count ≥30,000/microL and not bleeding often do not require any treatment.
            The American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines recommend that children with no bleeding or mild bleeding (i.e., bruising or petechiae) be observed with monitoring of bleeding regardless of platelet count. This includes repeat laboratory studies under the care of a pediatric hematologist to monitor platelet levels. Fifty to seventy percent of children will recover without intervention within three to six months from the initial presentation. For those children with non-life-threatening mucosal bleeding and/or decreased health-related quality of life, guidelines recommend prednisone 2 to 4 mg/kg/day (maximum 120 mg daily) for 5 to 7 days. For children where corticosteroids are contraindicated or not preferred, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or anti-D immunoglobulin can be used.

The need for therapy requires the following assessment:

- Presence and type of bleeding

- Platelet count

- Other bleeding risk factors

- Any previous treatments

**Critical Bleeding**

- **Platelet transfusion:**1 apheresis unit or 4 to 6 units of pooled platelet. It is the fastest way to increase the platelet count in critical bleeding. Repeated transfusions and other systemic therapies are needed as platelet count increases typically last less than one hour. Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) may enhance the response to platelet transfusion.

- **IVIG and glucocorticoids:**Their combined effect is perceived as augmentative.
- IVIG is typically administered as 1 g/kg as a single dose and may be repeated the following day unless the platelet count is >50,000/microL.
- Glucocorticoids are usually prescribed as **one**of the following regimes:
- Methylprednisolone 1 g IV once daily for 3 days
- Dexamethasone 40 mg IV once daily for 4 days

- Hemostatic therapies like **tranexamic acid**may also be given.

**Severe Bleeding**

- **IVIG and glucocorticoids:**Their combined effect is perceived as augmentative.
- IVIG is typically administered as 1 g/kg as a single dose and may be repeated the next day unless the platelet count is >50,000/microL.
- Glucocorticoids are usually prescribed as **one**of the following regimes:
- Methylprednisolone 1 g IV once daily for 3 days
- Dexamethasone 40 mg IV once daily for 4 days

- Hemostatic therapies like **tranexamic acid**may also be given.

**Minor bleeding/low platelet count:**

- Glucocorticoids are usually prescribed as **one**of the following regimes:
- Prednisone 1 mg/kg/d for 7 to 14 days, followed by a gradual taper.
- Dexamethasone 40 mg IV or orally once daily for 4 days

Anti-D, an immune globulin against the D antigen of the Rh blood group system, is sometimes used as an alternative in patients with RhD-positive blood group. However, it comes with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) **boxed warning**for hemolytic transfusion reactions; hence, many clinicians are hesitant to use it.

**Second-line Therapies**

The American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines recommend that children with non-life-threatening mucosal bleeding and/or decreased health-related quality of life who do not respond to first-line therapies or who have chronic ITP should be trialed on a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (i.e., eltrombopag or romiplostim) first. If the child fails to respond to a thrombopoietin receptor agonist after a period of time, then rituximab should be used as the next therapy of choice. Splenectomy is usually reserved for those children with severe thrombocytopenia and severe hemorrhagic symptoms, which require multiple pharmacological interventions and should be delayed as long as possible due to the high potential for spontaneous remission and risk for asplenic sepsis. The current recommendation for splenectomy in children is waiting at least 12 months from initial diagnosis and waiting until the child is older than five years of age.

The American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines recommend adults with ITP who are dependent on corticosteroids or unresponsive to corticosteroids for three months or more or are considered chronic ITP; second-line therapies are recommended. These include thrombopoietin receptor agonists (i.e., eltrombopag or romiplostim, or avatrombopag), rituximab, and splenectomy. The choice of a second-line agent is more individualized based on the duration of ITP, the number of hospitalizations, comorbidities, and the desires of the patient. If a patient desires a long-term response and prefers to avoid surgery, then thrombopoietin receptor agonists are the therapy of choice. If a patient does not desire to take a medication for an extended period of time and also avoid surgery, then rituximab is the therapy of choice.

**Administration of Second-line Therapies**

- Rituximab:

- The usual dose is 375 mg/m IV once a week for four consecutive weeks.
- Use in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patients is avoided.
- Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has also been reported following rituximab for ITP.
- The initial response is 7 to 56 days.
- Immunizations are given before administering rituximab as it may interfere with their response.

- Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs):

- Started at an initial low dose and titrated up as needed.
- Romiplostim

- The dose ranges from 1 to 10 mcg/kg.
- Typically started at  2 to 3 mcg/kg.
- The initial response is 7 to 14 days.


- Eltrombopag

- The initial dose is 50 mg daily.
- 25 mg once daily in individuals of East-Asian ancestry or those with moderate or severe liver insufficiency
- The initial response is 7 to 14 days.
- Reduced absorption with calcium-rich food
- Supplements containing polyvalent cations such as iron, calcium, aluminum, magnesium, zinc, or selenium should be given at least four hours before or two hours after eltrombopag.


- Avatrombopag

- The initial dose is 20 mg once daily and is adjusted to keep platelets >50,000/microL.
- The initial response is 3 to 5 days.
- Less hepatotoxic
- No interaction with dairy products

Splenectomy should be considered for those patients desiring a long-term response but should be delayed until after the first year of diagnosis due to the potential for remission within the first year.

In 2018, the FDA approved fostamatinib, a spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor, as an option for patients whose disease is refractory to second-line treatments.

Platelets should be monitored one week after the change in dose/drug and every month once the therapy is stable. Moreover, platelets should be checked whenever there is a mucosal bleed or petechiae.
