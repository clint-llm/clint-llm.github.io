# Introduction

The pancreas is an abdominal organ possessing both endocrine and exocrine functions. It produces a variety of hormones that mostly pertain to regulating blood sugar levels. As an exocrine gland, it secretes pancreatic fluid that contains bicarbonate and digestive enzymes. Commonly, a few broad categories of diseases affect the pancreas that can be characterized on imaging: pancreatitis, pancreatic insufficiency, cystic lesions of the pancreas, and pancreatic tumors.

Pancreatitis is a generalized inflammation of the pancreas due to the activation of digestive enzymes produced by the pancreas while still inside the organ. Acutely, this can result from gallstones, alcohol misuse, or hypertriglyceridemia.

Pancreatic insufficiency results when the pancreas is unable to produce enough digestive enzymes to break down food in the digestive tract.

Pancreatic exocrine cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the United States.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are malignancies that form in the endocrine tissue of the pancreas. Also known as islet cell tumors, these are rare tumors occurring in approximately 1 in every 100,000 people, and only 1% of all pancreatic tumors are NETs.

Cystic lesions of the pancreas are a relatively common incidental finding on body imaging, with prevalence in the general population ranging up to 14%.

# Anatomy

The anatomy of the pancreas and nearby structures are of particular importance for understanding gallstone pancreatitis and surgical contraindications to pancreatic cancer.

The common bile duct enters the pancreas and merges with the main pancreatic duct, just prior to the ampulla of Vater, where they both empty into the second part of the duodenum through the major duodenal papilla.

The anatomy of both the pancreas and surrounding structures is critical for understanding the surgical indications and contraindications for pancreatic cancer. The head of the pancreas resides in the “C-loop” of the duodenum, with the uncinate process curling back and behind the superior mesenteric artery and vein.

# Plain Films

The use of plain radiographs is extremely limited in the evaluation of the pancreas. Although not diagnostic, calcifications of the pancreas may be visible on abdominal radiographs in the setting of chronic pancreatitis.

**Computed Tomography (CT) vs. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) vs. Ultrasound**

A few general principles common to imaging in various body parts are essential when deciding which of these three cross-sectional modalities to use and the relative strengths and weaknesses of each. In general, CT and MRI have large fields-of-view and are both very effective in identifying local abnormalities along with regional or more distant involvement.

CT and MR are better than ultrasound for characterizing solid lesions due to the advantage of administering intravenous contrast material and differences in signal intensity seen on MRI. On the other hand, cystic lesions can be detected with all three modalities but are better characterized by ultrasound and even better by MRI.

# Computed Tomography

Computed tomography (CT) is the backbone of pancreatic imaging.  Intravenous contrast is nearly always indicated, with multi-phase enhanced imaging being optimal for identifying and characterizing pancreatic masses or complications from pancreatitis.  Multi-phase pancreas protocols will usually include an unenhanced sequence, a ‘pancreas phase’ or late-arterial phase, as well as portal venous phase sequences.

In acute pancreatitis, intravenous contrast-enhanced CT will show focal or diffuse enlargement of the pancreatic parenchyma due to interstitial edema, with heterogeneous enhancement.

Regarding chronic pancreatitis, findings may include a dilated main pancreatic duct, atrophy of the pancreatic parenchyma, and pancreatic calcifications. While pancreatic atrophy occurs in approximately 54% of patients with chronic pancreatitis, this is not a specific finding and can also occur with normal aging.

Nearly nine out of ten cystic fibrosis patients experience pancreatic exocrine gland insufficiency due to ductal obstruction and subsequent fibrosis and fatty replacement. This blockage can cause acute pancreatitis when there is still residual pancreatic exocrine function. CT imaging can reveal fatty replacement of the pancreas, which appears as areas of fat (low) attenuation. Eventually, the continuing fatty replacement can lead to complete pancreatic lipomatosis, typically before the patient reaches 20 years of age.

When evaluating pancreatic exocrine tumors, the ‘pancreas phase’ sequence best accentuates the attenuation difference between the malignancy and the healthy pancreatic tissue due to the tumor’s hypovascularity.

Multiphase, contrast-enhanced CT is also the ideal imaging technique for evaluating pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. NETs are highly vascular tumors that will enhance during the arterial or pancreatic phase. Washout should be noted during the portal venous phase sequencing.

# Magnetic Resonance

Although CT is the initial modality for diagnosing pancreatic abnormalities, MRI is beneficial for characterizing cystic lesions and characterizing and even identifying some solid tumors, particularly smaller ones.

Pancreatitis evaluation in the acute setting is nearly always with CT; however, MRI is comparable to CT and can be useful in some complicated cases or patients who cannot receive iodinated contrast. Fat-suppressed T2-weighted sequences demonstrate greater differentiation between pancreatic and peripancreatic tissues while making any peripancreatic inflammation much more conspicuous.

MRCP is increasingly in use to diagnose chronic pancreatitis due to its ability to visualize pancreatic duct obstruction and dilation; however,  the typical calcifications in chronic pancreatitis are not visualized as effectively as on CT.

MR can help differentiate pancreatic lipomatosis from fibrotic changes in cystic fibrosis patients.  Fibrotic replacement of the pancreas will appear as hypointense areas on T1- and T2-weighted imaging, while fatty changes will reveal the opposite: hyperintensity on both T1- and T2-weighted sequences.

Pancreatic adenocarcinomas appear hypointense on T1-weighted images vis-a-vis the normally bright appearance of the healthy pancreas. There is less utility of T2-weighted images as the signal is similar to the normal pancreas. Diffusion-weighted images can show restricted diffusion of adenocarcinomas, but restricted diffusion is not specific to carcinomas as it can also present in pancreatitis.

Pancreatic NETs appear on MRI as hypointense on T1- and hyperintense on T2-weighted images with hyperenhancement after gadolinium administration on arterial or pancreatic phase timing due to their hypervascular nature. Large islet cell tumors may have areas of cystic or necrotic nonenhancement.

Lastly, in cases of biliary ductal dilation, MRCP can help differentiate an obstructing gallstone (no enhancement and dark on T2) or intraluminal mass (enhancing mass without dark T2-weighted signal).

# Ultrasonography

Transabdominal ultrasound’s main role in acute pancreatitis is to identify gallstones and/or choledocholithiasis. Otherwise, ultrasound has limited use in significant measure due to difficult visualization of the pancreas, often due to overlying bowel gas.

On the other hand, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) may be useful in the setting of chronic pancreatitis evaluation.

Pancreatic lipomatosis, in the setting of cystic fibrosis, classically shows increased pancreatic echogenicity on ultrasonography.  The characteristic lobular architecture of the pancreas may also appear diminished.

Transabdominal ultrasound is not an uncommon initial imaging modality for a patient with jaundice, epigastric pain, and/or weight loss, as ultrasound is highly sensitive for detecting obstruction of the biliary tract and resultant dilation. If these symptoms are due to a pancreatic carcinoma, the mass usually appears as an ill-defined and hypoechoic, hypovascular structure with or without ductal dilation.

Ultrasound’s place in the evaluation of pancreatic NETs is uncertain.  However, these well-circumscribed, hypoechoic, and hypervascular lesions can sometimes be seen on ultrasound, even if their morphology is nonspecific. EUS can be helpful in the setting of both exocrine and endocrine tumors, as biopsy via FNA can be performed during the ultrasound.

# Nuclear Medicine

In patients with NETs, nuclear medicine studies may be necessary for further staging and characterization of the lesion.

# Clinical Significance

The differential of pancreatic disease processes is challenging, but it can demonstrate significant morbidity and mortality in the population. Understanding the various imaging modalities available and when each is appropriate is of critical importance. CT and MR provide an excellent spatial resolution of the pancreatic anatomy and are the modalities of choice when considering the pancreas. EUS-FNA is highly specific and valuable in diagnosing pancreatic cystic lesions.
