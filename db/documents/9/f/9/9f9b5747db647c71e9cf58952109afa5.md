Failure to thrive (FTT) is a common term used to describe lack of adequate weight gain in pediatric patients. Accepted definitions include a weight for age less than the fifth percentile on standardized growth charts, a decrease in weight percentile of more than two major percentile lines on the growth chart, or less than the 80 percentile of median weight for height ratio weight/length ratio. Failure to thrive is important to recognize and treat because it can result in developmental delays and other long-term effects for the developing child. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of FTT and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this disorder.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of failure to thrive.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with failure to thrive.
- Review the management options available for failure to thrive.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of failure to thrive and improve patient outcomes.
