**Normal Coronary Anatomy**

The coronary arteries arise from the aortic sinuses as two main branches, the right coronary artery, and the left main coronary artery. The right coronary artery (RCA) arises from the right sinus of Valsalva (RSV), whereas the left main coronary artery (LM) arises from the left sinus of Valsalva (LSV) (image 1). The LM passes between the main pulmonary artery and the left auricle and further divides into the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX). The LAD courses down towards the apex of the heart via the anterior interventricular sulcus. It will further give rise to the diagonal and septal branches and supply the anterior wall and the anterior half of the interventricular septum. The LCX courses through the coronary sulcus and onto the diaphragmatic cardiac surface give rise to one or more obtuse marginal branches and supply the lateral wall.

After its origin, the RCA courses through the right atrioventricular sulcus to the acute margin of the heart and then continues posteriorly into the diaphragmatic surface and base of the heart. The RCA gives rise to the atrial branch, SA nodal, and AV nodal branches and supplies the right atrium, right ventricle, sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes, the interatrial septum, portion of the left atrium, posterior one-third of the interventricular septum, and a portion of the posterior part of the left ventricle.

Many variations exist in the coronary anatomy and are considered normal. One such example is that of coronary dominance. The artery that supplies the posterior descending artery (PDA) and the posterolateral branch determines coronary dominance. In most individuals (70% of cases), the PDA arises from the RCA, which makes it a right dominant system. If the supply is from the LCX, then it is considered a left dominant system (10% of cases). Co-dominance is also possible in about 20% of cases. The dominant artery usually also supplies the AV nodal branches. Variations can exist within that as well.

There exist a number of variations in regards to the blood supply of the inferior wall. The supply can be from PDA, distal RCA, LCX, obtuse marginal branches of the LAD, or “wraparound LAD.”

Another variance is not in the origin of the coronary arteries but in their course. Coronary arteries typically are surrounded by epicardial fat. In some cases, coronaries can dip into the myocardium for a variable length. This phenomenon is known as myocardial bridging and can be found in up to 25% of patients. The clinical significance of this is controversial and is thought to be dependent on the length and depth of the myocardial bridge. Systolic contraction of the myocardium can result in compression of the coronary artery and may cause myocardial ischemia and angina.

In about 2% of the population, the angle between the LM and the LCX can be less than 45 degrees. This phenomenon is known as the acute take-off of LCX. This can cause technical difficulties during invasive coronary angiographic procedures.

High take-off of the coronary ostium can also exist and is considered a normal variant. This is defined as the position of the coronary ostium 5 mm above the aortic sinotubular junction. The RCA is most frequently implicated and is present at increased frequency in those with a bicuspid aortic valve. The higher the position, the higher the risk of coronary hypoperfusion as the coronary sinuses facilitate optimal diastolic coronary perfusion.

**Coronary Artery Anomalies**

Many different classifications have been proposed, but no single universal one exists. We will describe anomalies associated with each artery in turn rather than use these classifications for practical reasons.

**Left Circumflex Anomalies**

LCX can originate from the left or right sinus of Valsalva, or the RCA. These anomalies are relatively common and usually benign.

**Right Coronary Artery Anomalies**

RCA can have its origin from the left sinus of Valsalva with an incidence of about 0.1%. When this happens, the RCA will course between the aorta and the pulmonary artery, and due to this, it is implicated in sudden cardiac death. Some recent studies have reported a prevalence of about 30% in young individuals who have suffered sudden cardiac death.

**Left Main Coronary Artery Anomalies**

The left main can be absent, leading to split origin or separate ostia of the LAD and the LCX, and usually, this is of no clinical significance. LM can have an anomalous origin from the right sinus of Valsalva, which is quite rare, with a reported incidence of 0.03-0.15%.

**Left Anterior Descending Artery Anomalies**

The origin of the LAD can be from the RCA, the right sinus of Valsalva, the latter with a reported incidence of about 0.03%.

Anomalies of the LM coronary artery have been most implicated in sudden cardiac death, and many mechanisms for this have been presented. Normally LM originates from the LSV at an angle perpendicular to the aorta. If the anomalous LM arises from the opposite coronary sinus, then it comes off at an acute angle and has sharp bends. During exertion, the aortic root expands and further exaggerates the angle leading to compression and subsequent ischemia.

If the anomalous artery is between two major vessels such as RCA originating from the LSV, then overexpansion of the aorta and pulmonary artery from hypertension can cause extrinsic compression and ischemia. Angelini et al. have demonstrated with intravascular ultrasound the compression of the anomalous artery when it courses between the great vessels.
