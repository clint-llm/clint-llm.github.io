The withdrawal reflex is mediated by the PNS and CNS, the epidermis, and the musculoskeletal system. The epidermis is central to the reflex initiation because, when damaged, it releases chemicals to induce the activation of the sensory neurons that further the completion of the reflex. The PNS includes the sensory neurons stimulated by noxious input and the somatic motor neurons that target muscles. The CNS is involved because the sensory neuron communicates through the spinal cord to relay the withdrawal reflex. Lastly, the extensor and flexor muscles of the body accomplish the actual movement of the limb away from the stimulus. For example, suppose the reflex was to occur in the upper limb. In this case, the flexor muscles involved include the biceps brachii and coracobrachialis, with the primary extensor of the arm at the elbow joint being the triceps brachii. In the lower limb, there are flexors at the knee, which include the biceps femoris, semimembranosus, and semitendinosus muscles. Extensors of the knee include the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medius, and vastus intermedius, collectively known as the quadriceps muscle group.
