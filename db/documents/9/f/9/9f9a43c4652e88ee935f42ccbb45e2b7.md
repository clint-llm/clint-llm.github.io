**Symptoms and Signs**

- Contralateral hemiplegia of the extremities (sparing the face) due to pyramidal tract involvement.

- Ipsilateral lateral rectus palsy leading to diplopia that is accentuated when the patient looks towards the side of the lesion, internal strabismus (i.e., Esotropia) and loss of power to rotate the affected eye outward due to theÂ involvement of CN VI.

- Ipsilateral peripheral facial nerve paresis leads to flaccid paralysis of the muscles of the facial expression and loss of the corneal reflex due to cranial nerve VII involvement.
