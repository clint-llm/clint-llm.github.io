The earliest precursors of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, including ethyl-2 cyanoacrylate, had similar bonding capabilities but rapidly broke down into cyanoacetate and formaldehyde, leading to local inflammatory reactions. 2-octyl cyanoacrylate has overcome this issue by utilizing longer chain products leading to a slower release that can undergo safer, natural excretion. Those who have a hypersensitivity to cyanoacrylate or formaldehyde can develop contact dermatitis if 2-octyl cyanoacrylate is applied.
