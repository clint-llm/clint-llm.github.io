Parents and patients should be informed adequately about all the signs and symptoms of cancer. They must be counseled to seek care whenever they have any unusual signs or symptoms that may be related to a cancer. Patients should be trained to perform a breast self-examination regularly every month, starting at age 18 years. Psychological monitoring is very important as these patients can develop anxiety or depression.
