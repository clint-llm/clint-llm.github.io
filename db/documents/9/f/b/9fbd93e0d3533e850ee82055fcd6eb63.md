Vitreoretinal changes noted in IP are classified into five stages:

**Stage 1**- Retinal pigment epithelial changes only,

**Stage 2**- Retinal vascular abnormalities (except neovascularization),

**Stage 3**- Retinopathy with neovascularization or other pathologies secondary to retinal vasculopathy, such as retinal exudation, epiretinal membrane/proliferation, or vitreous hemorrhage,

**Stage 4**- Retinal detachment without end-stage changes

- 4a: partial retinal detachment;

- 4b: total retinal detachment, and

**Stage 5**- End stage: severe ocular complications such as phthisis bulbi and secondary glaucoma.
