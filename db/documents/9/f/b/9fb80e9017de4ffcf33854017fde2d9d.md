The key to maximizing outcomes and patient satisfaction is beginning with a thorough history and physical examination of the patient and a discussion of the patient's expectations. Reviewing the anticipated outcome, recovery period, and potential risks are essential before planning ablative laser therapy.

The success of the procedure depends on efficient cooperation among the interprofessional team members, including a physician, a physician assistant, and/or a nurse or technician. A team consisting of personnel who are comfortable and well-trained to provide quality peri-procedural monitoring and care is the cornerstone of effective ablative laser treatment.

Post-procedural care and close follow-up are required to evaluate the patient for possible complications such as infection or dyspigmentation. Patient education regarding proper care for the procedural site during convalescence is essential to minimize adverse outcomes and maximize patient satisfaction. [Level 5]
