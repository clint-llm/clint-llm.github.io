Meeting with the patient or their family should be planned in advance and ideally coordinated with many of the personnel listed above.

The medical discussion about potential termination of life support should be led with empathetic open support for the family, with importance on knowing the patient preferences (from the patient directly or via the legal surrogate if needed). Family and the patient's perception of the clinical condition, the management plan, the expected clinical course, and the outcome should be explained in detail without the use of medical jargon. The level of care provided needs to be explained, and it may need to be adjusted to the patient's preferences. It would help confirm the comprehension of medical information conveyed by having the legal surrogate summarize the main points at the end of the conversation. The family members should be informed about what the dying patient may look, sound, and smell like after the initiation of comfort care. The palliative care team can be constructive in guiding this conversation.

If the patient is expected to survive for more than a few days, then a multi-disciplinary plan (with a social worker, primary care physician, the hospice care team, etc.) is needed. The children must be informed about their family member's impending death sensitively with the help of the child-care experts. Religious and spiritual support is provided by religious leaders or priests, who are encouraged to pray with the patient and family members.

Discussions about the possibility of organ donation, if appropriate, and/or autopsy, if indicated, should be done at this time. It is important for the clinical team NOT to have a detailed discussion about organ donation. This must be done by the organ transplant team to avoid any conflict of interest. A social worker can help the family plan for the funeral and financial arrangements post-death.

After the basic plan has been discussed, it is important to establish the 'Code status,' including the patient's choice about resuscitation and intubation, with a plan for ‘no escalation of care’ if the clinical condition deteriorates. During the discussion related to the 'termination of life support,' it is important to inform the family about what the process involves, including a plan to discontinue regular diagnostic interventions, commencing medications for pain and symptom control, and the removal of invasive lines and tubes (like the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, arterial line, etc.). Typically, one intravenous line and the bladder draining catheter are maintained to provide pain and other symptom control medications (including anti-epileptic drugs if the patient already needed them). It is helpful to inform the family of what would be expected after the life support is withdrawn, including the plan for transfer to in-patient hospice care or home hospice if the patient survives beyond a certain time. Emphasizing the transition to the 'initiation of comfort care' rather than 'withdrawal or termination of life support' during the discussion is better, in the author's opinion.

During the conversation, it helps establish a rough timeline about the palliative extubation and termination of care, with reasonable accommodation of the family requests, pending arrival of close family members from geographically distant locations. Relaxing the institutional visitor policy may be needed while taking care not to compromise the privacy of the patient or family as well as the privacy of the neighboring patients and their families. Accommodating requests for religious prayers and the use of non-pharmacologic stress-relieving measures like music and aromatherapy can make a positive impact on the grieving family members.
