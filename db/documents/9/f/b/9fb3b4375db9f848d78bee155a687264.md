Ventilator bundles play a vital role in preventing ventilator-associated events. Some of these measures include minimizing sedation, daily spontaneous breathing trials, early mobilization, conservative fluid and transfusion strategies, and lung protective strategies.

**Sedation:**Before initiating mechanical ventilation, one should also consider what medications to provide for post-intubation pain control and sedation. An "analgesia first" sedation strategy is recommended, with the most commonly used agent being fentanyl due to its forgiving, i.e., minimally hypotension-inducing hemodynamic properties.

**Head of the bed elevation:**All patients on mechanical ventilation should have the head of the bed elevated to at least 30 degrees. According to a 2016 Cochrane review on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), "a semi-recumbent (30º to 60º) position reduced clinically suspected VAP by 25.7% when compared to a 0° to 10° supine position" however, they acknowledge that the data is severely limited.

**Airway maintenance:**If the patient suddenly desaturates, then the DOPES mnemonic should be followed to determine the causes of the problem. DOPES stands for displacement, obstruction of the ETT or airways, pneumothorax/pulmonary embolism/pulmonary edema, equipment failure, and stacked breaths. The patient should immediately be disconnected from the ventilator and switched to a bag valve mask. The person bagging should ventilate calmly and allow for a full exhalation. Following this, a systematic approach should be followed. Does the patient still have a good waveform on their ETCO2? If not, then the ET tube may have become dislodged. Does the patient bag easily or with difficulty? If bagging is difficult, this will inform you of some obstructive problems, such as an obstructed ET tube, pneumothorax, or bronchospasm. If the patient bags easily and SpO2 rises rapidly, it points to equipment failure. While this is under evaluation, another provider should assess the patient with an ultrasound of the lungs and heart, and a chest X-ray should be obtained ASAP. Pulmonary embolism should be a consideration if no other cause of the desaturation is found.

**Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis:**Invasive mechanical ventilation is an independent risk factor for increased odds of venous thromboembolism in the intensive care unit.

**Gastrointestinal prophylaxis**: Gastrointestinal bleeding occurs in approximately 5 % of critically ill patients not receiving prophylaxis.
