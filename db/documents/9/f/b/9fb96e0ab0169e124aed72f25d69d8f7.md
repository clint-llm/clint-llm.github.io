Results of testing procedures done for biosafety checks must be recorded, consolidated, and interpreted regularly (i.e., daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or as applicable). The results may show a trend that may signal a need either for equipment maintenance or replacement. Frequent incidents associated with a particular process may demonstrate a need to perform reviews and modify the procedure. Involved staff should willingly report accidents inside the laboratory. Laboratorians should not be reluctant to report such events as these may become a future source of infection.
