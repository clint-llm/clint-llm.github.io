From minor tongue lacerations to tongue amputation, the repair of a tongue injury requires a range of abilities and specialties to achieve a good result. More complex lacerations will need the primary physician, emergency department physician, and nurse practitioner to adequately communicate the nature of the wound to advanced care specialists such as otolaryngologist and oral maxillofacial surgeons. Lacerations in children might require the teamwork of physician, nursing and respiratory therapist to sedate and repair the wound. The pharmacy may have involvement depending on the decision to use antibiotics prophylactically. The lack of large trial or comparison studies on the repair of tongue lacerations means that communication between providers on past experiences will be an integral part of each new patient's plan of care as part of an interprofessional team approach.
