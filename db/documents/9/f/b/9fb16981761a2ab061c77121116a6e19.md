Like the other portions of the dural venous sinus system, the composition of the walls of the superior petrosal sinus is dura mater lined with epithelium. These walls lack valves and vessel layers. The course of the superior petrosal sinus is as follows: the sinus originates in the cavernous sinus, leaves the posterosuperior aspect of the cavernous sinus, then runs caudally between CN III and IV. The sinus then joins with the transverse sinus. The skull contains the superior petrosal sulcus—a groove in the temporal bone—through which the superior petrosal sinus runs. The tentorium cerebelli is attached to the edges of the superior petrosal sinus.

The function of the superior petrosal sinus is to pass blood from the cerebral veins and cerebrospinal fluid from the subarachnoid granulations into the transverse sinus. After traveling through the rest of the dural venous sinus system, this venous fluid will drain via the internal jugular vein. The fluid then empties into the superior vena cava and the systemic circulation.
