Inability to correctly diagnose a cloaca in the newborn period may fail to identify obstructing uropathy caused by a hydrocolpos which may cause sepsis, acidosis, and in severe cases renal failure. With misdiagnosis of the cloaca in the newborn period, the surgeon may only repair the rectal component of the malformation and leave a persistent urogenital sinus. The most concerning postoperative complication is the development of a urethrovaginal fistula which requires surgical repair if proximal to the urinary sphincter.
