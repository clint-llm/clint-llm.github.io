Perimetry is a widely used diagnostic tool that helps assess glaucoma, optic neuropathies, posterior segment disorders, and conditions affecting the visual pathway. It also helps in monitoring the progression of diseases and guiding the treatment. It helps in the measurement of the extent of the visual field loss. This activity outlines the role of perimetry in the diagnosis and follow-up of various conditions affecting the optic nerve, retina, and visual pathway, and it highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating the perimetry reports and thus improving the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Review the technique and various strategies available for performing the perimetry test.
- Identify the indications for performing a perimetry test.
- Describe the technique of reading and interpreting a perimetry report.
- Explain the typical perimetry patterns associated with various conditions and the role of interprofessional collaboration in improving the management and outcomes of patients undergoing perimetry.
