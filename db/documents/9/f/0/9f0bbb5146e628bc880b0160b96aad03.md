Bouveret syndrome is the most infrequent variant of gallstone ileus. It results from a gallstone migrating through a bilioenteric fistula and causing obstruction at the gastric outlet and occasionally in also other portions of the intestine. The entry point is typically a fistula between the gallbladder and a portion of the stomach or intestine.

The well-studied risk factors for Bouveret syndrome include a history of cholelithiasis, stones greater than 2 cm to 8 cm, female gender, andÂ age older than 60 years. It has been reported that approximately 43% to 68% of patients have a history of recurrent biliary colic, jaundice, or acute cholecystitis.
