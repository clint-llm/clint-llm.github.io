Hypertriglyceridemia is diagnosed by a fasting lipid panel. According to National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) guidelines, HTG is classified into mild: TG level 150-199 mg/dL, high: TG 200-499 mg/dL and very high: TG > 500 mg/dL.

The measurement of LDL size or density is not useful in the management of cardiovascular events. Apo B and Lp(a) may be useful in assessing cardiovascular risk in hypertriglyceridemia.

Hepatic steatosis or non-alcoholic steato-hepatosis (NASH) is associated with hypertriglyceridemia secondary to insulin resistance. It is usually suspected with elevated aminotransferases on the hepatic function panel. Further testing with an ultrasound of the liver is recommended.
