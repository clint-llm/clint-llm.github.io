Littoral cell angioma (LCA) is a rare primary splenic hemangioma, which can appear in the red sinus shore cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) in the spleen. Falk et al. were the first to describe and name LCA in 1991. Most of the reported cases are that of benign tumors and can present as a single lesion as well as multiple recurrent lesions.
