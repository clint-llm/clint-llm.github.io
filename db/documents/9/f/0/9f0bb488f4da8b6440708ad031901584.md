The recommended starting dosage is usually 5mcg/kg or 10mcg/kg, depending on the indication, as noted earlier. There has been very limited data regarding the maximum tolerable dosage of filgrastim. Although rare, doses of up to and even greater than 100 mcg/kg have been used in individuals with minimal toxic effects.

Some studies noted a plateau in dose-response curves when the dosage exceeded 10 mcg/kg in bone marrow transplant patients.

Baseline CBC and platelet counts should be obtained prior to administration and following filgrastim administration.

The following are the required monitoring parameters:

- Twice weekly in cancer patients on myelosuppressive therapy or AML patients receiving induction/consolidation therapy.

- Frequently in bone marrow transplant patients.

- After four days of filgrastim initiation in patients undergoing PBPC collection and discontinued if neutrophil count >100,000/mm^3.

- During the initial four weeks of filgrastim therapy and the two weeks following any adjustment in the dose in patients with severe chronic neutropenia

- When a patient is clinically stable, counts should be monitored monthly in the first year and less frequently thereafter.

- Every three days until ANC>1000/mm^3 for three consecutive CBCs in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive radiation doses.

It is advised not to use filgrastim with concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to a lack of safety and efficacy studies.
