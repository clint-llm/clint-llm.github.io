Paraphimosis is a true urologic emergency that occurs in uncircumcised males when the foreskin becomes trapped behind the corona of the glans penis, leading to strangulation of the glans as well as painful vascular compromise, distal venous engorgement, edema, and even necrosis. By comparison, phimosis is the condition when the foreskin is unable to be retracted behind the glans of the penis.
