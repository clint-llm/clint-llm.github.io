# Continuing Education Activity

Presbyopia is a condition which every individual is bound to face around their forties. This activity talks about the pathophysiology, evaluation, and various management options in a comprehensive and concise way. This also explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pathophysiology of presbyopia.
- Review the step for the evaluation of presbyopia
- Outline the management options available for presbyopia
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to manage presbyopia and improve outcomes.

# Introduction

Among the various causes of visual impairment for near, presbyopia is an important and the most common cause in older adults.

# Etiology

A progressive decrease in the accommodative capacity of the lens is the major cause of presbyopia. Various theories depicting the mechanism involved in presbyopia have been proposed. Helmholtz's theory, Schachar's Theory, and the Catenary theory of Coleman are the most discussed ones.

Helmholtz theory: As per this theory, the ciliary muscle contraction results in the relaxation of zonules and an increase in the convexity of the anterior lens capsule.

Schachar Theory: This theory, in contrast to Helmholtz's theory, says that the ciliary muscle contraction results in increased tension of equatorial zonular fibers with simultaneous relaxation of anterior and posterior zonular fibers. This concept results in the steepening of the anterior central part of the lens with flattening of the lens periphery.

Catenary theory of Coleman: As per this theory, with ciliary muscle contraction, there develops a pressure gradient from vitreous compartment to aqueous compartment, resulting in the steepening of the anterior lens capsule in the center.

Other theories include Tscherning's theory and Baikoff's theory.

To summarize, all these theories depict anterior central lens capsule steepening during accommodation.

# Epidemiology

Its onset is usually around 40 years of age; this is the most economically active group. In the developing nations, the majority of presbyopes do not get presbyopic corrections, because of lack of awareness and also poor affordability.

# Pathophysiology

There are various explanations about the pathophysiology of presbyopia. Among all the concepts, increased stiffness of the crystalline lens is the most popular and widely accepted. Presbyopia is a physiological condition wherein there is a progressive functional decline in the accommodative capacity of the crystalline lens. Clinically, it manifests as progressive difficulty in reading at the usual reading distance. In an in-vitro study by Glasser and Campbell, they noticed no change in focal length, with simulated zonular tension and relaxation.

Normally, the nucleus is stiffer than the cortex in the older lens, whereas, among young individuals, the cortex is stiffer than the nucleus.

# History and Physical

Patients around 40 years of age present with complaints of difficulty in reading finer prints at usual reading distance. Typically, patients report improvement in near visual acuity if the reading distance is increased slightly beyond the usual reading distance. At the outset of symptoms, patients often complain of headaches. Asthenopic symptoms appear relatively earlier in patients with longer screen time exposure due to latent accommodative dysfunction.

Other symptoms include delayed focussing of near and distance, squinting, drowsiness during near work, and need for bright light for reading.

# Evaluation

In presbyopia, we note that the near point of accommodation (NPA) recedes beyond the usual reading distance. Using the Royal Air Force (RAF) rule, the NPA is calculated and hence the amplitude of accommodation. The amplitude of accommodation decreases with an increase in age.

Evaluation is subjective. Patients are asked to keep the near reading target at the usual reading distance, and lenses are added. The minimum value of the plus lens, which makes vision clear enough to read the last line of the reading chart at the usual reading distance, is considered to be the dioptric power that has to be prescribed.

# Treatment / Management

**Non-surgical Option**

1. Spectacles: Single vision lenses are a relatively cheaper option. Patients can comfortably read near; however, one needs separate distant glasses if one has a refractive error for distance also. Bifocal lenses are of great help, especially if the person has both refractive errors for distance and presbyopia. However, bifocals are more expensive than single vision lenses.

The bifocal lenses can be classified based on their make as:

- Fused bifocal: A depression curve in the crown glass is fitted with a flint button.

- Solid bifocal: made from a single material

- Cemented bifocal: a segment is glued onto a single vision lens.

- Split bifocal: two separate lenses are held together with a frame.

Based on the design, it can be classified as:

- D-seg or straight top bifocal lens

- Round segmented bifocal lens

- Executive bifocal lens

- Kryptok lens- here, the segment for near vision correction is round.

The advantage of the Kryptok lens is that the transition is not visible from outside in contrast to D-seg, where the segmentation is very well demarcated. So. it is cosmetically better; however, image jump can occur with all these designs.

Progressive lenses have a gradient of power for near add in the central zone. The peripheral part of the lens may cause distortion.

2. Contact lenses: Contact lenses can help deal with presbyopia in 2 ways. Monofocal contact lenses can correct one eye for distance and the other for near. Always, the dominant eye is corrected for distance. This concept is called 'monovision.' The advantage with monovision is that the clarity of vision is good over a range of distance; however, the contrast sensitivity and stereopsis are reduced.

**Surgical Options**

1. Corneal procedures: Monovision with laser refractive correction is well known.

Conductive keratoplasty is another procedure where corneal collagen shrinkage at the mid-peripheral cornea results in increased refractive power of the cornea and thus correcting for presbyopia.

Intracorneal inlays made of polyvinylidene fluoride are available for the correction of presbyopia. The inlay is placed intrastromal after lifting a corneal flap. The central aperture measures around 1.6mm. This pin-hole effect results in increased depth of focus and hence used for presbyopia correction.

2. Scleral procedures: There are various scleral expansion procedures with PMMA annulus into the sclera overlying the ciliary muscles, which promise to correct the presbyopia. The scleral implants are proposed to act by causing scleral expansion over the ciliary muscles, thus restoring the ciliary muscle contraction and accommodation. Radial scleral cuts (posterior) over sclera are also said to serve the purpose, by the same mechanism. However, the data is not sufficient and convincing.

3. Monovision with intraocular implant: These options are beneficial when the patient has presbyopia and a higher degree of ametropia.

4. Phakic intraocular lenses include anterior chamber lenses (angle supported and iris-claw) and posterior chamber lenses. These days anterior chamber angle supported multifocal lenses are available, which not only corrects for near but also corrects ametropia for distance.

5. Clear lens extraction followed by IOL implantation for correction of presbyopia and ametropia has popularized. Planned myopic astigmatism after cataract surgery gives some pseudo-accommodation.

Asymmetric IOL designs are available that claim to have the same contrast sensitivity as mono-focal lenses.

# Differential Diagnosis

Diseases affecting near vision are:

- Macular/retinal diseases- In macular diseases, vision does not improve by refractive corrections, and optical coherence tomography of the retina may reveal the abnormalities.

- Diseases of the optic nerve

- Posterior subcapsular cataract - Unlike presbyopia, the near vision further deteriorates in bright light.

- Hypermetropia

- Astigmatism

# Prognosis

Presbyopia is inevitable and usually starts around 40 years of age. Patients do better with glasses and contact lenses. Surgical options with relatively good acceptance have also been discussed.

# Complications

Uncorrected presbyopia results not only results in difficulty reading near but also causes drowsiness and headache.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients with difficulty near reading should start using presbyopic correction at the earliest to avoid asthenopic symptoms. However, patients should not insist on higher-end corrections, as this helps them use some of their accommodating capacity for quite some time.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

An ophthalmologist and an optometrist work hand in hand. Both of them together give better treatment to the patient. This increases not only the efficiency of each one of them but also better outcome improves patients' satisfaction.
