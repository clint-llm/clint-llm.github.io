Allgrove syndrome is a rare and underdiagnosed condition. Prompt diagnosis and treatment should start promptly in cases of suspected disease. An interprofessional team approach will improve patient outcomes. The team should include a neurologist, an ophthalmologist, a pediatrician, a gastroenterologist, and an endocrinologist. Parental and patient education should take place at every visit detailing the disease course, risk factors, and treatment. Lacrimal gland biopsy may be an option for making a definitive diagnosis of dry eyes secondary to alacrima. Frequent weight, dosing of steroids, and linear growth monitoring are regularly necessary.
