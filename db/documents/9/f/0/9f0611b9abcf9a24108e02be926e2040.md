Typically, synovial sarcoma arises from deep soft tissues of the extremities. SS arises less commonly from the trunk, thorax, and neck regions. Rarely SS has also been reported to arise from pleuropulmonary, cardiac, GI tract, and other body organs.

It is often not possible to establish a diagnosis of SS clinically. However, the index of suspicion for SS should be high if a previously young, healthy patient in the adolescent/young adult age group presents with a hard mass in the extremity or elsewhere in the body.
