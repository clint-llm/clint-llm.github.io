The most commonly reported side effects of THC that require its discontinuation are dysphoria, hallucinations, and paranoia. Other common side effects include sedation, confusion, headache, dry mouth, dysphoria, euphoria, and hypotension. Seizures and seizure-like activity have been known to occur in patients using THC.****

There has been an increasing number of case reports of cannabinoid-induced hyperemesis syndrome as the use of cannabis has become more widespread. Such a syndrome is characterized by intractable vomiting from chronic THC use. A characteristic feature of this syndrome is relief with hot showers.

Another side effect or complication from chronic cannabis use is an amotivational syndrome, which clinically resembles depression with a lack of motivation.

Multiple studies have linked marijuana use to increased risk for psychiatric conditions, including psychosis, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders.
