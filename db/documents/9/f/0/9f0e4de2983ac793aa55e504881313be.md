The classic description of gestational trophoblastic tissue is a "bunch of grapes." Microscopically, diffuse villous enlargement with hydropic changes can be observed. There is almost always some degree of cytologic atypia with many cells being mitotically active. Central cisterns, as well as trophoblastic hyperplasia, will also be present. Stromal changes such as stromal mucin and apoptosis appear early and can help to make the diagnosis. In partial molar pregnancies, fetal tissue will be present. The fetal tissue will be absent in complete moles.
