Ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI): Lung injury related to ventilator use is common when the setting is not selected based on PBW, particularly in cases of stiff lungs such as ARDS that require lung protective strategy using low tidal volume and targeted airway pressures to prevent lung injuries.

Ventilator-associated events (VAE): VAE is defined as "deterioration in respiratory status after a period of stability or improvement on the ventilator, with evidence of infection or inflammation, and laboratory evidence of respiratory infection."

Hemodynamic changes: When placing a patient on mechanical ventilation, there is a change in their natural negative pressure ventilation to one of positive pressure ventilation; this will affect the heart-lung physiology and can alter the patient's hemodynamic status. The addition of positive pressure ventilation increases intrathoracic pressure. The increase in intrathoracic pressure will lead to a decrease in right ventricular preload and left ventricular preload and afterload. It will also increase the right ventricular afterload.
