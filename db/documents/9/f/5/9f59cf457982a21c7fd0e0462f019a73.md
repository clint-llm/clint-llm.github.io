Phases of reflex recovery

- Phase 1 (between 0 to 24 hours): This is driven by motor neuron hyperpolarization and is characterized by areflexia or hyporeflexia. The first pathological reflex during this period is the delayed plantar reflex followed by a bulbocavernosus, abdominal wall, and cremasteric reflexes. Sympathetic dysfunction can lead to bradyarrhythmias, atrioventricular conduction block, and hypotension.

- Phase 2 (day 1 to day 3): This is driven by denervation supersensitivity and receptor upregulation. Cutaneous reflexes are more prominent in this phase, while deep tendon reflexes remain absent.

- Phase 3 (4 days to 1 month): This is driven by synaptic and short axon growth. Deep tendon reflexes usually return in most patients, and the Babinski sign may appear.

- Phase 4 (1 to 12 months): This is driven by the growth of long axons and synapses. Cutaneous and deep tendon reflexes will be hyperactive even with minimal stimuli. Malignant hypertension and autonomic dysreflexia may appear in this stage.
