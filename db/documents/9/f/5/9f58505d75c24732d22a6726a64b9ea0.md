Performing perimortem cesarean requires a great deal of clinical judgment and is best done with an interprofessional team that includes NICU and labor and delivery nurses.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, physicians were required by law to perform cesarean sections. In 1747, a Sicilian physician was condemned to death for not performing a post-mortem cesarean section. Combined with the dismal patient outcome and such harsh ramifications, it is no surprise that physicians were reluctant and opposed to this procedure.

Outcomes and attitudes alike have changed as survival rates have increased and legal matters have shifted in favor of good samaritan involvement. To this author's knowledge, no healthcare provider has been found liable for the outcome when performing this procedure in the United States.
