Symptoms of acute tonsillitis include fever, tonsillar exudates, sore throat, and tender anterior cervical chain lymphadenopathy.

Examination of patients should involve a thorough history and physical exam focused on the oropharynx. Vaccination status and sexual activity should both undergo assessment. Visualization of the tonsils is paramount, and features such as swelling, erythema, and the examiner should note any exudates. Tonsillar enlargement resulting in decreased visualization of the posterior oropharynx and decreased ability to handle secretions and/or protect the airway should alert the provider to consider further imaging and assess the need for airway management. In the absence of direct visualization of a tonsillar abscess, uvular deviation should raise suspicion, and CT imaging can be an option. As with all otolaryngological complaints, a full examination of the ears and nose should also be performed.
