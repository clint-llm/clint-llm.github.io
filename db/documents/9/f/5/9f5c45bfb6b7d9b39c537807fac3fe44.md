There are approximately 29 million people with diabetes in the United States, and approximately 25% of people older than age of 65 have diabetes. The incidence of diabetes worldwide is projected to increase by 55% over the next 20 years, so this problem is only going to get worse. Approximately 75% of diabetic neuropathies is distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP). Once peripheral neuropathy develops the annual incidence of ulcer formation increases from less than one percent to greater than 7%. The three-year mortality for people with diabetes increases from 13% to 28% with an ulcer. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of diabetic foot infections and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of diabetic foot infections.
- Recall the presentation of diabetic foot infections.
- List the treatment and management options available for diabetic foot infections.
- Explore interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with diabetic foot infections.
