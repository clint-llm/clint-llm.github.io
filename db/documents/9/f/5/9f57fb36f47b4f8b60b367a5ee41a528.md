Lesions usually disappear and do not cause problems in adulthood. OFD is a benign lesion, and thus it has an excellent prognosis. However, there is evidence of a link between OFD and AD. However, several large series of patients with OFD with excellent follow-up have failed to show any case of OFD that has progressed to AD. Isolated cases have reported the progression of OFD to AD, but these may represent biopsy sampling error and initial misdiagnosis.

Long-term surveillance is required for survivors of this low-grade, slowly progressing tumor. Local recurrence usually occurs 5 to 15 years after diagnosis, but it has been reported as late as 24 and 36 years after diagnosis. Metastases can also occur many years later, even after initial resection with wide margins and a disease-free interval of more than 10  years. Metastases are managed with surgical resection.

As there is no clear evidence of progression from OFD to adamantinoma, conservative management with observation or curettage is often successful for patients with OFD and OFD-like adamantinoma. Resection with clear margins is required for patients with adamantinoma. Late tumor recurrence is not uncommon in adamantinoma, and prolonged follow-up should be considered.
