The contemporary clinical practice guidelines recommend Percutaneous Mitral Balloon Commissurotomy (PMBC) in the following patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis.

- Symptomatic patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis having valve morphology suitable for PMBC and do not have left atrial thrombus or moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR) qualify for PMBC as class I (Level of Evidence A)

- Severely symptomatic patients with severe mitral stenosis, having valve morphology not suitable for PMBC but are not candidates for mitral valve surgery, qualify for PMBC as class IIb (Level of Evidence B)

- Asymptomatic patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis having valve morphology suitable for PMBC and do not have left atrial thrombus or moderate to severe MR qualify for PMBC as class IIa (Level of Evidence B) if pulmonary artery systolic pressure is >50 mmHg.

- Asymptomatic patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis having valve morphology suitable for PMBC and do not have left atrial thrombus or moderate to severe MR qualify for PMBC as class IIb (Level of Evidence C) if they developed new-onset atrial fibrillation.

- Severely symptomatic patients with moderate rheumatic mitral stenosis, having valve morphology suitable for PMBC, and do not have left atrial thrombus or moderate to severe MR, qualify for PMBC as class IIb (Level of Evidence C) if found to have hemodynamically significant MS based on pulmonary artery wedge pressure of >25 mm Hg or mean mitral valve gradient of >15 mm Hg on exercise.

- Asymptomatic women with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis, who are considering pregnancy, have valve morphology suitable for PMBC, and do not have left atrial thrombus or moderate to severe MR,Â  qualify for PMBC before pregnancy as class IIa (Level of Evidence C)
