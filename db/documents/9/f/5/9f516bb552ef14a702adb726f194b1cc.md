Patients with a suspected vascular disorder affecting the vertebrobasilar system should undergo computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to assess for abnormal bony structures, infarction lesions, and vertebral artery stenosis. Diagnostic confirmation is digital subtraction angiography, which in true bow hunter's syndrome, will show normal arteries in neutral head alignment and stenotic arteries or vascular occlusion with head rotation. These vascular studies are considered the gold standard in confirming the diagnosis of bow hunter'sÂ syndrome.
