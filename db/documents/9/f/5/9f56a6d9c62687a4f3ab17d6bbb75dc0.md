The septum receives vascular supply by a branch of sphenopalatine artery posteriorly, a tributary of anterior ethmoid artery superiorly, a branch of the superior labial artery and the greater palatine artery antero-inferiorly. The lateral nasal wall gets its supply from the anterior ethmoid artery anteriorly, and the sphenopalatine artery supplies the rest of the structure. The turbinates, which are the lining of the lateral wall of the nose, are extremely vascular, and have large sinusoids, thus forming a system where both shunting of the blood and venous pooling are possible. A branch of the facial artery provides vascular supply to the vestibule.
