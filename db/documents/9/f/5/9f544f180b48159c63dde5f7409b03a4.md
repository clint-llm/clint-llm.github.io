Medications that cause vasodilatory effects, such as antihypertensives, alpha-blockers, and amlodipine, should be avoided with concomitant use with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. If used in sequence, patients should have routine monitoring, and therapy should be started on the lowest possible dosage as it may result in profound hypotension, lightheadedness, and dizziness. Patients with renal insufficiency and hepatic impairment can result in higher serum concentrations of medication; dose adjustment may be necessary. Fluid and electrolytes require monitoring routinely with milrinone use as it may precipitate hypokalemia and induce arrhythmias. Precautions are necessary for patients with underlying ophthalmopathy taking sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil, and avanafil as unexpected vision loss may occur unilaterally or bilaterally, which may be an indication of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).

Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors are substantially and quickly metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme found in the liver.

Patients receiving treatment milrinone should be monitored via EKG as it can precipitate ventricular arrhythmias. Electrolytes should also be monitored with milrinone use as it can decrease serum potassium. Patients being treated with roflumilast and apremilast should be followed for alterations in mood, such as worsening depression or suicidal thoughts, as it may precipitate underlying or undiagnosed mood disorders. Anagrelide serum concentration can increase eightfold in hepatic impairment. Liver function tests should be conducted before therapy, and platelet count requires routine monitoring for patients taking this medication.
