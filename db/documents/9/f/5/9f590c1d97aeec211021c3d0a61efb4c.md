Make sure to gather all of the appropriate materials before the procedure. Being comfortable is also important. Try to secure a single line of sight for the operator to look down at the patient’s arm and then directly up to the ultrasound screen. Before penetrating the patient with the IV needle, it is critical to visualize the expected course of the veins. Find one that is adequate for cannulation. Studies indicate that superficial and larger vessels correlate to a higher success rate.

After identifying an appropriate vein, put a cover on the probe. For peripheral IVs, transparent adhesive films can function as a probe cover. When placing the covers, put them directly on the transmitting surface of the probe. Ensure that there are no air bubbles between the probe and cover.
