Brachial neuritis, also called neuralgic amyotrophy, has two major clinical symptoms, pain and muscle weakness from atrophy. It is a multifocal, immune-mediated inflammatory process that involves the peripheral nerves. Milner reports that up to 80% of patients have a unilateral onset, and 60% involves the dominant side while only 20% had a bilateral extremities onset. This activity describes the causes, pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis of brachial neuritis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of brachial neuritis.
- Describe the history and physical exam of a patient with brachial neuritis.
- Summarize the treatment options for brachial neuritis.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by brachial neuritis.
