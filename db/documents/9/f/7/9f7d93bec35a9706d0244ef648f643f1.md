Perisacral surgical techniques offer a different type of difficulty. During perisacral surgery to remove tumors, the surgeon must have clear landmarks developed, or they risk cutting the superior and or inferior gluteal artery. The sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments are landmarks that the surgeon must identify because these two ligaments lie over the superior and inferior gluteal arteries. Traditional surgical techniques removed more gluteus tissue, which made identification of the arteries easier, but also compromised functional recovery because of tissue loss.
