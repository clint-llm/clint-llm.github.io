This condition usually has a good prognosis. Mild disease can be stable for years but can also be aggressive and rapidly progressive after any insult.

In general, there is a delay in diagnosis of up to 2 years due to the rarity and insidious nature of the disease. Mortality is, for the most part, due to tracheal compression. The disease-specific mortality rate has been reported to be around 6 to 10% in older studies. However, a recent study from Mayo clinic reported no increase in mortality over a follow-up period of 9.5 years, and approximately 86% of patients had stable disease.
