An accurate and thorough history and physical examination of patients with persistent pain after lower back surgery are crucial for correct diagnosis. The character and location of the patientâ€™s pain should be identified and compared to presurgical pain; lack of immediate pain relief may indicate operation at the wrong level whereas new-onset pain may indicate surgically-induced nerve damage.

Physical exam for the failed back surgery syndrome patient is generally not useful for identifying a specific etiology of pain, although the practitioner may be able to elicit several suggestive findings.
