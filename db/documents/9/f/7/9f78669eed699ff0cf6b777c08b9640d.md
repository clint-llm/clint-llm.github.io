Allopurinol undergoes metabolism in the liver, where it transforms into its pharmacologically active metabolite, oxypurinol. The half-life of allopurinol is 1 to 2 hours, and oxypurinol is about 15 hours. Both allopurinol and oxypurinol are renally excreted. Allopurinol and oxypurinol both inhibit xanthine oxidase, an enzyme in the purine catabolism pathway that converts hypoxanthine to xanthine to uric acid.

Schmidt A. et al. conducted a clinical trial on the analgesic effects of allopurinol in patients undergoing hysterectomy. The investigators found that allopurinol given as a pre-anesthetic agent reduced pain scores 2 hours after surgery.

Fagundes A. et al. conducted a study (12 women) on allopurinol treatment in patients with fibromyalgia.

Hsu F. et al. found evidence that medium to high doses of allopurinol reduced colorectal cancer risk in patients.

Park S. et al. found that allopurinol was renoprotective in patients with hyperuricemia and chronic kidney disease compared to febuxostat treatment.

Prieto-Moure B. et al. conducted research on small intestine ischemia-reperfusion injury of Wistar rats and the role of allopurinol and dantrolene in preventing oxygen-free radical damage. The researchers found that the allopurinol and dantrolene combination provided antioxidant effects, which decreased the oxygen-free radical damage caused by the ischemia-reperfusion in the rat's small intestines.
