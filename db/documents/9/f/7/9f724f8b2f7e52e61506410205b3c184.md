The pathology of MSA mimics many other neurological diseases. It is therefore integral that a thorough history and physical exam should be performed to rule out other similar diseases.Â In addition, the role of early levodopa as both a diagnostic and a partially therapeutic agent should be strongly encouraged. This would both help elucidate underlying disease pathology faster and result in expedited treatment of either disease. Furthermore, due to the limited life expectancy and treatments available following diagnosis, end-of-life planning in addition to therapy, expectations should be incorporated into every treatment plan.
