As mentioned above, the cause of many cases of encephalitis remains unknown despite extensive testing. Thus, history and physical exam play a vital role in making the diagnosis of viral encephalitis. Important elements of history include immune status, exposure to insects or animals, travel history, vaccination history, geography, and time of year. The most common sign and symptoms are fever, headache, seizures, and altered mental status. Neuropsychiatric features such as behavioral changes, hallucinations, and/or cognitive decline are often seen. Patients may also have other symptoms or exam findings that are more specific to a given virus. For example, rash and skin vesicles are seen with herpes zoster encephalitis, whereas lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are usually associated with EBV. HSV encephalitis involves the temporal and frontal lobes, so it is often characterized by psychiatric features, memory deficits, and aphasia. On the other hand, motor symptoms such as choreoathetosis and parkinsonian movements are seen with some arboviruses because they predominately affect the basal ganglia.

JE may lead to extrapyramidal symptoms-which mimic Parkinson disease

Enterovirus 71 may cause tremor, myoclonus, ataxia, pulmonary edema, and cranial nerve palsies.

Nipah virus has been shown to produce brainstem and cerebellar signs, hypertension and segmental myoclonus.

Microcephaly is typical of Zika virus infection.
