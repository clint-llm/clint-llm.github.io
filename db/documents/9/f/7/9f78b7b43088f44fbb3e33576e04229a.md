Studies estimate the median survival in cases diagnosed with polycythemia vera to be approximately 14.1 years.

Factors that were found to correlate with better prognosis included:

- Thrombocytosis

- Pruritus: The reason for the correlation of pruritus with a better prognosis was unclear. This could be attributed toÂ the following:

- Lead-time bias: patients with significant pruritus were likely to seek medical attention earlier.
- Lower risk of arterial thrombosis

Factors associated with worse outcomes included:

- Higher leucocyte counts

- Venous thrombosis

- Leukoerythroblastic blood smear
