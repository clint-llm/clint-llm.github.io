Wrist arthrodesis, also known as wrist fusion, is a procedure in which the wrist joint is immobilized by fusing the radius to the carpal bones. It is a procedure used for pain relief purposes in conditions such as advanced wrist arthritis, following wrist fractures, or severe ligament injuries. This procedure is performed when all other treatment options have failed to control the patient's symptoms.

Wrist arthrodesis may involve the entire wrist joint or partial wrist joint in techniques such as scapholunate fusion, four-corner fusion with scaphoid excision, scapho-trapezoid fusion, scaphocapitate fusion, and radio-lunate fusion. Whether arthrodesis is total or partial, the goal is to provide pain relief and to preserve as much function as possible in the wrist joint. This article refers to total wrist fusion as a surgical procedure.
