Brain and spinal cord formation arise during the embryonic process of neurulation.  During the fourth week of development, the neural plate, which arises from neural ectoderm, thickens, and folds along the dorsal midline.  After folding, the neural tube then undergoes sequential differentiation, organization, and then closure in an extremely complex and regulated process to complete the primary neural tube, much of which is regulated by the notochord.  The neural tube eventually develops into the primitive central nervous system, separating into its ventral and dorsal components.

Meanwhile, neurons in the peripheral nervous system arise from neural crest cells after undergoing epithelial to mesenchymal transitioning. Motoneurons being among the first fibers of the peripheral system to develop.
