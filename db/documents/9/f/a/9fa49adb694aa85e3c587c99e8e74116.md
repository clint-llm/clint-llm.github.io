As with all nerve conduction studies, the temperature should be ideally between 32 and 33 degrees Celsius to avoid artifactual measurements. A warming lamp may help achieve proper limb temperature. Colder temperatures can cause mistakenly increased amplitudes, prolonged latencies, and slowed conduction velocities on NCS.
