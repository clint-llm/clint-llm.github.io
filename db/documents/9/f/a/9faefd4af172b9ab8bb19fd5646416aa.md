The papillary muscles of the heart are pillar-like muscles seen within the cavity of the ventricles, attached to their walls. They have an integral role in proper cardiac valvular function. They arise from the inner walls of the left and right ventricle and attach to mitral and tricuspid valve leaflets respectively via chordae tendinae. Historical documentation of the existence of papillary muscles as a component of cardiac anatomy exists at least as early as the 16th century.
