The nucleus ambiguus is the common nucleus of the efferent fibers for glossopharyngeal (CN IX) and vagus (CN X) nerves. The name ‘ambiguus’ originates from its difficult-to-find location and variation in different species. Its location is in the reticular formation in the medulla oblongata. The nucleus ambiguus provides fibers that innervate the somatic muscles of the pharynx, larynx, and soft palate. Additionally, the nucleus ambiguus plays a role in parasympathetic cardiac inhibition through CN X. Unilateral lesions of the nucleus ambiguus may lead to dysphagia and hoarseness, and these characteristics are classic in lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg syndrome).
