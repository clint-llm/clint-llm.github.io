The primary differential diagnosis of Sweet syndrome is infections given the presence of fever, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, elevated inflammatory markers, and neutrophil-dense infiltrates. Bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial infections all merit consideration, and the clinician must rule these out. The cutaneous lesions of Sweet syndrome may mimic several other conditions, including:

- Allergic contact dermatitis

- Cellulitis

- Behcet's disease

- Herpes simplex

- Hypersensitivity drug reaction

- Erythema multiforme

- Erythema nodosum

- Pyoderma gangrenosum

Other diagnoses in the differential include:

- Leukocytoclastic vasculitis

- Leukemia cutis
