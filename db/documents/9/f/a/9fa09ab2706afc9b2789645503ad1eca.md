Multiple mechanisms are believed to be involved in the pathophysiology of migraines.

**Cortical Spreading Depression**

Neuronal and glial depolarization spreading across the cerebral cortex is thought to cause the aura of the migraine.

**Trigeminovascular System**

Activation of the trigeminovascular system is also believed to be involved in the pathophysiology of migraine. The trigeminovascular system consists of sensory neurons originating from the trigeminal ganglion and upper cervical dorsal roots: these sensory neurons project to innervate large cerebral vessels, dura mater, and dial vessels. The convergence of these projections at the trigeminal nucleus caudalis explains the distribution of migraine pain that involves anterior and posterior regions of the head and the upper neck.Â Trigeminal ganglion stimulation leads to the release of vasoactive neuropeptides like substance P, neurokinin A, and calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP), which in turn leads to neurogenic inflammation.

**Role of Serotonin**

Serotonin, released from the brainstem serotonergic nuclei, may play a role in migraine; however, the exact role of its mechanisms remains a matter of controversy.

**Role of CGRP**

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of migraines. CGRP is a neuropeptide that has a vasodilatory effect on the cerebral and the dural vessels.

**Sensitization**

The process of neurons becoming increasingly sensitive to nociceptive and non-nociceptive stimulation is called sensitization. Sensitization in primary afferent neurons, the second-order neurons in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, and higher-order neurons in the central nervous system play a role in migraine attacks. Sensitization also explains the throbbing quality of migraine pain, hyperalgesia, and worsening pain with coughing and sudden head movements.

**Genetic Basis**

The genetic basis of migraines is complex. Some migraine disorders are believed to be caused due to mutations in a single gene, while others are caused due to polymorphisms in many genes.
