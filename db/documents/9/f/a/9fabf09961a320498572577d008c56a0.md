Lactulose, also known as 1,4 beta galactoside-fructose, is a non-absorbable synthetic disaccharide made up of galactose and fructose.

Although a variety of mechanisms of action of lactulose that limit the production and absorption of ammonia in the gut, as explained above, haveÂ been reported, it is probable that other laxatives could have the same effects with better tolerability. Lactulose originally received FDA approval in the USA in 1977, but there are concerns regarding the adequacy of data to support its efficacy. As lactulose has been believed to be the therapy for hepatic encephalopathy, it cannot be withheld from patients in need of the therapy from an ethical standpoint. Thus, it remains difficult to conduct human investigation review board approved placebo-controlled trials in the US to confirm or refute the efficacy of lactulose.
