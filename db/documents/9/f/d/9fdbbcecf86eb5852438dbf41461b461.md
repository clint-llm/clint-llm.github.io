Managing physostigmine dosing requires multiple healthcare professionals operating as an interprofessional team. This includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), nursing staff, and pharmacists. It is of utmost importance that those involved in caring for patients who require physostigmine understand the mechanism of action, dosing protocols, and toxicity treatment. When toxicity occurs, the nurse, as the team member who administers the drug, may be the first to notice it and report it to the healthcare team; it is up to the clinician to consult with the pharmacist to determine the proper dosing of atropine required to keep the patient stable and in no acute distress. The pharmacy and the ordering clinician are also responsible for medication reconciliation to avoid drug-drug interactions. The pharmacist must also perform medication reconciliation. After stabilizing the patient, it is up to the healthcare professionals involved in the care to collaboratively determine the reason behind toxicity. Protocols should be changed if necessary.

Because of the potential for cholinergic toxicity, physostigmine therapy requires an interprofessional team approach, including clinicians, specialists, mid-level practitioners (PA and NP), specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results.
