UV radiation is accepted as the major risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Mutations in the p53 gene are the most common genetic abnormalities found in actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma in situ and invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Tanning lamp usage, therapeutic UV exposure, and ionizing radiation are all well-known risk factors for the development of squamous cell carcinoma, likely through the p53 pathway. The p53 protein stops cells with mutated or damaged DNA from replicating.  If the p53 gene becomes mutated through the ways discussed above, then the p53 protein is rendered non-functional, and cells with damaged DNA, such as those found is squamous cell carcinoma can replicate.
