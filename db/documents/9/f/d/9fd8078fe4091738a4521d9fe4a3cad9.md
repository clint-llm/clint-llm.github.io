The patient should be aware of the possibility of a pathological collapse of the involved vertebrae, and therefore bracing or external immobilizers may sometimes be recommended (apart from surgical stabilization procedures) by the treating clinicians. Strict compliance with physician recommendations is very important in such scenarios.
