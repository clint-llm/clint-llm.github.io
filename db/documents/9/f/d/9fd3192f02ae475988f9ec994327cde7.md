Lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) comprise a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled production of lymphocytes that cause monoclonal lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy and bone marrow infiltration. These diseases often occur in immunocompromised individuals. There are two subsets of lymphocytes: T and B cells that regenerate uncontrollably to produce immunoproliferative disorders, which are prone to immunodeficiency, a dysfunctional immune system, and lymphocyte dysregulation. Several gene mutations have been described as causes of LPD that can be iatrogenic or acquired. Describe the roles of various interprofessional team members in caring for patients with LPD and how the team can improve chances for survival and recovery.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the signs and symptoms of lymphoproliferative disorders. 
- Review the diagnostic evaluation of LPD. 
- Explain treatment considerations for patients with LPD. 
- identify the roles of various interprofessional team members in caring for patients with LPD and improving chances for survival and recovery.
