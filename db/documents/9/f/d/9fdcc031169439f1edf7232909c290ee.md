The management of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia is mainly surgical as with the progression of time, and it leads to more worsening, shortening, and deformity of the condition. The role of prophylactic bracing in a child who has just started walking can help delay or limit the deformity associated with this condition. The goal of surgical management is restricted to achieving the union in cases of CPT and includes restoring the limb's satisfactory alignment and correcting the limb length discrepancies while preserving the normal articular function. Various surgical techniques described in the literature include intramedullary nailing along with a bone graft, Ilizarov technique, and vascularized fibular transfer.

**Intramedullary Nailing Along With a Bone Graft**

This concept was first described in the literature by Charnley in 1956. It is based on the principle of resection of pseudarthrosis and fixation with an intramedullary implant supported by a large bone graft which results in limb alignment, deformity correction and guides the lengthening of bone during the growth phase. Various types of intramedullary fixation devices are available. One of the recent fixation devices is a telescopic nail.

**Ilizarov Technique**

This technique works on the principle of direct compression of the pseudarthrosis area with or without its resection along with or without bone graft. High rates of the union are seen when resection of pseudoarthrosis was performed at the initial stage. This method has the advantage of correcting deformity postoperatively and bone transport for any limb length discrepancies.

**Vascularized Bone Transfers**

This procedure was initially described by Judet and Gilbert in 1978 for the treatment of CPT. It is based on the principle of dystrophic tibia resection, which is substituted by vascularized healthy bone.

Recent advances in the management of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia include the use of bone morphogenic proteins, induced membrane and spongy autologous grafts, periosteal grafts, and electrostimulation.
