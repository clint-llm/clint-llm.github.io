The incidence of pemphigus is rare and has been estimated to be 1 in 100,000 people. While the disease is likely multifactorial, drug-induced pemphigus is the most common cause. Pemphigus vulgaris is the most common variant, with an incidence as high as 0.1 to 0.5 per 100,000 people. Pemphigus vulgaris also has a higher incidence among the Jewish population and in those individuals of Mediterranean descent. There seems to be an equal incidence in both males and females with an average age of 40 to 60 years. The most common offending drugs include D-penicillamine, captopril, and penicillin. One study reported an incidence as high as 7% among individuals taking penicillamine for the last six months.
