Erythema marginatum is reactive inflammatory erythema seen most commonly in association with acute rheumatic fever. Although a rare cutaneous manifestation, it is of utmost diagnostic value for acute rheumatic fever as well as other rare disorders. It can be described as an evanescent, blanchable, nonpruritic macular rash seen generally on the trunk and extremities. It can also be seen in hereditary angioedema and psittacosis.
