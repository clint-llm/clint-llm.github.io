Atazanavir is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection.

Atazanavir therapy works in combination with other anti-HIV drugs.

Because of cross-resistance among antiretroviral agents, information on the baseline mutations in the virus, as determined by genotype testing, should guide the drug regimen selection, especially in patients who have had prior treatment with protease inhibitors.

Atazanavir is not recommended to children younger than three months of age, and the optimal dosage remains unestablished. Atazanavir may cause kernicterus in this group as it is a competitive inhibitor of an enzyme that catalyzes bilirubin glucuronidation.
