Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the world. Pontine strokes, in particular, are catastrophic. Clinical presentation of a pontine infarction can vary, ranging from the classical crossed syndrome (ipsilateral cranial nerve palsy and contralateral motor and/or sensory impairment) to the less common pure motor hemiparesis or hemiplegia or pure sensory stroke. A majority of stroke events and their complications can be prevented with proper care. This activity outlines the presentation, evaluation, and management of infarction in the pons and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
-  Review the epidemiology of pontine infarction.
- Describe the common presentations in patients with pontine infarction.
- Outline treatment considerations for patients with pontine infarction.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination, collaboration, and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care and improve outcomes for patients receiving acute stroke care.
