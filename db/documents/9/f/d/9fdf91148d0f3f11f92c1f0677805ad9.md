Sunburns can range from mild to severe based on the degree of exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet rays. Prevention is easy and straightforward. A broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF of at least 30 should be applied 30 minutes before sun exposure and every 90 minutes, after that. Water resistant sunscreen should be considered and frequently reapplied when spending time in the water. Sun protective clothing should be worn as an added barrier. Direct exposure to the sun should be avoided between the hours of 10 AM and 4 PM.
