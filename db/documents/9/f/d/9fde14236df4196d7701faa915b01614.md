There are no biological or pathological tests of diagnosis. Diagnosis does not require a biopsy. However, a biopsy is beneficial to rule out squamous cell carcinoma in the presence of severe hidradenitis suppurativa if the diagnosis is uncertain. Bacterial cultures are not beneficial unless a secondary infection or an alternative diagnosis is suspected. Imaging is not typically helpful; however, ultrasound may be a useful tool pre-operatively to identify the extent of sinus tracts. Lesions may warrant further imaging, including MRI in severe perianal disease.
