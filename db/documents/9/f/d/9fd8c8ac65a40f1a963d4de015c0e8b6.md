Eosinophilic pneumonia includes a group of disorders characterized by an accumulation of eosinophilic infiltrates in the pulmonary parenchyma with or without peripheral blood eosinophilia. These include a broad range of lung conditions that occur due to infectious or non-infectious causes. This activity describes the pathophysiology of eosinophilic pneumonia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of eosinophilic pneumonia.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient suspected of having eosinophilic pneumonia.
- Summarize the treatment options for eosinophilic pneumonia.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by eosinophilic pneumonia.
