- Diplopia with upward gaze, limited upward gaze, infraorbital anesthesia, and enophthalmos are hallmarks of blow-out fractures and need a referral for surgical evaluation. However, the initial clinical presentation is not always able to predict long-term sequelae, such as late enophthalmos and diplopia.

- Early ophthalmologic consultation is mandatory.

- Observation of uncomplicated fractures is recommended for up to 2 weeks; then, a decision can be made whether the patient needs surgery.

- Loss of vision, exophthalmos, and absent pupillary light reflex are important criteria for ruling out optic neuropathy.
