Prevention and immediate recognition of POVL a paramount. Most delays are likely due to delayed recognition rather than deterioration following initially normal post-operative vision. Emergent ophthalmologic consultation is recommended for a more thorough ocular examination and to localize the anatomic lesion along the visual pathway.

If there is a concern for cortical visual loss, neurology consultation, and stroke activation should be initiated, which may begin with a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head to rule out an intracranial hemorrhage, possibly followed by CT angiography of the head to rule out large vessel occlusion and ultimately magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to delineate the extent of ischemic stroke.

As far as intraoperative evaluation, real-time flash visual evoked potentials (VEP) are currently under investigation as a potentially useful tool for monitoring visual function during prone spine surgery.
