Given that all infections due to GAS are bacterial in nature, the mainstay in treatment is targeted antibiotic therapy. In most cases of infection due to GAS, antibiotic treatment can actually be started before confirmatory laboratory results are available. However, it logically follows that if testing is ultimately negative for GAS, antibiotics specifically targeted against GAS should be discontinued.

When considering antibiotics for treating GAS, several options are available. Penicillin-based antibiotics, including ampicillin and amoxicillin, are very effective in treating GAS infections. Given their similar mechanism of action, cephalosporins, in addition to macrolides and clindamycin, have shown appropriate activity against GAS.

Specifically, when treating GAS pharyngitis and simple cellulitis, an oral regimen of the above antibiotics is typically recommended for about ten days in pharyngitis and 5 to 7 days in cellulitis. A typical regimen can be IV benzylpenicillin for ten days or Penicillin V as an oral alternative for ten days in pharyngitis. An alternate treatment specifically for pharyngitis due to GAS is a single dose of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, especially in those patients who are unlikely to complete the full course of oral antibiotics.

For more severe infections secondary to GAS, including necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome, the causative bacteria is typically not known at the time of the patient’s presentation. Given the life-threatening nature of these infections, it is recommended that more broad-spectrum antibiotics be given in IV form. This ensures that both GAS, as well as other possible causative organisms are treated while awaiting final speciation results.
