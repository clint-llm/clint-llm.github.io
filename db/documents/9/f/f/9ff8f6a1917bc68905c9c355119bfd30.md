Tendinous anatomical variants are common. For example, the tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii may vary its shape, its origin, or be absent with a 1.9% to 7.4% match rate in the population. The popliteal muscle tendon is bifurcated in 0.4% of the population, thus creating two muscular bellies. The tendon of the flexor hallucis longus muscle has a variability of lease and shape approximating 9.8%. The patellar tendon, a passive patella stabilizer, may present as two distinct tendons or be absent.
