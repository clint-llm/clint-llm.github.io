Although up to 30% of bacterial vaginosis cases may resolve without treatment, this condition can also be treated with either clindamycin or metronidazole.

Some studies have suggested that pregnant women who are symptomatic from bacterial vaginosis should be treated with clindamycin before 22 weeks of gestation to reduce the risk of labor before 37 weeks of gestation.

Unfortunately, it has been shown that recurrence may occur in up to 80% of women after treatment.
