Schizencephaly is a CNS malformation that most often presents as epilepsy. Though a majority of patients have well-controlled seizures, some patients may develop refractory epilepsy with uncontrolled breakthrough seizures and associated risks, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).

Individuals with schizencephaly with large fluid-filled spaces may develop elevated intracranial pressure with associated complications such as herniation, and these patients may require surgical intervention with or without ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. These surgical methods can be associated with complications such as bleeding, subdural hygroma, empyema, hydrocephalus, and infections like meningitis. If shunting is performed, additional possible complications include endocarditis and shunt-related renal damage.
