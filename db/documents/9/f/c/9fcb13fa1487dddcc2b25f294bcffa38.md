Apart from the classic complications observed during regional anesthetic techniques such as puncture site infections, hematomas at the puncture site, nerve damage, and toxicity linked to an overdose of local anesthetics. The paravertebral block presents specific complications such as the risk of pneumothorax, hemothorax, or intrathecal injection as described by certain authors ( Lekhak and colleagues ).

Pulmonary hemorrhage has been described in patients who have undergone paravertebral block during thoracic surgery.

Other complications such as Ipsilateral brachial plexus block and hemidiaphragmatic paresis were observed by Steven H Renes et al. (2011).

Burlacu et al. (2005) and Crawley S M (2006) also reported diffusion to the ipsilateral stellate ganglion during TPVB leading to ipsilateral Horner syndrome.

Nowadays, these complications are becoming less frequent thanks to the existence and technological progress of ultrasound devices.
