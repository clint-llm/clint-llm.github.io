Recognizing that a patient’s airway will be difficult allows the clinician to plan for and minimize the risks of airway-related morbidity. A prospective observational study of 156 patients undergoing intubation in the emergency department found the LEMON scale evaluation accurately stratified patients according to the risk of difficult intubation. The 3-3-2 rule plays a crucial role in planning as a component of the LEMON scale.

**L: Look Externally**

Look for external indicators of difficult endotracheal intubation. Which can include the abnormal shape of the face, extreme cachexia, poor dentition, edentulous mouth, morbid obesity, high arching palate, short neck, large front teeth, surgical scar indicating previous tracheostomy scar, indicating patient might have tracheomalacia, narrow mouth, face, or neck pathology.

**E: Evaluate**

This is where the 3-3-2 rule is important. It is the estimated measurement of 3 separate distances on the patient using the examiner's fingers.

3: Measurement of the Inter-incisor space, which should be greater than three fingers distance between the upper and lower teeth of the open mouth of a patient.

3: Measurement of the hyoid-mental distance, which should be greater than three fingers from the anterior tip of the mandible to the anterior neck on the hyoid bone.

2: Measurement of the hyoid-thyroid cartilage distance, which should be greater than two fingers between the floor of the mandible at the hyoid bone to the thyroid notch on the anterior neck.

**M: Mallampati Scoring**

Mallampati scoring is a system based on the anatomy of the mouth and the view of various anatomical structures when one opens his or her mouth as wide as possible. The scoring is done in a sitting position and is not performable in an emergency. A class 1 score is interpreted as easy, and class 4 is the most difficult.

- Class 1: Structures visualized- soft palate, uvula, fauces, anterior and posterior pillars

- Class 2: Structures visualized- soft palate fauces and uvula

- Class 3: Structures visualized- soft palate and the base of the uvula

- Class 4: Soft palate is not visible

**O: Obstruction**

One should assess if the airway could be obstructed with the foreign body, abscess, tumor, soft tissue swelling such as in a burn victim or expanding hematoma in a trauma patient.

**N: Neck Mobility**

In alert and awake patients, see if the patient can place their chin on their chest and how far back are they able to tilt their head. Decreased neck mobility is a negative predictor of intubation complications.
