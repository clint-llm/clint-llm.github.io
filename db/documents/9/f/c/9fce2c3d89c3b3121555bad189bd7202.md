These tumors are cataloged based on the WHO classification for pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors, in typical and atypical carcinoid, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma.

Typical carcinoids have a generally more benign course, but the opposite is true for small cell carcinoma. Atypical carcinoid and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma lay in the middle of the spectrum. Hence, these pathologic classifications have a prognosis correlation.
