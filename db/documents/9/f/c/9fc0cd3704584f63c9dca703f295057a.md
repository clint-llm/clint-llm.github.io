Generally, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is thought to develop from the response of susceptible individuals to inhaled antigens leading to immunologically-induced parenchymal inflammation.Thermoactinomycetes vulgaris. This organism produces a hypersensitivity reaction characterized by widespread bronchoconstriction in the peripheral bronchopulmonary tree, resembling other extrinsic allergic alveolitis such as the farmer's lungs.

However, other mechanisms have also been postulated in the pathophysiology of the disease, including the irritant property of bagasse itself, its silica content, other micro-organisms including fungi, or a combination of these factors.

- Raised serum levels of antigen-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG)

- Elevated neutrophils in the lungs primed for enhanced respiratory response

In subacute and chronic bagassosis, characteristic T-lymphocytic alveolitis is noted, attributable to increased T-cell migration, decreased apoptosis, and local proliferation. Immune processes leading to persistent disease and fibrotic changes are unclear but may be mediated by:

- Raised CD4:CD8 ratio

- Reduced effector CD8 T cells

- Skewing toward T helper cell differentiation and cytokine profile
