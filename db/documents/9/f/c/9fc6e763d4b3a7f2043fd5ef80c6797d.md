The thoracic duct travels within the posterior mediastinum and is therefore related to the aorta here. It originates in front of the L2 vertebra as the cisterna chyli, and ascends with the aorta through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm, where it then lies between the aorta and the azygous vein. At the level of the T5 vertebra, it continues posterior to the aortic arch before terminating as a loop arching over the subclavian artery to drain into the left internal jugular vein, jugulosubclavian angle, or left subclavian vein
