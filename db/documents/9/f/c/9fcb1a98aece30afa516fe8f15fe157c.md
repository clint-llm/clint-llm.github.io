Pudendal neuralgia due to pudendal nerve entrapment can immensely affect the quality of life, but it doesÂ not affect life expectancy. The overall response to pudendal nerve blocks in properly selected patients is roughly 80%, but the relief typically lasts only about 30 days in most patients. A repeat injection or an alternative treatment would then need to be utilized. The best long-term cures are from decompressive surgery, where the response rates are 60% to 80%.
