While UCL surgical intervention has progressed overÂ the years, the tracking of patient outcomes in a quantitative manner is lacking relative to other musculoskeletal injuries such as ACL tears and its reconstruction. The function of the UCL and the stresses put on this ligament need to be analyzed in various settings, especially the athletic setting such as baseball. Functional screening and quantitative measures regarding injury progression, proper postsurgical therapy, and the timeline for return to sport still need to be accounted for in the literature regarding UCL injuries.
