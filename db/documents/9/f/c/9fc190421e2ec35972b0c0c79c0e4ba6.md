Other indications include pre-operative evaluation before lung surgery in lung carcinoma to estimate the loss of lung function, pre-operative evaluation and post-operative monitoring in lung transplant patients, measurement of cardiac shunts, and evaluation of new-onset pulmonary hypertension to detect chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension or CTEPH.
