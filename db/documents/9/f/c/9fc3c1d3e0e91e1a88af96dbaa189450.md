Differential diagnoses for mycotic aneurysms can be various, which is attributable to the involvement of various organ systems. Following are some of the important differentials which need to be considered when suspecting the diagnosis of a mycotic aneurysm:

- Cellulitis

- Atherosclerotic aortic aneurysm (fusiform enlargement, with the presence of calcification and slow course in the absence of fever or systemic signs of infection)

- Pyelonephritis: Renal artery mycotic aneurysm in transplanted kidneys

- Inflammatory aortitis and aneurysm due to vasculitides

- Intracranial mycotic aneurysms may present similar to meningitis, septic thrombophlebitis, or orbital cellulitis.
