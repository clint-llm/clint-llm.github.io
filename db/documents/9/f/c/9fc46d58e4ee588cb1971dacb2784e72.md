The abducens nucleus consists of motor neurons, interneurons, and a small percentage of neurons projecting to the cerebellar flocculus. Signaling pathways through the nucleus allow for gaze holding and conjugate horizontal gaze during the vestibulo-ocular reflex and for the generation of saccades.

Motor nerve fibers course ventrally through the pons after exiting the abducens nucleus and form the abducens nerve fascicle.

The abducens nucleus plays a significant role in coordinating the conjugate gaze, and the generation of rapid saccades conjugate eye movements that allow the center of gaze to shift from one part of the visual field to another.

Different afferent inputs are involved in the control of the twitch and non-twitch muscle fibers of the lateral rectus muscle.

During the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex, axons of second-order neurons in the medial vestibular nuclei (MVN) transmit velocity commands to excite the contralateral abducens nucleus and coordinate eye movement with head movement.
