Management of favus was challenging in the early nineteenth century and was based on radiotherapy. Since 1958, oral griseofulvin had been the treatment of choice for anthropophilic Trychophyton infections, particularly tinea capitis favosa. The appropriate dosage was 1 g/day for an adult of average size and 15 to 20 mg/kg/day for children, for 6-8 weeks, but now larger doses and longer treatment duration are required. T. schoenleinii resistant to griseofulvin has been isolated. The thick, multiple-layered cell wall of the fungi could act as a barrier impermeable to griseofulvin.

In addition to decreased efficacity, griseofulvin has potentially severe side effects such as carcinogenicity and teratogenicity. Currently, newer antifungal drugs like terbinafine and azoles are recommended. They have the advantage of shorter treatment with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio and persistence in fungicidal concentrations for several weeks after completing the course of treatment, which prevents reinfection.

The local treatment, which is an adjunct to systemic therapy includes removing the crusts, cutting of hair around the alopecia patches, and applying twice a day antifungal shampoo, foam gel, lotion, or spray with isoconazole and ketoconazole.

Nail involvement requires more prolonged therapy.

The success of therapy is confirmed by repeated negative fungal cultures.
