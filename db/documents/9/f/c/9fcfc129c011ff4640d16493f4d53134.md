There is no vaccine available for any of the Ehrlichia species. Avoidance of tick bites remains the mainstay of prevention, with the application of insect repellents, avoidance of high-risk areas, covering all exposed skin, and checking carefully for ticks after outdoor activities in endemic areas. As ehrlichiosis is not transmitted directly person-to-person, no isolation is needed.
