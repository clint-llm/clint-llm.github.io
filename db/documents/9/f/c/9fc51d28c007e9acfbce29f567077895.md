It is essential to educate the patient and family on the possibility of growth disturbance with fixation of these fractures. Patients and families should be educated on the complications of surgery, including possible secondary surgery for hardware irritation, surgeries related to growth disturbances, the possibility of leg length inequality, risk of infection, risk of damage to surrounding structures, and possible non-union. The importance of postoperative rehabilitation should be emphasized to avoid complications from delayed motion due to patient pain tolerance. Patients should be educated about the risk of arthrofibrosis and quadriceps atrophy and the importance of working hard with physical therapy to get motion and strength back. It is also important to educate the patient and family that there may still be knee instability after treatment as the injury itself can stretch the fibers of the ACL and cause elongation of the fibers.
