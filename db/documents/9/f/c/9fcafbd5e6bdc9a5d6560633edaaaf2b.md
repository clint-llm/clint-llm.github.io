After administration, intravenous sodium bicarbonate dissociates to form sodium (Na) and bicarbonate (HCO3). Bicarbonate anions can consume hydrogen ions (H) and subsequently convert to carbonic acid (H2CO3). Carbonic acid subsequently converts to water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) for excretion from the lungs. The main therapeutic effect of sodium bicarbonate administration is increasing plasma bicarbonate levels, which are known to buffer excess hydrogen ion concentration, thereby raising solution pH to combat clinical manifestations of acidosis.

Bicarbonate is often a standard element of body fluids and is often regulated by the kidney via secretion or absorption methods to counter-regulate changes in serum pH. This action often leads to its second administration as it is known to alkalinize the urine, capable of changing precipitants in urine and providing a means of normalizing tubular acid concentration gradients to manage high fluctuations in serum acid-base status changes. This alkalization process enables compounds that would normally precipitate in the renal tubules in acidic conditions to be buffered within the renal tubule, thereby preventing mechanical or chemical damage while also providing increased efficiency within the kidney tubules to excrete acidified substances without disrupting the electrochemical gradient.
