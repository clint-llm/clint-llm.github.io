Accuracy of epidemiologic analysis is challenging since mucormycosis is not a notifiable disease and is further compounded by considerable variation of risk factors among the different populations. With the available data, the global epidemiology of mucormycosis has been showing not only an increase in the incidence but also reporting of new causative agents along with a change in the susceptible population characteristics. Though the rise has been noted globally, it is significantly higher in the Asian continent, especially in India and China. The Leading International Fungal Education (LIFE) portal estimates the annual global prevalence of mucormycosis approximately as 10,000 cases when Indian data is not included. When Indian data is added, it becomes 910,000 cases annually.

AÂ 7-year review of 851 cases showed that the incidence is higher in Europe at 34 %, and 31 % in Asia, 28 % in North and South America, 3% in Africa, and 3% in Australia and New Zealand.
