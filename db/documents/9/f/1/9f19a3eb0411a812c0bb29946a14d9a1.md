Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) occurs in patients that have been on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. It presents with clinical signs that include purulent tracheal discharge, fevers, and respiratory distress in the presence of microorganisms. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of ventilator-associated pneumonia and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia. 
- Review the differential diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia. 
- Describe the history and physical exam findings typically seen in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. 
- Explain why careful planning and discussion amongst interprofessional team members involved in the management of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia will improve outcomes.
