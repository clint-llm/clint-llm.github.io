Halitosis is a term coined from the merger of the Latin halitus (breath) and Greek osis (pathological process) to describe a condition that meant an unpleasant odor from the mouth or "bad breath," as we commonly call it. It is a serious concern for the patient as it could lead to social embarrassment and leave the individual reclusive or occasionally even stigmatized. It is sometimes discovered by the dental practitioner or primary care clinician during a routine examination, and the individual may have been unaware. As social awareness of dental hygiene continues to rise, more people seek medical guidance to help cure this distressing ailment. This activity explains when this condition should be considered in a differential diagnosis, articulates how to evaluate for this condition properly, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.
