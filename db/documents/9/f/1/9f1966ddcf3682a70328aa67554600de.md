Transmyocardial laser extravascular angiogenesis (TMLR) has emerged as an option in patients suffering from chronic refractory angina that can improve both patientsâ€™ symptoms, exercise capacity, quality of life, and decrease their cardiac rehospitalization. This activity on transmyocardial laser extravascular angiogenesis reviews and highlights the role of interprofessional teams in evaluating and treating patients with refractory angina pectoris that have failed all other therapeutic options.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of refractory angina pectoris.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of patients undergoing transmyocardial laser extravascular angiogenesis.
- Outline the procedure of transmyocardial laser extravascular angiogenesis.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance transmyocardial laser extravascular angiogenesis and improve outcomes.
