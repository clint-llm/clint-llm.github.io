ALM is characterized by a broad radial growth phase in which the melanocytic neoplasm remains in-situ. In this phase, single atypical melanocytes are increased predominately at the dermo-epidermal junction in a lentiginous pattern with a propensity to involve the adnexal structures.

Histopathologic evaluation of acral melanocytic lesions is difficult as the lesions may be subtle and heterogenous microscopically.
