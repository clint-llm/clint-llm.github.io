Often called heel, the calcaneus is a large and strong bone that forms the back of the foot and transfers most of the body weight from the lower extremity to the ground. It is the largest of the seven articulating bones that make up the tarsus. The calcaneus is located in the hindfoot with the talus and articulates with the talus and cuboid bones. Numerous ligaments and muscles attach to the calcaneus and help with its role in human bipedal biomechanics.
