Afatinib has several monitoring requirements.

- Given that dermatology adverse reactions are the most common reported adverse reactions during treatment, patients should be advised to avoid sun exposure if possible or utilize adequate sun protection.

- Monitor for signs and symptoms of volume depletion in patients with diarrhea

- Hepatic impairment was commonly observed in clinical trials; it is advised to monitor liver function periodically during treatment.

- The patient's renal function requires periodic monitoring.

- Keratitis is one of the rare adverse effects but reported in clinical trials - therapy should be interrupted with any suspected keratitis.

- Recommended to reduce the dose in case of paronychia

- Monitor patients for any signs and symptoms that raise concern for pulmonary toxicity - interstitial lung disease occurred in a small percentage of patients.

- Assess left ventricle function before and during treatment in high-risk cardiac patients. This drug should be used with caution in patients with cardiac risk factors and/or decreased left ventricle heart failure as patients with significant cardiac history met exclusion criteria for clinical trials.

Takahashi T. et al. studied using afatinib trough plasma concentrations in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer to improve the safety and efficacy of afatinib therapy.
