COVID-19, the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, has been primarily considered a viral respiratory illness. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can experience a multitude of clinical manifestations ranging from no symptoms to critical illness associated with respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ failure. The vast majority of the patients present with clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, anosmia, dysgeusia, malaise, and myalgias. However, COVID-19 can present with GI manifestations alone or in concurrence with the other symptoms as described earlier. Based on a meta-analysis by Elmunzer et.al that involved 1992 patients across 36 centers,1052 patients (53%, 95%CI 51-55%) experienced GI symptoms with the most common reported symptoms being diarrhea (34%, 95%CI 32-36%), nausea (27%, 95%CI 25-29%) vomiting (16%, 95%CI 14-17%),abdominal pain (11%, 95% CI 10-13%)

Viral RNA has also been isolated from stool specimens of COVID-19 patients as evidenced by results of a meta-analysis of 23 published and 6 preprint studies involving 4805 patients, fecal tests were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 8 studies, and viral RNA shedding was detected in 40.5% (95%CI, 27.4%-55.1%) of patients implying transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via the possible fecal-oral route in addition to respiratory droplet transmission

COVID-19 is also frequently associated with elevation of liver biochemistries in 14% to 53% of patients
