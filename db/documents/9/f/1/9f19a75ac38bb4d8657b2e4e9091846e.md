Tarsal coalition is a congenital abnormality in which there is an aberrant union between two or more tarsal bones in the foot. The cuboid-navicular coalition is an especially rare type of tarsal coalition that can occur. They represent less than 1% of all tarsal coalitions. The most likely etiology of tarsal coalitions is a genetic mutation that results in the absence of differentiation and segmentation of primitive mesenchyme. The cuboid-navicular tarsal coalition is usually asymptomatic. Still, the clinician can discover it due to the onset of pain symptoms in the cuboid-navicular area during times of stress and exercise. The diagnosis of this coalition is possible with radiographic evidence. However, the diagnosis can be difficult as radiographic findings are often subtle. Advanced imaging studies may be necessary for further evaluation of the coalition. The clinician can initiate treatment in symptomatic cases. Treatment is usually conservative and involves measures such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroid injections, physical therapy, and/or orthotics.
