Peak expiratory flow measurement (peak flow) is a simple measure of the maximal flow rate that can be achieved during forceful expiration following full inspiration. Patients can learn the technique quickly, and the equipment necessary is affordableÂ and widely available. Major societies and advocacy groups have published patient-facing websites with clear videos that demonstrate proper technique, which can help clinicians electing to start home measurements for their patients.
