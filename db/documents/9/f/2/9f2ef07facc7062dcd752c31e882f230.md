Untreated chalazia can predispose patients to preseptal cellulitis, which can lead to lid disfiguration with progression. Large central chalazia can cause visual disturbances due to the effects of direct contact with the cornea. Upper lid chalazion increases astigmatism and corneal aberrations, especially at the peripheral cornea. This risk is significantly increased by chalazion greater than 5 mm in size. Therefore excision of these lesions should be considered.
