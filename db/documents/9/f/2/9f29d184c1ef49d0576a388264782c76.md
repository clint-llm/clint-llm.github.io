Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a clinical syndrome defined by massive proteinuria responsible for hypoalbuminemia, with resulting hyperlipidemia, edema, and various complications. It is caused by increased permeability through the damaged basement membrane in the renal glomerulus, especially infectious or thrombo-embolic. It results from an abnormality of glomerular permeability that may be primarily due to an intrinsic renal disease in the kidneys or secondary due to congenital infections, diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, neoplasia, or certain drug use.

The disorder can affect people of all ages. In most children, the first sign of nephrotic syndrome is facial swelling. Adults usually present with dependent edema.

The nephrotic syndrome could affect adults and children of both genders and any race. Also, it could occur in a typical form or with nephritic syndrome. The latter denotes glomerular inflammation leading to hematuria and impaired renal function.

The first indication of nephrotic syndrome in children is the swelling of the face which then progresses to the entire body. Adults may present with dependent edema. Other common features are fatigue and loss of appetite.
