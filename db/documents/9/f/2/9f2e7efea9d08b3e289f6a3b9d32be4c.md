Patients presenting for medical treatment after a sexual assault may be concerned about the possibility of acquiring an infectious disease. For many types of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), providers should administer appropriate therapy to prevent this transmission. Some of the STIs have become resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
