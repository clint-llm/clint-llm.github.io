Due to its ubiquity in the hospital setting, ultrasound or a bladder scanner should be considered an extension of the physical examination in the setting of postoperative urinary retention. Several studies have demonstrated the accuracy of volume measured by ultrasound when compared with catheterization, and the technology continues to improve.

If there is any concern that urinary issues were present to a significant degree before the surgery and the clinician did not order a basic metabolic panel preoperatively, a BMP or serum creatinine will identify any baseline renal disease due to chronic retention.
