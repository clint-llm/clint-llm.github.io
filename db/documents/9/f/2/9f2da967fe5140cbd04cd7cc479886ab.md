**Osteotomies of the Le Fort l Segment**

Osteotomies of the Le Fort l segment are common surgeries that are known to have low complication rates. The main complication includes ischemia which leads to avascular bone necrosis of the Le Fort l segment, which is rare. When completing this surgery, it is important to note that the ascending palatine artery, along with the ascending pharyngeal artery, are the main, and most common, blood supplies to the area.

**Complications Due to Physiologic Variations**

When the anterior and posterior branches of the ascending palatine artery are not present simultaneously, there can be differences in surgical risks. When the ascending branch is non-existent, and the posterior branch terminates close to the uvula, there is an increased risk of damaging the main blood supply to the soft palate.

**Cleft Palate Repair**

Knowledge of the soft palates arterial supply is important for surgical procedures of velopharyngeal incompetence and cleft palate. Cleft palates result in the arteries of the soft palate being displaced anterior-laterally due to the bone and muscle deformities.
