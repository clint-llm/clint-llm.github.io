After the site is selected and prepared, unsheath the catheter and place it in line with the vein. While keeping the bevel of the needle up and angled approximately 30 degrees from the surface of the skin, advance as the needle punctures the skin. Continue to advance in the direction of the vein until blood fills the chamber. This flashback indicates the needle has punctured the vein. Flatten the angle of the catheter to approximately 10 degrees above the skin. Then advance the catheter until it is placed in the vein. Once the catheter is sufficiently in the vein, retract the needle while keeping the catheter in place and hold pressure distally on the vein to prevent blood leakage.

AÂ transparent film dressing over the catheter hub is an ideal way to first secure the catheter in place. Attach a syringe if blood is to be sampled or IV tubing or other connectors if medications or fluids are to be administered. Flush the catheter with saline and monitor the catheter site to ensure the extravasation of fluid is not occurring and that the catheter is in its appropriate place. Gauze should be placed under the catheter hub to prevent physical compression or pain on the scalp and taped in the usual style of other peripheral IVs. Given the head's shape, location, and constant movement, stabilization of the scalp vein catheter should be attempted. One example is a simple plastic medicine cup cut and taped over the catheter.
