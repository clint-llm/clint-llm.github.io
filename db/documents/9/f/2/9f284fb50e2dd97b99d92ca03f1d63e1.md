On discharge, the patient should receive counsel that liver problems can happen with valproate overdose, which can be fatal. Parents need to know that children under two years are at higher risk of deadly liver problems.

Pregnant ladies should understand that valproate may cause severe birth defects, including spina bifida and neurodevelopmental disorders if taken during pregnancy, and hence it is prudent to use birth control to prevent pregnancy while on valproate.

Parents/caregivers should also understand that there is an increased risk of liver failure in patients with a mitochondrial disorder like Alpers–Huttenlocher syndrome.

The patient should also be counseled regarding the risk of pancreatitis with long-term therapy and hence patient should call the clinician or emergency department immediately if he/she develops symptoms such as acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever.

Following discharge, patients should receive clear instructions on drug dosage, frequency, and route of administration, as well as potential drug interactions.
