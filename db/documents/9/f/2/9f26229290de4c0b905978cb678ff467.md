The primary organ system involved in the usage of Boyle’s law is the respiratory system. The human body brings air into the lungs by negative pressure. At baseline, the thoracic cavity is in static equilibrium with an intrapleural pressure near -5 cmH2O. During inspiration, there is a contraction of inspiratory muscles (diaphragm, external intercostal muscles; additional muscles such as the scalene and sternocleidomastoid can take part under specific circumstances) that increases intrathoracic volume. Due to the combined motion of the lungs and the chest wall, the lungs will begin to expand as the thorax expands during inspiration. According to Boyle’s law, as the volume increases, the pressure must decrease; therefore, as the intrapleural volume increases, the intrapleural pressure decreases to about -8 cm H2O occurs at end inspiration.

At baseline (rest), the alveolar pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure (0 cm H2O), and during inspiration, this pressure will go to -1cmH2O as the volume expands within the alveoli. When the alveolar pressure drops below the atmospheric pressure, air will flow into the lungs for gas exchange.

When the inspiratory muscles relax, the volume within the thorax will decrease; thus, the pressure increases and forces out alveolar air back into the atmosphere. With inspiration: lung volume increases, intrapleural pressure decreases. With expiration: lung volume decreases, intrapleural pressure increases.
