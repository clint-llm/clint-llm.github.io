Though in an appropriate clinical setting, most cases of this pattern comprise an acute occlusion of the LAD artery, it should be highlighted that similar changes in repolarization can be present in other clinical scenarios.

Among these, hyperkalemia should be considered. Importantly, in this entity, a different clinical presentation, as well as the fact that T waves tend to be narrow and peaked (presenting a sharp apex), should be noted.
