First-degree AV block is generallyÂ asymptomatic and therefore well-tolerated. Studies show that as patients with this condition age, they become more likely to develop associated rhythm disturbances such as atrial fibrillation or high-degree AV blocks. Therefore, close observation of patients with known first-degree AV block is indicated as they advance in age or if they develop coronary artery disease, heart failure, valvular disease, or another potentially-complicating condition.
