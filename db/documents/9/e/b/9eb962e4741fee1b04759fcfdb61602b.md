The definitive treatment for ventricular fibrillation is electrical defibrillation. This is most often performed using an automated external defibrillator (AED). If an AED is not readily available for defibrillation, brain death is likely to occur in less than 10 minutes. CPR is a means of providing artificial circulation and ventilation until defibrillation can be performed. Conventional manual CPR, combining chest compressions with rescue breathing, can provide up to 33% of normal cardiac output and oxygenation when done properly.
