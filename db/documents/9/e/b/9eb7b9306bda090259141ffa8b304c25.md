Presbycusis refers to bilateral age-related hearing loss. In literal terms, presbycusis means "old hearing" or "elder hearing."

During the normal hearing, sound, in the form of air vibration, is captured by the funnel-shaped external ear and is directed to the tympanic membrane. This causes the tympanic membrane to vibrate at a specific frequency and amplitude. This movement is amplified by three small bones in the middle ear: the malleus, incus, and stapes. From there, the signal proceeds as vibrations that are transmitted through the fluid within the inner ear to the cochlea. In the cochlea, receptors known as hair cells transform the information encoded in the vibrations into a neurologic signal which travels to the auditory cortex via the cochlear nerve.
