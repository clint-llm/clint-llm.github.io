Diagnostic tests typically performed in the case of dark urine starts with a urine dipstick. The urine dipstick test turns out positive for heme in these patients. It is followed by microscopic analysis of the urine, which reveals no red blood cells. This points to the presence of myoglobin in the urine. There are quantitative and more precise tests available to measure myoglobin in the urine, like immunohistochemistry, spectrophotometry, and radioimmunoassay, but they are not commonly required in clinical practice. Creatine kinase levels are also measured, and its high level in blood confirms muscle injury as the cause of myoglobinuria.

Baseline studies of blood electrolytes and renal function tests are also done as these patients are at increased risk for hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury.

The patient's medication history should be reviewed to find out if they are taking any medication which is related to rhabdomyolysis.

Later on, further investigations are carried out to determine the cause of rhabdomyolysis. Some of these investigations include urine toxicology screen, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) for inflammatory myopathies like dermatomyositis and polymyositis.
