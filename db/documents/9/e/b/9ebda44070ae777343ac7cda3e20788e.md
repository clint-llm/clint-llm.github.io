Delayed diagnosis of myelomeningocele is associated with poor prognosis and lower rates of survival. It accounts for approximately 50% of infant death in underdeveloped countries. Moreover, delayed and neglected management has links to various complications such as dependence, immobility, functional disability, muscle weakness, bladder, and bowel dysfunction.

According to a study was done in Washington, United States, the survival rates have increased from 60 % to 90% in the 1960s to 1985, respectively. The increased rate is attributable to the improvements and advances in medicine and surgery throughout the past years.

Nevertheless, the presence of hydrocephalus can influence the long-term outcomes in patients with myelomeningocele. The same study showed that patients with a shunt had a survival rate of 75% at the age of 34. However, unshunted individuals had a survival rate of 94% at the age of 34.

Bowel dysfunction was associated with a lower score of health-related quality of life than bladder dysfunction in patients with spina bifida.

Renal failure remains one of the most common causes of mortality in patients with spina bifida. Hence, to prevent the occurrence of neurogenic bladder and renal damage, a full urological examination should be obtained after birth. The examination is done by assessing the pelvic floor muscle activity and sustaining low bladder pressure. After surgical repair, all patients should have a clean intermittent catheterization, followed by antimuscarinic therapy and low dose chemoprophylaxis. These will help to maintain low bladder pressure, avoiding overactive detrusor muscle activity, and preventing the risk of urinary tract infections.
