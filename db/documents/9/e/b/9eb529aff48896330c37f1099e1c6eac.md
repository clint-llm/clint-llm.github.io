Interdisciplinary teamwork is important with fertility preservation. In cases where a patient is diagnosed with cancer, collaboration amongst the oncologist and reproductive specialists is key. The American Society of Clinical Oncology released an updated guideline in 2013 stating that oncologists should address the possibility of infertility with their patients before cancer therapy is initiated and should refer the patient to reproductive endocrinologists.

In cases of elective fertility preservation, the reproductive endocrinologist needs to collaborate with the primary care physician. It is also important for the financial department to determine the funding for the patient through insurance or organizations that donate to patients with a diagnosis of cancer.
