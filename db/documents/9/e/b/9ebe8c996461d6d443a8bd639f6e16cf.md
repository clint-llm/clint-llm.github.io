Treatment for neonatal MIS-C is largely extrapolated from the evidence from the treatment of adults and older children.

Studies have shown that the combination of IVIG and steroids is more effective than IVIG alone. Inotropic support may be required in cases of cardiovascular dysfunction. Biological agents such as tocilizumab, infliximab, anakinra, and interferons have been used for children and neonates with refractory disease unresponsive to corticosteroids and IVIG. However, data supporting the use of such medications is sparse.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics are mostly used during presentation due to the clinical presentation mimicking sepsis. Antibiotic treatment should be discontinued once the diagnosis is confirmed and the blood cultures are resulted to be negative. Thromboprophylaxis is indicated in cases of high pro-thrombotic risk factors.

The ideal treatment approach must be tailored based on the clinical presentation. More clinical trials are necessary to study the efficacy of various treatment modalities. Long-term follow-up is necessary to elucidate potential sequelae.
