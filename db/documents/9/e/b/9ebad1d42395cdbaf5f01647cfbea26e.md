**Phenoxybenzamine in Pregnancy and Nursing Mothers**

Pregnancy Considerations

- It is unknown whether or not phenoxybenzamine can affect reproductive capacity.

- According to the FDA, phenoxybenzamine is pregnancy risk category C

- It is unknown whether phenoxybenzamine can cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman.

Breast-Feeding Considerations

- It is unknown whether or not phenoxybenzamine is excreted in breast milk.

- There are potentially serious adverse reactions that may occur in nursing infants. The recommended decision is either discontinuing nursing or discontinuing the drug, accounting for the importance of ongoing therapy to the mother.

**Cardiovascular Monitoring**

- Blood pressures need continual monitoring twice daily in outpatient settings with patients in both seated (based on age and comorbid disease; the target is low-normal, less than 120/80 mmHg) and standing positions (based on age and comorbid disease; target with systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg), due to potential extreme hypotension and tachycardia. Patients with marked cerebral and coronary disease may suffer from serious adverse effects when treated with phenoxybenzamine.

- After alpha-blockade is initiated (within 1 to 3 days), patients are encouraged to start a diet high in sodium (>5000 mg daily) because of volume contraction and orthostasis induced by catecholamines and alpha-adrenergic blockade, respectively. Although encouraged, a high degree of volume expansion may be contraindicated in patients suffering from renal insufficiency or congestive heart failure.

- Typically two to three days preoperatively, after achieving an adequate alpha-adrenergic blockade, beta-adrenergic blockade is initiated. Never start beta-adrenergic blockade first due to severe vasodilatory effects from peripheral beta-adrenergic receptors and unopposed stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors. This effect can lead to a further elevation in blood pressure.[

- Chronic catecholamine excess may result in cardiomyopathy, which may become evident with beta-adrenergic blockade imitation and result in acute pulmonary edema. Proceed with caution and lose dose with administering beta-adrenergic blockade.
