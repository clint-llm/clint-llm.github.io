Hantaviruses are single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses in the Bunyavirales order. Infection occurs via inhalation of aerosolized excretions from infected rodents. These viruses are associated with both hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) caused by hantaviruses of the New World and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by hantaviruses of the Old World. HCPS, also known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), is a febrile illness characterized by respiratory failure with diffuse interstitial edema. The illness has three distinct phases: the prodrome, cardiopulmonary phase, and the convalescent phase.

The etiologic agent causing HFRS was first described in 1978 and named after the Hantan river in South Korea. This virus caused Korean hemorrhagic fever among United Nations troops during the Korean War between 1951 and 1953.
