Superimposed precipitating factors cause thyroid storm in patients with diagnosed or undiagnosed hyperthyroidism. It is more common with Graves disease but can occur with other etiologies of hyperthyroidism, such as toxic multinodular goiter and toxic thyroid adenoma.

The precipitating factors are:

- Abrupt discontinuation of antithyroid medicine

- Thyroid surgery

- Non-thyroid surgery

- Trauma

- Acute illnesses like infections including Covid-19, diabetic ketoacidosis, acute myocardial infarction, cardiovascular accident, cardiac failure, and drug reactions

- Parturition

- Recent use of Iodinated contrast medium

- Radioiodine therapy (rare)

- Burns

- Stroke or traumatic brain injury

- Medication side effects, e.g., amiodarone, anesthetics, salicylates

- Hyperemesis gravidarum in pregnancy
