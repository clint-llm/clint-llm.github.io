Tobramycin belongs to the class of broad-spectrum antibiotics known as aminoglycosides. Streptomycin, the first aminoglycoside, was first isolated from Streptomyces griseus and introduced into clinical use in 1944; this led to the successful development of others in its category.

These drugs work synergistically with beta-lactams to penetrate the cell walls of aerobic gram-negative bacteria.

**Indications**

The FDA has approved systemic administration (intramuscular or intravenous) of tobramycin to treat various reinfections caused by susceptible organisms, mainly gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and non­ penicillinase-producing strains). Gram-negative bacteria include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and species of Proteus, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Providencia, and Citrobacter.

Infections caused by organisms susceptible to tobramycin can vary in nature and include septicemia, lower respiratory tract infections, central nervous system (CNS) infections like meningitis, intra-abdominal infections, skin and subcutaneous tissue infections, osteomyelitis, and complicated urinary tract infections.

Inhaled tobramycin is FDA-approved to manage cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged six or older with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.****CF guidelines recommend the chronic use of inhaled tobramycin in patients with CF to improve lung function, reduce exacerbations, and improve quality of life in patients with CF.

Tobramycin for ophthalmic use is FDA-approved to treat external ocular infections caused by susceptible organisms in adults and children.

Off-label use of tobramycin includes intraventricular administration in managing intraventricular catheter-associated central nervous system infections.
