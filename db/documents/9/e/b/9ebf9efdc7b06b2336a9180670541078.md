Preventing the spread of contamination from the medical provider to the patient and vice versa is essential. When first approaching the patient, the medical professional must verify the patient's identity and review their chart. This process will allow the provider to give the proper treatments and make changes based on the individual's needs. To maintain cleanliness, health care providers should always disinfect their hands before touching the patient. If needed, the provider can wear gloves for various procedures.

A clear and strong line of communication is needed between the health care provider and the patient. Patients can be embarrassed to discuss their hygiene needs, particularly when it comes to discussing elimination. Openly discussing these topics with patients can help them feel more comfortable and give the health care provider a detailed view of their needs.

A lack of hygiene can result in a multitude of adverse effects, such as hospital-acquired infections.

Besides the physical act of assisting with hygiene, the medical provider's attitude can influence a patient's hygiene behaviors. A study found that a caregiver's attitude towards the elderly's ability to eliminate using a toilet had a substantial effect on the patient's ability to complete toilet elimination.
