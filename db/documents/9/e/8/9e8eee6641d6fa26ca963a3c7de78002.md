The patient history should denote the mechanism of injury, as most patients recall the specific incident that led to the injury.

The physical examination may demonstrate swelling and ecchymosis over the anterior chest wall, axilla, and arm. Further inspection may reveal an asymmetric medial prominence of the muscle belly or a thinned-out, webbed appearance of the anterior axilla. Palpation may elicit tenderness over the insertion along the axillary fold, which may itself be thinned, hollowed, or completely lost. This finding can be accentuated by abducting the arm to 90 degrees.
