Thyroglossal duct cyst is managed by an interprofessional team that consists of a pediatrician, primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and a surgeon. The exact incidence of thyroglossal duct cyst remains debatable, but one fact is certain; it is more common in children compared to adults. It usually presents as a midline neck swelling and the standard treatment is the Sistrunk procedure. This procedure is associated with good outcomes and low recurrence rate of 3-5%. Very few complications have been reported in the literature, and most children have no residual sequelae.
