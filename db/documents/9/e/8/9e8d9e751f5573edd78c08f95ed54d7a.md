Aretz et al. proposed the Dallas criteria in 1986 for the histopathologic diagnosis of acute myocarditis, which requires evidence of inflammatory cellular infiltrate and myocyte necrosis for a diagnosis of acute myocarditis; whereas borderline myocarditis describes an inflammatory infiltrate in the absence of myocyte necrosis.

Some types of myocarditis have very characteristic morphologies. Aschoff nodules with central fibrinoid necrosis and Anitschkow cells are the hallmark findings of rheumatic carditis, typically seen in perivascular regions. Patients with toxoplasma myocarditis may have pseudocysts containing Toxoplasma tachyzoites in the non-inflamed regions of the myocardium.
