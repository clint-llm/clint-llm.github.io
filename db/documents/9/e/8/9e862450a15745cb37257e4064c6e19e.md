The following are differential diagnoses to be considered in patients presenting with signs and symptoms of coronary artery fistula:

- Patent ductus arteriosus

- Arteriovenous malformation

- Acute myocardial ischemia

- Congestive heart failure

- Arrhythmia

- Cardiac tamponade

Although these are some of the conditions that could also be presenting signs of a hemodynamically stable coronary artery fistula, it is important to exclude other more serious underlying etiologies such as a myocardial infarction, secondary to thrombosis, and primary ventricular arrhythmias.
