Cryptosporidium can persist in the environment as an oocyst that contains four sporozoites, which are the infectious form of the parasite. Following exposure, the incubation period ranges from two to ten days, with an average of seven days. Once ingested, the oocyst travels to the small intestine, and excystation releases the sporozoites. The sporozoites settle within the walls of the small intestine and undergo asexual multiplication within extracytoplasmic parasitophorous vacuoles. Each cell reproduces in massive quantities, producing both thick-walled oocysts that can be shed into the stool and persist in the environment. The cells also produce thin-walled oocysts that can auto-infect the patient. This auto-infection is thought to be responsible for the increase in the severity of disease seen in immunocompromised patients. Symptoms are caused by three proposed mechanisms: 1) infiltration of the lamina propria by inflammatory cells; 2) increased epithelial permeability, villous atrophy, and cell death; and 3) malabsorption due to loss of intestinal architecture. Cryptosporidium can modify the host immune response to avoid apoptosis of the infected cell, allowing for persistence of infection.
