Interprofessional care for a patient undergoing bowel preparation is vital to ensure better preparation and colonoscopy outcomes. An interprofessional team consistsÂ of a primary care physician, gastroenterologist, nurses, and a pharmacist. With a team-based approach, a proper bowel preparation regimen can be selected based on the patient's medical history and potential side effects. A single dose versus a split-dose regimen can be selected to accommodate the patient's lifestyle.

One study found that the utility of telephone reeducation about bowel preparation the day before a colonoscopy significantly improved the quality of bowel preparation and the rate of polyp detection.
