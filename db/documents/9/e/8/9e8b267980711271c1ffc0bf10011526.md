Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a clinical syndrome defined by massive proteinuria (greater than 40 mg/m^2 per hour) responsible for hypoalbuminemia (less than 30 g/L), with resulting hyperlipidemia, edema, and various complications. It is caused by increased permeability through the damaged basement membrane in the renal glomerulus. It results from an abnormality of glomerular permeability that may be primary with a disease-specific to the kidneys or secondary to congenital infections, diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, neoplasia, or certain drug use. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation of nephrotic syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of nephrotic syndrome.
- Review the presentation of patients with nephrotic syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for nephrotic syndrome.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with nephrotic syndrome.
