**Climate Change**

Effects of climate change are evident in water quality, air quality, agriculture, sanitation, and habitable spaces, to name a few. It is also evident in tribal health, vulnerable populations, and mental wellness. The public health community plays a critical role in educating the mass population about the effects of climate change on health through efforts that include clean and renewable energy and initiatives. These include climate justice and partnerships that increase awareness through climate and health meetings at the local, state, national, and international levels, such as the “the Paris Agreement.”

Many proponents of climate change help provide education on the effects of climate change seen in the most vulnerable populations made up of the poor, communities of color, young children, and individuals with chronic illness as the elderly (American Public Health Association 2017).

**Environmental Health**

Public health creates and improves environmental health, justice, and awareness to help maintain the healthiest communities and nations. Certain models are used to advance the field of environmental health through the following initiatives:

- Improvement of population health through healthy living

- Promoting health equity and environmental justice across places

- Providing a voice for environmental health practitioners

American Public Health Association’s Environmental Portfolio is comprised of three points:

Health Community Design

- Transportation and Health Tool

- Active Transportation

- Smart Growth

- Healthy Housing

- Food Systems

- Consumer Product Safety

Natural Environment

- Climate Change

- Chemical Safety

- Vector-borne Disease

- Water Quality/Safety

- Air Quality

- Fracking

Partnerships and Systems

- National EH Partnership Council

- National Environmental and Public Health Think Tank

- EH Coalition

- Preparedness Community

- Improving EH Systems

- EH Messaging

The above portfolio helps public health officials bring national attention to environmental health issues. It helps promote sound policies that help protect the health, well-being, and quality of life of the public in at-risk and affected communities.
