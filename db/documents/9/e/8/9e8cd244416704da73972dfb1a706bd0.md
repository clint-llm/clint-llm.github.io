The clinical progression of RBD is dependent on the etiology. Idiopathic RBD and RBD associated with neurodegenerative diseases are often slowly progressive. At the same time, medication-induced RBD may occur acutely and improve upon discontinuing the medication. In RBD related to neurodegenerative disorders, the prognosis is dependent on the underlying condition. Amongst those with the confirmed diagnosis of neurodegenerative condition due to an underlying synucleinopathy, it is estimated that the correlation with RBD is significantly high: 30 to 50% of Parkinson disease, 75% of Lewy-body dementia, and 70% to 90% of multiple system atrophy.

Once RBD has been confirmed, discussing the associated neurodegenerative risks is appropriate if individual patient circumstances are considered, and patients are closely monitored for neurodegenerative disorder findings. In these patients, early introduction for neuroprotective therapies
