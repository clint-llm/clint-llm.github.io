**National Comprehensive Cancer Network's 2020 Guidelines for Management of Osteosarcoma (Version 1.2020)**

- **OSTEO-1 (Low-Grade Osteosarcoma, No Metastasis)**
- Intramedullary and surface

- Wide excision alone (no neoadjuvant chemotherapy)

- If postsurgical pathology demonstrates low-grade features, then no adjuvant chemotherapy
- If postsurgical pathology demonstrates high-grade features, consider adjuvant chemotherapy




-  Periosteal

- Neoadjuvant chemotherapy then perform a wide excision

- If postsurgical pathology demonstrates is consistent with biopsy (low grade features only) then no adjuvant chemotherapy
- If postsurgical pathology demonstrates high-grade features, consider adjuvant chemotherapy

- **OSTEO-2 (High-Grade Intramedullary or Surface Osteosarcoma, No Metastasis)**
- Neoadjuvant chemotherapy then restage the lesion

- If restaging suggests the lesion is resectable, then perform a wide excision

- Positive margins

- If there was a good response to preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy (less than10% viable tumor on postsurgical pathology), then continue the same neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen and consider additional surgical resection +/- radiation therapy
- If there was an inadequate response to preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy (greater than 10% viable tumor on postsurgical pathology), then continue the same neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen or consider a new regimen and consider additional surgical resection +/- radiation therapy


- Negative margins

- If there was a good response to preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy (less than 10% viable tumor on postsurgical pathology), then continue the same neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen. No further resection is required.
- If there was an inadequate response to preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy (greater than 10% viable tumor on postsurgical pathology), then continue the same neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen or consider a new regimen. No further resection is required.






- If restaging suggests the lesion is unresectable, then continue chemotherapy and consider radiation therapy.

- **OSTEO-3 (Any Grade With Metastasis at Presentation)**
- If metastases are resectable (pulmonary, visceral, or skeletal), then perform metastasectomy and follow OSTEO-2 guidelines.
- If metastases are unresectable, then consider chemotherapy and radiation therapy, after which the primary site requires reassessment for local control.

- **OSTEO-4 (Follow-up & Surveillance)**
- Surveillance schedule

- Every three months for post-op years 1 and 2
- Every four months in post-op year 3
- Every six months in post-op years 4 and 5
- Yearly for post-op years six and beyond


- Surveillance visit should include

- Physical exam with assessment of function
- Imaging of post-op site and chest


- Consider PET/CT or bone scan
- CBC +/- additional laboratory tests as clinically indicated (e.g., alkaline phosphatase levels)

- If a relapse is detected, the following are the guidelines to follow:

- Chemotherapy +/- resection (if possible)

- Response to these treatments should have an evaluation via:

- Radiographs of the original tumor site
- CT or MRI (both with contrast) of the site of relapse
- CT of the chest to assess for pulmonary lesions


- Good response to treatment:

- Surveillance (restart OSTEO-4 guidelines)


- Poor response/progression of the disease:

- Resection (if possible)
- Clinical trial
- Palliative radiation
- Best supportive care

**Extraskeletal Osteosarcoma**

- Follow the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's guidelines for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma.
