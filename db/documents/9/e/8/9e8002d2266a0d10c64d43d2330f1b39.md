Renal infarction is the compromise of arterial blood supply to the kidney resulting in cell necrosis and loss of renal function. It has several causes, such as thrombo-emboli originating from the heart or in situ thrombosis. Patients typically present with flank pain; some may have microscopic or frank hematuria. Patients may have a history of atrial fibrillation, where cardiac thrombi can dislodge and eventually infarct the renal artery or one of its branches. Interventional procedures like angiography can result in embolic renal infarctions by causing an injury to the endothelium or dislodging an atherosclerotic plaque. Complications involve loss of renal function, which becomes evident in the form of declining GFR and increasing creatinine. This activity describes the investigation and management options of renal infarction by the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of renal infarction.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of renal infarction.
- Describe the various management options in a case of renal infarction.
- Outline the follow-up care of patients with renal infarction.
