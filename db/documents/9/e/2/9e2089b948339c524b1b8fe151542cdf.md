Precocious puberty is becoming increasingly common owing to a multitude of factors such as genetics, lifestyle changes, and exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals. It is one of the common conditions encountered in pediatric endocrinology practice. It raises a lot of concerns and uncertainties in parents and children. This condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an endocrinologist, pediatrician, nurse, surgeon (if involving masses or tumors) and a mental health counselor.

Precocious puberty, in its various forms, requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, counseling professionals, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level V]
