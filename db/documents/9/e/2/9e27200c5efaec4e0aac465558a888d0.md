Common manifestations and complications of multiple myeloma can include hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, infection, skeletal lesions, and anemia. Less common complications include venous thromboembolism and hyperviscosity syndrome.

Hypercalcemia is caused by bone demineralization and may be asymptomatic or cause anorexia, fatigue, constipation, polydipsia, polyuria, confusion, or stupor. Treatment depends on clinical severity and the rapidity of installation of hypercalcemia. As noted previously, it can include hydration, glucocorticoids, bisphosphonates, calcitonin, and/or hemodialysis.

The development of renal insufficiency can be acute or chronic. A variety of etiologic mechanisms may be involved, including those related to the excess production of monoclonal light chains (light-chain cast nephropathy), deposition of intact light chains causing the nephrotic syndrome, light chain amyloidosis, hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia, or dehydration.

Myeloma bone disease is thought to result from overexpression of RANKL by bone marrow stroma. RANKL activates osteoclasts, which resorb bone. Bone breakdown leads to calcium release into the blood, leading to hypercalcemia and symptoms of kidney failure that may develop acutely or chronically. It can manifest as severe bone pain, pathological fractures, and even spinal cord compression.

Another important complication that can occur is an increased risk of infection. Infection risk seems to be highest over the first 3 to 4 months of induction therapy. Factors contributing to the increased risk of infection include impaired lymphocyte function, suppression of normal plasma cell function, hypogammaglobulinemia, and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The most common infections are pneumonia and urinary tract infections, mostly with organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli. Early identification is important to assure timely treatment and infection resolution.

Neuropathy is also commonly seen. It can be secondary to the plasma cell dyscrasia itself, direct compression, or light chain deposition. However, it can also be worsened or even caused by treatment regimens including thalidomide, bortezomib, or vincristine.

Also significant is the increased risk for thrombosis. This can be secondary to the patient's comorbidities, tumor/disease-related factors, and immunomodulatory drugs, including thalidomide or lenalidomide. Practitioners should have a low threshold for workup or evaluation for any signs or symptoms of venous or arterial thrombus.

A rare side effect is hyperviscosity which can have severe complications. It typically presents as oronasal bleeding, blurred vision, retinal hemorrhage, seizure, other neurologic symptoms, confusion, dyspnea, and heart failure. This is considered an emergency, and plasmapheresis should be initiated immediately to promptly relieve symptoms.
