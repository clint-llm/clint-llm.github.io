Surgical considerations are important and need to evaluate anatomical variations of the upper extremity.

The double tendon of the EI leads to an increased volume of the fourth dorsal tunnel that may lead to clinical symptoms. Surgical excision to equalize the thickness of the medial slips of the two tendons relieves mechanical stress and may correct the symptomatology.

If the flexor digitorum superficialis has two muscle bellies, then the increased mass may lead to clinical symptoms in the anterior forearm. Many previously reported cases received surgical treatment but depending on the level of symptoms; they may be treated non-operatively.

The extensor digitorum brevis manus anatomical variant can be treated with either decompression or excision surgery. Recent studies have shown that the excisional method of complete removal of the anatomical variant proved beneficial because it is the most effective treatment. Excision leads to improved outcomes compared with decompression.
