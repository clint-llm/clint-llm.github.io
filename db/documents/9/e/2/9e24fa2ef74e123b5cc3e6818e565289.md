Ablative laser resurfacing represents a safe and effective technique associated with a low-risk profile and a high satisfaction rate.

Complications are associated with all types of laser therapy, includingÂ full-field and fractional lasers. Fractional laser resurfacing tends to produce a reduced severity and frequency of complications, including:

- Persistent erythema

- Hyperpigmentation/hypopigmentation

- Infections (viral, bacterial, fungal)

- Scarring

- Acneiform eruptions

- Milia

- Ectropion
