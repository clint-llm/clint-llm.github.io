The exact mechanism of CRS is not well understood. CRS is a systemic inflammatory response that occurs during the CAR-T activation and expansion in the human body.

ICANS is thought to be related to myeloid cell activation, including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) mediated stimulation of monocytes after CAR-T and monocyte-derived IL-1 and IL-6.

The costimulatory domain is a component of CAR-T necessary for T cell activation and expansion of the CAR-T cells.
