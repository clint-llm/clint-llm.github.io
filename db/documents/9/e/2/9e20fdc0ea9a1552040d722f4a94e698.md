Abrasions are one of the most common physical injuries. While many of them are simple and treated at home, healthcare workers will inevitably encounter patients with abrasions. They are usually associated with other injuries. The presence of abrasions should be appropriately investigated and managed clinically and medicolegally. The initial assessment may be by emergency medical technicians, trauma nurses, and clinicians. Emergency department and ambulatory care nurses provide direct care and educate patients. Pharmacists are often called upon to counsel regarding over-the-counter and prescription medications and the use of these treatments. [Level 5]
