**Stages of Lyme disease**

- Stage 1: Localized disease associated with erythema migrans and flu-like symptoms; duration 1 to 30 days

- Stage 2: Early disseminated disease with malaise, pain, and flu-like symptoms; may affect the neurological, ocular, and musculoskeletal organs; duration 3 to 10 weeks

- Stage 3: Late or chronic disease chiefly affects the joints, muscles, and nerves and may last months or years. Lyme arthritis is a hallmark of this stage.

- The occurrence of post-treatment Lyme syndrome is debatable.
