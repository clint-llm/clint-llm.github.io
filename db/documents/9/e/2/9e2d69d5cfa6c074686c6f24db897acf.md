Complications depend on the severity of the head injury and can vary from mild cognitive impairment to seizures, long-term neurological deficits, and even death. Systemic complications may also occur, particularly in the severe TBI cohort secondary to immobility, and may include pneumonia, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolus, among others. If patients cannot be successfully weaned from a ventilator, they may require temporary or long-term airway and nutritional support via a tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube, respectively.
