The GAA gene on chromosome 17q25.3 synthesizes acid alfa-glucosidase, which is a lysosomal enzyme catalyzing alpha 1,4 and alpha 1,6 linkages of lysosomal glycogen. Mutations in such a gene inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, lead to unstable mRNA translating into a deficient or null product.
