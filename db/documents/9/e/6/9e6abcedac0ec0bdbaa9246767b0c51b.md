In all mammals, the vascular supply of a limb develops from branches of the dorsal root of the umbilical artery, which forms a primitive axial artery, the ischiadic artery. This artery is present early in limb development. A second developmental artery arises later in development, traversing the pelvis and proximal thigh. This later artery will form the external iliac artery, the femoral artery, and the inferior epigastric artery.
