Airway suctioning refers to the collective measures that are used for clearing the airway of a patient. It involves suctioning, clearing secretions, and maintaining the patency of the airway. It is of particular importance for patients with mechanical ventilators, endotracheal tube (ET) intubations, tracheostomies, or other airway adjuncts. Clearance of airway secretions is a normal process and is critical to the prevention of respiratory infections, atelectasis, and preservation of airway patency. Patients on mechanical ventilation and intubated patients are at risk of increased secretions as they are sedated, supine, and have mechanical adjuncts that prevent spontaneous clearance of secretions. Suctioning can help maintain and establish the gas exchange, adequate oxygenation, and alveolar ventilation. Suctioning can be performed through an endotracheal tube, a tracheostomy tube, the mouth, or the nose.

There are two separate suctioning techniques, namely the closed and open system. Basic principles of suctioning are the same, and care should be incorporated during suctioning. Closed suctioning includes an inline suctioning system.

There is no consensus on the time interval for suctioning airways. It depends on the clinical picture; such as the age of the patient, the associated risk factors, and the ease of obtaining adjunct airway equipment in case of disruption or loss of the airway. Studies of newborns did not show increased risks between 6- or 12-hour intervals.
