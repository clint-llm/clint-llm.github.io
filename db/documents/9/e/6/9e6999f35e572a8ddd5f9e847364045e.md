The differential diagnosis for trochanteric bursitis includes Femoroacetabular impingement, fracture of the greater trochanter, femoral neck, or intertrochanteric hip fracture, a hamstring avulsion injury, or simple muscle strain or sprain.

Gluteal medius tear presents as lateral hip pain that exacerbates with prolonged sitting, climbing stairs, and walking. The pain is usually associated with Trendelenburg gait. Trochanter bursitis pain increases while sitting with the cross legs. Both conditions are painful while lying on the affected site.

Snapping hip syndrome is associated with pain on the lateral side of the trochanter and the feeling of catching and "giving way" while climbing stairs and running. Palpation of the snapping over the greater trochanter while flexing the hip joint confirms the diagnosis.
