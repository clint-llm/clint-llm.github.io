The procedure must be described to the patient, with sufficient time provided to understand and weigh the risks and benefits, following which informed consent is sought. A history, including current medication and allergies, and ophthalmic examination is performed prior to the procedure. Many patients who are candidates for this procedure are older and have comorbid conditions and advice should be given to them regarding their anti-diabetic, anti-thrombotic, and other medication. Many health care organizations have guidelines, protocols or instructions regarding such medication and stopping/continuingÂ them pre-operatively that patients can follow. Phone numbers should be given to contact in case there are any post-operative issues, and transport arranged with a next of kin for care following the procedure.
