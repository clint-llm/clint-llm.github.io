Pregabalin is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, spinal cord injury, and postherpetic neuralgia. Pregabalin is FDA-approved for the treatment of fibromyalgia. Pregabalin also has FDA approval as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in adults with epilepsy. Off-label uses include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, insomnia, and chronic pain conditions not otherwise approved by the FDA. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for interprofessional team members.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of pregabalin.
- Describe the adverse effects of pregabalin.
- Outline the important dosage considerations of pregabalin.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients prescribed pregabalin.
