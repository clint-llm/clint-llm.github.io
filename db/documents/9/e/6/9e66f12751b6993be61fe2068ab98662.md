There is a paucity of data for outcomes of injections with medial epicondylitis, and much of the data used to guide treatment has been extrapolated from studies for lateral epicondylitis. Despite a lack of inflammation, corticosteroids are likely effective by providing relief of pain of neurogenic origin. Corticosteroids are effective in improving short-term pain relief.Â  However, there is a high recurrence of pain and lack of benefit demonstrated at one year compared to observation and physical therapy. Therefore, corticosteroid injections should only be performed concurrently with other non-operative therapies.
