The incidence and prevalence of splanchnic vein thrombosis are on the rise. This pattern is partially attributed to the widespread use of computed tomography that will pick up this disease as a confirmation of clinical judgment or sometimes incidentally. One study in Sweden noted an increase from 2 to 2.7 per 100,000 between the 1970s and 2000s.

The most common leading cause of portal vein thrombosis is liver cirrhosis. Among patients with cirrhosis, ultrasound has shown a prevalence of 5 to 24 percent for portal vein thrombosis. In contrast, the autopsy of patients who died with cirrhosis has reported a prevalence of 6 to 64 percent. The prevalence is unknown in non-cirrhotic patients.

Chronic pancreatitis is the most common reason for splenic vein thrombosis. Splenic vein thrombosis is reported in 11 percent in one study and 5 to 22 percent of patients with chronic pancreatitis in another study.

Some studies have shown that acute mesenteric venous thrombosis is the cause of acute mesenteric ischemia in 2 to 10 percent of the cases.

Hepatic venous thrombosis is more predominant in women in their 30s or 40s in non-Asian countries. One study in Italy showed the incidence rate of 2.2 and 2.0 per million in females and males, respectively. In contrast, hepatic venous thrombosis is more common in men than in women in Asian countries.
