# Introduction

The humerus is the largest bone of the upper extremity and defines the human brachium (arm). It articulates proximally with the glenoid via the glenohumeral (GH) joint and distally with the radius and ulna at the elbow joint. The most proximal portion of the humerus is the head of the humerus, which forms a ball and socket joint with the glenoid cavity on the scapula.

Continuing distally is the cylindrical-shaped shaft of the humerus, which contains a deltoid tubercle on its lateral aspect and a radial groove on its posterior aspect (also referred to as the spiral groove).

# Structure and Function

The humeral head articulates with the glenoid fossa of the scapula and forms the glenohumeral joint, a synovial ball and socket joint.

Articulation of the capitellum and trochlea of the humerus with the head of the radius bone and trochlear notch of the ulna forms the elbow joint, a synovial hinge joint. This joint is stabilized by the ulnar (medial) collateral ligament and radial (lateral) collateral ligament complexes.

- Anterior oblique band: the strongest and most significant stabilizer to valgus stress forces

- Courses from the medial epicondyle of the humerus to the sublime tubercle at the proximal ulna

- Posterior oblique band: tightest in flexion; the posterior component of the UCL demonstrates the most significant change in tension from flexion to extension range of motion (ROM) at the elbow.

- Transverse ligament: contributes minimal, if any, to elbow joint stability.

An olecranon bursa exists here to reduce friction during movement as well. This joint allows only extension and flexion. Elbow movement is principally the result of the biceps brachii, coracobrachialis, and triceps muscles.

# Embryology

As one of the many long bones within the appendicular skeleton, the humerus develops via endochondral ossification.**,**a relatively tiny cartilage model is laid down by mesenchymal cells that form cartilage secreting chondrocytes. Second, in the center of the cartilage template (ossification center), there is chondrocyte hypertrophy and secretion factors such as alkaline phosphatase to promote calcification of that cartilage. This action forms a blockade of nutrients and causes chondrocyte death. However, before dying, these cells also secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to support angiogenesis towards the interior of this calcifying cartilage. Meanwhile, under the influence of Indian hedgehog homolog (IHH) protein, cells outside in the perichondrium differentiate into osteoblasts and form a layer of bone surrounding the center of cartilage known as the bony collar.****

As time progresses, a central area of dead chondrocytes develops, with little pieces of calcified cartilage left behind, a shell of bone around the center, and the vascular supply going around the interior. Vascular supply brings into the interior mesenchymal cells that differentiate into more osteoblasts and monocytes that form osteoclasts. In the center of the initial cartilage template, bone is resorbed on the inside and deposited on the outside, creating the growth in width of a hollow entity (forming a marrow). Simultaneously, the proximal and distal ends of the cartilage template have chondrocytes that continue to proliferate as secondary ossification centers. This activity allows cartilage growth at the end of the bones, providing vertically expansive capabilities. Ultimately, the areas where bone meets cartilage forms the epiphyseal plate (a linear zone of cartilage), where bone replaces cartilage continuously until bone growth completely fuses and stops around puberty. In the humerus specifically, there are eight ossification centers, at the head of the humerus, humeral shaft, greater and lesser tubercles, medial and lateral epicondyles, trochlea, and olecranon.

The ossification of the shaft occurs at eight weeks gestation, with the humeral head ossification occurring at birth/after birth. The greater tubercle's ossification takes place during the first year of life and the lesser tubercle ossification within the first six years of life.

# Blood Supply and Lymphatics

The primary blood supply of the proximal humerus comes from anastomoses between the anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries.

The axillary artery continues to become the brachial artery, which, along with one of its branches, the profunda brachii artery, will give off peri-osteal arteries to provide the blood supply for the rest humerus and its attached muscles.

# Nerves

The axillary nerve, formed from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, wraps around the surgical neck of the humerus, and provides innervation to the deltoid and rotator cuff muscles, specifically the teres minor.

# Muscles

The humerus serves as the origin and insertion site of many upper limb muscles that divide into the following distinctions: scapulohumeral muscles, anterior compartment muscles, posterior compartment muscles.

Scapulohumeral muscles: The deltoid muscle, which defines the shoulder contour of the upper limb, originates at three locations: the acromion of the scapula, the spine of the scapula and clavicle, with each part inserting into the deltoid tuberosity of the humerus. The deltoid muscle allows internal/external rotation and abduction/adduction of the humerus.

Anterior compartment muscles: The biceps brachii muscle has a long head and short head but does not have an actual origin or insertion sites on the humerus.

Posterior compartment muscles: The triceps brachii muscle contains three heads, with the medial head originating on the posterior aspect of the humerus, inferior to the spiral groove, and the lateral head originating on the posterior surface, both insert into the olecranon process of the ulna and allow extension of the forearm at the elbow joint.

# Surgical Considerations

Elderly patients who fall on their shoulders or land on their outstretched arm can sustain proximal humeral fractures.

Children ages three and younger can sustain transphyseal fractures of the distal humerus after a fall or trauma.

Intercondylar fractures at the distal humerus are often treated surgically as well with olecranon osteotomy.

# Clinical Significance

**Radial Nerve Injury**

Radial nerve palsy is among the most common peripheral nerve injuries following a humeral fracture.

**Conditions of the Shoulder**

Conditions such as calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff and adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder (i.e., frozen shoulder syndrome) are relatively common conditions with controversial and/or multifactorial etiologies.

**Metastatic Disease**

Metastatic bone disease causes destructive bone lesions and significant localized pain, most often in the humerus. Lesions can increase the risk of a fracture within the humerus.

**Supracondylar Fractures of the Distal Humerus**

This fracture is the most common elbow fracture in the pediatric population. The fracture location is superior to the medial and lateral condyles and epicondyles. Supracondylar fractures of the distal humerus by the elbow joint can compromise nerve and vasculature depending on its displacement. Anterior displacement puts the median nerve and brachial artery at risk. Posterior displacement puts the radial artery at risk. Palpation of distal pulses and capillary refill should be part of the initial workup to survey for preserved blood supply. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs are necessary for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Nondisplaced fractures are treated initially with a posterior splint and eventual casting. Displaced fractures are reduced, and pinned percutaneously. Malunion, compartment syndrome, and neurovascular complications are morbidities related to this fracture.

**Other/Miscellaneous Conditions**

Hematologic, infectious, genetic, and neurologic disorders may cause humerus varus.

Disappearing bone disease is a rare musculoskeletal condition marked by bone resorption, lack of bone formation, and lack of vascular proliferation. This disorder has severe quality of life implications.

Charcot arthropathy is a rare disorder characterized by debilitating joint destruction. The disease can lead to bone and soft tissue loss around the humerus and can alter muscular control. Treatment involves shoulder arthroplasty.

Osteochondrosis of the humerus is associated with Panner disease and osteochondritis dissecans. The two diseases present similarly.
