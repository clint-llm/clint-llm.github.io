The etiology of AKI has always been traditionally divided into three categories: pre-renal, renal, and post-renal. Each of these categories has several different causes associated with them.

Pre-renal includes any reduced blood flow to the kidney. This may be part of systemic hypoperfusion resulting from hypovolemia or hypotension or might be due to selective hypoperfusion to the kidneys, such as those resulting from renal artery stenosis, aortic dissection.

Renal includes acute tubular necrosis, which can result from several different causes. Prolonged renal ischemia, sepsis, and nephrotoxins being the most common ones. It is worthwhile mentioning that pre-renal injury can convert into a renal injury if the exposure to the offending factor is prolonged enough to cause cellular damage.

Post-renal mainly includes obstructive causes, which lead to congestion of the filtration system and thus eventually lead to shutting down the kidneys. The most common ones being renal/ureteral calculi, tumors, or any urethral obstruction. Another noteworthy fact is that a unilateral obstruction may not always present as AKI, especially if the obstruction is gradual such as a tumor, because a normal working contralateral kidney may be able to compensate for the function of the affected kidney. Therefore, the most common etiology of post-renal AKI is bladder outlet obstruction.
