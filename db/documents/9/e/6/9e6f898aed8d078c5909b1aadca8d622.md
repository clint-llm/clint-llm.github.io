Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cells, and mtDNA is required for the MRC to generate ATP. It is proposed that the mutations in mtDNA disrupt MRC resulting in decreased cellular energy, ion-channel dysfunction, and neuronal cell death. Since mitochondria are present in the majority of the cells, hence these disorders involve multiple systems. Further, different tissues have different energy requirements and have a variable threshold of vulnerability to mitochondrial dysfunction, wide phenotypic variations and overlaps exist in clinical presentations among mitochondrial diseases.
