Abortion is the medical term for a pregnancy loss before 20 weeks of gestational age.  The types of spontaneous abortion include threatened, inevitable, incomplete, complete, septic, and missed abortion

A threatened abortion is defined as vaginal bleeding before 20 weeks gestational age in the setting of a positive urine and/or blood pregnancy test with a closed cervical os, without passage of products of conception and without evidence of a fetal or embryonic demise. The definition of a threatened abortion by the World Health Organization (WHO) is pregnancy-related bloody vaginal discharge or frank bleeding during the first half of pregnancy without cervical dilatation

Other types of abortion should be considered if the cervical os is open, if there is determined to be an extrauterine pregnancy, if there is determined to be an intrauterine pregnancy without a fetal heartbeat, or if there is evidence of the passage of products of conception

Nearly 25% of pregnant women have some degree of vaginal bleeding during the first two trimesters and about 50% of these progress to loss of the pregnancy. The bleeding during a threatened abortion is typically mild to moderate. The abdominal pain may present as intermittent cramps, suprapubic pain, pelvic pressure, or lower back pain.
