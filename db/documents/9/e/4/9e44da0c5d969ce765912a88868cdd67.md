Vitreous floaters can often be the presenting symptom of a retinal tear or detachment. Early recognition of floaters can help prevent vision loss or blindness. Patients that present with signs and symptoms of vitreous floaters need to be evaluated by an ophthalmologist. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation of vitreous floaters and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients affected by them.

**Objectives:**
- Describe common presenting symptoms in patients with vitreous floaters. 
- Explain the evaluation for vitreous floaters.
- Describe the treatment options for vitreous floaters.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination, with particular emphasis on communication between the interprofessional medical teams, to enhance prompt and thorough delivery of care to patients with vitreous floaters.
