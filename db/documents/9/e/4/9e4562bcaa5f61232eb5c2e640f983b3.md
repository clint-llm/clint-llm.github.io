A high suspicionÂ for ichthyosis vulgaris should be included in the evaluation of patients consulting for skin disorders. A family history of a similar dermatosis and a thorough inspection of the skin should be obtained. The diagnosis of ichthyosis vulgaris is based on several factors. These factors include the time of onset of clinical symptoms, the skin phenotype (color, scale pattern, the presence of erythroderma, a collodion membrane at birth), associated cutaneous manifestations, family history and hereditary transmission, histopathologic findings, absence or presence of extracutaneous manifestations, and genetic testing. Genetic testing may be beneficial for the confirmation of diagnosis and for genetic counseling.
