Gallstones occur when substances in the bile reach their limits of solubility. As bile becomes concentrated in the gallbladder, it becomes supersaturated with these substances, precipitating into small crystals in time. These crystals, in turn, become stuck in the gallbladder mucus, resulting in gallbladder sludge. Over time, these crystals grow and form large and/or multiple stones. These gallstones may cause cholecystitis symptoms, but if they become embedded in a floppy Hartman's pouch, they can cause additional findings of jaundice. As this condition progresses, internal fistulas from the gallbladder into the common bile duct, common hepatic duct (CHD), and the duodenum can develop. A grading system has been developed to categorize the various stages of Mirizzi syndrome.

**Type I: No Fistula Present**

- Type IA: Presence of the cystic duct

- Type IB: Obliteration of the cystic duct

**Types II to IV: Fistula Present**

- Type II: Defect smaller than 33% of the CHD diameter

- Type III: Defect 33% to 66% of the CHD diameter

- Type IV: Defect larger than 66% of the CHD diameter
