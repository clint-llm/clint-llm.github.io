The prevalenceÂ of sinus squeeze is roughly 34% in divers and 20% to 25% in pilots. Interestingly, high-performance pilots, such as fighter pilots, experience barosinusitis less than commercial pilots. Prevalence in commercial pilots increases to 55% with a concurrent upper respiratory infection. Hyperbaric oxygen treatments account for 3% of annual barosinusitis cases. Concomitant sinusitis of any etiology increases the incidence of barosinusitis.
