Prediabetes is a precursor before the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Adults with prediabetes often may show no signs or symptoms of diabetes but will have blood sugar levels higher than normal. The normal blood glucose level is between 70 mg/dL to 99 mg/dL. In patients with prediabetes, you can expect to see blood glucose levels elevated between 110 mg/dL to - 125 mg/dL. This activity reviews the cause and pathophysiology of prediabetes and stresses the importance of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of prediabetes.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with prediabetes.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for prediabetes.
