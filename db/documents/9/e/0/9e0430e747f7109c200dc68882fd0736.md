The evaluation may include:

**Ultrasound:**Ultrasound is the initial non-invasive modality for localizing superficial tumors; distinguishing solid masses from cystic collections, and helping guide fine-needle aspiration biopsy.

**Computerized tomography (CT):**Conventional CT and MRI have similar sensitivity and specificity in determining tumor location, tumor margin, and tumor infiltration.

**Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):**For lesions in the deep parotid lobe, sublingual glands, and minor salivary glands, MRI provides an accurate extent of the tumor, the location of the tumor, and its relationship to the facial nerve, for preoperative planning purposes.

**Positron emission tomography (PET).**Compared with conventional CT, PET may be more accurate in demonstrating tumor extension, nodal involvement, local recurrence, and distant metastasis due to the tissuesâ€™ higher levels of standardized uptake values (SUV).

**Biopsy.**Imaging is unable to completely distinguish between benign and malignant lesions. Obtaining histological samples is key to determining treatment options. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a safe diagnostic tool with a high level of accuracy including sensitivity and specificity of 73% and 91%, respectively, in distinguishing benign from malignant tumors.
