Pulmonary complications can lead to shorter life expectancy even in early detection of hypogammaglobulinemia. The main complication involved is the development of bronchiectasis which is seen in approximately 20% of patients with a history of recurrent infections. This may cause worsening respiratory symptoms with increased bronchospasms presenting like an obstructive and/or restrictive pulmonary disease.

A high-resolution CT scan is recommended periodically to monitor pulmonary status. Another long term complication is malignancy that is usually seen in the fourth to fifth decades of life, for which close follow up is advised. High dose IVIG started early in the disease course can promote a healthier outcome with decreased pulmonary complications.
