# Continuing Education Activity

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by episodes of complete collapse of the airway or partial collapse with an associated decrease in oxygen saturation or arousal from sleep. This disturbance results in fragmented, nonrestorative sleep. OSA has significant implications for cardiovascular health, mental illness, quality of life, and driving safety. This activity reviews the cause and pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea.
- Review the presentation of a patient with obstructive sleep apnea.
- Summarize the treatment options for obstructive sleep apnea.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by obstructive sleep apnea.

# Introduction

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by episodes of a complete (apnea) or partial collapse (hypopnea) of the upper airway with an associated decrease in oxygen saturation or arousal from sleep.

# Etiology

Pharyngeal narrowing and closure during sleep is a complex phenomenon, and likely multiple factors play a role in the pathogenesis. Sleep-related reduced ventilatory drive and neuromuscular combined with anatomic risk factors are likely to play a significant role in upper airway obstruction during sleep.

**Anatomic Factors**

- Micrognathia, retrognathia

- Facial elongation

- Mandibular hypoplasia

- Adenoid and tonsillar hypertrophy

- Inferior displacement of the hyoid

**Nonanatomic Risk Factors**

- Central fat distribution

- Obesity

- Advanced age

- Male gender

- Supine sleeping position

- Pregnancy

**Additional Factors**

- Alcohol use

- Smoking

- Use of sedatives and hypnotics

**Associated Medical Disorders**

- Endocrine disorders (e.g., diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, acromegaly, and hypothyroidism)

- Neurological disorders (e.g., stroke, spinal cord injury, and myasthenia gravis)

- Prader Willi syndrome

- Down Syndrome

- Congestive heart failure

- Atrial fibrillation

- Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS)

These relationships between OSA and various medical disorders are based mainly on observational studies and not necessarily randomized clinical trials.

# Epidemiology

Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condition with significant adverse consequences.****with 425 million adults aged 30-69 years having moderate to severe OSA (15 or more events/h).****In the United States, it has been reported that 25-30% of men and 9-17% of women meet the criteria for obstructive sleep apnea.

# Pathophysiology

Upper airway obstruction during sleep is often due to negative collapsing pressure during inspiration; however, progressive expiratory narrowing in the retro palatal area plays an important role.

# History and Physical

Patients with suspected OSA usually present with excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, gasping, choking, or breathing cessation while sleeping that a bed partner witnessed. Excessive daytime sleepiness is one of the most common symptoms. However, the majority of patients are asymptomatic.

The **STOP-BANG**questionnaire is one of the most widely accepted screening tools for OSA.

- Snoring: Do you snore loudly (louder than talking or loud enough to be heard through closed doors)?

- Tired: Do you often feel tired, fatigued, or sleepy during the daytime?

- Observed: Has anyone observed you stop breathing during your sleep?

- Blood pressure: Do you have or are you being treated for high blood pressure?

- BMI: BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2

- Age: age > 50 yrs

- Neck circumference: Neck circumference >40 cm

- Gender: Gender male

Use **STOP-BANG**to decide if high probability of moderate-severe disease. High risk if ‘YES’ to ≥ 3 items Low risk if ‘YES’ to < 3 items Items.

Obesity is the most common finding in individuals with OSA. Other physical findings are large neck circumference (17 inches or 43 cm in males and 16 inches or 40.5 cm), crowded oropharynx (Mallampati 3 to 4), retrognathia, micrognathia, tonsilar hypertrophy, low-lying palate, overjet, and a large tongue. However, after adjusting for body weight and neck size, only lateral narrowing is an independent predictor of OSA.

# Evaluation

Any adult patient with unexplained daytime or sleep-related symptoms such as excessive sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep should be evaluated for sleep apnea. However, universal screening for OSA is not recommended in asymptomatic patients except for those who are at risk of occupational hazards such as driving or those who are pilots.

Nighttime in-laboratory Level 1 polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. During the test, patients are monitored with EEG leads, pulse oximetry, temperature and pressure sensors to detect nasal and oral airflow, respiratory impedance plethysmography belts around the chest and abdomen to detect motion, an ECG lead, and EMG sensors to detect muscle contraction in the chin, chest, and legs (as depicted in the polygraph).

Scoring respiratory events in adults rely on 4 channels:

- Oronasal thermal sensor

- Nasal air pressure transducer

- Inductance plethysmography (esophageal manometry or pressure catheter may be used instead)

- Pulse oximetry

*A snoring monitor is a required channel but is not used in scoring any respiratory events

According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), hypopnea can be defined based on one of two criteria. It can either be a reduction in airflow of at least 30% for more than 10 seconds associated with at least 4% oxygen desaturation (Medicare criteria) or a reduction in airflow of at least 30% for more than 10 seconds associated with at least 3% oxygen desaturation or an arousal from sleep on EEG (Recommended  AASM criteria).

Scoring apnea requires both of the following criteria to be met:

- A. Drop in the peak signal excursion by ≥90% of pre-event baseline flow

- B. Duration of the drop in flow is ≥10 seconds.

- Apneas usually further are classified based on effort (RIP signals):
- Obstructive apnea, if there is increased effort throughout the entire apnea
- Central apnea, if there is no effort throughout the entire apnea

Mixed apnea occurs if there is no effort in the first part and there is an effort in the second part of the apnea (See polygraph).

Home sleep tests (HST) or portable monitoring (PM) have gained popularity due to their relative accessibility and lower cost. PM, however, should be used with specific rules and procedures based on the AASM unattended PM task force guidelines, which outlined the following criteria

- At a minimum, PM must record airflow, respiratory effort, and blood oxygenation.

- The airflow, effort, and oximetric biosensors conventionally used for in-laboratory PSG should be used in PM.

- PM testing must be performed under the auspices of an AASM-accredited comprehensive sleep medicine program with written policies and procedures.

- An experienced sleep technologist/technician must apply the sensors or directly educate patients in sensor application.

- The PM device must allow for the display of raw data with the capability of manual scoring or editing of automated scoring by a qualified sleep technician/technologist.

- A board-certified sleep specialist, or an individual who fulfills the eligibility criteria for the sleep medicine certification examination, must review the raw data from PM using scoring criteria consistent with current published AASM standards.

- A follow-up visit to review test results should be performed for all patients undergoing PM.

- In patients with a high pretest probability of moderate to severe OSA, negative or technically inadequate PM tests should prompt in-laboratory polysomnography.

Unattended PM and HST are appropriate for adults with a high pretest probability for sleep apnea and no significant medical comorbidities (advanced congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neurologic disorders). These are level III sleep tests consisting of pulse oximetry, heart rate monitoring, temperature and pressure sensors to detect nasal and oral airflow, resistance belts around the chest and abdomen to detect motion, and a sensor to detect body position. Moderate and severe sleep apnea is detected on these tests, but due to the chance of underestimating the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) relative to the total recording time (which may be longer than the total sleep time measured in an in-lab study), mild sleep apnea may go undiagnosed, and a repeat in-lab study may be needed. A proposed algorithm for the appropriate use of PM and in-lab PSG is outlined in the figure below.

One of the main limitations of HST is that the majority of studies rely on total recording time (TRT) as the denominator instead of total sleep time (TST) in the calculation of AHI as there are no EEG sensors to differentiate sleep from wake. It is estimated that using TRT can result in an underestimation of AHI by at least 20%.

While most PM devices include flow sensors, other technologies use an alternative method without flow such as peripheral arterial tonometry (called PAT) to identify sleep-disordered breathing events. The OSA severity obtained using PAT devices is called pAHI and is reported to provide similar indices to PSG-derived AHI.

The severity of OSA in adults is based on AHI, REI, or pAHI as follows:

- Mild: 5 to 15 events per hour

- Moderate: >15 to 30 events per hour

- Severe: greater than 30 events per hour

The burden of disease in mild OSA is controversial and based on associated clinical sequelae (such as excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep maintenance insomnia, and cognitive dysfunction).

Recent studies challenged however the traditional definition and scoring criteria of OSA in adults due to its limitations in capturing the pathophysiological impact in individual patients.

# Treatment / Management

The treatment of OSA is a multi-pronged approach and should be individualized to each patient. While treatment of moderate to severe OSA has been shown to improve clinical outcomes

**Lifestyle Changes and Treating Underlying Medical Conditions**

The importance of weight loss should be emphasized in OSA patients with overweight and obesity.

**Positional Therapy**

OSA that is more prominent in the supine position can be treated with a positioning device to keep a patient on their side can be an option.

**Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) Therapy**

Continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) is the most effective treatment for adults.

Several studies have reported conflicting findings when assessing the effect of PAP therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with OSA.

**Oral Appliance**

For patients unable or unwilling to use CPAP or those who will be unable to access electricity reliably, custom-fitted and titrated oral appliances or mandibular advancements devices (MAD) can be used to bring the lower jaw forward and relieve airway obstruction (See picture). This typically works best for candidates with appropriate dentition and mild to moderate sleep apnea. In a randomized clinical trial on 126 patients with moderate-severe OSA,

- Oral appliances can be considered rather than no treatment for adult patients with snoring (without OSA) or those with OSA who do not tolerate CPAP therapy or prefer alternate treatment.

- When a sleep physician prescribes oral appliance therapy for an adult patient with obstructive sleep apnea.

- A qualified dentist should use a custom, titratable appliance.

- A follow-up with a qualified dentist after oral appliance therapy is initiated in adult patients with OSA to assess for dental-related side effects.

- A follow-up with sleep testing to confirm treatment efficacy.

**Surgical Treatments**

Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) surgically removes the uvula and tissue from the soft palate to create more space in the oropharynx.

Maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) requires both the upper and lower jaws to be detached and surgically advanced anteriorly to increase space in the oropharynx.

A newer option is the implantable hypoglossal nerve stimulator (HNS), usually unilateral, although bilateral implantation has been recently reported.

The eligibility criteria for HNS adopted from the original randomized trial include the following characteristics:

- Adults >18 years of age

- Moderate to severe OSA (AHI between 20 to 50 with less than 25% central or mixed apneas)

- Inability to tolerate CPAP

- No complete concentric collapse at the palate on drug-induced sleep endoscopy

Exclusion criteria for HNS include the following:

- BMI > 32.0 kg/m2.

- Neuromuscular disease.

- Hypoglossal-nerve palsy.

- Severe restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease.

- Moderate-to-severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.

- Severe valvular heart disease.

- Heart failure, New York Heart Association class III or IV.

- Recent myocardial infarction or severe cardiac arrhythmias (within the past 6 months).

- Persistent uncontrolled hypertension despite medication use.

- Active psychiatric disease and coexisting nonrespiratory sleep disorders.

In extreme cases, OSA can also be treated with a tracheostomy to bypass the oropharyngeal obstruction. This management option is also best addressed at academic or specialty sleep centers that are experienced in treating patients with tracheostomy. Such patients will encounter numerous challenges with home care, durable medical equipment, and family/partner education on tracheostomy management. Many patients with severe OSA requiring tracheostomy have comorbidities.

# Differential Diagnosis

- Asthma

- Central sleep apnea

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

- Depression

- Gastroesophageal reflux

- Hypothyroidism

- Narcolepsy

- Periodic limb movement disorder

# Prognosis

The short-term prognosis of OSA with treatment is good, but the long-term prognosis is guarded. The biggest problem is the lack of adherence to CPAP, as nearly 50% of patients stop using CPAP within the first month despite education.

# Complications

- Hypertension

- Myocardial infarction

- Cerebrovascular accident

- Depression

- Sleeplessness related accidents

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Weight loss should be encouraged in patients with OSA. They should be counseled to avoid alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates, and some antidepressants, which may worsen their condition. Additionally, they should be made aware of the importance of proper sleep hygiene, getting enough sleep every night, and the risks of driving while sleepy. Adherence to CPAP use should be encouraged as well as how to clean and maintain the machine properly.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

The management of patients with OSA is best accomplished with an interprofessional team that includes a sleep specialist, primary provider, cardiologist, otolaryngologist, dietitian, pulmonologist, and neurologist. There are many options to treat OSA, the primary one being CPAP. Unfortunately, compliance with CPAP remains low. Some patients may benefit from an oral or nasal device, but compliance remains an issue. Surgery is the last step and should only be considered after a thorough patient evaluation. Surgery does not cure the disorder, is expensive, and can be associated with severe complications. The prognosis for most patients with OSA is guarded. Until the patient starts to lose weight, most therapies have poor efficacy.
