The disease is divided into five stages. Some phases overlap, and the five stages are only in severe cases whereas mild cases might not have all five:

- Febrile: lasts for 1 to 7 days, the main symptom is acute high fever along with some flu-like symptoms like headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.

- Hypotensive: lasts for 1 to 3 days due to capillary leakage, will have signs of petechiae, conjunctival hemorrhage, hematemesis, and melena.

- Oliguric: 2 to 6 days, decreased to no urine output, elevated BUN, creatinine, reduced GFR, and signs of fluid retention. The patient is at risk for hyperkalemia and other electrolyte abnormalities. Most deaths occur during this phase.

- Polyuric: about two weeks, urine output is increased and is a sign that the patient's outcome is improving. The biggest risk will be hypokalemia.

- Convalescent: lasts an average of 3 to 6 months but in some patients up to 1 year. The patient will still have mild symptoms, some proteinuria, and some fatigue.
