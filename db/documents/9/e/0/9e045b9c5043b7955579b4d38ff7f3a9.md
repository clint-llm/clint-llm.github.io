Adult-onset Still disease is a rare inflammatory arthritis with fevers, rash, and joint pain. Sometimes people may have just one episode while in others the symptoms persist. It can affect any joint, but the most commonly involved are knees, wrists, and ankles. Treatment involves nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and biologics depending upon the disease severity
