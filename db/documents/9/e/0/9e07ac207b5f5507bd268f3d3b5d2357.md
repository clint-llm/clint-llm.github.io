There are several adverse effects of estrogen therapy that manifest in different ways depending on the route of administration and whether that route has local or systemic effects. A study exhibiting the adverse outcomes of hormone replacement therapy showed that unopposed estrogen correlates with an increased risk of endometrial and breast cancer. A large prospective study exhibited a positive relationship between estrogen, used in the form of estradiol, and increased breast cancer risk. This study concluded that the relative risk was 1.7 (95 % CI 1.1 to 2.7) for women who used estrogen for more than nine years and 1.8 (95% CI 0.7 to 4.6) for those who used estradiol for more than six years. Another study showed a correlation between estrogen therapy and the risk of stroke, but that has yet to be confirmed.

Hormone replacement therapy,Â such as estrogen therapy, has also been associated with an increased risk of developing venous and pulmonary thromboembolism.
