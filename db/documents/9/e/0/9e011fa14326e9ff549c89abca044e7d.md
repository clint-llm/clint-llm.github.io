**Medical**

There is no specific cure for endocardial fibroelastosis. Treatment is largely tailored around symptoms. Management commonly revolves around chronic cardiac failure with diuretics, digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and beta-blockers. Early and long-term treatment with digoxin has been suggested.

**Surgical**

At present, surgery is only indicated in refractory cases that do not respond to medical management. Experimental procedures such as peeling off the fibrotic and thickened endocardium to restore compliance of the underlying myocardial tissue have been tried with limited improvement in outcomes.

Cardiac transplantation may be recommended for those with end-stage disease.
