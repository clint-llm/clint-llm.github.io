Clinicians should monitor for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome if the patient is taking other serotonergic drugs.Â In two case reports, the authors described patients who quickly developed serotonin syndrome after initiating cyclobenzaprine in the short term. In both cases, the patients took serotonergic medications (phenelzine and duloxetine) before starting cyclobenzaprine.

Healthcare providers should use the numerical rating scale (NRS), verbal rating scale (VRS), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) for the assessment of pain and to monitor the response to cyclobenzaprine therapy.
