The lower respiratory system begins its development during the fourth week as an outgrowth of the ventral wall of the foregut, also known as the respiratory diverticulum. The endodermal lining of the respiratory diverticulum gives rise to the epithelial lining of the trachea, bronchi, alveoli, and larynx.

The cartilaginous and muscular components of the larynx, including theÂ thyrohyoid membrane, are derived from the fourth and sixth pairs of pharyngeal arches. The superior laryngeal nerve (a branch of CN X) supplies the part of the larynx that develops from the fourth pharyngeal arch, and the recurrent laryngeal nerve (a branch of CN X) supplies the part that derives from the sixth pharyngeal arch.
