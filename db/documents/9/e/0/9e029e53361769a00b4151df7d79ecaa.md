Tympanocentesis is a minor surgical procedure with dual indications: diagnosis (allowing culture and sensitivity analysis of the aspirate) and treatment (physical removal of the fluid to improve hearing)

Therapeutic indications for tympanocentesis:

- Otalgia Relief: Pain is one of the classic manifestations of several otologic disorders. Otitis media is, by definition an inflammatory middle disease and can present with pain in addition to other findings. Patients, especially those of the pediatric population, with severe, severe otalgia arising from AOM (acute otitis media), can be managed acutely with tympanocentesis while awaiting results from a concurrent antibiotic treatment.

- Therapeutic Administration of Pharmacological Drugs: The administration of intratympanic medications such as antibiotics, corticosteroids, antifungals, and topical analgesic agents for the management of otological disorders such as Meniere disease and sensorineural hearing loss is facilitated greatly by tympanocentesis. This is most often employed for SSNHL and Meniere disease, where intra-tympanic glucocorticoid instillation is a routine part of treatment in many centers.

Diagnostic Indications for Tympanocentesis:

- Acute Otitis Media in an Immunocompromised Patient: The accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media in an immunocompromised host and its effective management can be challenging. Such patients may not respond clinically in predicted ways, and tympanocentesis offers the clinician the ability to perform a microbiologic culture and analysis of the ear aspirate to provide culture-directed therapy.

- Unresolved Acute Otitis Media: In patients with an episode of AOM that is unresponsive to 2 standard courses of antibiotics regimen or those with recurrent bouts of AOM, a diagnostic tympanocentesis may be warranted for the identification of pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility before the selection of a third line antimicrobial agent.

- Acute Otitis Media in Neonates: AOM in neonates or infants that recently completed their admission period at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) can be a challenging one to clinicians, especially pediatricians. Tympanocentesis may be helpful in making a diagnosis of AOM versus sterile ME fluid in neonates in such patients with fever of an unknown origin. These categories of patients have been found to have AOM not caused by the usual pathogens at a higher rate than the general population.

- The Management of Tympanic Membrane Retraction: While tympanocentesis by itself is not a management modality for patients with retracted tympanic membranes, tympanocentesis can help the clinician to determine if the insertion of a ventilation tube will help to elevate the retracted tympanic membranes (TM) in this cohort of patients. This is especially true in clinical situations where pneumatic otoscopy is unavailable. Air can be gently instilled into the middle ear space to determine the clinical and hearing response.
