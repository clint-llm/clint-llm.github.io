With more states liberalizing the use of cannabis, many cases of toxicity are now being reported, esp in children and teenagers. These patients typicallly present to the emergency department with varying mental status changes. The toxicity is best managed by the emergency department physician, posion control, an internist, nurses, neurologist and or psychiatrist. Most cases of cannabis toxxicity are managed with supportive care with close monitoring. Pharmacological therapy is used to manage symptoms that arise.

Patients should be observed for 6 hours for resolution of symptoms and be admitted for monitoring when there is central nervous system (CNS) depression, altered mental status, multiple seizures, or persistently abnormal vital signs. Longer periods of toxicity can be expected to occur with ingested edible products and with synthetic cannabinoids. Patients returning to baseline do not require any further testing or follow-up and should be counseled. The outlook for most patients is good but repeat incidents of toxicity are starting to become common all over the US.
