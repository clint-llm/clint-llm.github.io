Sacroiliac (SI) joint pain is a common etiology of low back pain. Studies have shown that 10 to 27 percent of mechanical low back pain is secondary to SI joint pain. Dysfunction of the SI joint occurs in degenerative conditions such as inflammatory arthritis, advanced age, or when there is an asymmetry in the joint, such as in patients with leg length discrepancy. Other conditions associated with SI joint pain include pregnancy, trauma, and previous spine surgery. When indicated, SI joint injection can be used as both a diagnostic and therapeutic modality for SI joint pain. This procedure involves introducing a local anesthetic or a mixture of local anesthetic and corticosteroids into the joint. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of sacroiliac joint pain, with particular focus on the indications, contraindications, and technique involved in performing a sacroiliac joint injection. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy pertinent to sacroiliac joint injections. 
- Outline the indications for sacroiliiac joint injections. 
- Review the complications of sacroiliiac joint injections. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to optimize sacroiliiac joint injections and patient outcomes.
