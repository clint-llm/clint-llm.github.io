Whenever there is a renal mass, it is always important to rule out infection and abscess, as antibiotics are required for such treatment. When an infection is ruled out, further investigation is needed for malignant etiologies such as renal cell carcinoma, metastasis, or lymphoma. While investigating for malignancy, it is crucial to identify benign tumors such as oncocytoma, angiomyolipoma, or adenoma. These usually require active surveillance, with no interventions needed.
