DVT is a common problem in the primary care, acute care, and inpatient setting. ItÂ is not clear what the actual incidence is, but DVT is found in about 80 out of 100,000 cases. One out of 20 people will develop a DVT sometime during their lifetime. DVTs account for approximately 600,000 hospitalizations per year in the United States. DVTs occur more commonly in those older than 40 years old. There is an increased incidence in the male and African American populations.
