Upper airway manipulations are very stimulating and often cannot be effectively performed on an awake patient. Once anesthetized, the patient cannot adequately protect their airway from aspiration and obstruction since the oropharyngeal muscle tone, expiration reflex, coughing reflex, and apnea reflex are progressively obtunded by the majority of general anesthetics.

Changes in the respiratory pattern invariably and progressively lead to hypoventilation and then to apnea. This introduces a need for endotracheal intubation to facilitate ventilation of the lungs and to prevent the possibility of airway obstruction and asphyxiation. An endotracheal tube with an inflated cuff effectively occludes the portion of the trachea outside of the hollow plastic tube itself, performing the above-described functions. Yet, in the case of upper airway surgery, it can also obstruct the surgical field and be vulnerable to mechanical damage from surgical manipulations, including using a laser.

Smaller-sized devices, like jet ventilation catheters, can be placed below vocal cords to insufflate oxygen, provide some ventilatory oscillations, and simultaneously allow for better visualization of the surgical field.
