Managing a case of PSGN requires cooperation between internists, nephrologists, infectious disease consultants, pharmacists, and nursing staff, functioning as an interprofessional team, to provide excellent care for their patients. PSGN patientâ€™s fluid and salt intake, as well as urine output, should be carefully monitored by the team. The pharmacist should coordinate with the clinician to ensure that the patient is on no nephrotoxic medications and emphasize medication compliance if the patient has hypertension. The visiting nurse should encourage all close contacts and family members to undergo throat swabs to rule out an acute infection. The nurse should also weigh the patient to ensure that the edema is not worsening. Besides, renal function and potassium levels need to be closely monitored.

Consulting a nephrologist (or a pediatric nephrologist) must be sought in complicated cases. These patients need monitoring for fluid and electrolyte status at each visit. Close communication between interprofessional team members is vital to ensure good outcomes. [Level 5]

The prognosis in children is excellent but adults tend to have a protracted course with at least 30 to 50% developing renal dysfunction and hypertension.
