NSIP is rare. It constitutes 14% to 36% of cases of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia which is less common than usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) (50% to 60%) but more common than desquamative interstitial pneumonia, respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (DIP/RB-ILD) (10-17%) and acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP) (0% to 2%). IdiopathicÂ NSIP occurs mostly in middle-aged women who are non-smokers, while NSIP due to connective tissue disease is equal in men and women.
