The management of a colovesical fistula is best done with an interprofessional team of a general surgeon, urologist, oncologist, stoma nurse, and colorectal surgeon. However, since many patients do have a urinary catheter left in place, the role of the nurse is vital. The nurse will monitor the urine and order cultures when an infection is suspected. If the patient has hematuria, the surgeon and radiologist need to be notified for imaging studies. Patients need to be educated about the symptoms of a colovesical fistula in case there is a recurrence. If the cause was from diverticulitis, a dietary consult is recommended to educate the patient on the importance of a high-fiber diet. Finally, the nurse should ensure that the patient has prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis and is ambulatory.

**Outcomes**

For patients who undergo repair of the fistula from benign causes, the outcomes are excellent. However, if the cause is related to radiation or a malignancy, the outcomes are guarded. Other studies reveal that a single stage repair is not associated with worse outcomes compared to a multistage repair. The overall prognosis is worse for patients with a colonic malignancy and before a repair is even undertaken, a metastatic workup is necessary. The highest risk of recurrence is following radiation. When the fistula persists, the quality of life is also poor.
