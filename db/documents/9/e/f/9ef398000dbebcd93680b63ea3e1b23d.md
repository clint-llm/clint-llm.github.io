Identified risk factors for postpartum pubic symphysis diastasis include primigravid women, multiple gestations, and prolonged active labor.

- Biomechanical strain of the pelvic ligaments and associated hyper-lordosis; anatomical pelvic variations and "contracted pelvis"

- Metabolic (calcium) and hormonal (relaxin and progesterone) changes leading to ligamentous laxity

- Extreme weakening of the joint

- Tearing of the fibrocartilaginous disc during delivery

- Narrowing, sclerosis, and degeneration of the pubic joint

- Muscle weakness

- Increased pregnancy-related weight gain
