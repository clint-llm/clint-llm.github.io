In males, cleft lips most commonly occur on the left side. There is a 0.1% overall risk of cleft lip with or without cleft palate in the general population. In the Asian population, cleft lip is more common, with 2 out of 1000 babies born with cleft lip versus 1 out of 1000 in Caucasians and 0.5 out of 1000 in African Americans. Twenty-nine percent of children with cleft lip have associated congenital malformations. Cleft lip formation is most likely influenced by a patient’s genetic make-up but is multi-factorial. An expectant mother's malnourishment as well as exposure to phenytoin, steroids, tobacco, alcohol, and Accutane is known to increase the likelihood of cleft lip deformity. Folate, however, has been found to be preventative for cleft lip formation.
