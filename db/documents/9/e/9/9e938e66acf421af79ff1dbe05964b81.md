In addition to intractable low back pain, patients with failed back surgery syndrome often suffer from associated disorders. Psychiatric comorbidities are common in FBSS patients and correlate with worse pain outcomes. A survey of failed back surgery syndrome patients by Long and colleagues found that 67 of 78 patients with FBSS suffered from depression, with the vast majority experiencing an onset of depressive symptoms following the initial onset of pain.

Patients with failed back surgery syndrome may also experience complications from attempted treatment of their pain. Prolonged NSAID use has significant adverse effects on gastrointestinal and renal health. Opioids also have significant addictive potential; one study found that opioid overdose was the most common cause of death following lumbar fusion surgery.
