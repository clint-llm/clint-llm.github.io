It is clinically relevant to determine the level of ammonium in the urine to determine the capacity of kidneys for an appropriate response to an acid challenge. Kidneys excrete increased amounts of ammonia in acidotic conditions than normal acid-base balance conditions.  There are several methods for the estimation of ammonia excretion through the kidney. One of the most appropriate and widely accepted methods is to measure the urinary anion gap and urinary osmolal gap.  Urinary anion gap is determined as UNa+ + UK+ −UCl-. This particular method is beneficial based on the assumption that urinary ammonium ion is excreted only in association with the chloride ion. But this method is not useful for other ions like sodium, potassium, or glucose and urea nitrogen. For this, urinary osmolal gap estimation is necessary. The urinary osmolal gap is determined by Uosm−[2×(UNa++UK+)+UUN/2.8+Uglucose/18)]Uosm−[2×(U+U)+U/2.8+Uglucose/18)]. One can assume that in the absence of any osmotically active material like mannitol or unmeasured cations, the urinary osmolal gap only shows the ammonium ion concentration with its anion. However, the gold standard of measurement of urinary ammonium ion is the same as the enzymatic assay to measure the blood ammonium ion levels.
