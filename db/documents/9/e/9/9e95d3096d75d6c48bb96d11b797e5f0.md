Astrocytomas are glossy, infiltrative tumors with a poorly defined surgical resection plane. They can form a cavity in the spinal cord, known as a syrinx, and can degenerate into a malignant subtype. Ependymomas arise from ependymal cells, are soft and encapsulated, grow slowly, and are more centrally located, appearing as a focal enlargement within the spinal cord. A common histologic subtype is a WHO grade II cellular variant with perivascular pseudorosettes. In the filum terminale, micropapillary ependymoma, a WHO grade I tumor, is most commonly found. Ependymomas can span in length across 3 to 4 vertebral bodies, whereas astrocytomas can span 5 to 6 segments on average. Hemangioblastomas are small tumors that are highly vascularizedÂ but rarely extend beyond one or two vertebral bodies. Cyst formation is common, and the tumor is more often found in men.
