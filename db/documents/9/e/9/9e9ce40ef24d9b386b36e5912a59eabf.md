The etiology of twin complications occurs secondary to doubling placental mass and, thus, the associated obstetric complications of preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Additionally, the uterus may restrict its capacity to distend and permit adequate fetal growth, thus creating a risk for preterm labor. Fetal growth restriction may also increase the risk for preterm labor and birth due to the increased risk of abnormal placentation and function. In monozygotic gestations, there is an additional unique risk of intraplacental vascular connections between the fetal circulations. Thus, the definition of chronicity in twin gestations is critical to understanding the possible obstetric risks that can develop andÂ formulate an obstetric care plan.
