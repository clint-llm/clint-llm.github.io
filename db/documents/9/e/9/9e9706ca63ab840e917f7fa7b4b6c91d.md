The management of an umbilical hernia is with an interprofessional team that includes a pediatrician, pediatric nurse, primary care provider, pediatric surgeon, and the emergency department physician. The key is to understand that the majority of pediatric umbilical hernias will spontaneously close by ages 5-7. Unless the infant has signs of bowel obstruction or incarceration, the child can be followed. If in doubt, a referral to a pediatric surgeon is recommended.
