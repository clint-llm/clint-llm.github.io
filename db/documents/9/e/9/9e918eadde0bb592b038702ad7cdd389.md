Iron supplementation is indicated for iron-deficient states secondary to conditions such as iron deficiency anemia, iron deficiency without anemia, nutritional deficiency, malabsorption, chronic inflammatory state, blood loss, or an increase in the body's need for iron. Iron is an essential mineral needed for general health. Depleted iron stores lead to decreased production of hemoglobin and circulating erythrocytes in this body, resulting in anemia. Symptoms of iron deficiency can present as fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, pica and pagophagia, tachycardia, altered mental status, hypothermia, and increased risk of infection.

Treatment primarily aims at replenishing the body's iron stores and providing symptomatic relief. If left untreated, this may lead to adverse events such as neurodevelopmental delay in developing children and poor pregnancy outcomes for expectant mothers. At-risk populations are women of child-bearing age, where monthly menses and pregnancy are a common cause for anemia.

Iron supplementation through various routes such as oral or IV and iron fortification of foods can help manage and treat iron deficiency.
