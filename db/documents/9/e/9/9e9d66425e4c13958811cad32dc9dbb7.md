The tibial nerve innervates the tibialis posterior muscle. The tibial nerve is a component of the sciatic nerve, which comes from the ventral rami of spinal roots L4-S3. The sciatic nerve splits into the tibial nerve, which continues inferiorly, and the common peroneal nerve, which travels laterally around the neck of the fibula.

The tibial nerve courses inferiorly with the posterior tibial artery deep to the soleus muscle in the posterior compartment on the posterior surface of the tibialis posterior muscle belly. The tibial nerve gives off motor branches to all of the muscles of the posterior compartment, including the tibialis posterior. The tibial nerve continues inferiorly and passes posterior to the medial malleolus with the tibialis posterior tendon, flexor digitorum longus tendons, posterior tibial artery, and flexor hallucis longus within the tarsal tunnel. The tibial nerve exits the tarsal tunnel onto the plantar surface of the foot, where it divides into both the medial and lateral plantar nerves.
