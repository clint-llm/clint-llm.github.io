The diagnosis and management of pigmented purpuric dermatitis are difficult and is best done with an interprofessional team that includes the primary care provider, dermatologist, nurse practitioner, and pathologist. Pigmented purpuric dermatitis is often chronic with a relapsing and remitting course. However, it is a benign, often asymptomatic condition. Even if the capillaritis improves and the active inflammation ceases, the resulting hemosiderin deposition in the dermis can take months to years to slowly fade. Patients should be encouraged to wear compression stockings and keep the legs elevated at rest. The use of moisturizers may help relieve the itching. For most patients, the problem is poor cosmesis.
