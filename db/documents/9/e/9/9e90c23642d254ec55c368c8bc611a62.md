Finkelstein's test is more reliable in diagnosing De Quervain tenosynovitis than the Eichhoff's test, but studies that have tested the reliability of the Finkelstein's test are currently very limited. More large scale studies are needed to give us an exact sensitivity and specificity of the test. Typically, once the diagnosis of De Quervain's tenosynovitis is made, the initial treatment is conservative such as activity modification and rest. If conservative management does not result in symptom alleviation the next step is a thumb spica splint follow by corticosteroid injection. In refractory cases, patients may benefit from the surgical release of the APL.
