The diagnosis and treatment of an osteoid osteoma require an interprofessional team of a foot and ankle specialist, pharmacist, radiologist, pathologist, and physical therapist. Once an appropriate history and physical is obtained, the treatment protocol can be established which will determine the level of involvement of the various specialties. A delay in diagnosis may occur due to the vast differential diagnoses and difficulty with diagnostic imaging interpretation. However, a complete history and physical performed by the specialist combined with the imaging interpretation of the radiologist will dictate the treatment protocol.
