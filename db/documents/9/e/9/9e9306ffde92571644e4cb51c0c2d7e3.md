Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia diagnosis should be explored initially with a laboratory evaluation consisting of a CBC, electrolyte and renal panel, and LDH level. Additionally, imaging such as a chest x-ray for symptoms of shortness of breath may be obtained. If abdominal fullness, tendernessÂ or abdominal mass are symptoms, then a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis should be obtained. This can also help with the staging of the disease.

NCCN diagnosis guidelines:

- Have presence of more than 20% bone marrow lymphoblasts

- Hematoxylin and eosin-stained bone marrow clot and biopsy sections

- Morphology of bone marrow aspirate assessed with Wright/Giemsa

- Complete flow cytometric immunophenotyping

- Baseline evaluation of the leukemic clone

Lumbar puncture is used to evaluate CNS involvement. The fluid is checked for the presence of lymphoblasts.
