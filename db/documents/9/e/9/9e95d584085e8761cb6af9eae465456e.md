The sciatic nerve provides motor innervation to the posterior compartment of the thigh. This includes the biceps femoris, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and the ischial portion of the adductor magnus, providing knee flexion and hip adduction.

The tibial nerve innervates the posterior compartment of the leg and foot, which includes the gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris, popliteus, flexor hallucis longus, flexor digitorum longus, and tibialis posterior. These muscles are primarily responsible for plantar flexion and flexion of the toes.

The common fibular (peroneal) nerve innervates the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg and foot. The anterior compartment includes tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, and fibularis tertius. These muscles are primarily responsible for dorsiflexion of the foot and extension of the toes. The lateral compartment includes the peroneus longus and brevis, which are responsible for foot eversion.

The sciatic nerve also provides sensory innervation to the skin of the foot and the lower leg (except for the medial leg, which is innervated by the saphenous nerve). The tibial nerve further divides into the medial and lateral plantar nerves, which are responsible for the sensation of the sole. The common fibular (peroneal) nerve further divides into the superficial fibular (peroneal) nerve and deep fibular (peroneal) nerve. The superficial fibular nerve provides sensory innervation to the lateral leg and dorsum of the foot. The deep fibular nerve is responsible for sensation between the first and second toes. The medial and lateral sural nerves are made up of collateral branches from both the tibial and common fibular nerves and provide sensation to the calf and a small lateral portion of the foot.
