Common complications related to this include temporary corneal haze (10Â to 90%), delayed epithelial closure, sterile infiltrates, and central stromal scars. The literature describes postoperative microbial keratitis from bacterial, herpetic, protozoal, and fungal sources.

Rarer but more serious side effects include corneal melts and endothelial failure. Treatment failure is also a noted complication, defined as the progression of the condition with an increase in Kmax values of 1.0 D over the pre-operative value or greater than a 10% decrease in pachymetry readings six months post-operatively; this may occur in up to 10% of patients.
