PPS is an area of medicine that must be performed as a team. In an ideal setting, two clinicians participate in PPS, with one performing the indicated procedure and the other administering the sedation and monitoring the patient throughout. In the emergency department or resource-constrained settings, a qualified nurse can monitor the patient throughout the procedure while the physician performs the procedure. It is mandatory that a nurse or another qualified staff member monitor the patient while the procedure is performed, requiring interprofessional teamwork and communication to perform PPS.

Theclinician and nursing staff must work together to coordinate that all resuscitative equipment, monitors, medications, and reversal agents are in the room and available before the procedure is started. The provider may also need to be in communication with the pharmacist to obtain sedation medications or reversal agents. Consequently, interprofessional communication is imperative to ensure patient safety, enhance team performance, and work to enhance patient-centered care.
