As the PRUJ shares a joint capsule with the humeroulnar and humeroradial joints, it also shares their innervations. The innervation of the elbow capsule divides into an anterior and posterior capsule.

A small branch of the musculocutaneous nerve travels through the brachialis muscle to the central portion of the anterior capsule.

The lateral portion of the posterior capsule receives innervation from a branch of the radial nerve as it travels down the lateral head of the triceps. It then travels through the supinator muscle to also innervate the anterior capsule. Joint branches of the ulnar nerve arise just above the cubital tunnel and innervate the medial portion of the posterior capsule around the medial epicondyle and olecranon. Overlapping innervation from the radial and ulnar nerves supply the central portion of the posterior capsule.
