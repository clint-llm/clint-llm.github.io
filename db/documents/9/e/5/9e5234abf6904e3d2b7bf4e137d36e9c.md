Age is the most important factor in the incidence of fibroadenoma. Therefore, when obtaining a medical history, age is the most important factor which should be considered.

A family history of breast cancer is also significant. Female patients who have first-degree relatives with breast cancer should be monitored and observed more carefully for malignant features than patients without this family history.

Fibroadenoma most commonly occurs in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. On physical examination, it has the following features:

- Non-tender or painless

- Mobile

- Solitary

- RapidlyÂ growing solid lump with rubbery consistency and regular borders.
