All patients with a history of HTx should have a thorough history and physical exam performed. Medication history and immunosuppressant therapy compliance are requisite parts of the patient intake process. Development of new ventricular dysfunction systolic, diastolic or mixed should raise suspicion for transplant rejection. The timing of rejection can act as a clue to the diagnosis.

Patients most commonly present with orthopnea, shortness of breath,  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, syncope, palpitations, nausea/loss of appetite, weight gain, edema, arrhythmias (atrial flutter), oliguria, and hypotension. The physical exam can reveal signs of heart failure such as elevated jugular venous pressure, extra sounds on auscultation and peripheral edema.
