Close follow-up during the initial post-operative period, either by a wound care nurse and/or clinician experienced in the post-operative care of HT, should monitor the patient for possible complications including infection and ingrown hair formation. The patient should receive counsel that loss of the implanted hairs normally occurs after several days and may take several months to grow. There may also be surrounding native hair loss at the donor or recipient site, though the patient should understand that this “shock loss” is normally transient and to expect a full recovery after a few months.
