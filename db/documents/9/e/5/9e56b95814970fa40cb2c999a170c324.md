Previous analysis of the sensitivity and specificity of the straight leg raise test shows high sensitivity and low specificity of lumbar disc protrusion.

A straight leg raise test is an important physical examination finding during primary care to assess the need for imaging studies such as X-rays and MRI and the potential need for a referral from primary care to a spine specialist.

This test is also relevant among spine specialists to guide proper treatment options; beingÂ positive Lasegue test is a sign of nerve root irritation and possible entrapment, which might require a nerve root injection or surgery.****

A positive straight leg raising test results from gluteal or leg pain by passive straight leg flexion with the knee in extension. It may correlate with nerve root irritation and possible entrapment with decreased nerve excursion. This clinical neurological test has high sensitivity and low specificity; it is an important diagnostic workup in patients with lower back pain and suspected radiculopathy. This test is relevant to guide referrals among primary care providers and treatment among spinal surgeons, especially when considering a surgical decision.
