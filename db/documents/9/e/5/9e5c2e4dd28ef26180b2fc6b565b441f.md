Hyperphosphatemic tumoral calcinosis is a disorder of phosphate regulation caused due to a defect in the functioning of fibroblast growth factor-23 and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner in the vast majority of patients. It manifests as increased serum phosphate levels resulting in the formation of ectopic calcific masses in peri-articular locations and occasional inflammatory bony pains. The management is based on the description of previous case series and case reports and involves phosphate-lowering therapies, anti-inflammatory medications, and sometimes surgical management in severely disabling patients. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hyperphosphatemic tumoral calcinosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of hyperphosphatemic tumoral calcinosis.
- Describe the common presentation of a patient with hyperphosphatemic tumoral calcinosis.
- Identify the imaging findings associated with hyperphosphatemic tumoral calcinosis.
- Explain the treatment considerations taken by the interprofessional team for patients with hyperphosphatemic tumoral calcinosis.
