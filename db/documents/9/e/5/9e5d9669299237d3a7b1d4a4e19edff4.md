Hepatic cystic lesions were once thought to be relatively uncommon; however, they are being diagnosed more frequently with the continued advancement and improved access of patients to cross-sectional imaging. Estimates are that cystic liver disease affects 5 to 10% of the world population. The differential for liver disease is broad and includes infectious, inflammatory, malignant, developmental, and traumatic etiologies. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of biliary cystadenomas and highlights the interprofessional approach in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the typical patient presentation of patients with biliary cystadenomas.
- Describe the imaging findings associated with biliary cystadenomas.
- Summarize the appropriate management for patients with biliary cystadenomas.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients with biliary cystadenomas.
