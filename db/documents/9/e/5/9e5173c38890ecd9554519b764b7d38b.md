Non-dystrophic myotonias have generally been regarded to have a benign prognosis. However, data is limited due to the relative rarity of the illnesses. The severity of illness is thought to be best correlated with the acuity of the patient’s reported pain and fatigue. In dystrophic myotonias, the severity of illness is best predicted by the severity of the systemic symptoms involved. Given that myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 2 can often present with significant systemic symptoms, the morbidity of a patient’s disease can be severe. However, myopathy is thought to be most severe in the periodic paralyses and can worsen with age and result in permanent severe myopathy.
