Monitoring parameters for calcitriol involve measurements of serum calcium, creatinine, BUN, intact PTH, and phosphate. During titration periods, all patients must be monitored with serum calcium levels twice weekly. According to the KDIGO 2009 guidelines, the corrected total serum calcium and phosphorous levels should be in the normal range for all stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

If hypercalcemia develops, the drug is discontinued immediately until serum calcium levels normalize, at which point treatment can resume at a lower initial dose. In dialysis patients, serum calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, and alkaline phosphatase must be monitored periodically. In hypoparathyroidism patients, serum calcium, phosphorous, and 24-hour urinary calcium levels must be monitored periodically. In predialysis patients, serum calcium, phosphorous, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, and intact PTH are compared at baseline then monthly for 6 months. Therapeutic effectiveness requires aÂ minimum of 600 mg of calcium intake daily, with the recommended dietary allowance for calcium in adults being 800 to 1200 mg.
