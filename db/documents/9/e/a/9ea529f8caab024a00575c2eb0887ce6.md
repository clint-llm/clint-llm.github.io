Two theories are responsible for the development of polydactyly. One is a disorder in the programmed cell death during fetal limb development, and another is the genetic mutations of some gene loci. Limb development and growth are controlled by at least two signals, including the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA), where the sonic hedgehog molecule is found to mediate ZPA activity. Another signal is the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) that expresses fibroblast growth factors.

Preaxial polydactyly is due to the disturbance of the ectodermal and preaxial mesodermal apoptosis during the early embryologic period, approximately before the eighth week. Abnormal expression of genes such as the sonic hedgehog gene, Hox genes, bone morphogenic proteins, and GLI3 in the zone of polarizing activity is responsible for the development of preaxial polydactyly.
