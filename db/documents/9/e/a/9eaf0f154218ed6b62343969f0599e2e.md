Multiple subspecialties may be presented with the initial presentation of enthesopathies, and an astute clinician will need to discern where the patient may need to be referred. Education for localized enthesopathies from repetitive use can be safely done in the clinician’s office or with a skilled physical or occupational therapist. Educating on joint protective measures may also greatly benefit the patient with overuse enthesopathies. For patients with an underlying systemic inflammatory disease, a more thorough and comprehensive educational approach may be necessary. Discussions with subspecialists such as physiatrists, rheumatologists, internal medicine, and immunologists may all be needed to adequately educate and treat select patients.
