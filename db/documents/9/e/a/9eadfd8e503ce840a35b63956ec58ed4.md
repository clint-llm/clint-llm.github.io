Spinal TB is usually secondary to hematogenous spread from a primary site of infection (most commonly the lungs). The paradiscal vessels typically supply the subchondral bone on either side of the disc space and therefore, the most common site of vertebral involvement is paradiscal. The other patterns of involvementÂ include central (with predominant vertebral body involvement), posterior (involving the posterior structures primarily) and non-osseous involvement (presenting with the abscess).
