Acute spinal cord ischemia (ASCI) can occur in a range of clinical settings, but a significant portion of documented cases occur in the setting of acute aortic pathology or aortic surgery. It is thus useful to classify etiologies as spontaneous or periprocedural.

**Spontaneous Causes of Spinal Cord Ischemia**

As with cerebral ischemia/infarction, the TOAST classification system provides a useful schema for developing a differential diagnosis in spinal cord ischemia.

Cervical vessel injury which results in interrupted flow to the upper anterior spinal artery can arise in the setting of trauma, abrupt head-turning, cocaine abuse, and chiropractic manipulation.

**Iatrogenic Causes of Spinal Cord Ischemia**

A significant number of cases of spinal cord ischemia occur in the periprocedural setting. Up to 45% of all reported cord infarctions in one case series were attributed to an iatrogenic cause.

Aortic surgery has long had recognition as a risk factor for spinal cord stroke. Spinal cord ischemia can occur during both cross-clamping and de-clamping, the latter due to abrupt reperfusion of the viscera and resultant hyperperfusion of radicular arteries.

Cord infarction/ischemia following percutaneous procedures is a rare but devastating complication reported following celiac ganglion block, epidural steroid injection, intra-aortic balloon pump, and lumbar epidural catheter placement.
