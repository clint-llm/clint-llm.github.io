Hydroxocobalamin is a precursor of methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, which are the active forms of vitamin B12.

Hydroxocobalamin can serve as an antidoteÂ for cyanide poisoning.

Hydroxocobalamin binds to transcobalamins. Transcobalamin-II is the main serum transport protein that delivers hydroxocobalamin to the tissues.
