Patients with acute hydrocarbon-related illness most often present with respiratory complaints. Symptoms usually occur within 30 minutes of exposure but may be delayed for hours. Patients will typically present with coughing, choking, or vomiting with aspiration.Â  They may have findings of hypoxia and increased work of breathing. Initial neurologic symptoms may be agitation, hallucinations, tremors, but generally, hydrocarbons are neurologic depressants. Patients also may have GI complaints such as a burning sensation or nausea with frequent vomiting. In patients with prolonged exposure, patients may complain of rashes, chronic headaches, peripheral neuropathy, or cognitive impairment.
