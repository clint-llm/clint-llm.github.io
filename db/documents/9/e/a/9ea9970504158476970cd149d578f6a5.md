The patient should be positioned supine with the transducer perpendicular to the floor and coronal to the patient. To obtain the maximal vertical pocket (MVP), the entire uterus is scanned, and the pocket of amniotic fluid with the greatest vertical length is identified. Vertical calipers are used to measure the depth in cm of amniotic fluid, which will appear hypoechoic on ultrasound. The literature interchangeably refers to this as the single deepest pocket (SDP) or occasionally the deepest vertical pocket (DVP).

To obtain the amniotic fluid index (AFI), the same process above is repeated four times. With the uterus divided into four quadrants and the umbilicus as a central point, each quadrant's largest vertical pocket is identified and measured. The criteria above apply to the pockets obtained in each quadrant. The measurements are added to obtain the total.
