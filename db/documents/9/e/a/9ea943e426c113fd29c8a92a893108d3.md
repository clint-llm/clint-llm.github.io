The incidence of nonfatal choking episodes is difficult to measure because many of these events are transient and do not result in visits to a hospital.

Among children, choking rates were highest among infants less than one year, and over 75% of choking incidents occurred in children under 3. No significant difference appeared in the choking rates between boys and girls.

Among adults, conditions associated with a higher risk of choking include AlzheimerÂ disease, parkinsonism, prior stroke, intellectual or developmental disability, poor dentition, intoxication, dysphagia along with psychotropic medications, and advanced age.
