Foscarnet is often contraindicated for patients with underlying diseases that increase the effect of the adverse reaction profile of the drug. With the health care provider’s medical discretion, the drug is either used with extreme caution or not used at all in patients who have abnormal EKG readings due to chronic cardiac problems, chronic kidney disease with decreased renal function, underlying electrolyte abnormalities (which have to be corrected to be able to administer foscarnet) or seizure disorders. Foscarnet is also contraindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema or a history of anaphylactic reactions to it.

Significant and contraindicated drug interactions include concurrent use with cidofovir, pimozide, and thioridazine.
