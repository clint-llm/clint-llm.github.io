LBBB is often detected on ECG. Diagnostic criteria are defined by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) as follows:

- Rhythm must be of super-ventricular origin (EG: ventricular activation coming from atrial or AV nodal activation)

- QRS Duration greater than 120 ms

- Lead V1 should have either a QS or a small r wave with large S wave

- Lead V6 should have a notched R wave and no Q wave
