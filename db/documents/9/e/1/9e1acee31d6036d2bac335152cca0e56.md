The primary complications from snake envenomations are due to the direct toxic effects. The localized tissue damage may require debridement or even amputation in severe cases. Reports exist of massive coagulopathies leading to profound blood loss. These coagulopathies usually resolve within 48 hours of the snake envenomation. Profound neuromuscular blockade can also occur, leading to pulmonary insufficiency if the diaphragm is involved. These symptoms also typically resolve within 72 hours of envenomation.

The administration of snake antivenom requires monitoring for signs of adverse reactions. These include an anaphylactic reaction that may occur within the first few minutes of administration and up to two hours.  If a severe anaphylactic response is suspected, the infusion should stop, and the administration of epinephrine and an anti-histamine should follow. Patients may also develop a hypersensitivity reaction leading to pruritus, hives, nausea, and mild hypotension. This reaction may occur at any time during the antivenom administration and will dissipate once the infusion is complete. There are also documented cases of serum sickness as a side effect that may occur up to two weeks after administration. This usually presents as an influenza-like illness with a rash, and possible microhematuria. This condition responds well to a short course of antihistamines and oral corticosteroids.
