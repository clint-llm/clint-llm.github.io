Imaging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows an encapsulated mass with no vascularization and delayed enhancement. Histology is not always a requirement for diagnosis in the presence of clinical phenotype and MRI findings. Electrocardiogram (ECG) in most fibroma patients shows T-wave abnormalities, and VT morphologies on ECG are mostly consistent with an origin near the tumor site. In adults, it is also reported to present as a fixed defect on myocardial perfusion imaging.
