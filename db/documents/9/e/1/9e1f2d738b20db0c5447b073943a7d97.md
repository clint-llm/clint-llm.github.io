Splenic rupture can be divided into two major categories: traumatic and non-traumatic rupture. The most prevalent major mechanism in traumatic injury (50% to 75%) is the result of motor vehicle injury. Direct abdominal blows and falls are the remaining major causes of traumatic rupture. Additionally, traumatic rupture can present immediately after an injury or may present in a delayed fashion. Non-traumatic splenic rupture is very uncommon, though can be related to underlying pathologic conditions or may be idiopathic.
