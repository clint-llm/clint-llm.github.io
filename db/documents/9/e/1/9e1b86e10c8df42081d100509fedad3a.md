Conservative: Given the dormant nature of the PHH, it mainly presents late as an emergency with complication, or when they are very large (at high risk of developing gastric volvulus), there is no published evidence for conservative management.

Operative: Laparoscopic approach is recommended for all large and symptomatic cases. The repair aims to achieve a complete reduction of the hernia content along with excision of the sac. Once the boundaries of parahiatal defect are clearly identified, which could only be achieved if the oesophageal hiatus is fully dissected, the left part of the right crus and left crus is approximated tension-free interrupted non-absorbable stitches (see Video Part 1).

If the tissue quality is poor or the defect is large enough, reinforcement techniques should be considered. With mesh, our preferred choice is an absorbable bio-mesh. In the presence of reflux symptoms or when the whole GOJ is disentangled, an anti-reflux procedure may be necessary.

Partial Toupet fundoplication is our preferred and standard practice, but it is dependent on the surgeonâ€™s preference and expertise. (see Video Part 2)
