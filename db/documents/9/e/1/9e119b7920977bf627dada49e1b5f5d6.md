The typical timeframe for the appearance of SSI symptoms is 3-7 days post-procedure, and as per definition, they have to occur within 30 days post-surgery (or one year in cases with implant). Patients with metabolic syndrome, especially diabetics, smokers, elderly, and immunosuppressed people, are at higher risk. People with difficult/long or contaminated surgery are at higher risk as well. Most patients complain of a gradual onset of pain and discharge, and they may feel generally unwell.

Clinical features of surgical site infections are similar to the classical five signs of inflammation, but some small details set them apart. These include erythema, localized pain, unexplained persistent pyrexia, discharge from the wound (often purulent), wound dehiscence, and problems with wound healing.

When suspecting wound infection, dressings should be removed. The wound blisters, tight closure, grey, or black tissue will alert the clinician that there is ischemia and/or necrosis, therefore, increased risk of wound infection. If there is discharge, a microbiology sample at this point needs to be taken, and treatment commenced if the suspected diagnosis is wound infection. A serous or sanguineous discharge does not indicate infection, but purulent discharge does.

The examination would include assessing patients for sepsis from the wound, also from other causes, and starting appropriate therapy.

A study measuring the effect of introducing wound photography for scenarios where face to face review is not possible showed improvements in diagnostic accuracy and helped prevent overtreatment.
