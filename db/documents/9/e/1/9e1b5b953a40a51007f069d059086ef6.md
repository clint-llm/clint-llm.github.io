Tietze syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion after a thorough workup of life-threatening or more common diseases has been completed. An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed on all patients that present with acute chest pain. Lab results for this syndrome are non-specific. Biopsy of the costal cartilage can lead to a more prompt diagnosis if obtained early in the disease progression. Ultrasound has proven to be the most effective modality to assist in the diagnosis of Tietze syndrome as it can quickly demonstrate soft tissue swelling at the site of inflammation. Another useful diagnostic tool, though not specific, is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which accurately identifies alterations in the neighboring fat tissue and bone marrow due to inflammation. These inflammatory changes can lead to compression and joint narrowing of the affected articulation.

Radiographs are typically read as normal, while computed tomography (CT) may show a slight focal swelling or mild sclerosing of the symptomatic joint.
