Long-term erectile dysfunction due to damage from prolonged priapism is possible. The longer the duration of the priapism, the greater the damage to corpora cavernosal tissues.

Glans necrosis is a very uncommon complication of priapism. Non-surgical options, including a Winter or similar type of cavernosum - spongiosum shunt with continuous irrigation of normal or heparinized saline, have reportedly been more successful in treatment than immediate surgical excision.
