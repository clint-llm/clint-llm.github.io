Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast is the gold standard for evaluating intraventricular lesions. On the brain MRI with and without contrast, intraventricular meningioma appears as a solid, well-circumscribed mass, iso- or hypointense on T1 and T2-weighted images, and showing homogeneous contrast enhancement.

Head computed tomographic (CT) scans and brain digital subtraction angiography (DSA) may provide additional relevant information. Calcifications are easily seen on the head CT scan. DSA will show the tumors' specific feeders, and in large tumors, they can be embolized preoperatively. The vascular supply is usually from the anterior choroidal artery, but in larger lesions, the posterior choroidal artery also contributes. Typically, these tumors are highly vascularized. They drain into the deep ventricular veins.

Diffusion tensor imaging and functional MRI can help delineate and plan surgical approaches.
