Described in detail below is the piston syringe technique which can be performed in almost all environments with equipment that is universal to most medical clinics.

A 35 to 50mL syringe may be attached to an eye cup (to prevent splash back) or an 18 gauge plastic catheter. The syringe may be filled with the operatorâ€™s choice of irrigation solution as discussed above. An assembly consisting of a 19-gauge plastic attached to a 35 to 50mL syringe produces a pressure of 25 to 40 PSI when pushing the barrel of the syringe with both hands.
