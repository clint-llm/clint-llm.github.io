Cameron lesions pose a diagnostic challenge to physicians. The laboratory tests show iron deficiency with low hemoglobin levels and microcytic hypochromic anemia. Iron studies reveal low iron and ferritin levels with high total iron-binding capacity.

Endoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis, although it is not uncommon to overlook these lesions due to their unique location. They are often missed on the initial endoscopy and are usually discovered on subsequent endoscopies.

Newer diagnostic studies like magnification chromoendoscopy may be useful to demonstrate the mucosal defects. They have also been shown to be useful in situations where there are no well-defined lesions. The usefulness of capsule endoscopy has not been fully documented. Given the short transit time and the cost involved, it is unlikely to be a diagnostic modality of choice.
