Mendel’s laws come to light within human pathologies in the way of single-gene or monogenic disorders. Disorders that follow an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance manifest when an individual inherits at least one dominant allele (A) for a disorder gene. Following Mendel’s Law of Dominance and Uniformity, only one dominant allele within the disease gene is necessary for an individual to be affected or show the phenotype. The classic example is as follows: if one parent is affected with an autosomal dominant disorder, thus heterozygous (Aa), while the other parent is not affected and homozygous (aa), then 50% of the offspring will have the chance of 1) receiving one dominant allele, resulting in the heterozygous (Aa) state and being affected with the disorder or 2) receiving both recessive alleles, resulting in the homozygous (aa) state and not being affected with the disorder. Please see Figure 1 for segregation, as illustrated through a Punnett Square.

The most expeditious way to determine the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of a disorder within a family is by analyzing the family pedigree. Since autosomal dominant disorders involve autosomes or the non-sex chromosomes, the disorders affect males and females equally. Also, autosomal dominant disorders rarely skip generations because they only require the inheritance of one dominant allele to express the phenotype of the disorder. The chance of inheriting and expressing the disorder phenotype is dependent on the genotype and phenotype of the parents.

If one parent is heterozygous (i.e., Aa) and affected with the disorder, approximately 50% of the offspring have the chance of inheriting a dominant allele and thus being affected with the disorder, as previously mentioned. If both parents are heterozygous and affected by the disorder, 75% of the offspring have the chance of inheriting a dominant allele and being affected by the disorder. If one parent is homozygous (i.e., AA) and affected by the disorder, all of the offspring may have the chance of inheriting a dominant allele and being affected by the disorder.

Though dominant inheritance is common, dominant conditions can occur sporadically or de novo within a family due to sporadic mutation in parental gonads or within the developing fetus. In fact, many autosomal dominant disorder mutations arise de novo, or for the first time within a family, in an affected individual. de novo mutations are not inherited from a parent; therefore, siblings of an affected individual are very unlikely to be affected. If the affected individual is heterozygous (Aa) and has a child with an unaffected individual (aa), the children will have a 50% chance of inheriting a dominant allele (Aa) and being affected by the disorder. Germline mosaicism can also play a factor; however, in that, if a parent only has the mutation in their germline, they can have a higher recurrence risk (50% rather than <1%).

As with any heritable single-gene disorder, penetrance plays a role. Penetrance is measured by the percentage of individuals who inherit a disorder allele AND display the phenotype of the disorder.
