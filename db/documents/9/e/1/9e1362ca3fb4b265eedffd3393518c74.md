The function of albumin in the serum is multifaceted. Albumin is a protein that can carry lipid-soluble substancesÂ such as thyroid hormone, sex hormones, and triglycerides. It also serves a major role in contributing to the plasma oncotic pressure as it can comprise up to 50% of all circulating serum proteins.

Ions and glucose contribute to 95% of the osmotic pressure as they are the most abundant in the serum. Osmolality, and subsequently, osmotic pressure, is not affected by the size or charge of the solutes but only the number of solutes.

The function of osmolality and oncotic pressure is to keep the ions suspended in solution at optimal concentrations, which are set by the cells in the body, which helps create ion gradients leading to action potential generation, muscle contractions, and adequate glucose supply in the serum.
