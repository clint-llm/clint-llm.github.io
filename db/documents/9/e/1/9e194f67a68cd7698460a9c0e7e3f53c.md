Quinapril is a non-sulphylhydryl ACE inhibitor that acts by blocking the action of ACE, which plays a vital role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Quinapril is metabolized into quinaprilat in the liver, where the drug enters circulation. After conversion, the liver releases quinaprilat into the peripheral circulation, inhibiting ACE; the enzyme is responsible for converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is the hormone that promotes the stimulation of the hormone aldosterone, which is responsible for salt and water retention.

**Pharmacokinetics**

- Time for peak plasma concentration: within 1 hour

- Extent of absorption: approximately 60% (based on quinapril and its metabolites)

- Food ( high fatty meal): rate and extent of absorption decrease to 30%

- Plasma protein binding: 97%
