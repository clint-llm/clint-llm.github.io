The complications arise not from stuttering priapism itself but from acute ischemic episodes if they arise. If not treated within 24 hours, ischemic priapism can lead to fibrosis of the corpus cavernosum and eventually to significant erectile dysfunction.

Half or more patients with even one episode of prolonged priapism will develop erectile dysfunction (ED). This rate increases with the repeated episodes found in stuttering priapism. Liability exposure to the treating physicians is relatively high as patients may become upset with a poor outcome (ED) or repeated episodes of priapism despite correct treatment and counseling on presentation. Meticulous documentation is therefore recommended.

There are also several psychological issues that arise from stuttering priapism like sadness (70%), embarrassment (62%), fear (44%), and exhaustion (39%) which should be recognized and addressed appropriately.
