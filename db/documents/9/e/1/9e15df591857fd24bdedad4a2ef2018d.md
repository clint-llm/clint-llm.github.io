Lesser/true pelvic cavity is lined by obturator internus and piriformis muscles laterally. The piriformis muscle also creates the posterior wall. The inferior border of the pelvic cavity is the pelvic floor formed by levator ani and coccygeus muscles. The pelvic floor has 2 "gaps": urogenital hiatus and rectal hiatus. Three separate muscles form levator ani muscles: pubococcygeus, puborectalis, and iliococcygeus, symmetrically arranged about the midline.

The pubococcygeus muscle is the main muscle of the levator ani providing support to the pubic viscera. Puborectalis muscle is a U-shaped muscle around the rectal hiatus. When contracted, it maintains fecal continence. This muscle is relaxed during defecation. Some fibers of the muscle loop around the urethra and vagina in females, assuring urinary continence when contracted. Iliococcygeus muscle elevates the pelvic floor. The coccygeus muscle is the most posterior muscle of the pelvic floor, adding to the muscles of the pelvic floor function of visceral support.

The perineal body is a fibromuscular structure in between the vagina and anal canal that is very important in support of the pelvic viscera. Any damage to the perineal body might (usually during vaginal delivery) lead to prolapse of the uterus and other pelvic organs.
