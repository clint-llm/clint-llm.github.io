- It is essential to monitor patients' response to benztropine treatment and any unwanted anticholinergic effects. For instance, patients with mental disorders can have a wide variety of reactions to benztropine treatment. Thus, they should be kept under close monitoring and observation, especially at the beginning of the treatment or when dose increment is required in their cases to prevent any intensification of their mental symptoms.

- Geriatric patients are more sensitive and have an intense response to anticholinergic medicines. Thus, the healthcare team should give extra attention to the dose and its effects on other pre-existing disorders that the patient has. Therefore, during benztropine use in geriatric patients, the dose should be started at the lower end before building it up later because of higher sensitivity for the drug's side effects, e.g., confusion.

- It is crucial to provide sufficient clinical monitoring for benztropine administration in a relatively warm environment as it can cause anhydrosis to specific groups of patients. In other words, the administrationÂ of benztropine should be careful in alcoholic patients and patients conducting manual labor in hot and humid weather. Therefore, meticulous supervision and monitoring, in this case, is a vital need.
