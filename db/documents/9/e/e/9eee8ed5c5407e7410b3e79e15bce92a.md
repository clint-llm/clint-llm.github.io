PRRT involvesÂ complex clinical and navigational patient needs and thorough inter-departmental communication for preparing a patient for each therapy. A nurse navigator is vital in providing a cohesive solution to address the multifaceted operational requirements associated with PRRT. The navigator offers critical ambulatory support to each patient throughout the treatment journey by delivering multi-disciplinary coordination and patient education, monitoring treatment-related adverse effects, and following radiation safety protocols.
