The complications of Pierre Robin sequence are due to airway obstruction. Short term complications from airway obstruction include desaturations, difficulty feeding, and aspiration events. Long term complications may be attributed to hypoxic injury and inability to feed well. This may include cerebral impairment, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, and failure to thrive.Â Procedural complications relating to PRS are discussed in the treatment/management section. Early detection of PRS can help prevent long term complications of airway obstruction and hypoxemia.
