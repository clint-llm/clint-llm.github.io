ANUG remains largely a clinical diagnosis; thus, the physical exam is critical. The diagnosis is based on three essential findings. Necessary findings include mouth pain, usually of rapid onset, gum bleeding, and, most specifically, ulceration and necrosis of the interdental papillae.

The diagnosis of ANUG is associated with poor oral hygiene and weakening of the host immune system, particularly in the setting of HIV infection.
