Prepatellar bursitis may present acutely or chronically. The underlying causes should also be addressed, such as with medical therapies for gout and antimicrobial therapy for septic bursitis. The general approach to the treatment of bursitis should be focused on conservative therapies of rest, ice, activity modification, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and aspiration.
