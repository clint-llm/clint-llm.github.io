The optimal IMRT dose decreased to 20 to 25 Gy in CS I and 30 to 36 Gy in CS IIs.

In one study from Mass General, photon beams were weighted to yield a maximum of 26 Gy(RBE) and a minimum of 25.5 Gy(RBE) in 1.5 Gy(RBE)/fraction to the CTV. A 5 mm compensator expansion was added for proton plans to emulate a PTV expansion in photon treatment planning.
