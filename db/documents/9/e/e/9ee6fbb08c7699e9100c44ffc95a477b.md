The common iliac artery bifurcates into the external and internal iliac artery. The origin of the internal iliac artery is commonly found at the spine levels L5-S2 anteriorly and superiority to the sacroiliac joint. The superior gluteal artery is found posteriorly to the sacroiliac joint at the spine levels of S2-S3.

Many blood vessels supply the sacroiliac joint. The posterior aspect is supplied by the median sacral artery and lateral sacral artery which arise from the internal iliac. The anterior aspect is supplied by the iliolumbar artery which originates either from the internal iliac or common iliac artery. The venous drainage of the joint flows into the internal iliac vein thus correlating to the arterial supplies described above.
