Behavior and lifestyle play a significant role in improving or deteriorating health outcomes for many of the most frequent medical conditions seen across different medical specialties. While behavior modification and lifestyle improvement are challenging, they are possible and should be a priority for healthcare teams. For better outcomes, behavior modification strategies should be an interprofessional collaboration with valuable contributions from professionals with different backgrounds and scopes of practice.

Physicians can identify behavioral risk factors and behavior-related health conditions and develop treatment plans for lifestyle improvement. Nurses can aid with patient education on behavior modification techniques and provide ongoing support to help patients maintain their behavior. Pharmacists can help manage medication and ensure patients receive appropriate pharmacological support to enhance weight loss and alcohol and tobacco cessation. Dietitians can provide nutritional guidance specific to patient needs and preferences. Behavioral therapists and mental health professionals can assist patients in identifying and replacing maladaptive cognitive patterns directly or indirectly related to health behaviors, provide emotional support, and help increase patients’ self-efficacy. Social workers can help identify socioeconomic barriers to behavior modification and provide alternatives specific to the patient’s situation.
