Stroke is the third leading cause of death and major disability in the united states. Atherosclerosis of extracranial and intracranial cerebral arteries has been identified as the major cause of ischemic stroke. The evaluation of atherosclerotic burden, therefore, is very crucial for stroke risk stratification. Grayscale ultrasound imaging combined with color Doppler and spectral waveform analysis is a widely available tool that can assess the morphology of plaques and detect hemodynamically significant stenosis. Besides the screening, doppler examination of extracranial carotid is also beneficial to evaluate the potential complications of vascular interventions such as pseudoaneurysm formation, restenosis of carotid arteries, fistula formation, and stent deformation and fracture.
