When patients are referred for spherical equivalent correction, clinicians must be on the lookout for signs suggesting underlying disease. In such cases, patients gain more quality care from a multifaceted assessment. The timely adoption of an interprofessional approach is critical for these individuals. People with diabetes with poor glucose control regimens, for example, may be first seen by the optometrist or ophthalmologist with complaints of transient blurry vision. These individuals may require multiple changes to spectacle prescription without timely referral to endocrinology for the underlying metabolic disorder.

For patients who may have logged multiple visits to the eye clinic before presenting with similar complaints, the spherical equivalent also enables delineating acute changes in the ocular refractive state. The clinician must have a thorough approach when assessing refractive errors, considering that several pathologic conditions may masquerade as changes in refractive defects.[Level 3] Moreover, the optometrist and ophthalmologist must select which patients are not suited for toric correction and can benefit from spherical equivalent lens prescriptions.
