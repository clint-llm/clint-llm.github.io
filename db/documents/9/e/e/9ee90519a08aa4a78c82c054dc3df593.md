- Scoring systems are devised to predict prognosis with meningococcal disease. Most prognostic scoring systems agree that purpura fulminans and shock are poor prognostic signs.

- The Glasgow meningococcal septicemia prognostic score (GMSPS) evaluates 7 key items: hypotension, the difference in skin-core temperature, coma, acute deterioration, the absence of meningismus, progressive purpura, and base deficit.

- At Los Angeles Children's Hospital,Â 5 features were correlated with a poor prognosis: Shock or seizures, hypothermia, total WBC count less than 5000/mm, platelet count less than 100,000/mm, and development of Purpura fulminans.

- The overall mortality of invasive meningococcal disease in the United States is 7% to 19%.

- A retrospective population-based analysis of meningococcal disease mortality in the United States from 1990 to 2002 identified 3335 meningococcal deaths.
