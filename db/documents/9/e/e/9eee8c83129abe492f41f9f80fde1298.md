Tetracyclines (tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, tigecycline) are a class of medication used to manage and treat various bacterial infections. Tetracyclines classify as protein synthesis inhibitor antibiotics and are considered to be broad-spectrum. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for tetracyclines as a valuable agent in treating bacterial infections. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and relevant interactions pertinent for members of the healthcare team involved in patient care of these infections.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of tetracyclines. 
- Review the potential adverse effects of tetracyclines. 
- Describe appropriate monitoring necessary for patients receiving tetracyclines. 
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance tetracycline use and improve outcomes.
