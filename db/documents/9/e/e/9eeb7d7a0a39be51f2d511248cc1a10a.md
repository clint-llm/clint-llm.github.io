**Laboratory**

Only elevated thallium levels in hair, nails, blood, urine, feces and saliva can make a definitive clinical diagnosis. A 24-hour urine thallium concentration, assayed by atomic absorption photospectrometry, is the standard method. Although a urine spot test is faster, it has a high false-positive rate. Blood thallium levels may be falsely negative. The following are other tests to order:

- Complete blood count with differential

- Electrolyte

- Glucose

- Blood urea nitrogen

- Liver function test

- Calcium

**Radiographic**

Thallium is radiopaque. Thallium may be reviled after ingestion.

**Other Tests**

Electrocardiograms should be ordered to evaluate for arrhythmias and tachycardia. An electroencephalogram should be ordered for any seizure-like activity as well as a nerve conduction study for patients experiencing neurological symptoms.
