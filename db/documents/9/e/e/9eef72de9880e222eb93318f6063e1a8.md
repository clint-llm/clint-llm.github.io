Treatment of POI is largely based on estrogen repletion to diminish vasomotor symptoms, maintain bone density, decrease fracture risk, decrease cardiovascular and autoimmune morbidity and mortality, protect cognitive function, and improve the overall well-being of the patients affected.

Of note, in premenopausal women with POI who desire fertility, cyclic bleeding cycles are preferred to maximize their chances of successful embryo transfer or even naturally occurring pregnancy.

In regards to assisted reproduction and fertility, there is no evidence that ovulation induction can be reliably achieved with gonadotropins or GnRH analogs. Spontaneous ovulation in women with POI has shown the greatest success of pregnancy.

Furthermore, diagnosis of POI can incur devastating psychological effects not only for the patient but also for the patientsâ€™ significant other and family. It is imperative that the patient is followed closely in the clinic and given the resources necessary to establish care with a behavioral health specialist and therapist to facilitate discussion and coping with the emotional stressors associated with POI.
