E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) is a potentially fatal disease, with 68 deaths reported as of this writing. A significant number of patients may end up requiring non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. A recent study of 98Â patients showed that as many as 76% of the cases needed supplemental oxygen, 22% required non-invasive ventilation (NIV), and 26% required intubation and mechanical ventilation.
