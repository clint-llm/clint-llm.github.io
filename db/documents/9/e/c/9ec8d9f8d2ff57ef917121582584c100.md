The uterine and ovarian arteries supply blood to the uterus. These arteries become the arcuate arteries; then, the arcuate arteries send off radial branches which supply blood to theÂ two layers of the endometrium, the functionality and basalis layers. Progesterone levels fall at the end of the menstrual cycle, leading to enzymatic breakdown of the functionalis layer of the endometrium. This breakdown leads to blood loss and sloughing, which makes up menstruation. Functioning platelets, thrombin, and vasoconstriction of the arteries to the endometrium control blood loss. Any derangement in the structure of the uterus (such as leiomyoma, polyps, adenomyosis, malignancy, or hyperplasia), derangements to the clotting pathways (coagulopathies or iatrogenically), or disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis (through ovulatory/endocrine disorders or iatrogenically) can affect menstruation and lead to abnormal uterine bleeding.
