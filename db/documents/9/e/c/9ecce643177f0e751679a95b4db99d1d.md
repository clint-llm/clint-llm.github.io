Monitoring should include subjective as well as objective assessment via laboratory testing. There must be documentation of pain intensity, level of functioning, progress toward therapeutic goals, the presence ofÂ adverse effects, and adherence to the therapy.

Monitoring with tools such as the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) for Narcotic abuse helps identify patients with an increased risk for misuse and who might benefit more from other pain control modalities besides narcotics (for patients with chronic pain). Clinicians can use the Revised Opioid Risk Tool for patients with chronic nonmalignant pain (CNMP).
