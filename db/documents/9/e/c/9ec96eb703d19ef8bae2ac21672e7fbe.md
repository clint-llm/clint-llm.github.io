Variability in patient presentation is related to the underlying pathophysiologic causes of hearing loss. A typical patient with hearing loss may present with self-reported hearing loss. Family members or friends may notice that the patient has difficulty hearing, such as difficulty comprehending speech, requiring loud television or radio, or changes in social interaction.

Careful attention is necessary when questioning the onset, duration, and timing of symptoms. One should also inquire about differences in the sides, fullness, otorrhea, and otalgia. Certain causes of hearing loss also have higher rates of vertigo, tinnitus, and vestibular dysfunction, so each should be assessed in a history.

A thorough head and neck physical exam should always be performed in patients with hearing loss, including visualization of the tympanic membrane and in-office hearing tests, including tuning-fork exams (Weber and Rinne) and gross hearing exam (finger rub test). These simple exam techniques may first lead a provider in the correct diagnostic direction and typically have reliable specificity.
