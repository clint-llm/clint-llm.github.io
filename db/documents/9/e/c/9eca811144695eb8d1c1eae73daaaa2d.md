The medial pterygoid muscle has a superficial and a deep head which arise from different areas of the jaw. The lateral pterygoid muscle via its lower head separates the two distinct heads. The smaller superficial head has its origin mainly from the maxillary tuberosity with some fibers arising from the pyramidal process of the palatine bone. The larger deep head has its origin from the medial side of a horseshoe-shaped extension of the sphenoid bone (lateral pterygoid plate) at the base of the skull.

Its fibers pass in a downward, lateral, and posterior direction and have their insertion via a strong tendinous lamina, into the roughened area on the lower and posterior part of the medial or inner surface of the ramus and angle of the mandible, as high as the mandibular foramen.

The muscle is divided by the tendinous sheets into three layers recognizable in its upper one third.

The lingual nerve runs in an anteroinferior direction lateral to the belly of the medial pterygoid muscle and medial to the mandible. The area between the medial pterygoid muscle and superior constrictor muscle is referred to as the prestyloid space, which is filled with fat.
