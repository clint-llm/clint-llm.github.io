Voclosporin is dosed and administered in the following manner:

In adults with active lupus nephritis, when combined with background immunosuppressive therapy:

- 23.7 mg twice daily by mouth. To ensure adequate absorption, voclosporin must be taken on an empty stomach.

Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with renal dysfunction and are as follows:

- If eGFR is <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and reduced from baseline by >20% and <30%, the dose should be reduced by 7.9 mg twice daily.

- Upon re-assessing the eGFR within 2 weeks, if it is still reduced from baseline by >20%, reduce the dose again by 7.9 mg twice daily.

- If eGFR is <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and reduced from baseline by >30%, voclosporin should be discontinued.

- For patients with a decrease in dose due to eGFR, consider increasing the dose by 7.9 mg twice daily for each eGFR measurement that is ≥80% of baseline; do not exceed the starting dose.

- If voclosporin is used in patients with severe renal impairment at baseline (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min the recommended starting dose is 15.8 mg twice a day.

- In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with or without hemodialysis, the pharmacokinetics of voclosporin is unknown.

Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with hepatic dysfunction and are as follows:

- In patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B), the recommended dose is 15.8 mg twice daily.

- Voclosporin is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).

**Drug Interactions**

- Voclosporin is a CYP3A4 substrate. When co-administered with other medications that are moderate or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, it reduces clearance and increases voclosporin levels. The increased levels can increase the risk of voclosporin-associated adverse reactions.

- AReducingthe dose of voclosporin is recommended when co-administered with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors such as verapamil, fluconazole, and diltiazem.

- When voclosporin is co-administered with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers, the combination increases voclosporin metabolism, reducing the efficacy of voclosporin.

- Voclosporin is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Hence, caution is required upon co-administration with other P-gp inhibitors such as verapamil, sertraline, erythromycin, and reserpine. If P-gp substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, such as digoxin, are co-administered with voclosporin, then a dose reduction of P-gb substrates may be required.

- There is no clinically significant interaction between voclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil. There is no necessity for dose adjustment when these medications are administered simultaneously.
