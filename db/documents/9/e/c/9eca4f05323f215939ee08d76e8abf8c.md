If treatment is not initiated, progressive right heart failure and death occur in patients with PAH. Recent data from the United States suggests 1-year mortality as high as 8% for intermediate risk and 19% for high-risk patients, with 3-year mortality rates being 20% and 55% for those groups, respectively.****This emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and aggressive therapy. Prognosis varies among different subgroups of PAH based on underlying etiology. Among patients with LHD, the presence of PH and right ventricular dysfunction is associated with high mortality.
