Polyhydramnios occurs in 1% to 2% of all pregnancies.

Idiopathic polyhydramnios is less likely to be associated with an underlying disease process. However, an underlying disease or congenital anomaly has been identified in 91% of cases with more severe polyhydramnios. These patients are more likely to be symptomatic due to significant amniotic fluid volume.
