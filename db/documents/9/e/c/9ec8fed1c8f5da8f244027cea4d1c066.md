An interprofessional approach to actinic purpura is needed. Actinic purpura is a very common condition, especially in elderly individuals. Although the condition is benign, the skin is easily prone to bleeding, even with minor trauma. Healthcare workers, including nurse practitioners, can play a key role in the prevention of this condition. Patients should be encouraged to keep their skin moisturized, use sunscreen, wear sun-protective garments, including a wide-brimmed hat, and try to avoid direct sun exposure and trauma. It should also be noted that patients with actinic purpura are also more prone to develop actinic keratosis, hence proper awareness and a biopsy may be required.
