The ischemia-reperfusion inflammatory reaction can occur with any injury that involves the ischemic interruption of vascular flow. This includes many soft tissue injuries involving crushing force, myocardial ischemia, and stroke. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment is not only an adjunctive treatment aimed at reducing ischemic tissue damage but, when used early enough post-injury, may actually mitigate the ischemia-reperfusion response altogether. Due to a paucity of available hyperbaric chambers in many regions and lack of experience or knowledge regarding its indications, it is an often-missed therapeutic option. This activity educates the learner on the etiology and pathophysiology of ischemia-reperfusion injuries, reviews the treatment of these injuries with hyperbaric oxygen, and highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing patients with ischemia-reperfusion injuries.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the factors leading to reperfusion injury.
- Identify key treatment considerations related to the treatment of ischemia-reperfusion injury with hyperbaric oxygen.
- Review the potential adverse effects of treating ischemia-reperfusion injury with hyperbaric oxygen.
- Explain the importance of well-integrated interprofessional communication to advance the treatment of ischemia-reperfusion injury and improve patient outcomes.
