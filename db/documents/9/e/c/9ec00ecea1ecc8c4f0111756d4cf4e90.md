Nocturnal cough causes disturbed sleep, which may cause neuropsychiatric disorders in patients. A study by Won et al showed that in adults, chronic cough impacts health-related quality of life. Persons with a chronic cough had a significantly lower overall EQ-5D-3L index score than individuals without chronic cough, with the impact on quality of life being particularly large in women 65 years or older. A greater association was reported between chronic cough and anxiety/depression, pain/discomfort, and usual activities than with self-care or mobility.
