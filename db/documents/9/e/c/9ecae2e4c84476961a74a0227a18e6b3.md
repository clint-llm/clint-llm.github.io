Bombesin binds to G protein-coupled receptors, which stimulate adenylate cyclase, increasing intracellular cyclic adenine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and activating intracellular signal cascades. These cascades propagate, leading to calcium, sodium, and potassium fluxes inducing the modulation of growth factor receptors, and expression of the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-myc.

Bombesin G protein-coupled receptor signal-cascade also results in the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) through the phosphatidylinositol second-messenger system.

Bombesin-associated extracellular events include stimulation of mitogenesis and monocyte chemoattraction.
