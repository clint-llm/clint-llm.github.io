There are few absolute contraindications to brachioplasty. These include lymphoedema, peripheral arterial ischemia, and venous insufficiency, as well as those at high risk of lymphedema, such as a history of axillary dissection and radiotherapy.

Relative contraindications take into account the aforementioned preoperative assessment. They include BMI>30, unstable weight, current smoking, comorbidities such as poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, nutritional deficiencies, BDD, and untreated or poorly managed psychiatric disorders.

More specifically, some patients may not be ideal candidates for brachioplasty. This may be due to little skin laxity (e.g., <5 cm ptosis) or residual excess adiposity unaddressed by MWL. Other patients may warrant a short-scar brachioplasty with limited resection, while others may be better suited to an extended brachioplasty that entails excision of excess tissue on the lateral chest wall. Decision-making on the most appropriate operation (if any) is contingent on a thorough preoperative examination and a plan tailored to each individual.
