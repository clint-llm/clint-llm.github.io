The hip joint has a complex innervation, and the pain following hip fractures or total hip arthroplasties is particularly severe. An appropriate plan for perioperative analgesia is challenging, but a multimodal approach including acetaminophen, cox-2 selective NSAIDs, regional anesthesia, and periarticular infiltration techniques improves patient outcomes.

The ultrasound-guided PENG block allows for coverage of the hip joint, targeting the proximal articular branches that innervate the joint capsule. This proximal approach via ultrasound guidance can confer several advantages over a femoral nerve block by providing more complete analgesia to the hip joint. Additionally, the motor function of the involved extremity should be spared. The PENG blockÂ can be used alone as a primary analgesic or in conjunction with other forms of anesthesia during surgery or in the perioperative period. For lateral surgical incisions, a supplemental lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block provides additional coverage.
