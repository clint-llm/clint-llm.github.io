Thyroid adenomas are homogeneous, solitary, and encapsulated tumors. They are usually classified as follicular or papillary based on pathology findings. The follicular type is the most commonly seen type, whereas the papillary adenomas are extremely rare. There are five subtypes of follicular adenomas:

- Fetal type

- Colloid type

- Embryonal type

- Hurthle cell type

- Hyalinizing trabecular type

The classification of follicular adenomas into subtypes is based on histological findings such as cellular architecture and the amount of colloid content. It is highly recommended that thyroid adenomas be differentiated from thyroid carcinomas. This is usually done through histological evidence of capsular invasion and angioinvasion that strongly suggests when a thyroid lesion is of malignant nature.
