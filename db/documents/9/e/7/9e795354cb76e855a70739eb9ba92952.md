The clinical manifestations of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth classically include a combination of abdominal discomfort with bloating, flatulence, or chronic watery diarrhea. Steatorrhea and weight loss from fat malabsorption may also manifest, especially with altered gut anatomy (blind loop syndrome).

D-lactic acidosis is a rare neurological syndrome that can present withÂ altered mental status, slurred speech, seizures, and ataxia. This syndrome results from bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates. Patients with SIBO associated with short bowel syndrome or a jejunoileal bypass can develop this syndrome.
