Bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa are all causes of microbial keratitis. Fungal keratitis (FK) was first documented in 1879, and its incidence has been increasing for the past 30 years. It accounts for about 40% to 50% of all microbial keratitis cases.

More than 100 different fungal species are capable of causing FK.

Trauma, immunocompromised state, ocular surface disease, and contact lens wear are the most prevalent personal risk factors associated with FK and may predispose to different types of fungal infections.

Clinically, it may be challenging to diagnose a fungal infection as a cause for keratitis and diagnostic delays are common with negative or delayed culture results. A high index of suspicion is, therefore, usually required depending on the presence of specific risk factors for FK. Even if the diagnosis is made, management is still challenging as many antifungal agents have poor penetration into the cornea.
