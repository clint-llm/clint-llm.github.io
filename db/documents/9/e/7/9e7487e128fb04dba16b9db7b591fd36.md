There is a limitation in predicting which patients are at increased risk of developing neutrophilia, given multiple contributing factors. Certain social factors like smoking status, stress, and exercise level can also impact neutrophilia risk. There are more consistent ethnical differences among patients with neutropenia than neutrophilia patients; relative to white people, black people have a lower total WBC count and lower neutrophil count. However, the Latino population is noted to have a higher leukocyte count (mean difference 0.16×10^9/L) and higher neutrophil count (mean difference 0.11×10^9/L) compared to the white population.
