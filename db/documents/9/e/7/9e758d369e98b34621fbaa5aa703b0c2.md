Premature ejaculation describes the phenomenon which occurs when ejaculation happens sooner than a man or his partner would like during sexual activity. It is considered the most common sexual disorder in the male population. Premature ejaculation that has been present for one year or more has a significant impact on the couple and tends to lead to clinical depression, relationship issues, and other problems. Overall, premature ejaculation is primarily psychological in nature. However, the precise cause of premature ejaculation remains largely undetermined. This activity describes the evaluation and management of premature ejaculation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.
