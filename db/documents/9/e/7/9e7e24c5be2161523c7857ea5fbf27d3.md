The pathophysiology of nasal polyps can be varied. As we age, there are a series of anatomical and functional changes that occur in the human body that lead to stasis of thick mucus and impaired clearance of irritants and biologic offenders (viruses, bacteria, fungi), making patients more prone to develop polyps. These changes include decreased ciliary beat frequency with impaired mucociliary clearance, sinonasal mucosa atrophy with decreased vasculature, and diminished mucus secretion. These all potentially result in increased permeability of the epithelial basement membrane and distortion in the normal osmotic regulation between cells. Overall edema and resultant chronic inflammation results, leading to a localized increase in cell and tissue size. Hereditary factors have also been proposed (cystic fibrosis being but one of the hereditary factors, there are many others).

One study showed a 4.1-fold increased risk in first-degree relatives of patients with CRSwNP. Lastly, impaired innate and adaptive immunity rendering patients to the colonization of bacteria has been implicated. It has been found that patients with Staphylococcus aureus colonization have higher levels of IgE and eosinophils in nasal polyps.
