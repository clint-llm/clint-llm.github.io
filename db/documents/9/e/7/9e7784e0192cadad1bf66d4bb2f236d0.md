A review of oropharyngeal anatomy is important to understand the implications of BVMBVM ventilation. Anatomy may cause difficulty with ventilation.

It is important to predict which patients may be difficult to ventilate. Several acronyms have been formed to help predict who will be difficult to ventilate. MOANS stands for "mask seal, obesity, age (elderly), no teeth, stiffness." BONES stands for "beard, obese, no teeth, elderly, sleep apnea/snoring." These patients may be particularly difficult to ventilate and may require the use of a supraglottic airway to improve chances of ventilation. Likewise, several  studies have identified factors that are associated with difficulty ventilating patients. These include the presence of a beard, obesity, lack of teeth, snoring, older age, and limited jaw protrusion. Leaving the patient’s dentures in, if applicable,  helps create a better seal for the mask. A beard or significant facial hair can make it difficult to ventilate; the use of a water-soluble lubricant can improve the ability to create a seal.
