Hand motion results from a variety of muscle contractions. The contraction of muscles manifest as movement of the hand. These contractions may come from the muscles both within the hand (intrinsic hand muscles) and the muscles that originate from the forearm with tendon attachments to the hand (extrinsic hand muscles).

The action of making a fist and palmar flexion of the hand involves the muscles that originate in the forearm. These muscles are called theÂ long flexor muscles of the hand.
