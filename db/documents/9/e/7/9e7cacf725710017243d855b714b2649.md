- Malrotation with volvulus is treated surgically with emergent surgical intervention and a Ladd procedure.

- The Ladd procedure includes a reduction of volvulus, lysis of Ladd bands, placing the small bowel in the right abdomen and the colon in the left abdomen, and an appendectomy.

- Diagnostic imaging modality depends on the hemodynamic stability of the patient. If the child is stable, a radiologist may perform an upper gastrointestinal contrast series.

- Presentation for intestinal malformation in older children and adults is more variable and may not present with classic bilious emesis but instead present as chronic abdominal pain with intermittent vomiting.

- At the time of surgical intervention, frankly, necrotic bowel is resected, while gut that may be viable is evaluated at a second-look procedure within 24 hours.

- Asymptomatic malrotation discovered during imaging is corrected by many surgeons with elective surgery, often utilizing the laparoscopic approach.
