Once a patient has suffered spinal cord injury, their quality of life and life expectancy is dependent upon continued well-coordinated care between an interprofessional healthcare team. A team approach is ideal for helping mitigate the many complications that can result from SCI

- Evaluation by a neurosurgeon at the time of injury can help minimize the extent of the initial injury.

- Nursing care can prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections, pressure sores, and aspiration pneumonia from occurring.

- Physical and occupational therapists can help maximize the patient’s level of function.

- Social workers can coordinate disability services and reimbursements.

- A psychiatrist should be available to help the patient with depression, which is common following SCI.

- Pain management specialists can help manage ongoing issues with chronic pain.
