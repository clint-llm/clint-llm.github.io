The RTS is an assessment tool that can be utilized by multiple medical professionals with a variety of experience levels to help triage patients or to predict mortalities. Junior residents can assess trauma patients, using the RTS, despite their inexperience making complex medical decisions, to identify severe injuries that may require additional support from a senior resident or attending physician.
