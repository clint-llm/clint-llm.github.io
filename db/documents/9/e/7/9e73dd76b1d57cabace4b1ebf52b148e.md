The retroperitoneal fibrosis mass centers around the distal aorta between L4 and L5 and encases the ureters. This can lead to hydronephrosis via extrinsic compression on the ureters leading to interference with ureteral peristalsis. Presenting symptoms usually include lower back and/or flank pain. This pain is often described as dull, non-colicky, unchanged with position, and with radiation into the groin or lower abdomen. The pain is relieved with aspirin rather than narcotics. In 2 of the largest retrospective series looking at RPF, the pain was present upon presentation in over 90 percent of patients

On physical exam, CVA tenderness to percussion is often present. Patientâ€™s may have hypertension due to renal artery impingement. One study found hypertension present in 57% of patients on presentation. Lower extremity edema or evidence of thrombophlebitis or DVT may be present. A hydrocele may be evident on GU exam, as well as testicular tenderness.
