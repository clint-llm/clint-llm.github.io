Retroperitoneal bleeding is a serious illness that occurs when blood enters into space in the back of the belly. This usually occurs after a traumatic injury and may require surgery to fix. Sometimes the bleeding occurs because of cancer, the use of blood thinners, abnormal enlargement of blood vessels, or other diseases of the belly. As is the case with all procedures, unintentional bleeding can occur. Surgeries on the abdomen or surgeries that examine the arteries of the heart can cause bleeding into this retroperitoneal space and may require hospital admission and potentially further procedures to correct the problem.

Patients should see their primary care doctor regularly and be careful to take their blood pressure and blood-thinning medications as prescribed. Men over age 65 who have smoked should undergo a one-time screening ultrasound of their aorta to assess for enlargement.
