The urea cycle is the bodyâ€™s way of converting toxic ammonia into urea. Ammonia originates from protein catabolism whether that is secondary to a high-protein diet, deaminations, or during the period of prolonged starvation. Ammonia is also naturally produced by gut flora. In muscle and peripheral tissues, glutamate is the amino acid that accepts free ammonia, which results in the formation of glutamine. Glutamine is then exported from muscle and peripheral tissues and utilized by the liver. Glutaminase breaks down glutamine into glutamate and ammonia. Glutamate also yields additional urea via the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase. From here, ammonia is initially incorporated into hepatocyte mitochondria and ultimately results in the formation of urea. Urea subsequently leaves the hepatocyte cytoplasm and is ultimately excreted in the urine.
