Thyroid disease in pregnancy can lead to serious maternal and fetal implications if not adequately diagnosed and treated. It is vital to follow an interprofessional approach when treating pregnant women with thyroid disease. It should be managed by a team of healthcare professionals including an endocrinologist, obstetrician, primary medical doctor, nurse practitioner, and pharmacist. The team should work closely in monitoring thyroid function tests and titrating medications in pregnant women with thyroid disease (including hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism). There is clear evidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in cases of untreated overt hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in pregnant women. (Level III)

It is equally important for health care providers to understand normal thyroid physiology during pregnancy. It would help them to interpret thyroid function tests accurately and avoid incorrect diagnosis and treatment in pregnant women.
