Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice in patients with Gilbert syndrome can be precipitated by a variety of triggers. Fasting, hemolytic reactions, febrile illnesses, menstruation, and physical exertion are common precipitants.

Several theories have been proposed to explain unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia following dietary manipulation. Increased cycling of bilirubin by the enterohepatic circulation, decreased conjugation due to a decrease in the levels of UDP-glucuronic acid, which is a co-substrate in glucuronidation, andÂ release of bilirubin from fat cells.
