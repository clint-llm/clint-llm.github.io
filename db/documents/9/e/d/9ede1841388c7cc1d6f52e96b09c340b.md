The majority of patients with selective IgA deficiency undergoing transfusion of blood products are asymptomatic. However, in the subset of patients in whom anti-IgA antibodies are formed, anaphylactic reaction to blood products may occur. This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of transfusion selective IgA deficiency and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of transfusion selective IgA deficiency.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of selective IgA deficiency.
- Outline the management options for selective IgA deficiency.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients with selective IgA deficiency.
