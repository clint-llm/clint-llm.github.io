In the absence of other obvious causes, infants who meet the Rome IV criteria can be confidently diagnosed with colic. These criteria, which are modifications of the original "Rule of Three," include inconsolable crying or fussiness for 3 or more hours per day, during 3 or more days for 1 or more weeks. Etiologies are likely multifactorial, and treatment recommendations vary based on those potential etiologies. However, the strongest evidence for effective treatment recommendations includes eliminating potential allergens (dairy, eggs, fish, nuts, fish, soy, and wheat) from the diets of mothers who are breastfeeding and switching bottle-fed infants to hydrolyzed formulas. Weaker levels of evidence also support supplementing breastfed infants withÂ Lactobacillus reuteri but do not endorse supplementing formula-fed infants with those probiotics.
