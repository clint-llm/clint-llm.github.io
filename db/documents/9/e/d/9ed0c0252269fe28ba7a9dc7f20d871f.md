Management of biceps rupture depends on the site of rupture.

**Rupture of the Proximal Biceps Tendon (Long Head)**

Non-surgical treatment is usually sufficient for proximal tendon rupture as it is more common in elderly patients. However, residual cosmetic deformity and some intermittent biceps muscle cramping may persist. Younger patients and female patients who are unwilling to accept cosmetic deformity and athletic patients with frequent cramping may opt for surgical intervention in the form of biceps tenodesis. The presence of associated rotator cuff pathology can also influence surgical management. Subpectoral tenodesis is the preferred approach for biceps tenodesis, where the tendon is attached to the bone in the bicipital groove. Sometimes this procedure is done concurrently with arthroscopic rotator cuff pathology treatment. Newer implants like interference screws and bio-absorbable suture anchors can be placed either through the open or arthroscopic approach to secure the tendon in the subpectoral space. All the approaches mentioned above are reported to achieve good clinical outcomes. However, there is limited data to show the superiority of the surgical intervention to the non-surgical approach.

**Rupture of the Distal Biceps Tendon**

Non-operative treatment: Patients with low physical demands and multiple comorbidities are more suitable for conservative treatments. If the bicipital aponeurosis (lacertus fibrosis)is intact, the functional deficits due to biceps rupture can be minimized. Any patient who opts for conservative management of distal biceps tendon rupture needs to be counseled about the outcomes with 50% loss of sustained supination strength, 40% loss of supination strength, 30 % loss of flexion strength, and approximately 15% loss of grip strength.

Operative treatment: This is usually indicated in younger active patients who are unwilling to sacrifice their functions. Especially for the benefits of faster recovery and return to sports.

Surgical repair of the distal biceps tendon can be divided into 2 methods. The non-anatomic approach indicates sutures of the ruptured biceps tendon to the brachialis, which is a simple and efficient way to regain flexion strength. The anatomic approach indicates reinsertion of the ruptured tendon on the radial tuberosity, which reportedly has better results in restoring elbow flexion and forearm supination strength.

There are 2 techniques for surgical exploration and fixation of the torn distal biceps tendon.

**Anterior Single-Incision Technique**

- The incision is over the anterior aspect of the elbow, at or just distal to the antecubital fossa. Deep dissection involves the interval between brachioradialis, which is laterally retracted, and pronator teres which is medially retracted.

- The most common complication is an injury to the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve exiting between brachialis and brachioradialis at the antecubital fossa. Damage to the radial nerve or the posterior interosseous nerve is the most severe complication that would be encountered in this setting.

- Less common heterotopic ossification and synostosis compared to dual incision technique.

**Dual-Incision Technique**

- The method is developed to avoid injury to the posterior interosseous nerve.

- It includes a smaller anterior incision over the antecubital fossa and a second posterolateral elbow incision. Deep dissection involves the interval between extensor carpi ulnaris and extensor digitorum communis. Anterior dissection is similar to the single-incision technique. Once the radial tuberosity is identified, blunt curved artery forceps are used to guide the second incision by sliding along the medial border of the tuberosity, piercing the anconeus, and tenting the skin where the second incision should be made.

- The dual-incision technique is more common to develop synostosis and heterotopic ossification than the single-incision approach.

**Distal biceps tendon fixation techniques:**There are various options to fix the distal biceps tendon. Either through a bone tunnel, suture anchors, interosseous screw fixation, or suspensory cortical button.
