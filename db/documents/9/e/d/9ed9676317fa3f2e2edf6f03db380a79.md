**Transabdominal Pelvic Ultrasound**

Ideally, the patient’s bladder will be full, as it provides an acoustic window for visualizing the uterus. The patient should be lying supine on a stretcher with her abdomen exposed and towels tucked around the gown and undergarment edges to keep them dry from the ultrasound gel. For dominant right-hand operators, the ultrasound machine should be positioned at the patient’s anatomic right, plugged in (if applicable) and turned on. The lights should be dimmed if possible.

**Transvaginal Ultrasound**

A transabdominal pelvic ultrasound should always be performed before a transvaginal ultrasound. The patient’s bladder should be as empty as possible before performing a transvaginal ultrasound, to allow the probe to get as close to the uterus and adnexa as possible. To allow adequate visualization of an anteverted uterus, the patient should be positioned in a stretcher with stirrups and her pelvis at the edge of the stretcher, or her pelvis should be elevated approximately 8 cm to 10 cm with an upside-down bedpan and two to three folded chucks.
