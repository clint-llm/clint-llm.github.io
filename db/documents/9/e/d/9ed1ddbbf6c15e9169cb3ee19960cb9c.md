Congenital agenesis of the SCM, which may also include the concomitant absence of trapezius muscle, is a rare anomaly that may not cause any clinical or functional deficits. This is likely due to the compensatory adaptations made by other muscles in the neck region.

Other variations of the SCM include its origin, which can make a difference during a surgical intervention in the area. The clavicular attachment can be narrow or wide (up to about 7 to 8 cm) or have more than one clavicular attachment; the attachment could also affect the acromion-clavicular joint or present more muscular bellies in the SCM.

An increased number of SCM muscle heads is not so rare; for example, one can find two sternomastoid, a cleido-occipital, and a cleidomastoid occipital origin on one side, while on the other side, a single sternomastoid, a cleido-occipital and two cleidomastoid origins, with a total of four muscle heads.

Rarely the margin of SCM can be in direct contact with the trapezius, probably due to embryological malformations.

The innervation of the SCM may vary. One study reported the innervation of the lower portion of SCM from a branch of C1 from the ansa cervicalis (descendens hypoglossi); the same can happen only for the upper portion of the muscle.

The variations of SCM are also represented by the names with which it is known: nutator capitis, mastoideus colli, sternocleidomastoid muscle of Kopfnicker, and sternomastoid muscle.

Considering all these anatomical variables, exercise caution before approaching the area surgically.
