Neuromuscular blockers are commonly administered during anesthesia to assist with endotracheal intubation and improve surgical conditions. It is important to understand when each class of NMBAs should be used and when they should be avoided. The depth of paralysis should be closely monitored via TOF for the duration of the procedure, and the physician should always be aware of potential medications, physiologic derangements, or genetic disorders that could lead to potentiation of neuromuscular blockade, leading to postoperative complications.
