Adaptive support ventilation (ASV) is a type of mechanical ventilation, which is a relatively newer mode of closed-loop ventilation. Other modes of mechanical ventilation include proportional assist ventilation, neurally adjusted ventilatory assistance, and knowledge-based systems. Many of the contemporary modes of ventilation are known to result in barotrauma, volutrauma, ineffective weaning, or prolonged weaning, higher hospital costs, and demanding one-to-one and vigilant, critical care staff. This activity reviews the ventilatory mode of adaptive support ventilation and its advancements in ventilating patients in critical care. This article demonstrates the advancements in mechanical ventilation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with ASV mode.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism and principles of mechanical ventilation in the mode of adaptive support ventilation.
- Review the latest clinical studies and the stance of adaptive support ventilation in the present day.
- Identify the conditions intensivists might use or prefer ASV over other modes of ventilation.
-  Explain the advantages of ASV over other forms of ventilation.
