The management of GLPLS remains elusive with no current therapeutic regimen highlighted to be dominant. Treatment focuses on reducing the immunological response before the development of follicular scarring. Novel research has shown that JAK inhibition with tofacitinib leads to the normalization of interferon-mediated T-cell chemotaxis, thus preventing infundibular inflammation. A case series of 8 lichen planopilaris patients treated with a twice a day 5mg dose of tofacitinib reported a 30-94% improvement of disease severity.
