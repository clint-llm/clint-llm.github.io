The talus does not serve as the site of any muscle attachment, which is significant because that means the talus does not have secondary sources of blood supply. Therefore, if there is vascular compromise to the talus through traumatic injuries such as in the setting of displaced fractures, there is a relatively high risk of developing post-traumatic, avascular necrosis (AVN).
