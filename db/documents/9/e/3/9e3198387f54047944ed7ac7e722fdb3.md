Frequently administered drugs for treating Microsporidia infection in animal and humans include albendazole and fumagillin. In the past, organic mercury compounds like Nosemack were also tested. However, Nosemack was less effective against the parasite and more toxic to agricultural bees than fumagillin. Fumagilin has amoebicidal properties and in vivo studies show that fumagillin inhibits Nosema
apis development in the honeybee. Albendazole is effective and efficient against Encephalitozoon species infecting humans and animals but has variable effectiveness against Enterocytozoon bieneusi. Albendazole inhibits the tubulin polymerization and is also used as an anthelmintic and an anti-fungal agent.
