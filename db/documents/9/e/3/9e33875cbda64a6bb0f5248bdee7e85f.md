Rodenticides or “rat poisons” are mixed compounds used to eradicate rodents. They are one of the most toxic agents commonly found in households. Historically, heavy metals such as arsenic were the first agents used to control rodent populations, but the most common rodenticide used in the twenty-first century is anticoagulants.
