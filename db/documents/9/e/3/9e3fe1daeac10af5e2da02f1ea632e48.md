A focused history can elicit potential causes of acid-base disturbances such as vomiting, diarrhea, medications, possible overdoses and chronic conditions with a predisposition to acidosis including diabetes mellitus.

The physical exam reveals signs unique to each cause such as dry mucous membranes in the patient with diabetic ketoacidosis. Hyperventilation may also be present as a compensatory respiratory alkalosis to assist with PCO2 elimination and correction of the acidemia. Compensatory reactions do not completely correct a disturbance to the normal pH range, however.
