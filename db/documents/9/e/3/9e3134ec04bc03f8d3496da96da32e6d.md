Malignant conditions are also a very common indication for an individual to seek fertility preservation. With improvements in cancer treatment, there has been a decrease in mortality, leading to a growing group of young woman survivors who wish to have children.

There are differentÂ degrees of damage to the ovaries based on the type of cancer treatment administered. The degree of gonadotoxicity depends on several factors, including the ovarian reserve when starting treatment, the patient's age at the time of treatment, the specific type of chemotherapy and or radiotherapy, and the duration and dose of the cancer treatment.

If a patient is older and has a lower anti-mullerian hormone level before starting a toxic cancer treatment, they will have increased risks of infertility

Patients who receive a new diagnosis of malignancy should be rapidly referred to a fertility specialist to receive fertility preservation counseling.

Another option that is specific to women who will receive pelvic radiation is an ovarian transposition, where the ovaries are mobilized and affixed to a location in the abdomen free of radiation.
