The approval of CBD for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome has revolutionized the lives of patients and their families. Managing the administration of CBD to patients requires a team. Clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs) and nurses must first properly diagnose these patients, especially since patients are often young (less than 5). Due to CBD's side effects, particularly on the liver, laboratory technologists must help monitor liver levels. Researchers are just beginning to discover CBD's therapeutic potential. Consequently, researchers and clinicians are necessary to continue to evaluate and identify CBD's uses. Finally, due to the differing state laws on marijuana use, social workers and other relevant healthcare professionals must help parents and patients understand that 1) CBD is legal and 2) CBD is not the part of cannabis that makes its users high. Proper utilization of CBD has demonstrated a reduction in seizure frequency in these syndromes that are notorious for being difficult to treat.

CBD reduces seizures and increases seizure control. In particular,

- CBD used as an adjunct therapy in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome patients without seizure control by anti-epileptics results in a greater reduction in seizure frequency.

- CBD is known to affect the liver. Thus frequent liver enzyme monitoring is necessary.
