Given the acute nature with which foreign body airway obstructions frequently present and the subsequent need for emergent resuscitation, much of the ongoing research into this and other cardiopulmonary science is reviewed regularly by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ICOR). The ILCOR consists of members of the leading global resuscitative organizations and is engaged in an ongoing Continuous Evidence Evaluation (CEE) system for ongoing review of resuscitative science. This CEE system has replaced the previous system where resuscitative care recommendations were made on a 5-year cyclic basis.
