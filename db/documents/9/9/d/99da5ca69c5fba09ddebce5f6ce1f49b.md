The term "ichthyosis" implies a generalized scaly dermatosis, without the component of erythema. The ichthyoses are disorders of cornification and are classified as inherited or acquired. Hereditary ichthyosis is further classified as syndromic and non-syndromic. Ichthyosis vulgaris (IV) is an inherited form of non-syndromic ichthyosis, with a very early age of onset. Ichthyosis vulgaris is associated with loss of function FLG gene mutations, which leads to a defective skin barrier. Historically, the first case of ichthyosis vulgaris was described in 1806 as "ichthyose nacr√©e." Willan introduced the term "ichthyosis," derived from the Greek root "ichthy," meaning fish.
