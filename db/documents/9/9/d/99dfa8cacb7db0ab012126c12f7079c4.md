Brain herniation is defined as the movement of brain tissue from one intracranial compartment to another. There are three key intracranial compartments created by two rigid in-folds of dura known as the falx cerebri and the tentorium. The falx cerebri separates each brain hemisphere. The tentorium separates the cranial vault into supratentorial and infratentorial compartments. The infratentorial compartment is also known as the posterior fossa. Within the posterior fossa are the cerebellum and brainstem. There are two openings in the infratentorial compartment: the foramen magnum and the tentorial notch. The tentorial notch allows communication between the infratentorial and supratentorial compartments. The foramen magnum allows passage out of the posterior fossa and into the spinal canal.

A tonsillar herniation is characterized by the descent of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, which compresses the medulla against the clivus/odontoid process. It is described as "coning" as the brain tissue is squeezed down through the foramen like being squeezed into a cone. (See media image 1) Clinically, progressive compression of the medulla causes Cushing's reflex, eventually resulting in death.
