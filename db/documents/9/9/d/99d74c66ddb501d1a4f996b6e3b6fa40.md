Double orifice mitral valve (DOMV)Â is a unique disorder; however, its symptomatology is very nonspecific. As stated above, the development of symptoms correlates to the degree of mitral valve dysfunction, the left atrial pressure, and the degree of pulmonary venous congestion. Therefore, in adults, it is important to consider other causes of mitral valve disease such as rheumatic heart disease, functional MR, myocardial ischemia, annular calcifications in the elderly, connective tissue disorders, myxomatous degeneration, and infective endocarditis.
