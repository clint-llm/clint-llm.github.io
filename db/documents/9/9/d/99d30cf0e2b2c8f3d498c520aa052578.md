Cysts seem to form as a result of fibrosis in breast tissue development and subsequent failure in the continuous process of the lobule and terminal ductule formation. The physical mechanism is that fibrosis causes thickening of the epithelium, and thus the developing lobule involutes early in its development. This causes the typical surrounding stroma to disappear and the adjoining ductule to break down, resulting in an aberrant epithelial lined fold, which becomes walled off entirely. The epithelial fold becomes dilated with epithelial acinar secretions and matures into a self-contained fluid-filled cavity.

This underlying process of fibrosis likely stems from an overproduction of estrogen and suppression of progesterone, leading to hyperproliferation of the connective tissue, causing increased epithelial thickness. This theory is supported by the regression of fibrocystic changes in postmenopausal women.

Fibrocystic changes are categorized into nonproliferative changes, proliferative changes without atypia, or proliferative changes with atypia.  Nonproliferative changes include simple cysts and are entirely benign. Proliferative changes may include varying degrees of solid components like adenosis, sclerosis, fibrosis, as well as epithelial hyperplasia or metaplasia and apocrine metaplasia. Epithelial atypia is referred to as atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia and is a risk factor for the development of breast cancer.
