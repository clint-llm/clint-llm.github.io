Like other fistulae, RVF is a result of a complication of an underlying disease, surgical procedure, or injury. A good understanding of the pathophysiological process helps to assess better, manage, and prevent fistulae. Loss of wall integrity with ongoing inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic processes at the rectal or vaginal wall can lead to erosion to the adjacent tissue or organ and establish an abnormal fistulous connection. When the initial process is reversible or curable,Â such as diverticulitis, fistulae have a better chance to resolve.
