Prognosis in YNS is dependent on the specific symptoms of the patient and co-existing illnesses. Symptoms range from mild (poor nail cosmesis and chronic cough) to severe (marked and recurring edema, persistent pulmonary infections). There is no cure for YNS. Treatment is aimed at improving symptoms.
