Accessory ossicles are common, generally asymptomatic, normal variants seen throughout the musculoskeletal system, with several examples within the foot and ankle. Awareness of their presence and location is essential to limit the misdiagnosis of these normal variants for pathology. The origin of many of these ossicles is debated in the literature. One proposed mechanism is from the non-union of secondary ossification centers.

Ossicles and sesamoids are known to be associated with painful symptoms such as the os navicular, os trigonum, and hallux sesamoids.
