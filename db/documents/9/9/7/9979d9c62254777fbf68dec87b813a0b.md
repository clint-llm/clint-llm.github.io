There are many tumors of the spinal meninges, one example being a meningioma. While the majority of meningiomas appear in the cranial meninges, they are also known to grow in the spinal portions, especially in the thoracic and cervical portions. Spinal meningiomas are typically benign and slow-growing and typically occur in women aged 50 to 70. Children with neurofibromatosis type 2 are also susceptible to developing spinal cord tumors, such as meningiomas and intramedullary tumors.

The more common tumors that impact the spinal meninges are epidural metastases, which can primarily arise from breast, lung, and prostate primary cancers. These metastases can grow on either the bony vertebra, the paravertebral tissues, or within the epidural space overlying the spinal meninges. These metastases are most common in the thoracic region and can cause significant compression of the spinal cord or cauda equina syndrome if in the lumbar-sacral region.
