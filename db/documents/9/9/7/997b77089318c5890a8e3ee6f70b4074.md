Ipilimumab is a CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody.

CTLA-4 is the primary negative regulator of T-cell-mediated antitumor immune responses and therefore represents a critical checkpoint for immunity, controlling both the intensity and duration of an immune response. Ipilimumab is an anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody that prevents CD80 and CD86 on APCs from binding to CTLA-4 on T cells. This blockage of CTLA-4 signaling allows T-cell activation, proliferation, and amplification of T-cell-mediated immunity, which allows the patient's immune system to mount a better response.

The drug is metabolized via the CYP450 enzyme system and has a half-life of 15.4 days.
