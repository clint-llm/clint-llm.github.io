The maxillary artery is the largest terminal division of the external carotid artery and distributes blood to the maxillofacial region, supplying the dental pulp's microcirculation.

The inferior alveolar artery is a continuation of the maxillary artery's mandibular division, which enters the mandibular foramen together with the inferior alveolar vein and nerve. It proceeds to supply the teeth through the apical foramen via arterioles.

The arterioles travel through the pulp towards the center of the tooth, where they branch to form a capillary network at the periphery. The circulating blood delivers oxygen and nutrients to the pulp's constituent cells, particularly the odontoblasts, through exchange diffusion. Metabolic waste products from the pulp are drained into central venules. The pterygoid plexus located within the infratemporal fossa is a complex venous network that provides venous drainage for tissues supplied by the maxillary artery.

This highly vascular network has an estimated blood flow of 40 to 50 ml/min/100g of pulpal tissue, which is relatively high compared to other oral systems. Shunt vessels within the pulp allow direct communication between the venules and arterioles. They can regulate intrapulpal pressure during inflammation by opening to decrease the pressure and maintain normal blood flow. Persistent inflammation can generate an overwhelming increase in intrapulpal pressure, resulting in compression of the apical blood vessels and subsequent tissue necrosis.

It is important for the dental pulp to sufficiently clear tissue fluid and cell components within its microcirculation through the presence of an effective lymphatic drainage system, although the exact functioning remains unclear. It has been postulated that lymph is collected in interstitial tissue clefts within the coronal pulp and is transported to lymphatic capillaries via the apical pulp.
