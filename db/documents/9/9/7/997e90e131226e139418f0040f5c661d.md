Patients over 65 years of age are most commonly affected by painful clavi. The epidermis undergoes many changes with age, resulting in a thinner and dryer protective layer; this could contribute to a higher prevalence of clavi in the older population. There is also a slight female predominance, most likely due to an increase in ill-fitting footwear.
