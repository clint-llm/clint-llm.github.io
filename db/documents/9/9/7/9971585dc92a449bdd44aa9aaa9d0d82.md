Depending on the clinical scenario, a clinician may consider referral to services such as neurology or physiatry.Â  If a patient presents with new-onset spasticity or spasticity that appears to worsen without any specific triggers, this may warrant a neurology consultation. A physiatrist consultation should be considered if the patient has failed to improve with their anti-spasticity medications or their spasticity is significant enough to affect their posture, mobility, and overall care.
