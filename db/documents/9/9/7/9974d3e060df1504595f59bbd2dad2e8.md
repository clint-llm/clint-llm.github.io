As with all disease states, the initial assessment of RVF begins with a thorough history and physical examination. The acuity, severity, and etiology should be determined so that an appropriate treatment plan may be put in place.

Clinically, patients present with the signs and symptoms of hypoxemia and systemic venous congestion. These include:

- Breathlessness

- Chest discomfort

- Palpitations

- Swelling.

Common findings on the exam include:

- Jugular venous distension

- Hepatojugular reflux

- Peripheral edema

- Hepatosplenomegaly/hepatic pulsation

- Ascites

- Anasarca

- S3 gallop

- TR murmur

- RV heave

- Signs of concomitant LVF

- Paradoxical pulse.

When severe, presyncope or syncope may occur when the RV is unable to maintain cardiac output. This is accompanied on the exam byÂ the following:

- Hypotension

- Tachycardia

- Cool extremities

- Delayed capillary refill

- Central nervous system depression

- Oliguria.
