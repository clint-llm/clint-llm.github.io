Generally, patients with acute rheumatic fever present in the age group of 5 to 15 years. Following an episode of acute streptococcal pharyngitis, there occurs a latent period of nearly 2 to 5 weeks before the onset of acute carditis. Erythema marginatum may either precede, coincide, or follow the development of episodes of carditis. These lesions have also been reported in patients with chronic carditis.

The classical clinical lesion begins as an asymptomatic erythematous macule that spreads peripherally and coalesces to form polycyclic or serpentine patches or plaques. Lesions occur in crops over days to weeks and are evanescent. The rate of migration is 2 to 12 mm over a period of a few hours.

Lesions are accentuated on exposure to heat and resolve with mild hypopigmentation without any atrophy or scaling. The commonest sites are the trunk, axillae, and proximal extremities, usually with the sparing of the face. Lesions tend to last from a few hours to a few weeks and are often more perceptible during the afternoon.
