Stewart-Treves syndrome is a condition of development of lymphangiosarcoma as a complication of chronic, long-standing lymphedema. Although the majority of cases are attributed to post-mastectomy lymphedema, the syndrome can be caused by chronic lymphedema of any origin. Prompt diagnosis of angiosarcoma is essential due to the occurrence of metastatic spread and poor prognosis. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of Stewart-Treves syndrome and underscores the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of Stewart-Treves syndrome.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with Stewart-Treves syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment options for Stewart-Treves syndrome.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to improve outcomes in those with Stewart-Treves syndrome.
