Like every other disease, patient education plays a vital role in disease management. Since permanent pacemaker placement is the usual mainstay in this disease, patients should receive training about the importance of maintaining regular follow up with their electrophysiologist to ensure proper pacemaker function with frequent interrogation. Patients also should be educated to recognize the signs of pacemaker malfunction, which include the recurrence of symptoms that they initially presented with such as syncope lightheadedness and fatigue.
