Education should be given to patients regarding long-term monitoring. A regular follow-up should be done annually with the cardiologist to assess heart valves and cardiac function. Regular echocardiograms should be done to assess rhythm abnormalities, valvular stenosis, valvular regurgitation, and cardiomyopathy. The orthopedic surgeon will assess the joint function and severity of contractures. The patient may need physical therapy, intra-articular steroid injections, or surgery to relieve joint pain and immobility.

The patientâ€™s cognitive learning and psychological status should be monitored closely. MPS II patients are at increased risk of suffering from depression and social withdrawal in the teenage years. Education and counseling about the psychological clinical symptoms and learning difficulties experienced by the MPS II patients should be given to the parents. Counseling, medication management, special educational classes, Individualized Education Program (IEP), classroom accommodations, and behavioral therapy should be offered to address hyperactivity, learning disability, and mood disorders. Psychologists should provide support to both patient and their families.
