**PTSD**

Screening: PTSD screening serves several functions, the first of which is risk assessment. This helps identify patients at risk of developing PTSD who do not yet meet full criteria, allowing them to be routed to early prevention efforts. Screening also allows for earlier detection of acute and sub-threshold cases or uncover unidentified chronic PTSD patients.

Diagnosis: DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for adults are:

- Exposure to death (actual or threatened), serious injury, or sexual violence by:

- 
              
- Direct experience,
              
              
- Witnessing as it occurred to others firsthand,
              
              
- Learning that it occurred to a close friend or family member, or
              
              
- Experiencing repeat or extreme exposures to unpleasant details of the event(s), for example, police officers repeatedly finding human remains. This is not applicable if the exposure was through media unless as part of the patient’s work.

- One or more “intrusion symptoms”:

- 
              
- Distressing memories of the event which are invasive, involuntary, and reoccurring
              
              
- Recurrent nightmares about the event
              
              
- Dissociative reactions such as flashbacks where the patient feels like they are reexperiencing the event
              
              
- Prolonged or intense psychological distress to cues resembling some aspect of the event
              
              
- Significant physiologic response to cues resembling some aspect of the event.

- Avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, as displayed by one or both:

- 
              
- Efforts to avoid stressful memories or thoughts
              
              
- Efforts to avoid people, locations, topics, situations, etc. which trigger stressful recollections of the event.

- Negative mood or cognitions surrounding the event, as displayed by two or more of these criteria:

- 
              
- Inability to recall significant features of the event, excluding other etiologies such as TBI and intoxication
              
              
- Exaggerated or persistent pessimistic beliefs about the self, others, or world
              
              
- Distorted ideas about the cause or consequences of the trauma
              
              
- Persistently negative emotional state, which can be fearful, angry, shameful, etc.
              
              
- Detachment from others
              
              
- Inability to feel good emotions such as satisfaction, love, and happiness.

- Altered arousal and reactivity, as shown by two or more of the following:

- 
              
- Irritability despite minimal provocation, often expressed as angry outbursts or physical/verbal aggression
              
              
- Recklessness or self-destructive behavior
              
              
- Hypervigilance
              
              
- Marked startle response
              
              
- Concentration difficulties
              
              
- Insomnia.

- Criteria B through E must be present for longer than one month.

- Symptoms must cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important functional domains.

- Symptoms cannot be due to substances or another medical condition.

The PTSD diagnosis is ideally made using multi-method assessments given limitations of individual tools. This practically includes a self-report symptom severity measure such as the PCL-5 and a semi-structured clinical interview. Biological measurements such as heart rate, sweat gland activity, and neuroimaging are areas of ongoing research and are not widely available. Semi-structured interviews, most commonly the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5), are conducted by trained interviewers and are the gold standard for diagnosis. They have the advantage of the ability to clarify responses, decreasing the likelihood of misinterpretation of questions, symptom exaggeration or minimization, and inconsistent responses.

**Depression**

Screening: Major depression is both prevalent and underdiagnosed in the general population. Because of this, the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for depression in those aged twelve or older. The youngest service members are eighteen years old. Therefore, screening for depression in the military community is highly recommended. Currently, a two-item (PHQ-2) and a nine-item (PHQ-9) Public Health Questionnaire are effectively used to identify patients warranting further investigation. They share similar sensitivities; however, the specificity of the PHQ-9 is higher at 91 to 94% compared to the PHQ-2 (78 to 92%).

While still useful as a severity tool, the BDI-II was found to have high sensitivity but lower specificity at over 90% and 59%, respectively, than the PHQ tools.

Diagnosis: according to DSM-5 criteria, a diagnosis of MDD can be applied when a patient experiences one or more major depressive episodes. A major depressive episode is defined as having five of the following symptoms present during a two-week period with a change in baseline functional status. Furthermore, depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in activities must be one of the endorsed symptoms. The full list of symptoms to consider includes depressed mood, loss of interest/pleasure in activities, weight loss or gain, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue, feeling worthless or excessive guilt, decreased concentration, and thoughts of death or suicide. Physiologic causes, substance use, and other psychiatric disorders must be excluded.

Laboratory and imaging: Evaluations should be performed at the provider’s discretion, guided by the history and physical exam. Common laboratories drawn in the initial evaluation of a patient with depressive symptoms include:

- Complete blood count

- Serum chemistry panel

- Urinalysis

- Thyroid-stimulating hormone

- Rapid plasma reagin

- Human chorionic gonadotropin

- Urine toxicology screen

Imaging is generally reserved for instances where structural brain diseases are suspected. Further laboratory and neuroimaging evaluations should be guided by findings in the history and physical examination.

**Suicide**

While many resources are available for identifying those at elevated risk of suicide, most such screening tools are ineffective in accurately predicting risk. They frequently have low positive predictive values, high false-negative rates, and high false-positive rates.

Item 9: “Over the past two weeks, how often have you been bothered by thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way?”

Responses: “Not at all,” “Several days,” “More than half the days,” or “Nearly every day.”

Generally, patients who respond with high levels of SI are associated with a higher risk of death by suicide.

Clinicians should conduct suicide risk evaluations on patients who screen positive. There are multiple analytic models and assessment tools for determining the future risk of suicide. These methods help standardize information gathering during the patient interview.

**Substance Use Disorders**

Screening: Several alcohol-use screenings have been validated, but none have advantages over the single-item screening, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), or AUDIT-Concise (AUDIT-C) in primary care settings. AUDIT was the most effective in identifying those with high risk, hazardous, or harmful drinking (51 to 97% sensitivity, 78 to 96% specificity depending on score cutoffs, and “harmful use” criteria used), while CAGE questions were best at predicting alcohol abuse and dependence (43 to 94% sensitivity, 70 to 97% specificity). Several single-item screening questions have been proposed. One validated example asks, “on a single occasion within the last three months, have you had five or more drinks containing alcohol?” An affirmative was 62% sensitive and 93% specific for problematic alcohol use. Brevity, memorability, and a lack of scoring make this easy to use. AUDIT is the most widely validated AUD screening. It contains ten items and takes two to three minutes to complete. Questions assess the frequency, quantity, drinking occasions, impairment, dependence, harmful use, and concern from others. Scores range from 0 to 40, with an 8 or higher considered indicative for unhealthy alcohol use. AUDIT-C contains three questions on excess consumption. It was proven primarily in male veterans, but other studies validating its use in other populations are being published. Studies show a 54 to 98% sensitivity and 57 to 93% specificity for varying definitions of “heavy drinking.”

- How often do you have a beverage containing alcohol?

- How many beverages containing alcohol do you have on a typical drinking day?

- How often do you have 6 (male) or 4 (female) or more drinks on a single occasion?

CAGE is a series of four questions designed to detect substance abuse and dependence per DSM-4 criteria. It is most useful for identifying patients with severe problems (when two or more questions are positive) and must be supplemented with quantity and frequency questions if positive.

- Have you ever felt the need to **C**ut down on drinking?

- Have others **A**nnoyed you by criticizing your drinking?

- Have you ever felt **G**uilty about your drinking?

- Have you ever needed to drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover (**E**ye-opener)?

Diagnosis: DSM-5 diagnostic criteria are below. The presence of two to three symptoms is considered mild, four to five moderate, and six or more severe.

Impaired Control:

- Taking the substance in larger amounts or over a longer period than intended

- Unsuccessful attempts or persistent desire to reduce or regulate the use

- Spending excess time to obtain, use, or recover from the effects of the substance

- A strong craving, or intense desire/urge, for the substance, can occur at any time

Social Impairment:

- Substance use causes significant interference with work, school, or home roles.

- Continued use despite recurrent social or interpersonal consequences exacerbated by the use

- Reducing or abandoning important social, recreational, or occupational activities due to substance use

Risky Use:

- Substance use in physically hazardous locations

- Use despite knowing of persistent physical or psychological consequences exacerbated by the drug.

Pharmacology:

- Tolerance: increasing doses of substance needed to achieve the desired effect

- Withdrawal: physical or psychological symptoms occur with abrupt discontinuation/dose decreases.

Laboratory tests: Urine, blood, sweat, hair, saliva, and breath tests exist for alcohol and other drugs and can detect recent use. Patients are more likely to answer use-related questions more honestly when an objective measure has been taken. However, they cannot quantify the frequency or dose(s) used. Thus, they may be of higher utility in monitoring for abstinence. Basic screening tests exist for amphetamines, cocaine, cannabis, certain opioids, and phencyclidine. Except in emergencies, permission for obtaining a drug screen must be obtained. Several alcohol-specific laboratory tests exist but tend to require heavy, repetitive consumption to cause abnormalities. Most are non-specific to varying degrees. In the absence of other explanations, the following can aid in the assessment of unhealthy alcohol use:

- Liver function tests: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) can be elevated with hepatotoxicity. An AST:ALT ratio of 2:1 is more specific to alcohol-induced liver disease. Bilirubin may be elevated. Albumin will be decreased in liver damage.

- Complete blood count: anemia, pancytopenia, and macrocytosis can be seen in chronic alcohol use.

- Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT): another enzyme primarily found in the liver, often elevated with excessive alcohol use (reference range: 8-40 units/L in females, 9-50 units/L in males).

The following are less widely available:

- Carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT): a level greater than 1.6 percent suggests chronic excessive alcohol use over an approximate two-week period. It is relatively specific but can be elevated in certain rare liver diseases, i.e., primary biliary cirrhosis.

- Phosphatidylethanol (PEth): this is specific for alcohol use. A value greater than 20 ng/dL is seen in moderate alcohol consumption, while values greater than 200 ng/dL typically indicate heavy alcohol consumption.
