The inability to inject at the site indicates incomplete penetration of the needle through the cortex into the medullary space. This situation will be apparent due to the inability to flush with saline. Drilling deeper will resolve this problem.

Extravasation of fluid occurs secondary to drilling through the posterior cortex, placing an IO in a fracture site or in the bone that was previously accessed or at a recent orthopedic surgical site; this can cause compartment syndrome as well as the usual soft tissue complications similar to venous infiltration, depending on the product infused.

In the pediatric population, epiphyseal plate necrosis is avoidable by ensuring an IO insertion site is away from the epiphyseal plate.

Other complications include fracture, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, fat embolism, and the inability to remove a bent IO needle. A bent needle may require surgical removal.
