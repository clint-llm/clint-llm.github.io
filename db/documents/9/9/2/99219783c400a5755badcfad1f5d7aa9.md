Gyrate atrophy (GA) of the choroid and retina is a rare genetic disease of autosomal recessive inheritance. It primarily affects the ocular tissues and occurs due to deficiency of the enzyme ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) that leads to a 10 to 20 times increase in the plasma level of the amino acid ornithine, compared to the normal plasma levels, which is thought to result in the ocular manifestations associated with the condition.
