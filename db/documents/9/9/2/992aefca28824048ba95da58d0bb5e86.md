The popliteal artery is defined as aneurysmal when focal dilation in its diameter is more than 50% of the normal vessel diameter. The normal diameter of the popliteal artery varies from 0.7 to 1.1 cm. These focal dilations classify as fusiform (diffuse dilation) or saccular  (asymmetrical). Popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs) account for 85% of all peripheral aneurysms. Popliteal artery aneurysms are associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms 40% to 50% of the time.

The popliteal artery is considered a continuation of the superficial femoral artery after it passes through the adductor magnus hiatus. It lies in the popliteal fossa accompanying its vein and terminates at the bifurcation into the anterior tibial artery and tibioperoneal trunk, which is located at the lower border of the popliteus muscle at the level of the tibial tuberosity.
