In the dental setting, infectious agents can be transmitted by inhalation, injection, ingestion, or contact with mucosa or skin. Infection prevention and control measures aim to prevent or minimize the transmission of pathogenic agents between patients, patients, and dental healthcare workers, and vice-versa. Infection control also limits the spread of infection outside the dental practice. Standard precautions must be in place for all patients, and transmission-based precautions must be applied when patients are at risk of spreading infectious diseases, mainly airborne infections.

Dentists handle several sharp instruments during their daily practice and therefore are always at risk of percutaneous injuries. A percutaneous injury exposes the dental professional to the patient's blood and possibly infectious agents. Bloodborne pathogens of concern for dental personnel include hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C viruses (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, the occupational risk of bloodborne viruses depends on the prevalence of the virus in the population and working conditions.
