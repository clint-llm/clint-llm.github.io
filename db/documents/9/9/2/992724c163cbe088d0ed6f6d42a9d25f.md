Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) medication used to treat breast cancer in men and women and as a prophylactic agent against breast cancer in women. The drug was first synthesized in 1962 and initially intended to be a birth control drug, but while it failed for that indication, it has become a very successful anti-cancer medication.
