All cochlear implant systems have both external and internal hardware. The external equipment includes a microphone, a sound processor, and a transmission system. The internal device includes a receiver/stimulator and an electrode array.

In general, an external microphone picks up sound and/or speech in the environment and sends the information to a sound processor. The speech processor converts the mechanical vibration (sound) into an electric signal, which gets sent through the skin via radio frequency transmission to the internal receiver/stimulator. For successful transmission through the skin, the external magnet on the transmitter must align with the internal magnet on the receiver (stimulator). The receiver/stimulator takes the electrical signal and moves it to the electrode positioned within the cochlea. The electrodes provide stimulation to the auditory nerve, and the signal is sent along the auditory pathway to the auditory cortex in the brain. There are several manufacturers of cochlear implants in the United States, each with different specifications to customize the device to individual patient needs. A full review of all the different companies and models is beyond the scope of this article.

Companies: Each company has device specifications required for implantation and patient selection; please refer to these companies for device-specific details.
