In a US registry of 2039 patients with pulmonary artery hypertension, the average age was 51.7 (plus or minus 14.5 years) with a female-to-male ratio of 3.9:1.0. Of those patients, 46.6% (950) were classified as IPAH. Estimates are that IPAH affects 1 in 1 million, usually young females who are otherwise normal. The median survival, if left untreated, is 2.8 years.
