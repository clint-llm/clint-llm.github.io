A comprehensive history and physical examination are vital to evaluate otalgia. The clinician must consider both primary and secondary causes.  History should include the following:

Red flags associated with otalgia include

- Dysphagia, odynophagia, dysphonia, or hemoptysis

- Loss of vision or black spots

- Unintended weight loss

Risk factors for a serious diagnosis, such as malignancy include

- History of smoking

- History of alcohol use (approximately 3.5 or more drinks per day)

- Immunosuppressed state, i.e., diabetes mellitus

Key features on history include:

- Shorter time-frames suggest more benign causes.  Longer time-frames suggest a secondary cause.

- Ear pain lasting over four weeks is more suspicious for malignancy, especially if in the presence of risk factors and normal otoscopy.

- Ear fullness rather than ear pain may be more associated with cholesteatomas.

- Sharp, lancinating pain is more indicative of neuralgia or neuropathy.

- Malignancy tends to cause unilateral symptoms.

- Ear pain exacerbated by swallowing is suggestive of glossopharyngeal neuralgia.

- Of note, 1 case series noted "the otalgia point," located at the apex of the jugulodigastric region.  The case series included 32 patients who pointed to this location, who also had normal physical examinations, tympanogram, and age-appropriate audiograms. This point was found to correlate more with symptom relief after either myringotomy or nasal steroid usage.

The following associated symptoms could indicate the following referred origins:

- Sinus congestion - chronic rhinosinusitis

- Toothaches - dental pathology

- Hoarseness - vocal cord condition

- Heartburn - gastroesophageal reflux

- Chest pain - coronary artery disease

- Shortness of breath- lung disease

- Upper back pain - cervical disc disease or myofascial pain

- Headache, diplopia, malaise, jaw claudication, diplopia - temporal arteritis

It is also possible for patients to experience otalgia during the early postoperative phase of tonsillectomies.

Physical examination should include the following:

- Ear examination to identify signs of infection or other signs of primary etiologies. It may also reveal vesicular lesions, which can be found in herpes zoster oticus infection (Ramsay Hunt syndrome if it occurs with facial paralysis).

- Nasal examination to identify inflamed nasal mucosa or nasal polyps. It may reveal chronic rhinosinusitis.

- Oral cavity examination to identify dental caries, loose fillings, aphthous ulcers, abnormal growths, or abscesses.  Intra-oral palpation may also detect an elongated styloid process, which can occur in Eagle syndrome.

- Temporomandibular joint examination to identify temporalis, lateral/medial pterygoid, or masseter muscle tenderness. It may reveal trigger points or TMJ syndrome.

- Head examination to identify parotid or other salivary gland pathologies. It may reveal salivary gland tumors or sialadenitis. Tenderness along the temporal artery may reveal temporal arteritis.

- Neck examination to identify lymphadenopathy or thyroid gland pathology. It may reveal thyroiditis or lymph node malignancies.

- Cervical spine examination to identify cervical spine and related musculoskeletal exam pathology. It may reveal myofascial pain or cervical degenerative disc disease.

- Cranial nerve full examination to identify cranial nerve neuropathies. It may reveal trigeminal, glossopharyngeal, geniculate, sphenopalatine, occipital, vagal neuralgia, or Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

- Cervical spine, cardiac, pulmonary, or abdominal physical examinations to identify referred pain from distant organ systems from the ear.
