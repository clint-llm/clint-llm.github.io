The monitoring and close follow-up of patients on estrogen therapy is not as strict as it would be with patients on warfarin, as symptom relief and absence of adverse effects are enough to determine the need for intervention or adjustment. Many patients on estrogen therapy undergo re-evaluation after several months for possible dose adjustments based on the response to the treatment and relief of symptoms. Depending on the health status and co-morbid conditions, an annual exam is subsequently part of the continued care to re-assess the risks and benefits individualized to each woman. The yearly exam includes several history taking and physical examination techniques used to evaluate whether adverse events or toxicity is developing, including breast and pelvic exam, review of any health concerns, and reassessment of symptoms.
