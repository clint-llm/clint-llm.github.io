A sunburn is caused by excessive exposure to the sunâ€™s ultraviolet (UV) rays or by exposure to artificial sources of UV rays such as tanning beds. The biggest risk factors for sunburn include the duration and intensity of exposure. An increase in the number of sunburns experienced directly correlates to an increased risk of skin cancer. This activity reviews the causes, risk factors, and pathophysiology of sunburn and the role of the interprofessional team in identifying and treating patients with sunburns.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of sunburns.
- Describe the evaluation of a sunburn.
- List the treatment and management options available for sunburns.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication to advance the prevention of sunburns and of the cutaneous malignancies that may result from them.
