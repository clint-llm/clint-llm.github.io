In rare cases, the internal carotid artery can take an anomalous course through the retropharyngeal space; this may be congenital in nature, due to an improperly descended third aortic arch, and present throughout one’s life with symptoms such as dysphonia. It may be more evident in older individuals with a history of atherosclerosis and hypertension, both of which can exacerbate clinical signs and symptoms. This anomalous artery may increase a patient’s risk for vascular injury during surgery in the pharyngeal region and during intubation.
