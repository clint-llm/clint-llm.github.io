The original Parkland formula incorporates both crystalloids and colloids. Crystalloids have a more negligible volume expansion effect than colloids because of the increased capillary permeability during early burn injury. However, colloids will pass into the extravascular space, creating a shift in oncotic pressure that expands into the third space.

A study by Perel et al. concluded that randomized controlled trials provide no evidence that resuscitation with colloids reduces the risk of death compared with crystalloids in burn resuscitation. Given that there is no associated improvement in survival and colloids are more expensive, they are used less in clinical practice. At this time, crystalloids are the consensus of fluids for burn management.

The Parkland formula (also called the Baxter formula), developed in 1968 by Dr. Charles Baxter, is perhaps the most widely recognized fluid replacement formula for burn injuries. It stipulates that 2 to 4 ml of Ringer's Lactate per kilogram of weight per percentage of body surface area burned, with the first half given over the first 8 hours and the remainder given over the next 16 hours. Parkland formula implies 4 mL/kg/%TBSA (3 mL/kg/%TBSA in children) = total amount of crystalloid fluid during the first 24 hours.

Burn injuries are a leading cause of unintentional death in children, although most of these are considered minor. Due to their small circulating blood volumes, prompt resuscitation for pediatric burn victims is paramount. Adult resuscitation guidelines must be altered for children because the distribution of their body surface area differs significantly. The Lund and Browder chart considers these differences by providing a pediatric-specific calculation.

According to some recent surveys to evaluate the emergency department healthcare professionals' knowledge considering the initial interventions for pediatric burn patients, almost 75 % declared the Parkland formula used in acute management.

The Evans formula was developed in 1952 and was the first burn formula created to account for body weight and burn surface area. The first 24 hours entails 1 ml/kg/% BSA of crystalloids plus 1 ml/kg/% BSA colloids plus 2000 ml glucose in water. In the next 24 hours, crystalloids at 0.5 ml/kg/% BSA, colloids at 0.5 ml/kg/% BSA, and the same amount of glucose in water as in the first 24 hours.

The Brooke formula, initially described in 1953, uses 1.5 ml/kg/% BSA of lactated Ringer's solution plus 0.5 ml/kg/% BSA of colloid and 2 L of 5% dextrose in water. This formula was later modified to 2 ml/kg/% BSA of lactated Ringer's solution with colloid not given in the first 24 hours postburn.

Ringer's lactate is recommended for initial resuscitation in all age groups, but infant patients will also require dextrose due to their limited glycogen stores. Because of this, pediatric burn resuscitation formulas are always 2-figure calculations: the estimated fluid resuscitation (EFR) and added maintenance fluids (MF) with or without dextrose, depending on the child's age. The cutoff for using the adult formula is generally agreed to be between 30 to 50 kg.

Currently, the two major pediatric formulas are the Cincinnati formula and the Galveston formula. To date, there has not been a clinical comparison study between these.

Urine output is regarded as the resuscitation goal in pediatric burn management. For children under 30 kg, 1 ml/kg per hour is recommended; for children over 30 kg, 0.5 ml/kg per hour is the goal. As with adults, using UOP as the sole measure of efficacy is controversial and often misleading. Sheridan et al. have suggested that in infants, the goals be determined by sensorium, physical exam, pulse, and systolic blood pressure in addition to UOP.
