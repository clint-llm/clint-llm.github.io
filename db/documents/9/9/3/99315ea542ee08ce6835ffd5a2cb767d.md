The etiology of nasolacrimal duct obstruction is as follows:

- Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (CNLDO): usually caused by a mucosal membrane at the inferior meatus but can also be caused by bony constriction of the nasolacrimal duct

- Primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction (PANDO): usually caused by age-related fibrosis of the nasolacrimal duct

- Secondary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction (SANDO): 

- Infection:

- Bacterial (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Actinomyces are the most frequent causes)
- Fungal
- Viral
- Parasitic


- Inflammation: 

- Sarcoidosis
- Wegener granulomatosis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis - GPA)
- Allergies
- Ocular drops (glaucoma medication, chemotherapy drugs, antiviral drugs)
- Irradiation (use of I-131 for thyroid carcinoma)
- Physical burns
- Chemical burns
- Pemphigoid disease
- Stevens-Johnson disease
- Chemotherapeutic drugs (docetaxel for breast carcinoma and lung cancer)


- Neoplasia

- Lacrimal sac tumors (lymphoma, papilloma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma)
- Surrounding soft tissue tumors such as basal cell carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, lymphoma, leukemia 
- Metastatic tumors (breast carcinoma, malignant melanoma, prostate carcinoma)


- Trauma

- Midfacial fractures including naso-orbito-ethmoid fractures
- Iatrogenic trauma


- Mechanical

- Surrounding mucoceles
- Dacryoliths within the lacrimal system
