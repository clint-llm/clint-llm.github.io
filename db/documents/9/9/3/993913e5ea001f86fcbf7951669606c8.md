The SMAS connects the facial muscles to the dermis, and itsÂ purpose is to transmit, distribute, and amplify the activity of all facial muscles.

The key anatomical boundaries of the SMAS are the zygomatic arch superiorly and the platysma inferiorly

The SMAS is not uniform across its breadth; cadaveric****dissection studies have led to the classification of two distinct types of SMAS occurring in distinct face areas.
