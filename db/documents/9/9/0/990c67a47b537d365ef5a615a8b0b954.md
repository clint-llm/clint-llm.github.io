The most common technique for performing transvaginal cervical cerclage is the McDonald method. First applied in 1951, this procedure involves a simple purse-string suture at the cervicovaginal junction. Under regional anesthesia, the patient is placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped with a vaginal betadine solution. A speculum or right-angle retractors are used to adequately visualize the cervix. The anterior lip of the cervix may be gently grasped using ring polyp forceps, and the vesicocervical junction should be identified. Just anterior to this junction, a nonabsorbable suture is inserted into the cervix in a purse-string manner, taking caution to avoid the paracervical vessels. The suture is then tied down with a surgeon knot, either anterior or posterior.

The Shirodkar technique begins with the patient positioned and prepared in the same manner. Once the vesicocervical reflection has been identified, the mucosa of the anterior cervix is incised at this junction, similar to a vaginal hysterectomy. An Allis clamp can be used to elevate the bladder flap while the bladder is then mobilized cephalad using blunt or sharp dissection. This is continued until reaching the level of the internal cervical os. A similar incision is then made in the posterior cervical mucosa. Again, an Allis clamp can be used for traction on the posterior mucosa, while the reflection of the Pouch of Douglas is created using blunt dissection. An Allis clamp can then be applied at the 9 o’clock position to retract and isolate the paracervical vessels. A nonabsorbable suture can then be passed from anterior to posterior just beneath the Allis clamp so as not to enter the cervical os. The Allis should then be removed and placed in a similar fashion at the 3 o’clock position. The suture can then be passed from posterior to anterior, with special attention to lay the suture flat against the posterior aspect of the cervix. The suture can then be securely tied anteriorly. The anterior and posterior mucosa can then each be reapproximated in order to bury the cerclage stitch. This may be done in the running or interrupted fashion using an absorbable suture. The free ends of the cerclage stitch may be left exposed to facilitate subsequent removal.

Both ultrasound-indicated and physical examination-indicated cerclages should be placed prior to 24 weeks gestation. Women undergoing a history-indicated cerclage procedure should have placement between 12-14 weeks gestation.

Cervical cerclages should be removed between 36-38 weeks of gestation, prior to the onset of labor. Removal can safely be performed in the office setting. If preterm labor is suspected or diagnosed, cerclage should be removed at that time to minimize potential trauma to the cervix. If a cesarean is planned, removal may be delayed until the time of surgery.
