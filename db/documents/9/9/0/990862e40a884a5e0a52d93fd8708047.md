Decompression illness can occur after exposure to reduced environmental pressure in situations involving diving and aviation as well. High altitudes can expose flight crews and individuals to the risk of decompression illness. The general pathophysiology involves gas, such as nitrogen, forming bubbles in tissue, which is responsible for the symptoms ranging from relatively minor symptoms to profound neurologic manifestations.

Traditionally, decompression sickness (DCS) is categorized as type 1, referring to skin changes and milder symptoms such as joint pain, or type 2, referring to more severe symptoms involving the neurologic, cardiac, and pulmonary systems. Some difficulties with that naming system have led to a more specified system that refers to the patient’s involved organ systems, such as musculoskeletal, cutaneous, neurologic, or cardiopulmonary subtypes.
