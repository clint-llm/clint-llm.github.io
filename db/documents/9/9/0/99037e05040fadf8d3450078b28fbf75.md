The etiology and diagnosis of UVCP are complex. There is no definitive epidemiological data published on its incidence within the general population. A comparison of patient demographics between neurological and non-neurological causes has noted no statistically significant difference in age, gender, or duration of symptoms, with only a past medical history of cancer or thyroid disease being significantly more common in the neurogenic group.
