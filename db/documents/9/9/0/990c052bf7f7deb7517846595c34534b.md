Retinal vascular changes and their progression are an indicator of fetal and maternal mortality.

Cortical changes have been noted to persist long after delivery and recovery. A long-term study of patients with a history of preeclampsia found increased temporal lobe white matter lesions independent of cardiovascular status and increased in frequency with time after delivery.

Preeclampsia is an independent risk factor for future stroke in patients later in life. Estimates of the increased risk include a roughly 80% increased risk for stroke, with the relative risk/odds ratio between 1.87 and 2.02. Childbearing alone can be a risk for atherosclerosis and carotid disease, which can further cause visual symptoms.

Stroke and cardiovascular disease during or after pregnancy can lead to numerous causes of visual impairment and is an important sex-specific differential in causes of cerebrovascular accidents.
