Meningococcal disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This activity will describe how to deal with this disease as a serious problem. It will also illustrate the importance of meningococcal vaccination and how it enhances immunological memory and reduces nasopharyngeal carriers (who represent the primary source of meningococcal infections ), leading to herd immunity. Then, we will mention the risk factors, individuals at high risk, ways of vaccine administration, doses, indications, and contraindications.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the characteristics of Neisseria meningitides that causes meningitis.
- Summarize the at-risk populations for Meningococcal disease. 
- Explain the differences between the two types of meningococcal vaccines.
-  Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve the rate of meningococcal vaccination.
