- Early use of PPIs and H2 blockers in patients can be beneficial to prevent stress gastritis.

- PPIs work to inhibit hydrogen ion secretion by blocking the H/K ATPase of parietal cells.

- Parietal cells are stimulated by acetylcholine, gastrin, and histamine to secrete hydrogen ions.

- Acetylcholine and gastrin via phospholipase and PKC to stimulate hydrogen ion secretion.

- Histamine works through cAMP and PKA to stimulate hydrogen ion secretion.

- TheÂ most common presenting symptom is bleeding (bloody nasogastric tube, melena).
