Contraindications to endotracheal intubation include severe airway trauma or obstruction that does not permit the safe placement of an endotracheal tube.  If an endotracheal tube cannot be placed, but an airway needs to be secured, a surgical airway is indicated. In an adult, a cricothyrotomy or needle cricothyrotomy is an emergent option; this should be converted to a formal tracheostomy as soon as an airway is established. An emergent tracheostomy (sometimes termed a "slash tracheostomy") is also an acceptable option. For a pediatric patient in whom an endotracheal tube cannot be placed, cricothyrotomy is not often performed and an emergent tracheostomy is preferred.  The only absolute contraindication to surgical cricothyroidotomy is the age of the child. The exact age at which they can safely perform a surgical cricothyrotomy is controversial and not well defined and may depend more on the size and body habitus of the patient, as opposed to an absolute age. Various sources list lower age limits ranging from 5 years to 12 years, and Pediatric Advanced Life Support defines the pediatric airway as age 1 to 8 years. For a pediatric patient, a needle cricothyrotomy with trans-tracheal ventilation should be performed instead of an incision-based surgical cricothyrotomy. This should then be converted to a formal tracheostomy.
