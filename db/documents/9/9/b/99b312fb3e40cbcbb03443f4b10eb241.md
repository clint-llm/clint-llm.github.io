Color Doppler ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of the acute scrotum in all age groups. It has been found to be superior to radionuclide imaging, is readily available on an emergency basis, and can be done more quickly.Â The normal ultrasonic appearance of a testicular appendage will typically show little or no vascular flow.

In contrast, a torsed testicular appendage will be over 5.6 mm and, depending upon the duration of torsion, may appear as an ovoid hypoechoic nodule in boys presenting before 24 hours compared to a hyperechoic or heterogeneous nodule after 24 hours.

The affected testicle is often found to be "high riding" in testicular torsion but not in a torsed testicular appendage.

Radionuclide imaging of the scrotum would demonstrate a "hot dot" sign at the site of the torsed testicular appendage but is useful only if the symptoms and torsion have been present for at least five hours. Even after five hours, this sign is only found in about 45% of patients ultimately found to have a torsed testicular appendage.

If the patient is having voiding symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, or frequency, it will also be important to obtain a urinalysis with culture.
