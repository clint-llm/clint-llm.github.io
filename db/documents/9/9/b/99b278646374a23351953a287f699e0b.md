Type 1 DM is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Close to 50% of patients will develop a serious complication over their lifetime. Some will lose eyesight, and others will develop end-stage renal disease. The prognosis is good for those who make it past the first 20 years. However, the disease has no cure, and with time, the patient may develop premature coronary artery disease, neuropathy, foot ulcers, and vision loss.

Maintaining euglycemia for a lifetime is associated with severe anxiety and depression; for many patients with type 1 diabetes, the quality of life is poor.
