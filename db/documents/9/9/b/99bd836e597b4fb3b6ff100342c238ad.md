Patients taking multiple medications should be educated that anticholinergic side effects are common. Parents and guardians should be encouraged to keep all medications in a safe place, inaccessible to children. This includes over-the-counter medications in addition to prescription medications. All patients should be informed not to take their medications more frequently than prescribed and not to take more than the recommended dose of over-the-counter medications. Patients should also be counseled not to drive after taking sedating anticholinergics such as antihistamines.
