In an immunocompetent person, Aspergillus conidia are inhaled and taken up by phagocytes in the lungs.Aspergillus infection is kept at bay.

Aspergillus is notable for angioinvasion, with thrombosis of blood vessels causing tissue necrosis and allowing spread to distant sites.

In patients with underlying pulmonary disease, colonization of Aspergillus in a preexisting cavity allows a large mass of fungal hyphae, fibrin, and other debris to form an aspergilloma.

In the case of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), Aspergillus conidia do not trigger the typical immune response and instead activate TH2 CD4 T-cells.
