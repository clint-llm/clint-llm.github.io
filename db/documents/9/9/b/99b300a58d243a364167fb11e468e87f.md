Traumatic fibromas should be evaluated to determine a definitive diagnosis via surgical excision.

TUGSE can mimic several malignant processes and, therefore, should be biopsied to determine a definitive diagnosis if the lesion persists for two weeks after removing any irritant.

Inflammatory papillary hyperplasia can present as very few or multiple lesions that require evaluation. Questions should be asked of the patient to determine how long they leave their removable dental prosthesis in their mouth each day. Additionally, the prosthesis should be evaluated for proper fit.

Thermal injuries should be evaluated by interviewing the patient to determine the etiology of the lesion.

Aspirin-induced oral lesions should be evaluated by patient interview to pinpoint the etiology of the lesion, as sloughing of the oral mucosa can potentially mimic an autoimmune or malignant process.
