Diabetic peripheral neuropathy encompasses sensory, motor, and autonomic neuropathy. Implicated causes of peripheral nerve damage include oxidate stress damage, accumulation of sorbitol, advanced glycosylation end products, and a disturbance of hexosamine, protein kinase C, and polymerase pathways. Neurovascular impairment with poor repair processes and endothelial dysfunction also have been implicated.
