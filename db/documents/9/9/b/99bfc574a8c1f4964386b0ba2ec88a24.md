Single ventricle patients undergoing the Fontan procedure usually have had multiple cardiac surgical interventions prior to this completion of staged procedures. Typically, patients will need to be intubated with general anesthesia, endotracheal intubation, and appropriate invasive line monitoring (arterial line, central line, etc.) Patients are placed in a supine position, and a median sternotomy (usually re-operative) is performed. Patients are cannulated in preparation for cardiopulmonary bypass.

The Fontan completion goal is to re-route the systemic deoxygenated blood from the venous circulation into the pulmonary vasculature. In Francis Fontan's first description involving two cases of tricuspid atresia, the right atrium was connected directly to the pulmonary artery, i.e., an atriopulmonary connection (APC).

In the modern surgical era, there are two major modifications to create a Fontan circuit; an extracardiac conduit (EC) or a lateral tunnel (LT) technique.

Classification for Fontan procedure modifications based on the Society for Thoracic Surgeons National Congenital Heart Surgery Database includes:

- 1) Lateral tunnel, fenestrated

- 2) Lateral tunnel, nonfenestrated

- 3) External conduit, fenestrated

- 4) External conduit, nonfenestrated

- 5) Intra/extracardiac conduit, fenestrated

- 6) Intra/extracardiac conduit, nonfenestrated

- 7) External conduit, hepatic veins to the pulmonary artery, fenestrated

- 8) External conduit, hepatic veins to the pulmonary artery, nonfenestrated
