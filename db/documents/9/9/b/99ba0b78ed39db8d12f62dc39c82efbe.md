Diagnosis of esophagitis can be made based on history and clinical examination however to differentiate subtypes of esophagitis requires endoscopy and biopsy examination. In suspected acid reflux esophagitis if symptoms are mild to moderate then an endoscopy may not be required and can be reserved if poor or failed response to proton pump inhibitors. Similarly, if the history is very suggestive of medication-induced (pill) esophagitis, endoscopy may not be initially required.

The endoscopic appearance of the mucosal lesions can help with diagnosis. In patients with suspected eosinophilic esophagitis, endoscopy may reveal white exudates or papules, red furrows, corrugated concentric rings, and strictures; but endoscopy may be normal in up to 10% of patients. Endoscopic signs of candidiasis are small, diffuse, linear, yellow-white "cheese-like" plaques adherent to the mucosa. CMV esophagitis is characterized by several large, shallow, superficial ulcerations. HSV esophagitis results in multiple small, deep ulcerations.

Endoscopic biopsy of esophageal lesion histology study can differentiate and confirm different esophagitis etiology. Patients with eosinophilic esophagitis on histology will have a characteristic eosinophilic infiltration (> 15 eosinophils per high-power field). Histology can also be helpful in the diagnosis of infectious etiologies. Multinucleated giant cells with ballooning and degeneration of squamous cells are diagnostic of HSV esophagitis with Cowdry type A inclusions being pathognomonic. Large cells with both intracytoplasmic inclusions and amphophilic intranuclear inclusions are suggestive of CMV esophagitis.
