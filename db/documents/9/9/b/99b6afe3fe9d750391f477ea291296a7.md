Comprehensive knowledge of normal and abnormal tracheal and bronchial anatomy is of utmost importance. The trachea is a fibromuscular tube with an internal diameter ranging from 15 to 25 mm in men and 10 to 21 mm in women. It is supported anteriorly by 16 to 20 incomplete cartilaginous rings and posteriorly by a strip of longitudinal smooth-muscle. These landmarks aid in orientation during bronchoscopy.Â The trachea divides sharply at the carina to give rise to the right and left mainstem bronchi.

Beyond the mainstem bronchi, the airway divides further into (secondary) lobar and (tertiary) segmental bronchial segments. There are three lobar bronchi on the right (upper, middle, and lower) and two on the left (upper and lower).

An accessory cardiac bronchus is present in approximately 0.08% of individuals and appears as an additional branch of the right mainstem typically opposite the right upper lobe bronchus. The cardiac bronchus is usually nonfunctional, petering out into rudimentary bronchioles. Although generally asymptomatic, retained secretions in a cardiac bronchus may become a nidus for infection in certain circumstances.

Another somewhat more common abnormality that may complicate lung isolation is the presence of a tracheal bronchus.
