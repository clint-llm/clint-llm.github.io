Herpangina is generally a mild and self-limited disease. If appropriate care measures, patient isolation, adequate food intake, and hydration are maintained, the disease resolves in less than ten days. Symptomatic treatment for the patient’s fever and oral lesions and close observation for the development of febrile seizures in young children with high-grade fever also improve the prognosis of the disease. Patients who develop serious neurological complications have a variable course, and the prognosis is poor in certain situations. Thus patients should be monitored closely for the development of complications, including flaccid paralysis, meningitis/encephalitis, and myocarditis.
