Adenosine single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) thallium (Tl-201) imaging is a non-invasive myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) test.

The underlying principle of the test is that when the myocardium is under stress, the diseased ventricle receives less blood flow than the normal heart muscle. SPECT scan performed after the stress event will reveal the distribution of thallium and therefore the relative blood flow to the different parts of the ventricle. Images are also obtained at rest and compared. The thallium is injected and taken up by the myocardial cells so that the initial distribution of the tracer reflects viable myocardium. Images are then taken during stress (induced by adenosine) and at rest reflect myocardial perfusion and viability.

Currently, SPECT Tl-201 is used mainly for myocardial viability assessment when positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging viability assessment is not feasible. American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC) recommend against using adenosine SPECT Tl-201/technetium 99m, dual-isotope (rest-stress), imaging for detecting myocardial ischemia because this protocol has high radiation exposure (up to 23 mSv) compared to other isotopes.

Adenosine is a nucleoside that is composed of adenine and d-ribose, a potent coronary vasodilator through activation of A2A receptors in smooth muscles and endothelium.
