Emergent injuries that require immediate attention, such as intracranial or intrathoracic trauma, take precedence over laceration repair. Securing the airway and maintaining hemodynamic stability remains the priority in a trauma evaluation. In a stable patient, head or facial lacerations should not be repaired until other bony or structural facial injuries have been assessed and the need for operative or specialty intervention has been determined. In some cases, facial lacerations provide optimal access to underlying bony injuries. Because the mechanisms of injury commonly resulting in facial lacerations include motor vehicle accidents, falls, and physical altercations, the cervical spine should always be evaluated and protected.

Wounds that appear grossly infected or highly contaminated should not be closed, as closure can create an abscess. A similar concern for infection exists with wounds evaluated 24 hours after injury. Lacerations that present more than 24 hours after injury without proper irrigation and repair carry a higher risk for wound infection and should be repaired in a delayed fashion or left to heal by secondary intention. Complex repair in the operating room should be considered when there is extensive soft tissue loss, need for debridement, or if laceration defects cannot be repaired tension-free at the bedside.
