Cochlear implant

Cochlear implantation is a surgery whereby an electrode is inserted into the cochlea to bypass the cochlear function and provide a direct electrical stimulus to the cochlear nerve, thereby allowing for patients with complete or partial hearing loss to regain the ability to hear. Cochlear implantation is reserved for patients with sensorineural hearing loss that will not improve with the use of hearing aids. The surgery involves placing 12 to 22 electrodes within the cochlea that connect to an internal receiver/stimulator that is implanted just below the skin posteriorly to the ear. Two weeks after successful implantation of the internal device, the patient is ready to have the external device, which the patient wears over the ear, activated. A microphone in the external device captures sound and encodes it into an electric impulse using a speech processor. Next, this electrical stimulation code travels to the external transmitter that is attached by a magnet through the skin to the internal receiver/stimulator that was recently surgically implanted. The information transmits via a radio-frequency link to the internal receiver and then travels to the cochlea, where it electrically stimulates the auditory nerve.

Labyrinthectomy

Patients with severe vertigo unresponsive to medical therapy can elect to undergo a labyrinthectomy whereby the organs that make up the labyrinth are surgically removed. The most common indication to perform a labyrinthectomy is in Meniere’s disease that has already compromised a patient’s hearing.
