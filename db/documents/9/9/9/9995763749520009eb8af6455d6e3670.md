Mini implants should be avoided for patients who are medically unfit for the treatment. Prospective patients must be thoroughly evaluated for all known risk factors and conditions related to oral surgical procedures and subsequent healing before any clinical treatment. Contraindications include but are not limited to the following:

- Vascular conditions

- Uncontrolled diabetes

- Clotting disorders

- Anticoagulant therapy

- Heavy smoking

- Metabolic bone disease

- Chemotherapy or radiation therapy

- Chronic periodontal inflammation

- Insufficient soft tissue coverage

- Metabolic or systemic disorders associated with wound and/or bone healing

- Use of pharmaceuticals that inhibit or alter natural bone remodeling

- Disorders inhibiting patient ability to maintain adequate daily oral hygiene

- Uncontrolled parafunctional habits

- Insufficient bone height and/or width

- Insufficient interarch space (not always placed in the narrow alveolar ridge)

In edentulous arches, more than two implants are usually needed due to narrow the diameter, the unpredictability of survival, and the lack of scientific understanding. Treatment of children is not recommended until growth is finished and epiphyseal closure has been completed.
