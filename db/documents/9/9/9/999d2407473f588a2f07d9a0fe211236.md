Chlorine was thought to cause direct tissue damage by generating free oxygen species. However, more recent studies show that cellular injury may result from the oxidation of functional groups in cell components from the reaction of chlorine gas with tissue water. This reaction forms hypochlorous and hydrochloric acid along with free oxygen radicals.

Hypochlorous and hydrochloric acid cause most of the toxic effects attributed to chlorine gas. These acids are produced by the reaction of chlorine (Cl2) with water.

Mild exposure may cause mucosal membrane irritation.  More severe exposure will induce edema of both the upper airway and the lung parenchyma. Large acute exposure can induce wheezing, cough, and dyspnea. Acute lung injury and/or adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can also be seen in some severe cases. Chlorine gas is primarily reactive only at a local level, thus absorbed systemic effects are not commonly observed.

Acids formed by the reaction of chlorine gas with water can react with the conjunctival mucous membrane, and although rare due to buffering by the tear film, can cause burns and corneal abrasions. These acid burns are generally superficial, only affecting the epithelial and basement membrane.
