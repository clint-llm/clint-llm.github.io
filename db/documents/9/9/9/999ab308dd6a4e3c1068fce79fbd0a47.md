Early detection and effective management of maternal diseases are necessary to improve pregnancy outcomes. Improved prenatal and intrapartum care can help to reduce stillbirths.

Only a few identified risk factors for stillbirth are considered modifiable. Maternal BMI and glucose control may be modified in women with diabetes to reduce the risk of recurrent miscarriage. Given that many stillbirths in this population occur at term, change in prenatal care and a planned early delivery may impact risk.

The use of tobacco and recreational drugs are additional modifiable risk factors. Universal screening for substance abuse is supported, and women with identified needs must be directed to receive treatment if desired. The goals of treatment are to review their self-efficacy and what they have tried in the past, recognize there are different life options, and identify that they are worthy of a better life. This is achieved with the help of mental health units, substance use disorder specialists, and the use of addiction recovery coaches.

For pregnancy complicated by obstetric cholestasis (OC), planned delivery by 37 to 38 weeks gestation should be replaced by individualized decisions given the known perinatal risks of early-term delivery and the lack of evidence associating OC with stillbirth risk.

Perinatal audits may help to reduce the stillbirth rate.
