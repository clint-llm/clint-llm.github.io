Cilia incarnata is the misdirection of eyelashes whereby they grow under the skin through to the surface or posteriorly to the conjunctival surface instead of emerging normally from the eyelid margin. The two major forms of cilia incarnata are cilium crescere internum, in which the lashes grow inward, and cilium crescere externum, in which case the lashes grow outward. In both conditions, the lash root is normal. Whereas cilia incarnata internum may present similarly to a foreign body, patients with cilia incarnata externum are generally asymptomatic. This activity examines the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of cilia incarnata and the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical exam findings in a patient with cilia incarnata. 
- Describe the proper evaluation of cilia incarnata. 
- Explain how to properly manage a patient affected by cilia incarnata. 
- Optimize interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by cilia incarnata.
