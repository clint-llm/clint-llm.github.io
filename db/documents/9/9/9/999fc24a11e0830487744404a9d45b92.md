Herpes simplex ophthalmicus is caused by a neurotrophic double-stranded DNA virus with an icosahedral capsid surrounded by a poorly defined tegument (covering). Two types of herpes simplex virus (HSV) affect humans, HSV type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 causes orofacial and eye infections by contact from an infected individual, while HSV-2 causes genital disease transmitted sexually. HSV-2 can be transmitted to neonates during birth through HSV-2 infected genitalia of the mothers and to children through orofacial contact by infected adults.

Primary infection occurs in neonates as ophthalmia neonatorum or children less than five years of age as blepharoconjunctivitis. The virus ascends through the cutaneous nerves to stay latent in the trigeminal ganglion. Viral replication is triggered by conditions like fever, menstruation, irradiation, stress, steroid treatment, immunocompromised conditions, etc. to cause secondary infection in adults. Secondary herpes simplex ophthalmicus manifests most commonly as epithelial dendritic keratitis and its recurrences as stromal keratitis.
