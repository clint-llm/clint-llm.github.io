LDL plays a key role in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques that leads to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Directly measuring LDL and VLDL by ultracentrifugation is extremely expensive and time-consuming. For this reason, multiple time and money-saving equations have been developed throughout the years to estimate the LDL and VLDL cholesterol levels. Most famously known, the Friedewald equation subtracts HDL and VLDL from the total cholesterol level to estimate LDL concentration. In turn, VLDL levels are estimated by a fixed ratio of triglycerides/5.

Initially intended for research purposes only, this equation has been widely utilized over the last decades to clinically estimate LDL cholesterol levels.
