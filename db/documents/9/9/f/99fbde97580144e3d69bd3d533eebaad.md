Proper utilization through integrated discussion between imaging experts and expert neurologists, epileptologists, neurosurgeons, movement disorder specialists, and neurooncologists will allow for improved diagnosis and improved patient outcomes. Multidisciplinary meetings can serve as a platform to enhance the appropriate and most effective use of these techniques.
