Diseases affecting near vision are:

- Macular/retinal diseases- In macular diseases, vision does not improve by refractive corrections, and optical coherence tomography of the retinaÂ may reveal the abnormalities.

- Diseases of the optic nerve

- Posterior subcapsular cataract - Unlike presbyopia, the near vision further deteriorates in bright light.

- Hypermetropia

- Astigmatism
