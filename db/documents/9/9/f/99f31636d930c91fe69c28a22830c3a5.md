Many conditions may evoke symptoms similar to those caused by DED. Some conditions may also be associated with or lead to DED, such as allergic conjunctivitis, cicatricial conjunctivitis, filamentary keratitis, and neurotrophic keratitis. Identifying the underlying primary condition in these cases is key to reducing the progression of the disease and worsening of dry eye.

Differential diagnosis includes:

- Conjunctivitis (allergic, viral, bacterial, parasitic/chlamydial)

- Anterior blepharitis

- Demodex blepharitis

- Cicatricial conjunctivitis (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, mucous membrane pemphigoid)

- Bullous Keratopathy

- Contact lens-related keratoconjunctivitis

- Eyelid malposition (entropion, ectropion) or abnormality (trichiasis) leading to ocular surface disease

- Keratitis (interstitial, filamentary, contact lens-related, neurotrophic)
