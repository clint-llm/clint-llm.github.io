Cardiac arrest is a fatal presentation of ventricular tachycardia. Early recognition, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and public access to defibrillation have helped improve the rate of survival for patients who have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias. However, survival after out-of-hospital still remains low.

In-hospital cardiac arrest shares a similarity with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in that early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and defibrillation are important factors in survival. [Level 1] Every minute treatment is delayed reduces survival by approximately 10%.

Management of a patient with ventricular tachycardia requires an interprofessional team. A cardiac electrophysiologic and a cardiac critical care nurse are essential to the team. Diabetic patients with ischemic heart disease should be seen by an endocrinologist to manage it properly. Strenuous exercise should be avoided as it may precipitate VT in some patients. All patients should be strongly encouraged to discontinue smoking. Patients presenting with VT secondary to (suspected) inherited cardiac conditions require a geneticist for genetic counseling and testing. The pharmacist should educate the patient on medication compliance and the need to follow up with the cardiologist, as well as perform medication reconciliation and contact the prescriber if they have any concerns about the patient's medication regimen. They can assist the clinical team in managing drug-drug interactions and making appropriate drug treatment selections. Nurses often coordinate activities between various providers, counsel patients, and assist in assessments and procedures. This interprofessional model will help drive optimal patient results in VT cases. [Level 5]
