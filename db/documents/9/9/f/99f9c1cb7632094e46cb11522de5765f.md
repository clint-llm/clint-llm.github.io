Patients with uterine prolapse may undergo initial evaluation for their condition in a variety of clinical settings. It is common for patients to not only present to their gynecologist for complaints of vaginal discomfort, but also the emergency department, urgent care centers, or their primary care physicianâ€™s office. Once diagnosed, it is imperative to provide the patient with proper follow up for uterine prolapse as progression can lead to long term morbidity. Therefore a patient that is diagnosed with uterine prolapse should be referred to a physician with experience in treating uterine prolapses, such as gynecologists or family practice physicians.

If there is significant morbidity, and the patient is amenable to surgery, they should be referred to a surgeon. In addition to physical discomfort, it is common for patients to experience anxiety, depression, and poor self-esteem as a result of their condition thus, referral for psychotherapy should be offered. Healthcare providers must work together to provide patients with holistic care to minimize the physical and mental morbidity that is typically associated with uterine prolapse.
