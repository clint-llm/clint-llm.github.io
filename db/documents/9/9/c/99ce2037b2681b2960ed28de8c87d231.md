- Perform a comprehensive physical examination before splinting

- Have the patient rest his or her elbow on a table, and the forearm should be in a neutral position

- The thumb should be in the normal resting anatomic position

- Measure a 4-inch wide, eight layers thick plaster measured from the tip of the thumb to the proximal forearm

- Soak plaster in lukewarm water

- Apply plaster to the radial side of forearm and thumb so that this area is protected from the thumb tip to theÂ mid- to distal-third of the forearm (depending on the specific injury)

- Ensure no ridges or indentations are created

- Cover the plaster with a one-layer soft wrap material to interpose between the plaster and the overlying most superficial wrap (e.g., ace wrap)

- Recheck and document neurovascular exam
