Vital signs are often obtained at the beginning of a patient encounter, frequently by a nurse, certified nursing assistant, or medical assistant. Therefore, Trouseeau's sign may commonly be noted by the allied health professional taking the vital signs, rather than by the clinician. Recognition of the sign and communication to the clinician may be the only opportunity for the patient to have this issue addressed.
