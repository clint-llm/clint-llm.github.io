Chronic urticaria is a mast cell-mediated condition characterized by the recurrent occurrence of urticaria and/or angioedema.

The current definitions and classification stratify urticaria according to time course and etiology:

- **Acute spontaneous urticaria**: Spontaneous occurrence of wheals and/or angioedema for a total duration of fewer than six weeks.

- **Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU)**: Spontaneous occurrence of wheals and/or angioedema for a total duration of six weeks or more. This is synonymous with "chronic urticaria" and "chronic idiopathic urticaria."

- **Chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU)**: Occurrence of wheals for a total duration of six weeks or more, which is inducible by physical factors (e.g., touch, pressure extremes). This is synonymous with "physical urticaria."
