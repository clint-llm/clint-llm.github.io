Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common diagnosis and second deadliest malignancy for both sexes combined. The incidence of new cases and mortality has been steadily declining for the past years, except for younger adults (younger than 50 years), possibly related to an increase in cancer screening and better therapy modalities. This activity outlines the etiology, epidemiology, clinical staging and stage-wise treatment of colon cancer.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of colon cancer.
- Outline the clinical presentation of colon cancer. 
- Identify the favorable and unfavorable risk factors for upfront surgical resection, post-surgical adjuvant therapy, and biomarker expression driven therapeutic decision-making.
- Discuss the role of early involvement of an interprofessional team including clinicians, nutritionists and dieticians, palliative service, social workers and case managers in helping improve the quality of life for patients diagnosed with colon cancer.
