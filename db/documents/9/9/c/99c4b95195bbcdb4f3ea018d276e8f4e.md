There are two sources of sympathetic innervation of the ovary; one is through the ovarian plexus. The origin of the ovarian plexus is the renal plexus which also innervates parts of the fundus of the uterus. The suspensory ligament of the ovary carries this plexus to the ovaries. The second source of sympathetic innervation is through the superior ovarian nerve,Â  carried within the ovarian ligament.

The parasympathetic innervation is from the uterine (pelvic) plexus, which arise from the pelvic splanchnic nerves.
