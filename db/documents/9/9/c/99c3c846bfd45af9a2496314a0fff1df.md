The chronic nature of the disease and spontaneous regression of each elementary lesion leaving a scar, are so characteristic of lymphomatoid papulosis that differential diagnoses are rarely raised. However, the pauci-lesional form is frequently misinterpreted as:

- Insect bites

- Prurigo

- Lichenoid pityriasis

- Folliculitis

- Scabies

Histologically, the distinction may be impossible between lymphomatoid papulosis type B and mycosis fungoides, or between lymphomatoid papulosis type C and CD30 anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The diagnosis is then based on the anatomoclinical confrontation privileging the clinical aspect. The distinction between mycosis fungoides of early-stage associated with lymphomatoid papulosis (good prognosis) and a transformed mycosis fungoides of nodular evolution (poor prognosis) is important and sometimes difficult. It is based on anamnesis and anatomoclinical expertise.
