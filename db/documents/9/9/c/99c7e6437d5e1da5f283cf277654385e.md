**Dissolution**

Dissolution is the process where a solute in gaseous, liquid, or solid phase dissolves in a solvent to form a solution.

**Solubility**

Solubility is the maximum concentration of a solute that can dissolve in a solvent at a given temperature. At the maximum concentration of solute, the solution is said to be saturated. The units of solubility can be provided in mol/L or g/L.

Factors that affect solubility include:

- The concentration of the solute

- The temperature of the system

- Pressure (for gases in solution)

- The polarity of the solute and the solvent
