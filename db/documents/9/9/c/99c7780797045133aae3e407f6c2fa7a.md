Intraductal papilloma is a benign tumor found within breast ducts. The abnormal proliferation of ductal epithelial cells causes tumor growth. A solitary intraductal papilloma is usually found centrally posterior to the nipple affecting the central duct. Multiple intraductal papillomas are located peripherally, found in any breast quadrant affecting the peripheral ducts. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of patients with intraductal papilloma and highlights the interprofessional team's role in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the histopathology of intraductal papilloma.
- Describe the presentation of intraductal papilloma.
- Summarize the treatment of intraductal papilloma.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve patient outcomes affected by intraductal papilloma.
