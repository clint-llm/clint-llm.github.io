Body surface area was developed as a metric to use in the modulation of various pharmacological therapies and a standard tool by which to index various physiologic measurements such as glomerular filtration rate and cardiac output. There exist many variations in formulae to calculate an individualâ€™s body surface area, but one of the most widely used techniques to calculate this value is the Du Bois and Du Bois formula. The formula is as follows

- 
**Body Surface Area= 0.007184 x (Height(cm)^0.725) x (Weight(kg)^0.425)**
