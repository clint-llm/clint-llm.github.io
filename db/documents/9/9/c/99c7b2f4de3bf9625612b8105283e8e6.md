Psoriasis is caused by inappropriate activation of the immune system defined by a series of linked cellular changes in the skin that include keratinocyte hyperplasia; altered T-cell function and angiogenesis, the most important cell series being the helper T cells. The role of oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species [ROS] and an increased expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the pathogenesis of psoriasis have been proved. Many psoriasis susceptibility loci have been detected by linkage studies (PSORS1-12). HLA-Cw6 allele has a strong association with early-onset psoriasis.

More research is ongoing in the area of biomarkers in psoriasis. Leptin and resistin are considered as candidate biomarkers for prediction of development of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis in obese patients with psoriasis. K16 expression in non-lesional psoriatic epidermis has been sug­gested as a marker of preclinical psoriasis. IL-18 is the candidate cytokine biomarker of disease severity. Lower levels of cell surface expression markers of T-cell subsets, such as CD8, CD45RO, CD2, CD94, and CD161 are features of  inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus (ILVEN) but not with Blaschko linear psoriasis.
