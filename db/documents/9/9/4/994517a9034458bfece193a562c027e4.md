The thyroid uptake and scan play a central role in the diagnosis of thyroid diseases and abnormalities in thyroid function as it provides detailed information on the functions and anatomy of the thyroid gland. Different radioactive tracers function to detect or diagnose various thyroid diseases. Iodine, technetium pertechnetate, gallium-67, and fluoro-deoxy-glucose are all used. Relative uptake of iodine and technetium pertechnetate by focal thyroid nodule is labeled as warm, cold, or hot. Other uses of iodine include treatment of thyroid cancer, evaluation of residual/recurrent disease, evaluation of distant metastasis, and follow up of patients after thyroidectomy.
