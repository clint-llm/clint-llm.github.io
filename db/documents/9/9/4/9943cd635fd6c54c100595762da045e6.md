As with any surgery, preparation begins with a thorough history and physical and focuses specifically on planned flaps, the proposed donor muscle or myocutaneous flap, and recipient site concerns. Computed tomography with angiography, while not required, may be prudent when the status of key vascular pedicles or recipient vessels remains unclear. A hematologist should evaluate patients with any history of coagulation problems and, if necessary, started on anticoagulation for the perioperative period. Contaminated wounds should be washed out and debrided multiple times when possible to decrease the bacterial burden before flap coverage. Also, given the prolonged surgical and recovery times and the high metabolic demands of muscle and myocutaneous flaps, nutrition should be optimized when possible. Nursing and support staff comfortable with flap patients require confirmation before starting flap surgery. When myocutaneous flaps are the choice for pressure sore coverage, a thorough assessment by therapy services, offloading mattresses, and wheelchair pressure mapping with appropriate offloading leads to a moreÂ successful reconstruction.
