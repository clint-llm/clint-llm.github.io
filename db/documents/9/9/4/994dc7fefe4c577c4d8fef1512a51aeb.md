About 110,000 new cases of LC are diagnosed each year in the United States. The true incidence of LC is difficult to determine, as this condition is usually underdiagnosed during a gross and microscopic examination at autopsy. The incidence varies among different cancer types. Among breast cancer patients, it ranges between 5% and 8%, up to 9% to 25% in lung cancer, and up to 30% in melanomas. Some authors have reported incidence rates of 6% to 18% for melanomas. The incidence of LC is increasing due to improved survival rates secondary to the improved systemic control of the disease, better imaging, diagnostic modalities, and treatment with therapies that do not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The longer patients live with systemic cancer, the higher the chances of tumor spread and seeding of the leptomeninges. The median time to diagnose LC after diagnosis of a solid tumor ranges between 1.2 and 2 years; this time is about 11 months in hematologic cancers.
