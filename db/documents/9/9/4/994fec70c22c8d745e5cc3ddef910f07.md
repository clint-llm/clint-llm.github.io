Sympathetic ophthalmia is a rare pathologic process characterized by bilateral uveitis following injury to one eye either from surgery or penetrating ocular trauma.

The exact pathogenesis of sympathetic ophthalmia is unclear. It is believed that there is a compromised immune-privileged status of the eye after a penetrating injury and exposure of previously sequestered uveoretinal antigens to the systemic immune system. The resulting inflammation in the eye can be devastating and cause permanent blindness. Therefore, early detection and intervention with immunosuppression are vital.
