Children with reading difficulties present differently depending on their age. Early intervention is essential to improving their outcome as most children with reading issues still present in the third grade continue to struggle throughout their formal education. Diagnosis is not typically made until formal reading education has been attempted, usually in the first grade.

At-risk preschoolers may present with:

- Rhyming difficulty

- Confusing words that sound similar

- Trouble learning the names of letters

At-risk kindergarten and first graders may present with:

- Inability to learn letters
- Strong predictor for reading ability

- Unable to read words and difficulty spelling by the end of first grade

Second grade and beyond may present with:

- Poor school performance

- Dislike of school

- Somatic dysfunctions when heading to school or before work is due

Children with reading disabilities will avoid reading; this will expose them to fewer words and increase their reading deficiency. The physical exam for patients with dyslexia should be standardÂ with a focus on signs of other neurological, medical, or genetic causes of their impairment.
