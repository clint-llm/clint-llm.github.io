Differential diagnosis of cystic echinococcus includes:

- Simple benign cyst: It produces the same symptoms of nausea, malaise, and RUQ discomfort but is easily differentiated by USG.

- Hemangioma: An incidental finding on imaging or laparotomy and presents with abdominal pain and fullness.

- HCC: It has characteristic features on imaging.

- Abscess: It can radiographically and clinically resemble echinococcal disease.

- Tuberculosis: It is differentiated by the presence of acid-fast bacilli on smear or culture.
