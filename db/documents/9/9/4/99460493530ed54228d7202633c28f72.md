The diagnostic workup of carcinoid syndrome includes initial testing for biochemical markers followed by localization of tumors with radiographic and endoscopic studies.

**Testing for Biochemical Markers**

**Twenty-four-hour urine for 5-HIAA**is the initial diagnostic test. The 5-HIAA is the end product of serotonin metabolism. This urine test has 90% sensitivity and specificity. A false positive can be due to tryptophan-rich food like banana, pineapple, plum, kiwi, avocado, eggplant, pecan, and walnut. Various medicines, including acetaminophen, guaifenesin, caffeine, nicotine, methamphetamine, and phenobarbital, can increase the 5-HIAA level. On the other hand, medications like aspirin, ethanol, heparin, imipramine, levodopa, methyldopa, monoamine oxidase (MAOI), INH, and corticotropin can decrease 5-HIAA level. Patients should avoid these foods and medicines for at least 24 hours before and during urine collection. The 5-HIAA correlates with tumor burden and can be used to follow treatment response.

**Chromogranin A**is a glycoprotein secreted by neuroendocrine tumors. It is useful for the detection of the non-secreting tumor. It has very good sensitivity but poor specificity. It is an excellent marker for follow up. Certain conditions like the use of proton pump inhibitors, atrophic gastritis, renal failure, hyperthyroidism, heart failure, HTN, prostate cancer can also cause marked elevation of CgA.

Twenty-four-hour Urine for serotonin is not available in the United States but can be useful in foregut neuroendocrine tumors with rare carcinoid syndrome due to 5-HT.

**Blood serotonin**is usually not recommended as the specificity of this test is not reliable.

**The plasma 5-HIAA level**is convenient but yet to be validated.

**Localizing and Staging Studies**

If positive for biomarkers, various radiographic imaging and or endoscopic procedures can be obtained for tumor localization.

**Radiographic imaging**includes cross-sectional imaging with triple-phase Computerized tomography scan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. Abdominal CT (with triphasic CT of the liver) is the diagnostic test of choice. Some prefer MRI over CT due to greater sensitivity for liver metastases.

**Indium-111 pentetreotide (Octreoscan)**has more than 90% sensitivity in symptomatic patients and 80% to 90% sensitivity in asymptomatic patients. It cannot detect poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, and its specificity is low. Functional PET imaging with 68-Ga Dotatate is preferred, and it is a newer modality with improved sensitivity and better resolution for a small tumor.

**Bronchoscopy with biopsy**can be performed for bronchial neuroendocrine tumors. If positive for radiographic findings, based on the location of the disease, upper or lower endoscopy or ultrasound-guided biopsy could be performed for histopathology. Neuron-specific enolase, Chromogranin A, Ki-67 mitotic index, saprophytic, and serotonin markers could be checked in tissue obtained.
