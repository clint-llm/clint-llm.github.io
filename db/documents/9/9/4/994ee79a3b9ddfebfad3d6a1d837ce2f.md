The probable theory for the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis – in pregnant women and the general population – is that the disease results from an environmental trigger in a genetically predisposed individual. The precise mechanism between the genes and the autoimmune process is still unknown. However, at the molecular level, they are believed to involve an antigen, a major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and a T cell receptor, which together form a complex in which complementary-determining regions identify and contact the antigen-MHC complex.
