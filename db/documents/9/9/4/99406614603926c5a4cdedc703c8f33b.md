History is key to suspecting this diagnosis as this condition is easy to overlook or fail to consider.Â Once CECS is suspected, diagnosis is confirmed by dynamic intra-compartmental pressure measurement at rest and then after exercise.

The Pedowitz criteria are often used to obtain or rule out a diagnosis of CECS in each compartment of interest

- A resting pressure of greater than or equal to 15 mmHg and/or a pressure of greater than or equal to 30 mmHg at 1 min post-exercise in any compartment, and/or;

- Post-exercise pressure greater than 20 mmHg at 5 minutes post-exercise
