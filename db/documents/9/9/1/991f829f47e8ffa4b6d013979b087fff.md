An informed consent, including risks and benefits of the procedure, should be performed before carrying out an ESP block. A peri-procedural “timeout” should be performed to confirm the type of procedure, side, and location of the procedure, and to ensure that there are no contraindications.

Standard patient monitoring should be in place, including continuous ECG monitoring, pulse oximetry, and blood pressure measurement in at least 5-minute intervals. Intravenous access should be obtained, and resuscitation equipment, including vasopressors/medications for local anesthetic toxicity and intubating equipment, should be nearby.

Patients should have prepping performed with chlorhexidine gluconate, and sterile conditions maintained throughout the procedure. Sterile gloves and surgical cap and mask should are necessary, and the ultrasound probe placed into the sterile ultrasound probe cover for imaging.
