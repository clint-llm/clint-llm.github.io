Generally accepted actions for care in the dying patient:

- Withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining measures: Not intubating a patient, not providing fluids or nutrition, removing mechanical ventilation or turning off a pacemaker for example.

- Relief of pain and other symptoms: Such as dyspnea, anxiety, agitation, confusion; concern that the use of drugs that will treat those symptoms could shorten the patient's life must not lead to underdosing.

- Sedation: In few cases, complex symptoms may be so severe that they are refractory to all medications and the undertreatment of those symptoms causes distress. They may perform continuous sedation until death in these types of situations. Discussions should be open and honest and involve all pertinent parties. The depth of sedation should be symptom-guided.
