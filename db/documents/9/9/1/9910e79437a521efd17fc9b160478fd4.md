Electrodiagnostic testing is an important tool for the diagnosis of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP). This activity describes the electrodiagnostic findings of both nerve conduction tests as well as needle EMG studies in AIDP.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomy/physiology of nerve conduction and its relevance to acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.
- Identify the indications for electrodiagnostic testing in patients with symmetric distal weakness.
- Describe the nerve conduction study findings in a patient with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.
- Review the electromyographic findings in a patient with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.
