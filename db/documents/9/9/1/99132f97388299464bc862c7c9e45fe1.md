**Boxed Warning:**Levothyroxine or other thyroid hormones, alone or with other therapeutic drugs, should not be used to treat obesity or promote weight loss. In euthyroid patients, levothyroxine dose in the range of daily hormonal requirements is ineffective for weight loss. In addition, larger doses of levothyroxine may lead to serious and life-threatening manifestations, especially when combined with sympathomimetic amines like phentermine used for anorectic effects.
