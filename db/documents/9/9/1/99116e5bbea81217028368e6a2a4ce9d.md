Bortezomib is FDA-approved for use in the initial treatment of multiple myeloma in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone. It is also FDA-approved for use in the treatment of multiple myeloma in individuals who previously responded to bortezomib and relapsed at least six months after the completion of the prior treatment. Also, it is FDA-approved for use in the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma in individuals who have received at least one previous first-line treatment. This activity will review the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring pertinent for members of the interprofessional team for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of bortezomib. 
- Identify the approved indications for bortezomib.
- Review the adverse events of bortezomib.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance bortezomib use and improve outcomes in cancer treatment.
