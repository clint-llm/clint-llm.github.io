Pericardiocentesis is performed for medical patients either as a therapeutic or diagnostic procedure. Pericardiocentesis is indicated when either an acute or a chronic pericardial effusion causes cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis in acute or chronic pericardial effusions without evidence of cardiac tamponade and other non-emergent situations is indicated for the diagnosis of the underlying etiology of the effusion by obtaining pericardial fluid for laboratory analysis, for palliation of symptoms including dyspnea or edema, or to prevent progression of the effusion to pericardial tamponade an emergent situation. Â In the acute setting, only a small amount of pericardiac fluid (100-150 mL) is necessary to cause cardiac tamponade, while in chronic pericardial effusions, as much as 1-2 L of pericardial fluid may accumulate as long as the parietal pericardium has adequate time to adjust to the increasing volume. Pericardiocentesis can be performed at the bedside in the same manner as for traumatic pericardial tamponade, or the patient may be resuscitated with IV fluids and taken to the cardiac catheterization lab for pericardiocentesis performed using TTE or fluoroscopic guidance and with monitoring of right-sided heart pressures. In situations where reaccumulation of pericardial fluid is expected, a pericardial drain may be to facilitate serial drainage.
