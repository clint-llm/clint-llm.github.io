The diagnosis of a chest wall tumor is multifold. It requires a thorough history and physical examination. Chest wall tumors have insidious onset of symptoms, most of which are nonspecific. Patients usually notice pain, swelling, and cosmetic derangement, which prompts them to visit a physician. After a thorough history and physical, patients can expect further imaging necessary, usually starting with a chest radiograph. If there is high suspicion for a chest wall tumor after obtaining a chest radiograph, additional imaging modalities, including computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, may be required.

Furthermore, definitive diagnosis relies on a tissue biopsy. The ultimate standard of care will be a surgical resection, potentially in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. An interprofessional approach is vital to creating a cohesive and comprehensive treatment plan.
