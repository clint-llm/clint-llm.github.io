Tetramethylenedisulfoteramine (tetramine) is a rodenticide that causes severe neurotoxicity. Though internationally banned, tetramine is still manufactured. There are numerous cases of poisoning, especially in rural areas.Â This agent is available through illicit markets in multiple countries and is relatively inexpensive.

Due to its chemical stability, ease of production, lack of taste or smell, and rapid onset of toxicity, tetramine has been discussed as a possible candidate for a chemical threat agent.
