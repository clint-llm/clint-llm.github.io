Typically, several different reconstructive options may be employed for a given defect, and engaging in a discussion regarding these options with the patient can help to provide realistic expectations. For patients who are amenable, showing them the defect prior to reconstruction can also help inform expectations regarding recovery and scarring.

The defect should be photographed preoperatively for the medical record, including a ruler or measuring tape for scale.

In the operating room, the defect and the surrounding area should be injected with a local anesthetic, including epinephrine, for hemostasis, and additional local anesthetic should be kept readily available on the sterile field for use in the event of insufficient pain control intraoperatively. Cleansing the skin can be performed before or after injection, depending on whether the injections are performed in a sterile fashion or not. A conservative volume of anesthetic should be injected to avoid distorting the area surrounding the defect. Skin preparation may be accomplished with povidone iodine, chlorhexidine, or isopropyl alcohol, according to surgeon preference. The use of non-colored cleansing agents may facilitate intraoperative selection of skin with an appropriate color and texture match, however. Marking the planned flap should be performed in a sterile fashion after skin cleansing, as an application of the cleansing agent is liable to smear or erase the surgical marks if they are made beforehand.
