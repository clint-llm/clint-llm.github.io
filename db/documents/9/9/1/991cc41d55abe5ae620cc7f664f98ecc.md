Treatment for metacarpal fractures is usually with hand surgery, with metacarpal shortening ranging from 2mm to 10mm. Researchers have found that in metacarpal shortening of 2 mm, there is an approximate 8 percent in strength reduction of the respective interossei. Moreover, a 10mm shortening can reduce the respective interossei strength of roughly 55 percent.

Compartment syndromes of the interossei are uncommon and are difficult to diagnose due to their atypical presentations.

Another case study described two children who experienced suction injuries when their hands got caught in a swimming-pool intake pipe filtration system. This system created a powerful negative pressure, causing acute interossei compartment syndrome that required emergent surgical decompression.
