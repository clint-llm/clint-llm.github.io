**Non-Operative**

Standard non-operative interventions include activity modification, anti-inflammatory medications, simple accommodative shoes, and custom orthoses. Patients with milder deformities and milder symptoms may be successfully treated using custom orthoses, with the goal being realignment of the hindfoot and to offload the lateral foot.

Medications for the underlying spasticity have been used as well and include baclofen, dantrolene, and diazepam. Botulinum toxin blocks have also been used.

Gastrocnemius stretching programs are also used to help prevent contractures. A single patient 12 weeks lower extremity strengthening program resulted in an increase in dorsiflexion strength by 56% to 72% and plantarflexion strength by 15% to 20%. Functional outcomes also improved for the patient.

**Operative**

Many authors will advocate for early operative intervention due to the progressive deformity and muscular imbalances that are present prior to unsalvageable fixed deformities with degenerative joints.

Options for surgical intervention include numerous in-phase tendon transfers, out-of-phase tendon transfers, tendon lengthenings, calcaneal osteotomies, talar neck osteotomies, dorsiflexion osteotomy of the first ray, midfoot osteotomies, and arthodeses for joints in which degenerative changes have occurred. The precise combination of procedures used depends greatly on each patient's deformity and the surgeon's experience and philosophy.

Commonly performed procedures are listed as examples below:

With regards to tendon transfers, in the flexible cavus foot, the posterior tibial tendon may be transferred to the dorsum of the foot to augment the weak tibialis anterior. The peroneus longus may also be transferred to the peroneus brevis to reduce the pull on the first ray and to assist with the eversion of the foot.

Soft tissue releases such as gastrocnemius recession or heel cord lengthening are often advocated in the setting of hindfoot equinus.

Osseous alignment procedures commonly consist of a first metatarsal dorsiflexion osteotomy for fore-foot driven cavus. For hindfoot drive varus, a lateralizing calcaneal osteotomy is commonly used to recreate native hindfoot valgus and realign the pull of the gastrocnemius.

Joint sparing osteotomies are preferred in patients without advanced degenerative disease. However, even in those patients in which arthrodesis is performed, the balancing of the muscular forces is recommended to avoid fusion failure.

Surgical treatment of the subtle cavus foot often occurs while the surgeon is addressing other pathologies such as lateral overload symptoms, stress fractures, or lateral ankle instability.
