Spinal anesthesia should be only be performed by highly trained and certified medical personnel; this is typically by a board-certified anesthesiologist or anesthesiologist in training under the supervision of an anesthesiologist. Other fellowship-trained staff that performs spinal anesthesia are pain management physicians with training in physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R), neurology, emergency medicine.

Like in any other procedure, an assistant is always helpful. Since the patient's back will be facing the physician performing the procedure, a supporting staff member, usually a trained nurse, is typically present to assist with equipment. The supporting staff also helps in supporting the patient from the ventral side to help them maintain their posture and keep them safe in their position, especially if the patient has undergone sedation.
