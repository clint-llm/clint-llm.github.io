The determination of the epidemiological measurement features sometimes becomes very difficult since a lot of women often remain asymptomatic and go undiagnosed. The exact prevalence cannot be easily defined since the definitive diagnosis of the disease; a laparoscopic examination needs to be conducted. It is estimated that endometriosis affects approximately 10% to 15% of women of reproductive age, whereas this prevalence increases by up to 70% in women with chronic pelvic pain.

The diagnosis of endometriosis in the majority of women is often delayed, and thus women unavoidably suffer from the pain and the long-term effects of this debilitating disease, including infertility. In women with infertility, endometriosis has been found to be up to 50%, whereas, in adolescents, the incidence of endometriosis is reported to be 47% of those who have experienced laparoscopy for pelvic pain.

On the contrary, there are protective factors against endometriosis, mainly acting via lowering the inflammatory process or by decreasing the levels of estrogen in the body. Parity, protracted breastfeeding, current oral contraceptive use, tubal ligation, and smoking are related to a decreased risk for endometriosis.
