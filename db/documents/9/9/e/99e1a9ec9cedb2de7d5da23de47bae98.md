Cholera is an infectious disease caused by the ingestion of food or water contaminated by the bacteria Vibrio cholerae. Patients living in endemic areas and travelers to these regions should be educated on the importance of hand hygiene. Additionally, boiling water before it is consumed or used to rinse food is imperative. As stated above there are vaccines that can be used in endemic areas as well. Patients that live or have traveled to endemic countries should be encouraged to seek medical attention immediately if they develop signs of cholera infection.
