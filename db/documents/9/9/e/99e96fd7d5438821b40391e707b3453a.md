Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) is a rare genetic disease secondary to an inborn error of glycine metabolism.

No known interventions are effective in altering the natural history of nonketotic hyperglycinemia, but whatever therapeutic strategies are applied can potentially reduce the comorbidities associated with this condition. It is essential that the clinician recognizes this disease and initiates early evaluation and treatment to attain the best possible outcome.
