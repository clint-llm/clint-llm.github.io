The history of the patient may describe a variety of symptoms. A patient may have pulmonary tuberculosis along with cutaneous tuberculosis and may give a history of cough, sputum, night sweats, fever, weight loss, hemoptysis, chest pain, and fatigue, among others, along with cutaneous symptoms. In disseminated cutaneous tuberculosis, abdominal pain and diarrhea may suggest abdominal tuberculosis. A headache may indicate tubercular meningitis. Direct inoculation of bacteria presents with cutaneous symptoms alone.

History may also reveal immune deficiency due to underlying diseases like AIDS, uncontrolled diabetes, malignancy, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Other causes of immunodeficiency include intravenous drug abuse and immunosuppressive therapy.

On examination, physical findings may include various kinds of cutaneous lesions. There can be inflammatory papules, ulcers, nodules, pustules, verrucous plaques, or any other type of lesion.
