The presentation of a double aortic arch depends largely on the existence of hemodynamic instability. Children with double aortic arch tend to present earlier than those with the other vascular ring pathology, the right-sided aortic arch.

They may remain undiagnosed, rarely may be diagnosed during fetal echocardiography, and often are identified as an incidental finding during routine imaging for other indications. There are reported cases of double aortic arch being diagnosed after foreign body ingestion, and in an adult with aortic dissection.

Due to the anatomic nature of the lesion and based on the degree of compression on the trachea and/or esophagus, patients may present with respiratory failure shortly after birth, apneic episodes, apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) or brief resolved unexplained events (BRUE), noisy breathing which may include stridor or wheeze, cyanosis, persistent cough, recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, misdiagnosed ‘asthma’ resistant to therapy, choking, regurgitation, persistent dysphagia, and failure to thrive. Exercise tolerance may be limited due to symptoms.

Physical examination may often be entirely normal but can include evidence of poor growth and feed intolerance, non-positional stridor, respiratory distress, and features of a lower respiratory infection such as bronchial breath sounds and crackle.
