- The maxillary sinus is one of the most common midface fracture sites reported in the literature.

- Maxillary sinus fractures are most commonly due to trauma from MVA's, falls, domestic disputes, accidents, or assaults.

- Patient stabilization with the ACLS protocol should be the first step in the management of these fractures. A thorough head and neck examination with neurologic evaluation is necessary to look for associated injuries and prevent complications.

- Noncontrast computed tomography scan of the maxillofacial bones is the gold standard imaging modality for these patients. Plain film x-rays, ultrasound, and MRI have less clinical utility in these patients.

- Physicians can wait up to two weeks to repair maxillary sinus fractures, allowing time to manage more life-threatening injuries.

- Isolated maxillary sinus fractures are typically treated with conservative management.

- Prophylactic antibiotic use for isolated MSFs is still controversial in the literature.
