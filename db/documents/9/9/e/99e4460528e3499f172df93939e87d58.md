Thyroid cancer is a malignancy of the thyroid parenchymal cells. The thyroid parenchyma consists of two major cell types, the thyroid follicular cells that give rise to differentiated thyroid cancer(DTC) and the parafollicular or C-cells that give rise to medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). DTC comprises papillary thyroid cancer(PTC), follicular thyroid cancer(FTC), and Hurthle cell cancer which account for 90-95% of all thyroid malignancies. MTC accounts for around 1Â to 2%, and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma accounts for less than 1% of all thyroid cancers
