These abscesses most commonly are found in reproductive-age women after an upper genital tract infection. However, a TOA also can occur without a preceding episode of PID or sexual activity and occasionally can develop as a complication of a hysterectomy.

Previously, nearly 20% of hospitalized PID cases were found to have a TOA. However, in 2002, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, which increased the number of patients being diagnosed with and treated for PID and reduced the prevalence of TOA to a mere 2.3%.

Of note, women who are HIV positive with PID generally have a slower clinical resolution of the disease and therefore an increased risk for the development of a TOA.
