It remains imperative to identify the risk factors and perform a thorough assessment of the patient before transconjunctival blepharoplasty. A team approach is an ideal way to limit the complications of this procedure. Before surgery, the patient should have the following done:

- Evaluation by a surgeon experienced in selecting the appropriate patient for the surgery

- Evaluation by their primary care physician, anesthesiologist, and nurse anesthetist to ensure that the patient is fit for anesthesia

- Evaluation by the optometrist or ophthalmologist if the patient suffers from dry eye, ptosis, or lagophthalmos

- Evaluation and monitoring by the pre-operative, operative, and post-operative specialty trained nurses assisting with patient and family education as well as coordination of care.

an interprofessional team of an experienced surgeon, anesthesiologist, and surgical assistants and operative nurses should perform the transconjunctival blepharoplasty for the best outcomes. Close follow-up during the initial post-operative period, either by a wound care nurse and/or clinician experienced in the post-operative care of transconjunctival blepharoplasty should monitor the patient for possible complications, including any visual deficits. It is also critical to counsel the patient on avoiding strenuous activity, heavy lifting, or bending over during the first several days post-operatively to prevent such complications. This type of interprofessional team approach will lead to optimal patient outcomes in transconjunctival blepharoplasty cases. [Level 5]
