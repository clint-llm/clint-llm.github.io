Conjunctivochalasis (CCh) is characterized by redundant, loose, and non-edematous bulbar conjunctival folds that can induce tear film instability and disruption to the tear drainage pathway. It is often missed due to the wide array of symptoms that can mimic other conditions. Management involves a stepwise approach, ranging from topical lubricants to surgical conjunctival recession and reconstruction of the fornix. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of CCh and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of CCh.
- Outline the clinical features of CCh.
- Review the management of CCh along with their indications.
- Summarize the importance of coordination between interprofessional team members regarding the management of a patient with CCh.
