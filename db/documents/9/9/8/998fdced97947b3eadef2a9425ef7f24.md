A complicated cataract causes significant visual impairment in addition to the effects of the primary intraocular disease. This can affect the patient physically and mentally to a significant degree. Hence, the patient should be well motivated and educated about the nature of the condition, possible complications, benefits of timely treatment, and the need for long-term follow-up. In addition, careful counseling is needed in these patients as many patients will have been receiving treatment for a prolonged period already.
