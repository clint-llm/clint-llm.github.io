Contraindications to the administration of the MMR vaccine include:

- Previous severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a dose of MMR or to a vaccine component (i.e., neomycin, gelatin)

- Pregnancy or attempting to become pregnant: Women should receive counsel to avoid becoming pregnant 28 days after receiving MMR because of the theoretical risk of congenital rubella syndrome. Pregnant women without immunity to rubella should receive a dose of MMR postpartum.

- Immunodeficiency: Individuals with immunodeficiency are at risk for severe complications following immunization with live attenuated virus vaccines (e.g., encephalitis, pneumonitis). Immune deficiencies that are contraindications to MMR include:

- 
              
- Primary acquired immunodeficiency (e.g., cellular immunodeficiency, hypogammaglobulinemia, HIV infection)
              
              
- Malignant neoplasms such as leukemia and lymphoma that affect the bone marrow or lymphatic system
              
              
- Immunosuppressive therapy. MMR should be avoided in patients receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy just as high-dose corticosteroid therapy.
