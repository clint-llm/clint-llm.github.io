The prevalence of FGR SGA varies across different populations.

The incidence rates of FGR SGA in preterm infants vary according to whether data collection was based on birth weight or gestational age. In a cohort of 4438 infants with birthweight from 500Â to 1500g, 22% are reported as FGR SGA, according to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network database.
