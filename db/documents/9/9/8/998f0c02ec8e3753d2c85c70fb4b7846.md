The nasopharynx represents the most superior portion of the pharynx, bounded superiorly by the skull base and inferiorly by the soft palate. The nasopharynx connects the nasal cavity to the oropharynx and contains the Eustachian tube openings and adenoids. Notable clinical situations include nasopharyngeal carcinoma and adenoidal hypertrophy. This review will discuss the anatomy of the nasopharynx, including the structure, function, embryology, blood supply, innervation, anatomical variants, and clinical relevance.
