Anastrozole, a selective aromatase inhibitor, is available as a 1 mg tablet, which is to be taken orally once a day, with or without food. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or liver impairment or elderly patients. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends the use of aromatase inhibitors as a component of adjuvant hormonal therapy after surgery for ten years in postmenopausal patients who have a diagnosis of early-stage, node-positive, and hormone receptive breast cancer.

Letrozole is also a selective aromatase inhibitor. It is manufactured in 2.5 mg tablets. For postmenopausal breast cancer, dosing is 2.5 mg daily. As an agent to induce ovulation, dosing is 2.5 mg to 5 mg daily for 5 days starting on day 3 of the menstrual cycle. Renal adjustment is unnecessary if creatinine clearance is above 10. In patients with cirrhosis of the liver, CHild-Pugh Class C, increase the dosing interval to every 48 hours.

Exemestane, another selective agent, comes in 25 mg tablets, and for postmenopausal breast cancer, dosing is 25 mg daily for 2 to 3 years. No renal or hepatic dose adjustments are necessary.
