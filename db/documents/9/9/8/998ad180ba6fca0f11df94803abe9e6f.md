The affected patients are mostly asymptomatic. Most of the patients present within the first two years of life.

The core syndrome of primary agenesis of corpus callosum consists of the following symptoms

- Reduction in the interhemispheric transfer of sensory-motor information

- Delay in cognitive processing and

- Decrease in the complex information analysis and unacquainted task performance: increased vulnerability to elevation in cognitive demands.

Patients with agenesis of corpus callosum usually present with:

- Mental retardation (60%)

- Vision problems (33%)

- Delay in the development of speech (29%)

- Seizures (25%)

- Feeding problems (20%)

- Impaired hand-eye coordination and

- Socio-behavioral disorders like attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and psychosis

Isolated agenesis of corpus callosum patients may have normal intelligence quotient but may have some cognitive deficits, which group under the "core syndrome," which includes

- Reduced interhemispheric transfer of sensory-motor information

- Reduced cognitive processing speed

- Deficits in complex reasoning and novel problem-solving
