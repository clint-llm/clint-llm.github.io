The differential diagnoses include infectious mononucleosis, Hodgkin lymphoma, T-cell lymphomas, and other large cell malignancies such as carcinomas, melanoma, and Kikuchi disease. Melanomas can also involve the lymph nodes but can be differentiated from DLBCL by positive S100, HMB-45, and Melan A staining.
