Laboratory tests are not typically helpful in diagnosing hepatic adenomas. A-fetoprotein is usually negative. Hepatitis B and C should be checked to exclude malignant disease. A two- or threefold increase in alkaline phosphatase and g-glutamyl transferase has been seen, particularly with inflammatory hepatic adenomas. WBC count, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein may be elevated as well.

Core needle biopsy also has limited diagnostic value, although immunohistochemical markers can be helpful in expert centers.

Ultrasonography fails to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors. Doppler can demonstrate arterial hypervascularity with vessels running along the border of the lesion in a "basket pattern."

Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging with a hepatocyte-specific contrast agent, such as gadobenate dimeglumine, is the best modality for diagnosing hepatic adenomas. This method is most able to distinguish between hepatic adenomas and other benign and malignant tumors of the liver. The tumor can have a clearly defined central margin with nearly parallel vessels entering from the periphery, giving the appearance of a spoked wheel. Alternatively, it could have a tortuosity of peripheral vessels with central necrosis. A dynamic CT scan is another modality that can be useful in imaging. Equivocal imaging may need core needle biopsy for further clarification.
