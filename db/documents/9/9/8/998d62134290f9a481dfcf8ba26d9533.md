Neurothekeomas are rare, benign, superficial cutaneous tumors with variable histologic patterns, including myxoid, cellular, or mixed-type based primarily on the amount of myxoid matrix present. They frequently occur in the head and neck and tend to affect females more often than males, usually in the second and early third decades of life. This activity illustrates the evaluation, treatment, and complications of neurothekeomas and the importance of an interprofessional team approach to management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the definition of a neurothekeoma.
- Describe the typical presentation of a neurothekeoma.
- Explain how to manage neurothekeomas.
- Outline a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by neurothekeomas.
