Following maternal exposure to RhD-positive blood, B-lymphocyte clones that recognize the RBC antigen are established. The primary maternal immune response is the production of IgM isotype. It is important to note that this primary maternal immune response is dose-dependent. It occurs in about 15% of pregnancies with 1 mL of Rh-positive cells and 70% after 250 mL of Rh-positive cell exposure. Maternal IgG response occurs later in subsequent pregnancies. The secondary immune response follows repeat exposure to as little as 0.03 mL of Rh-positive cells.
