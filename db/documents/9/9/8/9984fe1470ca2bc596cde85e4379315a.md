Initial Tests (lab, imaging)

- Anemia: Hemoglobin may be normal in active bleeding and may take six to 24 hours to equilibrate. Other causes of anemia are common in cirrhotics

- Thrombocytopenia is the most sensitive and specific lab parameter that correlates with portal hypertension and large esophageal varices

- Elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin; prolonged PT, low albumin suggest cirrhosis

- BUN is often elevated in GI bleed

- Sodium level may drop in patients treated with terlipressin

- coagulation profile

- Renal function

- Arterial blood gas

- Hepatitis serology

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy

- Can identify actively bleeding varices as well as large varices and stigmata of recent bleeding

- Can be used to treat bleeding with esophageal band ligation (preferred to sclerotherapy); prevent rebleeding; detect gastric varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy; diagnose alternative bleeding sites

- Can identify and treat nonbleeding varices (protruding submucosal veins in the distal third of the esophagus)

Diagnostic Procedures/Other

- Transient elastography (TE) for identifying CLD patients at risk of developing clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH)

- Hepatic vein pressure gradient (HVPG)  greater than 10 mmHg is the gold standard to diagnose CSPH (normal: 1 mmHg to 5 mmHg)

- HVPG response of equal or greater than 10% or to less than or equal to 12 mmHg to intravenous propranolol may identify responders to nonselective beta-blocker (NSBB) and is linked to a significant decrease in risk of variceal bleeding

- Video capsule endoscopy screening may be an alternative to traditional endoscopy

- Doppler sonography (second line): demonstrates patency, diameter, and flow in the portal and splenic veins, and collaterals; sensitive for gastric varices; documents patency after ligation or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)

- CT or MRI-angiography (second-line, not routine): demonstrates large vascular channels in abdomen, mediastinum; demonstrates patency of intrahepatic portal and splenic vein

- Venous-phase celiac arteriography: demonstrates portal vein and collaterals; diagnosed hepatic vein occlusion

- Portal pressure measurement using a retrograde catheter in the hepatic vein.

- Ultrasound of the abdomen may reveal biliary obstruction (eg cancer)
