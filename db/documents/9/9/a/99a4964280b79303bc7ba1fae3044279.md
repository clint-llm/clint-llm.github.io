Intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy was first developed in 1992 by Drs. Goldman, Fitzpatrick, and Eckhouse for the treatment of leg telangiectasias. Proof-of-concept studies were conducted on rabbit ear veins, demonstrating IPL's ability to thermocoagulate vessels while minimizing purpura or epidermal damage.

IPL devices are unique in that they employ flashlamps and bandpass filters to produce pulsed light of varying wavelengths, durations, and fluences. These aspects promote its versatility in treating numerous dermatological diseases.
