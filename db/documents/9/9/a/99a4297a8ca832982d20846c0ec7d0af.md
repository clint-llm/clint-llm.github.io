Mechanical ventilation will need to be initiated whenever a patient has been intubated since the patient is no longer breathing spontaneously. In addition, it is recommended by the NAEMSP to use mechanical ventilation once a hypoxic and/or hypercapnic respiratory failure is identified and for airway protection.

In one study, respiratory problems were the most common complaints for EMS calls that required ventilator use (63.9%).
