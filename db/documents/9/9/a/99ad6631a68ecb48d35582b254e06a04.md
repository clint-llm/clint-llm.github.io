Coordination amongst heart and interprofessional team members is critical in any patient suspected of having a left ventricular false aneurysm. Close collaboration between cardiology, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and cardiac surgery can help ensure adequate blood pressure management and the timing of surgical intervention. Cardiac surgery must be involved early in the care process as urgent or emergent surgery is necessary in many cases. The role of the cardiovascular nurse is crucial, from preoperative preparation, assisting during the procedure, and in the postoperative management of patients discovering and reporting untoward complications to the team. These patients are prone to arrhythmias, low ejection fraction, and bleeding. Hence, close communication with the surgeon is critical. Because of the relative rarity of this diagnosis, regular education of these interprofessional team members can help maintain an adequate knowledge base, which will allow maximum contribution from each clinical area. An interprofessional team approach will result in the best outcomes in treat left ventricular false aneurysm. [Level V]
