As noted above, vitamin A toxicity can occur from either topical or oral use. Oral vitamin A delivery comes in two forms: provitamin A (a prodrug that is metabolized to vitamin A) and preformed vitamin A. Pre-formed vitamin A is obtained from animal food sources, including dairy products and liver, and in most supplements. A list of other foods containing Vitamin A includes milk, cheese, margarine, butter, eggs, chicken, chicken liver, beef, beef liver, processed meats, pizza, fish, and cold breakfast cereals

Many people in the United States take either isolated supplemental Vitamin A or other supplements that contain vitamin, A in addition to dietary intake. The current recommended dietary allowance of vitamin A is 800 retinol equivalents or 2700 international units (IU) for women

Excessive intake of preformed vitamin A, but not precursors, has been linked to teratogenicity in both human and animals studies
