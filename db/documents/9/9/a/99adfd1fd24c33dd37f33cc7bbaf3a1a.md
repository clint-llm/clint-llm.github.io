Potassium administration can be in the form of multiple salts, some of which can be ingested by the oral route (potassium chloride, acetate, bicarbonate, gluconate, and citrate), and some of which are given intravenously (potassium chloride and acetate). Certain potassium-containing compounds (e.g., potassium chloride) can be injected subcutaneously (hypodermoclysis).

**Oral Administration**

To reduce gastrointestinal irritation and cathartic effect, oral potassium supplements should be administered with or after meals.

Oral potassium salts are usually administered in 1 to 4 doses daily. With a relatively high daily dosage (greater than 20 mEq), drug administration should beÂ in divided doses.

Extended-release potassium chloride preparations are useful for patients who cannot tolerate or are non-compliant with multiple daily doses of potassium preparations.

**IV Infusion**

Administration of potassium-containing infusions must be by slow intravenous infusion, including boluses of potassium for hypokalemia (rate of administration generally should not exceed 20 mEq/hour). When including potassium in the long term or maintenance fluid administration, concentration should not exceed 40 mEq/L (exceptions may be severe hypokalemia associated with cardiac arrhythmias or diabetic ketoacidosis where higher concentrations of 60 to 80 mEq/L require caution). Continuous ECG monitoring and serial measurements of plasma potassium concentrations are essential during IV administration of potassium, particularly when the rate of administration is greater than 20 mEq/hour.

Potassium IV solutions should be administered only in well-hydrated patients and with adequate urine flow (especially in post-surgical patients).

The selection of potassium dosages requires caution in patients with renal impairment and geriatric patients.

Potassium acetate, potassium chloride, and potassium phosphate are available as concentrated solutions that require dilution before intravenous administration. Local vascular intolerance may be a limiting factor in the ability to administer concentrated solutions. Ideally, potassium infusion administration should be via a large, high-flow vein (e.g., femoral vein), or administration of lower concentration solutions may be in divided doses via peripheral veins.

**Dosage**

The calculated dosage of potassium supplements is usually as mEq of potassium. Depending on the potassium supplement formulation being used, the amount of a particular oral supplement that will provide a specific effective dosage of potassium in mEq will vary.

Normal adult daily potassium requirement and usual dietary potassium intake is 40 to 80 mEq; infants and children require 2 to 3 mEq/kg up to 40 mEq/m daily.
