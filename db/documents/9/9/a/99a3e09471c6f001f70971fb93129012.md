Proper diagnosis of median nerve palsies is dependent on physician's and mid-level practitioner's understanding of the relevant anatomy and etiology of median nerve injuries. Hand and upper extremity surgeons must work closely with primary care providers, who typically make the initial diagnosis, neurologists who offer confirmatory testing in the form of electromyography and other diagnostic studies, and their staff to correctly identify and treat the causes of median nerve palsy.

Outcomes are dependent on the etiology of the patient's symptoms, as well as the severity of injury to the median nerve. A collaborative effort between all members of the interprofessional team is critical for optimizing patient outcomes. [Level 5]
