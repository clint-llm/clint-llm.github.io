The Westergren method involves a simple blood draw that should take only a minute or two to obtain.

Blood is typically collected in a black top ESR vacuum tube that contains a 3.2% sodium citrate anticoagulant. Whole blood collected in a lavender EDTA tube is also acceptable. The sample must be in its own tube (black or lavender) and cannot be combined with other tests due to the volume required.

The blood sample will be sent to a laboratory. A lab technician will then transfer the anticoagulated whole blood to a vertical test tube (Westergren tube), which is inserted into the vacuum tube. When this sample is allowed to stand in the vertical tube for one hour, the red blood cells will slowly fall (settle) to the bottom due to the influence of gravity. This will leave a clear, straw-colored fluid at the top of the tube. This clear fluid is plasma, the portion of blood that remains after the red blood cells and other cellular components have settled to the bottom of the tube.

The test result will depend on the amount of plasma at the top of the tube, measured after one hour. The result will be reported in millimeters per hour (mm/hr).
