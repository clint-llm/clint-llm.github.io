Histologically, the majority of esophageal cancers are divided into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (ADCA). In the past 3 decades, these carcinomas have been respectively decreasing (less than 30%) and increasing (more than 60%) in incidence in the United States. When stratified by anatomical location, the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) continues to increase rapidly due to Barrettâ€™s esophagus.
