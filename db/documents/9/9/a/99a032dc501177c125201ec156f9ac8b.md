The Finkelstein test should be performed in cases of wrist pain, especially in patients presenting with pain on the radial aspect of the wrist. De Quervain's tenosynovitis (named after the Swiss surgeon Fritz de Quervain) should be suspected in patients presenting with pain at the radial side of the wrist, which worsens during pinch grasping (pinching an object between the tips of the thumb and index finger) or thumb and wrist movement. Pain may radiate to the thumb or along the volar aspect of the wrist. Some patients may also notice swelling and tenderness on the radial side of the wrist. The dominant hand is no more likely to be involved than the non-dominant hand
