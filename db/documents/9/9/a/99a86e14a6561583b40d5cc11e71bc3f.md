Cocaine abuse is a major public health problem, with an estimated 20 million users worldwide, based on the most recent United Nations World Drug Report. The number of frequent cocaine users, which had been declining since 2006 in North America, has experienced a recent increase, with an estimated 1% of the population reporting use. The Drug Enforcement Agency estimated that in 2012, 639,000 persons aged 12 or older had used cocaine for the first time within the previous 12 months in the United States (US), averaging approximately 1,800 initiates per day. In the US, cocaine was the most common drug of abuse resulting in hospital treatment, with 505,224 ED visits (40.3% of drug reported visits) in 2011 based on data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. This translates to a rate of 162 ED visits per 100,000 population.
