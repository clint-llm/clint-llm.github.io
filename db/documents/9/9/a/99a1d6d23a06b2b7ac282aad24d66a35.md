Spinal cord stimulator leads are placed within the epidural space. The dura mater lies anteriorly and the vertebral wall posteriorly to the epidural space. Blood vessels, lymph nodes, and fat also make up the posterior wall. The epidural space anatomically lies within the dural sac. Nerve roots are bathed with cerebrospinal fluid lie within the sac. The epidural space is at its fullest at the L2 vertebra; it starts superiorly with the base of the skull at the foramen magnum, then descends inferiorly until the sacrum at the sacral hiatus. Stimulator leads can be implanted within the level of cervical, thoracic, lumbar vertebra, and the sacrum.Â Electrical signals, either persistent our pulsatile, are applied to the epidural space once the spinal cord stimulator is installed.

Spinal cord stimulators function by neuromodulating the spinothalamic tract within the spinal cord. The spinothalamic tract regulates pain. When this pathway becomes disrupted as in the case of chronic pain, it is said to be dysregulated.
