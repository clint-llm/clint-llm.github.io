Atazanavir administration is via the oral route. Administration with food has demonstrated enhanced bioavailability and reduced pharmacokinetic variability. Gastric acid is necessary for the dissolution of atazanavir. Therefore, co-administration of antacids, buffered medications, proton pump inhibitors, and histamine H2-receptor antagonists requires a careful plan for separated dosing time.

Atazanavir is the first once-daily administered protease inhibitor; administration is with low dose ritonavir or cobicistat. Cobicistat and ritonavir are cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) inhibitors. Because the same enzyme metabolizes atazanavir, co-administration with cobicistat or ritonavir will increase the bioavailability of atazanavir. Atazanavir without these pharmacokinetic boosts may be administered in patients with underlying hyperlipidemia, as ritonavir-boosted therapy may enhance the risk of hyperlipidemia.
