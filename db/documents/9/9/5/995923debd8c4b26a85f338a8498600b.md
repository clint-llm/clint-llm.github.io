Given the complexity of the procedure and co-morbidities associated with the patient, the importance of vigilant monitoring cannot be emphasized more. Neurologic parameters (consciousness, mental status), hemodynamic parameters (hypo/hypertension, cardiac rhythms, heart rate), metabolic parameters (blood sugar, renal function), and other clinical factors such as temperature should be continuously monitored. Effective communication should be established between the interprofessional team, and adequate interventions should be carried outÂ in the best interest of the patients.
