There have been varying reports of the prevalence of latex allergy among the general population.Â Latex allergy affects 1 to 2 percent of the population, and one study showed that latex sensitization is more likely in healthcare workers exposed to latex compared to the general population. Clinical manifestation, however, was approximately the same in both healthcare workers and the general population.

Epidemiologic studies have shown that a specific patient population such as those with spina bifida are at increased risk of developing a latex allergy with the prevalence of spina bifida hypersensitivity ranging from 20% to 65%.
