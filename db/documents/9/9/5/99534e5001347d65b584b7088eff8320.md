The classification of myopia is essential for its appropriate management.

Meridional myopia, also termed myopic astigmatism, is a condition in which myopia exhibits two foci along two axes. Regular myopic astigmatism is diagnosed when the meridional difference is along the vertical and horizontal axes. Oblique astigmatism occurs when the axis is not at 90 degrees or 180 degrees. The corneal curvature, not the axial length of the globe, mostly contributes to meridional myopia. Lenticular myopia is the third most critical component of the myopic classification.

The crystalline lens undergoes substantial modifications with age, eventually contributing to changes in refractive error. Thus, the lenticular component should be examined for any myopic progression in adults. The severity of myopia is categorized as mild (between −0.5 and −4 D), moderate (between −4 and −8 D), and severe (> −8 D).
