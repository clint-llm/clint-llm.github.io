The most concerning complication of PTC is permanent vision loss because of compression of the optic nerve secondary to elevated intracranial pressure.

- Acetazolamide: hypokalemia, paresthesias of the extremities, and dysgeusia.

- Steroids: weight gain, refractory ICP increase when tapered, and fluid retention.

- Diuretics (furosemide, chlorthalidone): hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia (Furosemide), and ototoxicity.

- Lumbar puncture: infection, damage to surrounding structures, and post-lumbar puncture headache.

- Surgery: infection, diplopia (transient or permanent), and transient or permanent visual loss secondary to central retinal artery occlusion or ischemic optic neuropathy.
