The most common causative organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Fungi can also cause the disease by 5% to 20% of the general population, making it the second most common causative organism, with Aspergillus fumigatus being the most common cause of fungal MOE.

Other organisms, such as Proteus mirabilis, Proteus sp., Klebsiella sp., and Staphylococci, have been isolated.

Most of the patients diagnosed with MOE share varying degrees of immunosuppression, including patients with diabetes and immunosuppressed patients:

- Diabetes

- This is due to small-vessel vasculopathy and immune dysfunction associated with diabetes. Moreover, patients with diabetes have impaired response to antimicrobial agents, as their ear wax has a higher PH than normal people as well as lower lysozyme concentration. It has been reported that there is no difference in the prevalence of MOE between patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

- Immunosuppressed patients (e.g., from HIV infection, chemotherapy, etc.).
- Patients with AIDS have a different presentation, as they are usually younger, and Pseudomonas is not the most causative organism.
- Granulation tissue might not be found in the external auditory canal of patients with MOE and AIDS.
- These patients usually have a worse outcome than patients with diabetes.

Therefore, do not exclude the diagnosis in young, non-diabetic, or immunocompetent patients.
