It is imperative that regular prenatal screening and ultrasound monitoring occur when a woman is pregnant to provide the best possible outcome for the neonate. Although there are no definitive preventive measures for placental insufficiency, once it has been recognized either via ultrasound, MRI, BPP, or any combination of these methods, interventions such as heparin therapy can be initiated with the hopes to prolong gestation with the hopes of minimizing acidosis and hypoxia and resultantÂ  IUGR, prematurity or fetal demise. Further studies need to be done on interventions and treatments, and when during pregnancy, they will provide the most benefit to the developing fetus.
