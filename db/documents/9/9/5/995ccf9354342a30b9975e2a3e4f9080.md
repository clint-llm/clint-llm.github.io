The mechanisms that lead to delayed cell death following hypoxic-ischemic injury in the brain are complex. Ischemic cell death occurs via two different pathways: necrosis and apoptosis. During hypoxia-ischemia of the brain, acute energy failure leads to loss of ion homeostasis where intracellular sodium and calcium accumulate, creating osmotic swelling, which can lead to cell lysis.

Moderate global ischemia leads to infarcts in watershed areas (e.g., the area lying between regions fed by the anterior and middle cerebral arteries). These infarcts can damage highly vulnerable areas such as pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus (CA1 region) and pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex (layers 3, 5, and 6), which leads to laminar necrosis, the death of neurons in the basal ganglia (caudate nucleus and putamen), and the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum.

The cells of these areas are high in metabolic demand and contain a high concentration of excitatory neurotransmitter receptors. Other histologic findings include a shrunken eosinophilic neuron (anoxic neuron) and a red neuron representing neuronal cells that die from hypoxia.
