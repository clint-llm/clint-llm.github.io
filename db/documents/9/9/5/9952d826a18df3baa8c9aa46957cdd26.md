There are many anatomic variations in the blood supply of the heart. One of the biggest distinctions is determining whether the heart is RCA dominant, LCA dominant, or codominant. The dominance of the heart depends on where the PDA is derived from.

- If the PDA is a branch of the RCA, then it is said to be RCA dominant, this occurs in at least 70% of cases.

- If the PDA branch comes off the LCA, the patient is said to be LCA dominant; this occurs in about 10% of cases.

- The patient may also be codominant, meaning the PDA is supplied by both right and left coronary arteries, this occurs in 20% of cases. This is significant because if the LCA and obstruction supply the PDA, the LCA can be more damaging and critical

Important congenital coronary artery anomalies exist.  Children born with an anomalous left coronary from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) present with congestive heart failure around 4-6 months of age.  An anomalous left coronary artery from the right sinus coursing between the pulmonary artery and the aorta is associated with sudden death during exercise.

Coronary artery disease is uncommon in young people except in rare cases of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.
