Researchers have identified various Tracheoesophageal Fistula (TE) malformations by altering the gene regulation in knockout mice. These include:

Regulatory mediator Noggin, produced by the notochord, mediates continued specification and differentiation of the respiratory system from the foregut. Studies in mice highlight this regulatory role, where disruption of the notochord resulted in tracheal-esophageal fistulas and esophageal atresia with excessive endodermal tissue.

Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling plays a critical role in elongation for the trachea and esophagus. The knockout of wnt5a in mice has shown truncated esophagus development.

Sonic hedgehog (Shh) has a critical role in the development of the esophagus and other structures. Studies of Shh knock out mice show decreased rates of cell division and transcription factor expression.

Briefly, various other factors resulting in esophageal malformations are as following:

- P63 knockout mice show disruption in the stratification of squamous epithelium.

- Loss ofÂ  Keap1 results in thick keratinization in the esophagus.

- Lastly, knockout HoxC4 results in an obliterated esophageal lumen from over-proliferation, implying a suppression effect of HoxC4.
