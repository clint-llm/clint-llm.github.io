The timely diagnosis of neurogenic bladder is crucial, and it significantly impacts patient outcomes. A careful history and review of systems, along with a thorough, focused neurological examination, play a key role in identifying the underlying cause of the neurogenic bladder. Laboratory evaluation is also helpful in reaching a final diagnosis.

A neurogenic bladder can have many differentials, the most important of which is a spinal cord injury or tumor. Any injury to the spinal cord, including blunt, degenerative, developmental, vascular, infectious, traumatic, iatrogenic, radiation-induced, and idiopathic damage, can disturb normal micturition and result in urinary incontinence. Remember that patients with lesions at or above T-6 are at risk for autonomic dysreflexia.

Other causes of urinary dysfunction can be the following:

- Alzheimer disease

- Benign prostatic hyperplasia

- Bladder decompensation

- Brain disorders, trauma, tumors

- Cauda equina syndrome

- Decompensated bladder

- Dementia

- Diabetes mellitus

- Diabetes insipidus

- Drug side effects such as excessive anticholinergics

- Functional incontinence

- Herniated disc

- Infectious neurologic process

- Interstitial cystitis

- Mobility issues

- Morbid obesity

- Multiple sclerosis

- Myelomeningocele

- Neurosyphilis

- Overactive bladder

- Parkinson disease

- Pelvic and sacral fractures

- Pelvic surgery

- Pernicious anemia

- Radiation therapy

- Spina bifida

- Spinal and sacral tumors

- Spinal cord injury

- Stress incontinence

- Stroke

- Tabes dorsalis

- Transverse myelitis

- Urethral foreign bodies

- Urethral strictures

- Urinary tract infections
