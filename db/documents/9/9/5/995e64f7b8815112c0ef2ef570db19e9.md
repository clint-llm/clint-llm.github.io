Most patients with viral encephalitis recover without sequelae. Those who remain symptomatic have difficulties in concentration, behavioral and speech disorders, and/or memory loss. In rare cases, patients may remain in a vegetative state.

Some children may develop seizures and changes in behavior following infection with WEE. Following EEE, children may develop seizures, severe mental retardation and various forms of paralysis. Zike virus infection in pregnancy may be associated with microcephaly. The most common long term complication after viral encephalitis is seizures that may occur in 10-20% of patients over several decades. These seizures often are resistant to medical therapy. Unilateral mesial temporal lobe seizures have good outcomes following neurosurgery.
