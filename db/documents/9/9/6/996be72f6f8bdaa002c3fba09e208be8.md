Approximately one-third of fetuses with EA/TEF will be diagnosed prenatally.

However, many cases are not diagnosed before birth. Infants with EA are symptomatic soon after birth, with increased secretions, which leads to choking, respiratory distress, or cyanotic episodes during feeding. In EA types C-E, the fistula between the trachea and distal esophagus results in a gas-filled stomach on a chest x-ray. Infants with EA type A and B will not have stomach distention because there is no fistula from the trachea to the distal esophagus. Infants with TEF may reflux gastric contents through the fistula into the trachea leading to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory distress. Patients with EA type E may have delayed diagnosis if the fistula is small.
