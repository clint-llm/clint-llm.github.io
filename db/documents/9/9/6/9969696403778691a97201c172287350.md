- Existing evidence regarding the management of ZMC fractures is relatively low quality resultingÂ in variation in management patterns; however, attention to form and function remains crucial when evaluating and repairing such fractures.

- Treatment options of ZMC fractures include observation, closed reduction, and ORIF depending on the severity of the fractures.

- Use the least number of incisions and fixation points as possible to achieve a stable reduction and fixation.

- There should be a low threshold for consulting ophthalmology to rule out orbital injury.

- There is no compelling evidence for routine antibiotic use when treating zygomatic fractures.
