Managing hiatal hernias and reflux requires an interprofessional team approach. The team should includeÂ primary care clinicians, radiologists, gastroenterologists, and surgeons. Diagnostic studies are required for both diagnosis and operative planning. This requires endoscopy, pH monitoring, and esophagography, which is a coordinated effort between multiple teams. This ultimately results in more accurate diagnoses, better surgical outcomes, and more patient satisfaction.
