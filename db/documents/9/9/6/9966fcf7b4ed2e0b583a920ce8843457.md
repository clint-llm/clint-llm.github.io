Bilateral anterior cingulotomy is a neurosurgical procedure that can be performed for chronic refractory depression, pain, or obsessive-compulsive disorder. It involves stereotactic ablation of the bilateral anterior cingulate gyri, thus severing the supracallosal fibers of the cingulum.

In the context of the treatment of refractory depression, a better clinical response was observed in patients who had relatively anteriorly placed lesioning of their ACC, in line with neuroimaging studies demonstrating that patients with major depression have anatomical abnormalities compared to the healthy population in the rostral part of the cingulate cortex.

In the context of the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, the target is the dorsal part of the ACC, and better clinical results have been found following lesioning of the superior part of the cingulate cortex here, as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) score.
