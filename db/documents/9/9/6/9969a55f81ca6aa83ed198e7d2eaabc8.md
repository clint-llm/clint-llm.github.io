Vemurafenib is FDA-approved for metastatic and unresectable melanoma with V600 mutation and Erdheim- Chester disease (non-Langerhans histiocytic disorder). Non-FDA-labeled Indications include metastatic and unresecctable melanoma with BRAF V600K and refractory non-small cell lung carcinoma BRAF V600 mutation. This activity provides an overview of the indications, mechanism of action, methods and timing of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring for vemurafenib as chemotherapy for indicated cancers.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of vemurafenib, including the genetic mutations it specifically addresses.
- Identify the most clinically significant adverse events associated with vemurafenib.
- Review the approved and off-label cancers for which vemurafenib is indicated.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team and how it can enhance patient care with vemurafenib to improve patient outcomes for patients in cancer treatment where it has therapeutic value.
