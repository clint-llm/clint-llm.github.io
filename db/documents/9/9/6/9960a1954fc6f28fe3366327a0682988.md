Aortopulmonary windows can induce the early onset of pulmonary overcirculation. Signs of pulmonary overcirculation include increased work of breathing, tachypnea, difficulty gaining weight, and chest retractions. The severity of the signs and symptoms vary as per the fall in the pulmonary vascular resistance. If the AP window is associated with an interrupted arch,Â symptoms usually start around 2 to 3 weeks of life, owing to ductal closure.

The infant may repent in extremis with poor feeding, cold and clammy extremities, poor systemic circulation, reduced urine output, and diminished femoral pulses. On examination, one may find signs of congestive heart failure such as tachypnea, a diaphoretic child with hepatomegaly. Pulses may be bounding due to run off into the lungs. A murmur may rarely be audible. A mid-diastolic rumble may be heard along the apex, indicating volume overload to the left side of the heart.
