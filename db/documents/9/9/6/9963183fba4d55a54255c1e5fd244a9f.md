The presence of the HLA-B*5801 genotype in patients of Korean descent with chronic kidney disease stage 3 or worse, or in patients of Han Chinese or Thai descent irrespective of renal function, is an especially high risk of AHS (hazard ratio of several hundred). American College of Rheumatology recommends screening this population for HLA-B*5801 genotype using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing before initiating allopurinol and, if positive, using an alternative urate-lowering therapy. However, universal HLA-B*5801 allopurinol screening is not recommended, given the significantly lower HLA-B*5801 prevalence and hazard ratio in other populations.
