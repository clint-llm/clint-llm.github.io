Wilson disease is caused by one of the several mutations in ATP7B gene present on chromosome 13 which controls the protein transporter responsible for excreting excess copper into bile and out of the body. The protein transporter is located in the trans-Golgi network of the liver and brain. The major route of copper excretion (95%) is through the liver. This excess copper first accumulates in the liver and then spills into the blood and then to other organ systems.

The excess copper leads to the generation of free radicals that causes oxidation of vital proteins and lipids. Early changes tend to occur in the mitochondria, nuclei, and peroxisomes.
