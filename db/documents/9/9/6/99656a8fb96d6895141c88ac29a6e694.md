Almost 30 to 35% of the strokes in posterior circulation are due to an embolus originating from an LVO in VA, BA, and PCA. An occlusion of BA is often due to an LVO by an embolism from the heart, aorta, or VA (36%), atherosclerosis of BA (35%), dissection (5%) of BA, and occasionally dolichoectasia or vasculopathy or undetermined (24%) causes.

The perfusion pressure drops due to the presence of an embolus in the proximal portion of the basilar artery, causing a reversal of blood flow from bilateral PCAs, and this reflux can prevent an embolus from reaching the distal segment of the BA.
