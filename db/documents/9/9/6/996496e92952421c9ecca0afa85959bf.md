Genetically susceptible patients can have a malignant hyperthermia reaction in response to triggering agents such as halogenated anesthetic gasses and/or succinylcholine and more rarely to stressors such as vigorous exercise and heat exposure.  Nitrous Oxide and Xenon, although they are inhaled anesthetics, are not halogenated and have not been implicated in malignant hyperthermia.
