Before tilt table testing, the patient should stay in the supine position for at least 5 minutes. A long time in the supine position is required if venous catheterization is to be done before the test. The patient should be wrapped to avoid falls and traumatic injuries. Venous catheterization is not mandatory before tilt testing.

Blood pressure and ECG should be monitored. The best method to monitor blood pressure is to use continuous non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, but using a sphygmomanometer is allowed.

The tilt table test should be performed according to the chosen protocol. There are a few protocols that can be used. The best-known in medical practice is the Westminster protocol or the Italian protocol. During the tilt table test, the passive phase is recommended to last 20 to 45 minutes. Later, medication is given (most commonly 0.4 mg nitroglycerine sublingually) to increase the sensitivity of the test, but the provocation reduces the specificity, and the patient should be in an upright position for up to 15 minutes.

The tilt table test should be terminated at syncope or after protocol termination. Some patients have prolonged hypotension without loss of consciousness, and in this case, the termination of tilt testing during the pre-syncopal period may be considered, especially in elderly patients.In the case of a positive result during the tilt table test, the patient should be asked about reproducing symptoms in his or her daily life. The downtime should be shorter than 10 seconds. Lowering the tilt table for a longer period may result in a longer loss of consciousness. The changes in blood pressure and heart rate should be assessed.
