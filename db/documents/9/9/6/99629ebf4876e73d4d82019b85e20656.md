Among the potassium-sparing diuretics, triamterene was the second drug of this class to be FDA approved for use in the US following spironolactone. However, despite these two drugs being within the same class and achieving the same desired result, they have two distinct mechanisms of action. While spironolactone is an aldosterone receptor antagonist operating at the late distal tubule and collecting tubules of the nephron on the apical aspect of these sites, triamterene acts at the same region of the nephrons but specifically at the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC), which are on the luminal side. These channels are transmembrane channels that operate to increase sodium uptake in exchange for secreting potassium.

After the ENaC actively reabsorbs the sodium from the lumen of the nephron into the principal cells of the collecting tubule, the sodium is then transported out of the cell into the interstitium via a sodium-potassium exchange pump.
