TURP is typically an elective procedure used to treat prostatic enlargement resulting in symptomatic bladder outlet obstruction. Because of this, appropriate indications and discussion of the complications associated with the procedure require an integrated interprofessional team to communicate effectively and initiate treatment plans so the patient and family have appropriate expectations. This approach will ensure that patients are adequately prepared for their procedure and what to expect. Patients who are better informed are more invested in their decision and are happier with their outcomes. The procedure is elective and irreversible, so some extra review and discussion with the patient and family are reasonable.

Collaboration, shared decision-making, and communication are critical elements for a good outcome. The interprofessional care provided to the patient must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to planning and evaluating all joint activities. The earlier the signs and symptoms of a complication are identified, the better the prognosis and outcome of the procedure. [Level 4]
