Aseptic meningitis is a term used to define inflammation of the brain linings, called meninges, due to various etiologies with negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bacterial cultures. Many studies and books determine it by showing CSF pleocytosis of more than five cells/mm3.

Viruses are the most common etiology for aseptic meningitis, but other causes can be divided into two main categories: infectious and non-infectious.
