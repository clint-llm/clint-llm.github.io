There are several risk factors for acute angle-closure glaucoma, including age, gender, race, and family history.

- Age: The average age at presentation is 60, and prevalence increases thereafter. This is felt to be due to the increasing size of the lens with age.

- Gender: There is a 4 to 1 ratio of the incidence of angle-closure glaucoma in women versus men.

- Race: Angle-closure glaucoma is more common in Southeast Asians, Chinese, and Eskimos. It is uncommon in black populations. In whites, acute angle-closure glaucoma accounts for 6% of all glaucoma diagnoses.

- Family history: Ocular anatomic features are inherited.
