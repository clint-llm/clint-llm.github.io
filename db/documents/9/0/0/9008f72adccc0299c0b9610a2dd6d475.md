The equipment for esophageal reconstructionÂ depends on the type of esophagectomy, operative technique, and the choice of the conduit. Operating room equipment should be capable of manipulating abdominal and thoracic organs if the operation is done in an open fashion. These include retractors, staplers, and absorbable and nonabsorbable suture. If the esophagectomy is done laparoscopically or robotically, then the appropriate laparoscopic equipment, including ports, needle drivers, staplers, graspers, and drains, should be available. Finally, if free flaps are used for esophageal reconstruction, microscopes should be available in the operating room.
