The equipment required should be gathered and laid out methodically so that each item is readily available and removed from its packaging. Consent should be obtained for the local anesthetic block and any subsequent procedure. The patient’s weight should be established or estimated in kilograms.

Your local anesthetic agent of choice should be selected, expiry checked, and the maximum dose calculated for your patient: based on their weight, the anesthetic agent, and the concentration available. Dosing should be based upon your departmental local anesthetic policy, but if no such policy exists, you should utilize standard dosing regimens outlined here.

**Drug Concentration mg/mL (Maximum Dose [mg/kg)])**

- Lidocaine 1% 10 mg/mL (3 mg/kg)

- Lidocaine 2% 20 mg/mL (3 mg/kg)

- Levobupivacaine 0.25%: 2.5 mg/mL (2 mg/kg)

- Levobupivacaine 0.5%: 5 mg/mL (2 mg/kg)

It is important to calculate the maximum safe dose accurately. This cannot be overstated, and if the healthcare professional is unfamiliar with this process, they should not perform the local anesthetic block.

The patient should be positioned supine in a comfortable position with his genitalia exposed. The area should be cleaned of any gross contamination or debris. The skin prep should be applied generously to cover the suprapubic region, penis, and scrotum. Sterile disposable drapes should be applied to the area to maintain sterility.
