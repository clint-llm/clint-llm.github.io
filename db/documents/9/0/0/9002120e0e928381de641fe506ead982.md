There are several circumstances in which fat grafting may not be the ideal rejuvenation method and could potentially be unsafe, particularly if a general anesthetic is to be employed. Autologous fat grafting may be contraindicated when there is a high likelihood of instability in the fat's volume, such as in cases of planned weight loss or ongoing weight gain, or if the patient has a prior history of complete or subtotal resorption of prior grafted fat. Patients undergoing fat injection for breast reconstruction or recontouring should also be aware that injected fat may form nodules or calcifications, which may subsequently appear suspicious for malignancy on future imaging.

Patients with local, regional, or systemic conditions that may affect blood flow or wound healing are also at risk of developing complications or having suboptimal outcomes. Examples include histories of extensive burn scarring, radiation therapy, keloid scarring, coagulopathies, the need for immunosuppressive medications, and other metabolic or chronic diseases.
