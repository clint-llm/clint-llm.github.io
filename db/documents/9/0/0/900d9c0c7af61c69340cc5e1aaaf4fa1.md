Biologic response modifiers (BRMs), also known as immunomodulators or cytokine inhibitors, are naturally occurring substances in our body that can also be manufactured in the laboratory. Autoimmune diseases incur a substantial economic burden to the patients and society.Â BRMs target the disease-causing mechanism and have now become revolutionary in the treatment of many autoimmune phenomena. Unsatisfactory response or evidence of disease progression despite treatment with conventional therapy mandates the use of BRM alone or in combination with traditional treatment.

Knowing the fact that TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-17, IL-1 are vital mediators of graft versus host disease,

TNF inhibitors, e.g., infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab, and golimumab has been FDA approved for use in RA, ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn disease (CD), AS, JIA, plaque psoriasis and, psoriatic arthritis. Adalimumab also has approval for hidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis. Non-FDA-approved indications include pyoderma gangrenosum, pustular psoriasis, and GVHD(etanercept). Interleukin-1 inhibitor, e.g., anakinra, is FDA approved for RA and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease. IL-2 inhibitor, e.g., aldesleukin, is used in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Tocilizumab is an interleukin-6 inhibitor used in giant cell arteritis, JIA, and RA. Secukinumab that targets interleukin-17 is FDA approved for psoriasis (plaque and arthritis), and AS. Ustekinumab blocks interleukin 12/23 and has been FDA-approved for plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and CD. Abatacept (T-cell co-stimulation blocker) has approval for use in RA, JIA, and Psoriatic arthritis. Rituximab is FDA approved for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, RA, granulomatous polyangiitis, and pemphigus vulgaris. Off label uses include Burkitt lymphoma, CNS lymphoma, GVHD, lupus nephritis, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Tofacitinib is Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors indicated for psoriatic arthritis, RA, and UC.
