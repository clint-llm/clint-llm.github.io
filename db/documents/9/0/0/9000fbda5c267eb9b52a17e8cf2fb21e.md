Complications from electrical injuries are similar to those of other thermal burns, such as infection (which can progress to sepsis), compartment syndrome, and rhabdomyolysis (due to extensive muscle damage from internal burns).  Additionally, one may have associated injuries from being thrown from the electrical source or from falling from a height (roof, bucket truck, ladder) due to the electrical shock, and these injuries  (long bone fractures, spinal fractures, lacerations, pneumothorax, etc.) should be assessed and treated appropriately.

Cardiac complications can occur. One can have an arrhythmia, possibly even a fatal arrhythmia, at the time of the injury. Anyone who experiences an arrhythmia or any chest pain or other typical cardiac-related symptoms is also at risk of arrhythmia in the 24 to 48 hours following the injury. Thus these patients should be kept on a cardiac monitor at all times.  Any high voltage injury should have continuous cardiac monitoring for a minimum of 8 hours

A special consideration is pediatric electrical injuries that occur as the result of a child putting a cord in the mouth and biting down, causing burn injury to the corners of the mouth.  These patients can be sent home if there are no other associated injuries, however, the complication in this case to warn parents about is delayed bleeding from the labial artery, which can occur about 7 days following the date of injury.

Due to the complicated nature of injury patterns with electrical injuries, anything more than a minor electrical injury should have a qualified trauma and burn center as a final disposition.
