Since it is very rare, the majority of patients who present with painful ophthalmoplegia will not have Tolosa Hunt syndrome. Painful ophthalmoplegia is essentially a result of a mass effect produced in the cavernous sinus which can be caused by many disease processes. Tolosa Hunt syndromeÂ is ultimately a diagnosis of exclusion, and thus, clinicians should be aware of the differential diagnoses. Various causes of painful ophthalmoplegia include the following:

**Trauma**

**Vascular**

- Intracavernous carotid artery aneurysm

- Posterior cerebral artery aneurysm

Spirochetal

- Treponema pallidum

Mycobacterial

- Mycobacterium tuberculosis

Others

- Sarcoidosis

- Wegener's granulomatosis

- Eosinophilic granuloma
