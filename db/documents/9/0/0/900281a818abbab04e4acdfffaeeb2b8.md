Using hepatic Doppler ultrasound as part of the abdominal ultrasound will increase the operator's experience in refining the probe movement and better visualizing the hepatic vessels. The time consumed for both examinations (abdominal ultrasound and hepatic doppler) will not increase much.

- The patient could be asked to hold his breath to improve visualization.

- The red color on the screen is usually set up in most devices as the direction of flow towards the probe, while the blue indicates the direction of blood flow away from the probe.

- The portal vein has a thickened fibrous tissue wall that will be reflected as drawing an echogenic line around the vessel, while hepatic vein walls are thin and non-visualized.

- Portal vein diameter can range from 7 to 15 mm.

- The patient is best positioned in the left lateral or supine position. Scanning starts in the right subcostal area, which allows for visualization of the portal vein. The confluence of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins is visualized when moving left towards the midline.

- Then scanning in the substernal position, the operator will view the IVC (which should be compressible) and aorta at the midline while the probe faces posteriorly (either longitudinally or transversely).

- Hepatic veins can be best viewed from the right intercostal position where the probe is facing medially, and this position is best to view the drainage of the three hepatic veins into the IVC. The hepatic veins could also be viewed from the subcostal position directing the probe posteriorly. Left and middle hepatic veins are best visualized from the substernal position.

**Limitations**

- Obesity can cause limitations in the visualization of vessel flow and velocity.

- Eating may cause an increase in the portal pressure and widen the diameter of the vessel. Ingested contents and resultant gaseous distension may hinder the visualization of vessels. Therefore, fasting for at least 4 to 6 hours before the Doppler examination is recommended.

- Changes in the liver hemodynamics may be falsely diagnosed if the gain and frequency are not well adjusted in the device.

- The low frequency may falsely diagnose portal vein thrombosis.

- Patients who cannot hold their breath will create some difficulty for the operator to visualize the vessels, but this could be overcome by the timing of inhalation and moving the probe synchronously.
