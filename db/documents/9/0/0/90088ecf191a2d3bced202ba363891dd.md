There is no universal consensus concerning the efficacy of TENS in managing pain. However, there are indeed a number of studies which have found a positive impact on patients with an overall low risk of complications/side effects when using TENS appropriately and according to manufacturer instructions. As such, combining TENS with pharmacotherapy remains a worthwhile endeavor for interested patients willing to try the modality. More research needs to take place to arrive at a definitive position on the place of  TENS in pain management. One characteristic that has universal agreement, however, is that if TENS does provide results, those are short-term in nature and rapid in onset and offset. TENS is not a cure for pain conditions or syndromes.

The positive impact in which TENS has on an individual might diminish over time. Habituation might even lead to a worsening of pain. Recommendations are that patients take breaks from treatment and vary their placement of electrode pads over time.
