Atelectasis is one of three types: compressive,  due to lung tissue compression,  resorptive, caused by absorption of alveolar air, or related to an impairment of pulmonary surfactant production or function.

There are four types of nonobstructive atelectasis: compression, adhesive, cicatrization, relaxation, and replacement atelectasis.  Compression atelectasis happens when there is increased pressure exerted on the lung which causes a  transmural pressure difference between the extra and intra-alveolar space that results in alveolar collapse. During anesthesia, diaphragmatic relaxation occurs inhibiting the natural lowering of the diaphragm that occurs during spontaneous breathing.     Lying in the supine position further displaces the diaphragm toward the head resulting in additional inhibition of gas exchange due to the further impairment of the transmural pressure gradient resulting in an increased risk of atelectasis.     Adhesive atelectasis occurs due to either a surfactant deficiency or dysfunction.  This type is commonly seen in patients with  Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) or among premature infants with Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS). Surfactant prevents alveolar collapse by decreasing alveolar surface tension.  Alterations to surfactant production and function tend to increase the surface tension within the alveoli lead creating instability resulting in collapse.  Cicatrization atelectasis results in the contraction of the lung tissue to the development of parenchymal scar tissue.  Cicatrization atelectasis is often seen in tuberculosis, fibrosis, and other chronic destructive lung diseases. Relaxation atelectasis occurs when there is a loss of contact between the parietal and visceral tissue.  This happens with pneumothoraces and pleural effusions. Replacement atelectasis occurs when a tumor replaces the alveoli of an entire lobe of the lung, seen with bronchioalveolar carcinoma, resulting in the complete collapse of the lung.

In obstructive atelectasis, the air in the alveoli is absorbed distal to the point of obstruction.  This is why it is referred to as resorptive atelectasis.  In this instance, there is a mismatch between ventilation due to complete or partial obstruction of the alveoli and the uninterrupted perfusion of the alveoli.   The presence of the ongoing ventilation-perfusion mismatch due to the obstruction results in the absorption of the gas in the alveoli precipitating the collapse.  Obstructive atelectasis may be caused by intrathoracic tumors, mucous plugs, and foreign bodies. Children are at risk for resorption atelectasis due to aspiration foreign bodies because there are less developed collateral pathways for ventilation.

Adults with COPD are less likely to develop resorptive atelectasis related to an obstructive lesion due to better-developed collateral ventilation secondary to airway destruction. General anesthesia contributes to the development of absorptive atelectasis through the use of high inspiratory concentrations of oxygen ( FiO2).  The risk for atelectasis due to the use of high FIO2 during anesthesia is related to the rates at which oxygen and nitrogen are absorbed into the bloodstream.   Oxygen is rapidly absorbed, whereas nitrogen is not.  Increasing the amount of oxygen inspired decreases the amount of nitrogen available to hold the alveoli open.

Postoperative atelectasis is normally seen within typically 72 hours of surgery using general anesthesia. Atelectasis is a known complication of general anesthesia.

Rounded atelectasis is rare.  It is most often associated with asbestosis.  It occurs because the lung tissue folds to the pleura.

Any of these mechanisms of atelectasis may contribute to perioperative atelectasis.  Most frequently seen are the absorptive and compression variety.

Middle lobe syndrome is the result of either an extraluminal or intraluminal obstruction of the bronchi which results in either a recurrent or fixed atelectasis of the lingula and right middle lobe of the lung. Inflammation, alterations in bronchial anatomy, and the presence of collateral ventilation are nonobstructive causes.   Middle lobe syndrome is treated via bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage.  Bronchiectasis may result from chronic atelectasis. Middle lobe syndrome has been associated with Sjorgen syndrome and treatment with steroids has shown promise.
