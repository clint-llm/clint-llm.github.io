Collaboration and communication between members of the healthcare team are essential to providing safe and effective PSV. [Level 5] Every team member involved in the patientâ€™s care must be aware when PSV mode initiates for any indication. At least one team member should directly observe the patient for the first 5 to 10 minutes of PSV. Only the respiratory therapist should be allowed to make the ventilator changes, and they should document these in the logbook. Also, they should inform the nurse regarding the change. Both the respiratory therapist and the nursing staff should inform the treating physician of any significant changes or concerns that may arise.

This careful attention and open communication will allow the interprofessional healthcare team to avoid or quickly identify complications of PSV and initiate a ventilatory mode that meets the goals of ventilation, oxygenation, and patient comfort. Multiple randomized controlled trials show efficacy in protocol-based strategies to ensure communication provides safe PSV and SBT.
