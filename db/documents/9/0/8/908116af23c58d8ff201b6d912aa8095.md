Patient selection is the key step in preparation, as discussed above. Phrenic nerve conduction velocities should be done to assess the viability of the phrenic nerve. Preoperative workup should be done in accordance with the instituteâ€™s protocol. These patients should have a tracheostomy prior to the surgery. DP can cause sudden upper airway closure due to dyssynchronous muscle contractions of the diaphragm and upper airway. Tracheostomy acts as emergency access to the airway in case of such an event. A careful anesthesia plan needs to be in place prior to surgery. The use of paralytic agents must be avoided intraoperatively, as the phrenic nerve is stimulated to assess for diaphragmatic muscle contraction.
