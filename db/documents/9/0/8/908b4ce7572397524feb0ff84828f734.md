Child development is universal. The surveillance and management of it are intricate and challenging.

Behavioral issues and developmental issues in children are common and can present in very diverse ways. The management of these conditions requires interprofessional coordination and communication between the parent or the caregiver, the primary care physician, and the school system. Monitoring the well-being of a child is a collaborative effort of each well-care visit, but also the parents, which are the most reliable and first-handÂ witnesses. Once a child enters school, then the teachers are responsible for identifying issues as well.

It is a societal responsibility to raise physically and mentally healthy children to have successful adults. To improve this, there should be strong ties between the entities that take part in a child's life.
