The diagnosis should be based on the following components:

- History (onset, location, intensity, duration, quality, aggravating factors)

- Clinical and sensory examination (to map the sensory abnormality and to rule out the other causes of pain)

- Imaging: CT/MRI brain without contrast (to confirm the history of stroke and the location and volume of lesions, if present)

Following areÂ diagnostic criteria for central post-stroke pain is suggested by Dr. Henriette Klit, Dr. Nanna B. Finnerup and, Dr. Troels S. Jensen.

**Mandatory Criteria
**

- Pain in an area of the body corresponding to the lesion of the central nervous system

- History suggestive of a stroke and onset of pain at or after stroke onset

- Confirmation of a central nervous system lesion through imaging or negative or positive sensory signs confined to the area of the body corresponding to the lesion

- Other causes of pain, such as nociceptive or peripheral neuropathic pain, are excluded or considered highly unlikely

**Supportive Criteria
**

- No primary relation to movement, inflammation, or other local tissue damage

- Descriptors such as burning, painful cold, electric shocks, aching, pressing, stinging, and pins and needles, although all pain descriptors can apply

- Allodynia or dysaesthesia to touch or cold
