The teres minor is supplied by the subscapular artery and one of its branches, the circumflex scapular artery, as well as the posterior circumflex humeral artery. The subscapular artery and the posterior circumflex humeral artery arise from the third, most distal portion of the axillary artery.

The subscapular artery is the largest branch off of the axillary artery. It travels caudally before dividing into two arteries: the circumflex scapular and the thoracodorsal. The circumflex scapular artery travels around the lateral border of the scapula between the subscapularis and teres minor. It moves cranially through the triangular space, created by the teres minor superiorly, teres major inferiorly, and long head of the triceps brachii laterally, into the infraspinatus fossa where it joins the scapular anastomosis. Along its route, the circumflex scapular artery supplies the teres minor.

The posterior humeral circumflex artery is a more distal branch off of the third portion of the axillary artery. It travels posteriorly with the axillary nerve through the quadrangular space, bounded by the teres minor superiorly, teres major inferiorly, the surgical neck of the humerus laterally, and the long head of the triceps brachii medially. Then the artery moves anteriorly around the surgical neck of the humerus to supply the shoulder joint. Along its route, the posterior humeral circumflex artery supplies the teres minor.
