The management and treatment of women with gestational diabetes is an emerging challenge for health care providers and teams. Thus, today, gestational diabetes requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results and prevent further complications. Efforts and strategies are necessary to recognize them effectively. The development of prevention strategies would facilitate the treatment of gestational diabetes and would help improve health outcomes. Women with gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes over 10 to 20 years after pregnancy.

Many pregnant women who develop diabetes are not diagnosed until very late, which significantly increases the morbidity of the disease.

Many healthcare institutions are now operating pharmacy or nurse practitioner diabetic clinics that offer diabetic education to pregnant females. These clinics regularly monitor blood glucose and refer patients to an endocrinologist. This practice reduces the burden of the obstetrician, lowers healthcare costs, and helps the delivery of optimal care for those who need it.

All members of the interprofessional healthcare team need to collaborate and work together to manage gestational diabetes. Nursing stands at the forefront of patient encounters to determine adherence to therapeutic choices, and monitor for therapy efficacy as well as being alert for potential adverse effects, which they will communicate to other team members. Pharmacists need to perform medication reconciliation, verify the dosing of insulin or other antihyperglycemic drugs, and assist with patient counseling about medication and lifestyle adherence. In this cooperative paradigm, the interprofessional team can guide outcomes most successfully. [Level 5]
