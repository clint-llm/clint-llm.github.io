- Both molecular genetic testing of the fetus and prenatal treatment of mothers with dexamethasone are available.

- Dexamethasone must be given before the seventh to eighth week of gestation to suppress the fetal pituitary-adrenal axis before virilization occurs.

- In a patient with ambiguous genitalia, the diagnosis is not difficult; however, in affected males with no symptoms, newborn screening may be lifesaving. Without it, the diagnosis can be missed until the patient is in an acute adrenal crisis.

- The objective of the treatment of CAH is to prevent adrenal crisis and virilization and to achieve normal growth, pubertal development, sexual function, and fertility. Both male and female patients are fertile but have reduced fertility rates. This consequence is due to biological, psychological, social, and sexual factors.

- The prevalence of metabolic abnormalities such as obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and the polycystic ovarian syndrome has been reported to be high due to the diseases themselves or glucocorticoid treatment.
