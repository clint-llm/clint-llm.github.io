The normal size of a tongue is variable and differs with increasing age with the greatest growth occurring in the first 8 years since birth and attaining full growth at 18 years of age.

True and relative macroglossia may be further subdivided into congenital and acquired disorders. In true macroglossia, there is an apparent enlargement of the tongue due to an underlying disease or condition, and relevant histopathological findings can be noted. In relative macroglossia, the tongue appears larger than compared to other structures in the oral cavity. Prominent examples include Down syndrome, where tongue appears enlarged due to hypotonia and Pierre Robin syndrome due to micrognathia.
