A critical issue emerging regarding the use of immunomodulating drugs like glatiramer is the generation of antibodies to the drugs themselves. While some studies have had conflicting results, researchers conducted a sera analysis study consisting of 217 patients who participated in the treatment and placebo arms of several glatiramer acetate trials. The subjects were tested for antibodies to glatiramer acetate via the ELISA method. IgG antibodies, mainly IgG1, were found in the patients who received active treatment.Â The titers increased to a peak concentration within three months of initiating treatment but then slowly tapered off. The patients with higher antibody titers seem to be more likely to be relapse-free.
