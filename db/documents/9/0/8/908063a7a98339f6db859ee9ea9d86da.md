Chondrosarcomas are malignant cartilaginous neoplasms with diverse morphological features and clinical behavior. They account for about 20 percent of all primary malignant tumors of the bone and usually arise in the pelvis or long bones. Primary or conventional chondrosarcoma arises in preexisting normal bone and is distinguished from the rarer secondary tumors, which occur within a preexisting enchondroma or osteochondroma. This activity reviews chondrosarcomas and the role of the interprofessional team in recognition and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the subtypes of chondrosarcomas. 
- Describe the epidemiology of chondrosarcomas. 
- Review the common presenting features of chondrosarcomas. 
- Explain the need to optimize coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care to patients affected by chondrosarcomas.
