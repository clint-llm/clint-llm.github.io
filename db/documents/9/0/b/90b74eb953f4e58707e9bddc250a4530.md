To achieve the goal of bidirectional feedback and a constant focus on translating knowledge, additional capacity building needs to occur, particularly in the area of faculty development. The field of translational science is gaining recognition as more people become aware of its importance. Translational scientists need to share definitions, ideas, and reasons why and how translational research will improve our healthcare systems and population health. Translational scientists are expected to have personality characteristics that allow them to facilitate cross-disciplinary work within a complex healthcare system. These characteristics include being a team player, a boundary crosser, a process innovator, a skilled communicator, a systems thinker, a domain expert, and a rigorous researcher.

Each of these skills takes time and effort to learn and become proficient. Within the simulation community, these ideas and traits can be taught through formal education, but also through more informal methods such as webinars, conference workshops, discussions across community members, and self-paced online learning. Ideally, building a translational research team that includes individuals who bring together a variety of these skills may also facilitate the process of knowledge translation.
