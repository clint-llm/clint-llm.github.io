Botulinum toxin injection can lead to a wide range of complications such as ptosis, diplopia, photophobia, ecchymosis, epiphora, and blurred vision amongst others. The likelihood of complications of botulinum toxin injection reduces withÂ repeated injection episodes.

The most frequently reported side effect is ptosis. Ptosis following botulinum toxin injection may occur due to the migration of the botulinum toxin into the levator palpebrae superioris muscle leading to ptosis.

As many patients with blepharospasm have a variable degree of apraxia of eyelid opening, most patients need injections into the pretarsal orbicularis oculi muscle. We therefore always remind patients to apply lubricating ointment into the eyes for the first two to three weeks after injections and also to increase the use of topical lubrication to the eyes for that period. Botulinum toxin injection has been shown to cause reduced lacrimal drainage as a result of a lower blink rate and laxity of the lower eyelid due to paralysis of the lacrimal portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle.
