Like many other gastrointestinal malignancies, the treatment ofÂ gastrointestinal stromal tumors is largely dependent on the extent of the disease. The management of GISTs less than 2 cm remains a somewhat unsettled topic, but given the decreased malignant potential of these tumors, it may be possible to monitor them with endoscopic ultrasound.

For localized, resectable disease greater than 2 cm, surgical resection remains the cornerstone of treatment. For patients with locally advanced disease, where it is thought that complete surgical resection is not attainable, or may lead to mutilation or loss of function, preoperative imatinib can be used to help reduce tumor burden before resection. For patients with high-risk diseases, it is recommended that adjuvant therapy be given, with 3 years of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, preferentially imatinib.

In cases of unresectable or metastatic disease, it is recommended to treat patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The first line tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of GIST is imatinib, which is recommended at 400 mg daily. For patients with imatinib-resistant mutations, such as KIT 9 mutations, it is reasonable to start with 800 mg of imatinib daily. Patients who fail imatinib therapy with 400 mg can be increased to the 800 mg dose or transitioned to the second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib. The third line of medical therapy for GISTs is regorafenib. Patients should be monitored for response to medical therapy, most commonly with a CT scan.
