Glaucoma may develop and cause visual field loss without any symptoms. For this reason, early detection is vital to the prevention of loss of vision. Patients with narrow or occludable angles should have regular exams with gonioscopy and intraocular pressure measurement to monitor for the development of angle closure. In addition, they should be educated regarding the symptoms of acute angle-closure.

A prophylactic laser peripheral iridotomy may reduce the risk of development of acute angle-closure for high-risk populations but does not eliminate the risk of acute angle-closure.
