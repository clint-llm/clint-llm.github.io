**Conservative Management**

Conservative treatment is non-operative.

- Hand therapy for passive stretching combined with corrective splinting may benefit even the chronic conditions. This combination of treatment may increase mobility and flexibility at both the DIP and the PIP joints.

- Extension block splints may help correct the hyperextension at the PIP joint.

- Progressive extension splinting can help improve the DIP flexion deformity.

- Although stretching and splinting may increase mobility, severe or long-standing deformities will not likely achieve true correction without surgery.

**Operative Management**

- An intact passive motion at the PIP joint is present for patients with early stages of swan neck deformity. In these cases, a volar restraint must be developed during surgery to recreate the action of the volar plate. FDS tenodesis is a common checkrein to help prevent hyperextension. However, FDS tenodesis does not correct DIP joint mallet deformity if lateral band laxity has already formed. Conjoint lateral band tenodesis can improve both deformities if the anatomy is intact.

- PIP joint hyperextension can be correctedÂ by lengthening the central slip. PIP joint hyperextension can also be corrected from the volar side of the joint by tethering the joint in flexion using an FDS tenodesis or by performing a dermodesis (removing an ellipse of skin on the volar aspect of the joint). If intrinsic tightness is also evident, the release of the intrinsic muscle contributing to the central slip can also be performed.

- In the later stages, if PIP arthrosis is evident, joint fusion or replacement may be indicated. These procedures are additional to the soft tissue procedures that will still be necessary.

- If the MCP joints are also subluxing from severe degenerative arthritis, these joints may also be addressed in the form of an arthroplasty.
