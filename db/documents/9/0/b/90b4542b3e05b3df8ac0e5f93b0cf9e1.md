While the anesthesia provider is primarily responsible for performing NTI, a nurse can help to pass instruments (such as the Magill forceps), apply pressure to the cricoid cartilage, or remove the endotracheal tube's stylet should be present. In prophylactic nasotracheal intubation to prevent airway compromise, such as evolving angioedema, having a second anesthesiologist present can be very helpful. An otolaryngologist may alsoÂ assist by passing a fiberoptic scope through the nose or even providing a surgical airway should attempts at NTI fail while the patient is in extremis.
