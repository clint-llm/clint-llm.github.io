Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated nephropathy is an aggressive condition that requires prompt diagnosis to prevent permanent damage to renal function. While the advent of combined antiretroviral therapy and early diagnosis of HIV has made this condition rare, it is important to understand the repercussions it could have, especially in those with poor access to healthcare. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of HIV-associated nephropathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of HIV-associated nephropathy.
- Describe the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of HIV-associated nephropathy.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for HIV-associated nephropathy.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of HIV-associated nephropathy treatment and improve outcomes.
