Taking a thorough, detailed history is an essential part of AR evaluation, so questions should focus on the types of symptoms, the time, duration, and frequency of symptoms, suspected exposures, and exacerbating factors.

On physical examination, clinicians may notice mouth breathing, frequent sniffling and/or throat clearing, transverse supra-tip nasal crease,Â and dark circles under the eyes (allergic shiners). Otoscopic examination of the nose typically reveals swelling of the nasal mucosa and thin, clear secretions. Whenever possible, an internal endoscopic examination of the nasal cavity should be conducted to assess nasal polyps and structural abnormalities. Pneumatic otoscopy can be used to assess for eustachian tube dysfunction, which can be a common finding in patients with allergic rhinitis. Palpation of sinuses may elicit tenderness in patients with chronic symptoms. These patients should also undergo careful examination for signs of asthma or dermatitis.
