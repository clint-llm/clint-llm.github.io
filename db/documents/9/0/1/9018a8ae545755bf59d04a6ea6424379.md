Linitis plastica (LP) term was first introduced to the medical field in 1779 byÂ Lieudaut to describe a scirrhous and rigid type of gastric tissue with a deadly outcome.

LP, a phenotype of gastric carcinoma, is interchangeably but not accurately termed Borrmann type 4, which occurs in the Asian population.
