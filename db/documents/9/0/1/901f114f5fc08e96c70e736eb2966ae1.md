Montelukast and zafirlukast are cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists indicated to prevent and treat chronic asthma. Leukotrienes are eicosanoid inflammatory mediators derived from arachidonic acid. Neither montelukast nor zafirlukast has a role as rescue medication during an acute asthmatic attack. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and monitoring pertinent for interprofessional team members in managing patients with asthma and related conditions with leukotriene receptor antagonists.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the mechanism of action of leukotriene receptor antagonists.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of leukotriene receptor antagonists.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for patients using leukotriene receptor antagonists.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of asthma with leukotriene receptor antagonists and improve outcomes.
