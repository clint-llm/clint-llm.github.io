The axillary artery typically divides into three parts by the pectoralis minor muscle. The third part, which is where the anterior humeral circumflex artery originates, lies distal to the lower border of the pectoralis minor muscle. The three branches of this third part are the subscapular trunk, the anterior humeral circumflex artery, and the posterior humeral circumflex artery. The anterior humeral circumflex artery is the smallest one.

It is known that the anterior humeral circumflex artery has numerous branches and an extensive anastomotic network, especially with the posterior humeral circumflex artery, in the proximal humerus. It gives off two main branches: the anterolateral ascending branch and the arcuate artery, which is the major blood supply to the greater tuberosity.

The anterior humeral circumflex artery was traditionally thought to be the primary blood supply of the humerus, but recent studies suggest that the main blood supply is the posterior humeral circumflex artery. This finding may explain the relatively low rate of osteonecrosis in displaced fractures of the proximal humerus.
