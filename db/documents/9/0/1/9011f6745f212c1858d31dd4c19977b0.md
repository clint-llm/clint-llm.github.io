Local anesthesia is essential for pain management in dentistry. Dental treatments can be associated with mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimuli, eliciting a painful response. Such dental treatments may include oral surgery, periodontal, endodontic, prosthetic, and restorative treatments. Local anesthesia is used to provide temporary sensory loss to allow for the delivery of dental treatment.
