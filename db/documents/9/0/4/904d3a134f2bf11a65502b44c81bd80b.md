Anisocoria is a clinical sign, and patients may not be able to identify this. However, patients should be educated that if they developÂ a sudden severe headache, blood in sputum, or a sudden blurring of vision with an associated anisocoria, they should be seen by a medical specialist as soon as possible. These signs could indicate a serious medical issue and need to be evaluated.
