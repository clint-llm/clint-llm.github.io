Immediate medical management of patients with pituitary apoplexy includes a careful assessment of fluids and electrolyte balance,Â ensure hemodynamic stability, and replacement with corticosteroids.

Management of the mass is controversial as some advocate early transsphenoidal surgical decompression in all patients, whereas others adopt a conservative approach for those patients without visual acuity or field defects and with normal consciousness. Emergency surgery should be reserved for patients with progressive deterioration of consciousness, hypothalamic involvement, and progressive visual worsening. It has been demonstrated that a significant postoperative clinical improvement is a consequence of a surgical procedure performed as soon as possible.

Pediatric pituitary tumor apoplexy has a more aggressive natural history in comparison to adults, and early surgery may reduce its occurrence and improve outcomes.
