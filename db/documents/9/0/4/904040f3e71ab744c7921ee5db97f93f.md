Communication and coordination between the interprofessional team are required to optimize gastric resection outcomes as well as patient morbidity and mortality. Nursing staff must communicate effectively during handoff to report a history of gastric resection and associated comorbidities. Specialized nurses should be available to provide support and education. Understanding complications such as bowel obstruction, anastomotic leak, post-operative bleeding, duodenal stump blowout, delayed gastric emptying, and malnutrition as well as identifying patients complaining of acute abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting can prompt nurses to call surgical services sooner.
