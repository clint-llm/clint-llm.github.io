Thallium is structurally similar to potassium and is treated as such at the cellular level. The following five major toxicologic effects are seen with thallium toxicity:

- Tissues with high potassium concentrations also accumulate large concentrations of thallium. This causes early stimulation, followed by inhibition of potassium-dependent processes. Inhibiting pyruvate kinase and succinate dehydrogenase leads to disruption of the Kreb’s cycle and glucose metabolism, with a result of decreased ATP production, swelling, and vacuolization due to impairment of the sodium-potassium ATPase.

- Riboflavin sequestration due to thallium and inhibition of flavin adenine dinucleotide disrupts the electron transport chain and decreases ATP production.

- Thallium’s high ability for disulfide bonds disrupts cysteine residue cross-linking, causing a reduction in keratin formation.

- Ribosomes are damaged by thallium’s effects on protein synthesis, especially the 60S ribosome.

- Lastly, thallium causes degeneration of myelin in the central and peripheral nervous systems, though the mechanism remains unknown.
