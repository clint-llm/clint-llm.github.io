When performed by a skilled physician, epidural steroid injections are a safe and integral treatment of back and leg or neck and arm pain caused by multiple conditions. It is imperative to note that epidural steroid injections are not necessarily designed to cure back or neck pain, instead, they are intended to provide temporary relief so that the patient may return to normal activities and/or continue their physical therapy regimen. Pain relief from epidural steroid injections may vary from one week to one year, and patients may require either a single or a series of injections for maximum relief.
