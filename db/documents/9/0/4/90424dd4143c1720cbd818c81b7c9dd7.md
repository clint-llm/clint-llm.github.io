Monitoring drug frequency and dosing is essential in tobramycin administration to decrease the chances of adverse effects. Researchers have observed that a longer dosing interval may reduce the risk of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.

The drug is excreted mainly by the kidneys, so it is essential to monitor renal function.

Serum sodium, calcium, and magnesium should be monitored while on treatment. Peak and trough tobramycin serum levels should be monitored periodically, usually after the first 2 to 3 doses. The dosage can be adjusted if needed and monitored at every 3- to 4-day intervals during therapy. Prolonged serum concentrations higher than 12 mcg/mL should be avoided. Rising trough concentrations above 2 mcg/mL might indicate tissue accumulation. Monitor serum levels closely in patients with advanced age and known renal impairment. Therapeutic drug monitoring is essential in patients receiving aminoglycosides, including tobramycin.
