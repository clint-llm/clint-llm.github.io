Mild to Moderate Disease: Less severely affected infants typically present with the self-limited hemolytic disease, which is manifested as hyperbilirubinemia within the first 24 hours of life.

Hydrops Fetalis: Infants with severe, life-threatening anemia (e.g., hydrops fetalis) present with skin edema, pleural or pericardial effusion, or ascites. Infants with RhD and some minor blood group incompatibilities, such as Kell, are at risk for hydrops fetalis, especially pregnancies without antenatal care.
