Patients must be educated on the triggers of their seizure activity, the side effects of medication, and the disease's prognosis. Parents/guardians of minors, along with the patient, should be educated. Adult patients deemed independent should be encouraged to include and educate spouses, significant others, family members, or trusted persons to ensure their safety.

Patients should be evaluated on an individual basis for safety and risk involved with driving, swimming, recreational sports, and hazardous work environments.Â Uncontrolled seizures require extra safety precautions, including deterrence from driving, swimming, performing strenuous, or extreme sports activities.

Patients with epilepsy require regular follow-ups appointments and long-term monitoring to observe medication efficacy, potential side effects, and the development of comorbid conditions.
