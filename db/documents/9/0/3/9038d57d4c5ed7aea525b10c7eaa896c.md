The differential diagnosis of Kikuchi disease includes infectious lymphadenitis, autoimmune causes such as systemic lupus erythematosus, and malignancy, particularly lymphoma

Particularly in the pediatric populations, sources of benign lymphadenopathy (such as pharyngitis, otitis media, upper respiratory infection) should be considered

Autoimmune differentials include SLE, sarcoidosis, Kawasaki disease; SLE is highest on the differential. On histology, findings of SLE and Kikuchi disease may be similar, with hematoxylin bodies being unique to SLE on histology compared to Kikuchi disease. Additionally, the two diseases would be differentiated based on serology and clinical picture, as SLE autoimmune markers would be negative in Kikuchi disease alone. Another autoimmune differential such as sarcoidosis typically presents with non-necrotizing granulomas and can be screened for with ACE level, chest imaging, and symptomatology such as cough

Of note, autoimmune pathologies can be co-diagnosed with Kikuchi disease. There are case reports of Kikuchi disease co-diagnosed with primary Sjogren’s syndrome manifesting as necrotizing lymphatic granulomas, Kikuchi disease co-diagnosed with relapsing polychondritis manifesting as bilateral pinnae inflammation and lymphadenopathy, and Kikuchi disease in Still’s disease and mixed connective tissue disease

Lastly, lymphoma is in the differential in Kikuchi disease. Histology as well as immune staining of the biopsy sample can help rule out these malignant etiologies, as can peripheral bloodwork. On histology, the paucity of CD-20 positive B cells makes B cell lymphoma less likely, and positive stains for myeloperoxidase in Kikuchi disease are absent in T-cell lymphomas. The absence of Reed-Sternberg cells and CD30/CD15 staining, as well as unremarkable peripheral flow cytometry, can additionally be used to rule out lymphoma
