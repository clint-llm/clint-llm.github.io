Patients with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome require a collaborative effort from multiple specialties and supportive/specialty-trained nursing services, working collaboratively as an interprofessional team. There is no cure for Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome at this time, so treatment should focus on symptom management. As discussed previously, the primary systems involved in this disease are the hepatic and central nervous systems. Seizures are often the presenting symptom and will need to be followed by neurology. With the progression of the disease, motor skills, and muscle strength decline, necessitating the services of physical therapy and occupational therapy. Liver failure may cause coagulopathies and hypoglycemia, leading to the addition of gastrointestinal specialists, hematology, and nutritional support to the team. Due to the relentless nature of this disease, chaplain and psychiatric care should be offered for the patients. Ultimately, a palliative care team should discuss the treatment options and help the family and patients make the decisions they feel will result in the best quality of life.

The nursing staff should assist with patient and family education, discussing the need to take seizure precautions. The nurses can also assist with the coordination of assistance with daily living activities. Often the nurse will identify the progression of the disease and need to report to the clinician the need for additional care. Home health nurses will often manage the care of the patient until a palliative care team assumes management. Nurses must work in conjunction with the clinicians to assure the patient's family is well educated about the clinical course, and coordination of care is achieved.

Valproic acid is appropriate in managing seizures, but it has been shown to cause a rapid progression of liver failure in patients with AHS. For this reason, it is critical to avoid this medication and the detrimental effects it may have on the patient's clinical course as long as possible. Once initiated, the pharmacist needs to assist the clinical team in monitoring for toxicity and advice the lowest dose possible.

An interprofessional approach to the management of clinicians, pharmacists, and nurses will produce the best outcomes in the care of Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome. [Level 5]
