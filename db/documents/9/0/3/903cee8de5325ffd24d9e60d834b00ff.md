Iodine is a natural precursor for thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) and is uptaken from the blood into the thyroid follicular cell by theÂ sodium and iodide transporter. Similarly, radioactive iodine (RAI) exerts its effects once it is taken up by the follicular cells of the thyroid, emitting beta rays that further cause definitive local damage to the thyroid tissue.
