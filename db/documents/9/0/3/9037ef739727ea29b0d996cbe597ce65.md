Indications for any type of brow lift surgery may include:

- Visual field obstruction

- Psuedo-blepharoptosis (eyelid appears to be lowered, but no pathology of the eyelid musculature or levator aponeurosis is present)

- Brow ptosis

- Facial paralysis

- Facial (brow) asymmetry

- Deep forehead rhytids

- Glabellar lines

- Concerns regarding the perceived resting facial aesthetic (e.g., an "angry" or "tired" look)

Clinical situations favoring a direct brow lift approach:

- Lack of forehead rhytids

- Unilateral facial paralysis

- Convex forehead craniofacial skeleton (limits endoscopic approach)

- Receding hairline

- Baldness

- Heavy eyebrows

- Prior eyebrow scar

- Patient preference

In summary, the direct brow lift is increasingly used as a reconstructive technique and less commonly performed in the cosmetic setting.
