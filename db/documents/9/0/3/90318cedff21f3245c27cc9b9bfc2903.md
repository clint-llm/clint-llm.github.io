There are a variety of products that can be beneficial in shock resuscitation, but the three typical products used in the acute care setting are packed red blood cells (pRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelets. The U.S. military discovered issues with ARDS and MODS developing in patients with large-volume resuscitation with strict crystalloids as early as 1996. Then, it was studies of the early 2000’s such as the PROMTT study (2013) and PROPPR trial (2015) which further refined our resuscitative use of blood products to their current form.
