While the initial workup for hemolytic anemia can begin with a general practitioner in a non-urgent setting or even an emergency physician, a thorough diagnosis and continued treatment can be difficult and challenging. An interprofessional team that incorporates a hematologist is often crucial. Once specific lab markers and blood smears are obtained and reviewed, the cause of hemolytic anemia can be determined. When a patient presents to the emergency department compromised and decompensated, blood transfusions may need to be given when the cause is unknown. However, if a thorough workup is able to be performed, it is crucial to systematically diagnose the cause of hemolytic anemia as the treatment for one category may be harmful in another. Furthermore, as the treatment is diverse among hemolytic anemias, the morbidity and mortality outcomes vary just as much.
