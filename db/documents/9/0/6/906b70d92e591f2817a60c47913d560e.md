Pseudophakic bullous keratopathy or postoperative corneal edema is characterized by epithelial and subepithelial bullae, stromal edema, and endothelial decompensation secondary to trauma inflicted during cataract surgery especially post phacoemulsification. The patient presents with pain, watering, redness, and gradually worsening visual acuity over months. The conservative management is characterized by topical hypertonic agents, cycloplegics, and antiglaucoma drugs. The gold standard treatment is corneal transplantation. This activity highlights the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, investigations, diagnostic modalities, treatment options, differential diagnosis, and complications of pseudophakic bullous keratopathy.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the risk factors for developing pseudophakic bullous keratopathy.
- Summarize the evaluation of pseudophakic bullous keratopathy.
- Explain the management of pseudophakic bullous keratopathy.
- Outline the potential complications of pseudophakic bullous keratopathy.
