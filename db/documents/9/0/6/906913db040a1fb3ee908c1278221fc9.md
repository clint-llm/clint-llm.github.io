For all vascular access closure devices, some general guidelines should be kept in mind. The common femoral artery should be accessed under ultrasonographic guidance in addition to evaluation of anatomic landmarks and fluoroscopic guidance. A micropuncture kit should be used for initial access. The puncture should be below the inguinal ligament, below the most superior aspect of the femoral head, should avoid accessing a densely calcified part of the artery and should avoid accessing the superficial and deep femoral arteries. Once the micropuncture needle and wire are in place, we usually use a scalpel to make a small skin nick at the access site. Using a hemostat, tissues are spread down to the level of the artery. Performance of this step helps in placement of the closure mechanism later on by reducing excess tissue between the skin and the artery. Once the 4F micropuncture catheter is in place, the micropuncture wire is removed. AÂ femoral angiogram is obtained with the appropriate obliquity of the image intensifier to ensure an appropriate position of access, suitability of vessel for closure device (especially size and arterial plaque), and to rule out any complications from the access such as perforation or dissection.
