Radiological or nuclearÂ emergencies are rare but can involve significant numbers of people. After the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in 1986, nearly 6000 children developed thyroid cancer. Radioactive iodine that was either inhaled or consumed from local contamination caused this cancer. Immediately after an accident, local health facilities will be overwhelmed with people wanting to be screened and treated. Areas with local nuclear power plants need to plan accordingly. Major cities now have to worry about the possibility of a dirty bomb.
