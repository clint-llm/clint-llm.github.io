High-density lipoproteins are shown to be atheroprotective and exhibit various antiatherogenic properties. These include inhibition of inflammation, oxidation, and apoptosis. One of the most integral antiatherogenic functions is the capability to promote reverse cholesterol transport (RCT).

RCT is a sequence of reactions in which HDL particles facilitate the release of lipids from the subendothelial space and intima and deliver them to the liver. In contrast, apoB-containing lipoproteins (LDL, VLDL, IDL) promote atherosclerosis by driving cholesterol and phospholipids into the subendothelial space.

In some circumstances, the protein cargo carried by HDL can be converted from an atheroprotective to a pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory state. This has been observed in patients with sepsis, CKD, chronic inflammatory conditions, recent acute coronary events, and diabetes mellitus. During these occasions, the apoprotein and enzyme components of HDL may be substituted by acute phase reactants (fibrinogen, serum amyloid A), which disable the ability of HDL to partake in reverse cholesterol transport or promote other antiatherogenic processes.
