The bite from a funnel-web spider can cause very severe symptoms that can worsen and progress rapidly, and the primary treatment is antivenom known as FWSAV. Therefore, all bites from large, black spiders in the endemic areas should be treated as funnel-web spider bites. First-aid treatment for a suspected funnel-web spider envenomation starts with cleansing the area with soap and tap water, then immediately applying a pressure immobilization bandage. This technique combines a light pressure bandage with immobilizing the affected area as if it were being splinted. This technique limits the spread of the venom throughout the body and minimizes the area affected by the bite.
