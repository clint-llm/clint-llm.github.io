Laminectomy is one of the most common procedures to decompress the spinal canal in cases of narrowing secondary to various conditions such as degenerative stenosis, fracture, primary and secondary spinal tumors, abscess, and deformity. The spinous process and the lamina are removed limited laterally to the medial part of facet joints. The central canal, the lateral recesses, and the neural foramina must be decompressed for good clinical recovery and the prevention of failed back surgery syndrome. This activity describes the laminectomy technique, highlighting the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients who undergo this posterior spinal decompression surgery.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for performing a laminectomy.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique used to perform a laminectomy.
- Outline appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of laminectomy.
- Review the contraindications to performing a laminectomy.
