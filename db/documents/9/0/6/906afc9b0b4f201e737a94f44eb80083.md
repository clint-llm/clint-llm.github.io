Prognosis of infants managed with antenatal steroids, respiratory support, and exogenous surfactant therapy is excellent. Mortality is less than 10%, with some studies showing survival rates of up to 98% with advanced care. Increased survival in developed countries is in stark comparison to babies who received no intervention in low-income countries, where the mortality rate for premature infants with RDS is significantly higher, at times close to 100%.
