**History**

Patients with eventration of the diaphragm have variable presentations. Most patients are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on chest X-ray; however, some may present with significant respiratory distress or gastrointestinal symptoms. Bilateral congenital diaphragmatic eventration in the neonate may present with acute respiratory failure and cyanosis. Respiratory symptoms in adult and pediatric cases may include dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, tachypnea, and shallow breathing. In Adults, recurrent respiratory infections or lung atelectasis or chronic productive cough may initial presentation. Adults may also complain of chest pain which may be caused by arrhythmias or palpitations. Gastrointestinal symptoms in the adult population may worsen with increased intraabdominal pressure (e.g., exercise, pregnancy, ascites, infection, fluid sequestration) and present with dyspepsia, dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux, and/or epigastric pain.

In infants, respiratory symptoms are largely attributed to the shifting of the mediastinal structures to the contralateral side. Gastrointestinal involvement is common and may manifest as vomiting, bloating, constipation, poor weight gain, and poor oral intake. In severe cases, gastric volvulus may be present. All patients should be assessed for a history of trauma and other causes of respiratory distress.

**Physical Examination**

The physical examination findings are variable and often non-specific. Below is a list of physical findings that may be found in adult and pediatric cases (or shared).

**Shared findings (Adults and Infants)**

General:

- Tachypnea

- Central cyanosis if hypoxia is present (rare in unilateral cases)

Lungs/Thorax:

- Accessory muscle use

- Paradoxical movement of the chest wall during inspiration (on the affected side)

- Decreased tactile fremitus and dullness to percussion on the affected side

- Decreased breath sounds (unilateral or bilateral involvement)

Gastrointestinal:

- Abdominal pain with palpation (usually epigastric or periumbilical areas)

- Bowel sounds within the thoracic cavity

**Congenital (Infants)**

Lungs/Thorax:

- Apparent signs of blunt or penetrating thoracic trauma

Gastrointestinal:

- Scaphoid abdomen

- Severe epigastric pain related to gastric volvulus

Musculoskeletal/Neurological:

- Findings of Erb palsy (C5 and C6 injury) in those with birth trauma

- Clavicular fracture
- The arm is adducted and internally rotated
- The forearm is extended and pronated

**Acquired (Adults)**

Lungs/Thorax

- Apparent signs of blunt or penetrating thoracic trauma

Cardiovascular

- Chest wall pain

- Tachycardia or arrhythmia

Gastrointestinal

- Abdominal pain due to causes of increased intraabdominal pressure

- Ascites
- infection
- Fluid sequestration (third-spacing)
- Pregnancy
