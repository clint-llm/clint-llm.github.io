The course for schizophrenia was once believed to be unvaryingly poor, although now studies have shown there is potential for good outcomes. The multitude of newer medications, along with an option for long-acting injectable antipsychotics, has given patients a variety of treatment options along with addressing compliance issues. As stated earlier, early intervention, along with intensive treatment, seems to be of utmost importance in long-term outcomes. There is little data supporting evidence either way for a single psychotic episode related to a medical or neurologic condition, and prognosis would be condition dependent. Treating the current episode, along with the underlying illness, would be considered the best course of action.
