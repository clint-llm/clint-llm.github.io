As trigeminal neuralgia is a clinical diagnosis, physicians need to be aware of the typical presentation of TN to reduce unnecessary imaging and investigations. TN is frequently misdiagnosed as toothache, thereby leading to root canal treatment and tooth extractions. Hence, physicians need to be aware of this condition. An interprofessional approach between the primary care physician, dentist, neurologist, anesthesiologist, and neurosurgeon is necessary to recognize and manage this condition. Otolaryngology and pain control nurses provide care to patients, inform them about their condition, and communicate with physicians. Since medical management is the typical first step, a pharmacist consult is in order to help guide agent selection, verify dosing, check for drug interactions, and counsel the patient on medication side effects. All patients with clinically suspected trigeminal neuralgia should undergo neuroimaging to look for secondary causes of TN. If a secondary etiology like multiple sclerosis is found, they should receive a prompt referral to a neurologist or a neurosurgeon for further management.Â These interprofessional strategies will improve patient outcomes in cases of trigeminal neuralgia.
