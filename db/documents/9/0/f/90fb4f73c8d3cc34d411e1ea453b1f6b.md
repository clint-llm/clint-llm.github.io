Absolute contraindication to gastric resection includes any patient who is too unfit for general anesthesia. Relative contraindications to gastric resection include patients who are elderly, have an advanced cardiopulmonary failure, or decreased life expectancy due to other chronic conditions.

Total gastrectomy is contraindicated when wide negative margins (4Â to 6 cm) can be achieved with partial gastrectomy, as partial gastrectomy has a significantly improved safety and long-term functional outcome profile, especially in patients with advanced age, malnutrition, and extensive comorbidities.
