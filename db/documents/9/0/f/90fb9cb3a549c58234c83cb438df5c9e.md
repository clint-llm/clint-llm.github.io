The tentorium cerebelli is a constituent part of the posterior cranial fossa meninges and receives its arterial supply from the meningeal branches of the ascending pharyngeal, occipital, and vertebral arteries.

The meningeal arteries derive from the carotid arteries (internal and external), the posterior cerebral artery and the vertebral arteries. There is a small arterial vessel; the meningohypophyseal trunk, which arises from the internal carotid artery (intracavernous portion). This meningohypophyseal trunk gives rise to two branches known as the tentorial branch or Bernasconi branch, and a dorsal branch or Cassinari branch. The posterior cerebral artery gives rise to two small branches known as Schechter and Davidoff.
