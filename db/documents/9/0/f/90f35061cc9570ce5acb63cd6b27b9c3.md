The degree to which myoclonus improves with treatment depends on the underlying etiology. Certain types of myoclonus may be secondary to potentially treatable etiologies as an inflammatory disorder or a metabolic disturbance. For example, in drug-induced myoclonus, stopping the offending drug can be sufficient for complete resolution of myoclonic jerks.
