The indications for sacral ART, or sacral rocking, include somatic dysfunction of the sacrum.Â  Sacral ART is one of many techniques that can help to treat somatic dysfunction of the sacrum.

The hands positioned on the sacral bone must not slide on the tissue, but must induce harmonious movements. The manual approach ends when the practitioner judges the tissue under the hands or the tissues under the sacral bone to have shown improvement.

This technique can have other goals. For example, improve the relationship between the base of the sacrum and L5, and consequently, positively influence craniosacral mobility.

The sacroiliac joint is innervated and can give painful symptoms; this approach could improve the articular relationship of these joints and reduce nociceptive afference.

Other indications are related to soft tissues. The sacral area is covered by the thoracolumbar fascia, which is known to be a source of pain because if there is a tension dysfunction, the receptors can turn into nociceptors. The technique described could alleviate fascial tensions and improve the symptomatic picture.

The technique can mitigate the fascial tensions of the endopelvic fascia, the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments, the urogenital diaphragm or triangular ligament, the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament.
