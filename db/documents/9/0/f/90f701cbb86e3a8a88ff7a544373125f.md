Parents should be informed of the benign nature of congenital dermal melanocytosis; it requires no further treatment or evaluation. Parents are educated that this condition should fade by 1 year old and rarely persist past 6 years old. Should extra-sacral lesions persist, laser therapy is a potential option for cosmetic treatment.
