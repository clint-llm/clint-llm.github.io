Patients with congenital lobar emphysema can present differently. The usual presentation is respiratory distress, wheezing, cyanosis, and difficulty in feeding. The parents of the newly diagnosed patient should be given emotional support and detailed information about the condition, its treatment, prognosis, and effects on everyday life.

**Asymptomatic patient:**If the patient is asymptomatic, the parents should be guided about conservative management. There should be regular follow-up and observation, and the parents should be advised of the steps that should be taken if the patient starts to show symptoms.

**Symptomatic patient**: If the patient has severe symptoms, parents should be guided about the possibility of surgery (lobectomy) as well as its prognosis and lifestyle changes accordingly.Â The parents should be provided with educational material about the disease. Flow charts, diagrams, and videos should be used to explain each and every aspect of the disease, treatment, and lifestyle changes until the parents fully understand everything and are satisfied with the provision of care.
