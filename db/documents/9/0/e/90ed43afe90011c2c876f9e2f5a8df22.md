The ophthalmologist may be the first person who encounters the patient with severe carotid artery stenosis. Thus awareness about the clinical features and prompt referral for further systemic investigations is the role of an ophthalmologist. As ocular signs may manifest before other systemic features of carotid artery insufficiency like slurred speech, weakness or tingling over the face, arm or leg, confusion, memory loss, and speech difficulty. Thus this required collaboration between the ophthalmologist, vascular surgeon, cardiologist, neurologist, and physician for management of a patient with carotid artery stenosis and improving their survival outcome and reducing visual morbidity.
