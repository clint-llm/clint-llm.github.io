Treatment of a new breast lump depends on whether the lump is benign or malignant and on the physical health and personal wishes of the patient.

Any patient with a proven or suspected malignant mass should receive management with an interprofessional approach, with input from the oncology, radiology, pathology, surgical, specialist nursing, and anesthetic teams, as well as palliative care, social workers, and psychology teams where indicated. Breast cancers are typically treated through surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and immunological therapy.

Benign breast masses are treated according to etiology:

- **Breast cyst:**A simple breast cyst is usually involuntary without any intervention. If persistent or troublesome cyst aspiration may be an option, however, they tend to recur. Cyst aspirate may be sent for cytological analysis, but there is some controversy as to the benefit of this due to the risk of false positives.

- **Fibroadenoma:**These lesions are benign and usually involute without requiring any further treatment. A broad range of indications for interventions in beast fibroadenoma have been introduced, including rapid growth, greater than 3 cm size, an increase in the BI-RADS category, and tissue diagnosis suggestive for atypical hyperplasia or suspected phyllodes tumor. Despite the wide use of the open excision approach to managing breast fibroadenomas, ultrasound-guided vacuum-assisted breast biopsy has been used for diagnostic confirmation before the definitive management.

- However, surgical consultation should be considered if they are large, painful, or causing the patient distress, and these are often removed surgically.

- **Fat necrosis, hematoma:**This usually does not require any treatment other than analgesia and monitoring. However, the surgical consultant should consider whether the mass is causing the patient significant pain or cosmetic issues.

- **Breast abscess:**In general, abscesses require surgical incision and drainage to identify and remove the source of infection. Smaller abscesses less than 3cm in size and lactational abscesses may resolve with oral antibiotics and needle aspiration, but there is a risk of recurrence.

- **Gynaecomastia:**In males presenting with gynecomastia, the investigation should focus on the likely cause, and if none can be found, further referral to endocrinology is recommended.

- ****Mastitis:****several standard antibiotic therapies have been introduced as the standard treatment for acute mastitis. The choice of antibiotic to be selected for the treatment differs considering the causative microorganism, antibiotic resistance profile, and positive history of recurrent mastitis. Accordingly, dicloxacillin- flucloxacillin, cephalexin, and clindamycin are standard treatments for staphylococcal mastitis, mastitis in patients with penicillin intolerance, and recurrent mastitis, respectively. The mentioned treatments should be offered for full duration of 7 to 14 days.
