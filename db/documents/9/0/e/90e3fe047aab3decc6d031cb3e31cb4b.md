Collaboration between health care providers is essential for patient-centered care. Many different types of healthcare professionals will likely be involved in some kind of ATD assessment and matching. Occupational therapists, physical therapists, and speech-language pathologists are just a few examples of healthcare professionals that commonly assess and match patients with ATDs. Additionally, Assistive Technology Professionals (ATPs) are trained service providers that can be consulted for the selection, acquisition, and training in the use of ATDs.
