The integrity and sustainability of an SP program can be maintained by following the standards of best practice set forth by professional societies of health care simulation. There is ongoing research on the growing interest and impact on learner performance and assessment from using SPs to improve curriculum outcomes.

A standardized patient program can meet institutional goals and enhance learner education, but it must be maintained and guided by a standardized patient program director who is engaged and knowledgeable about simulation and the importance of the SP role.
