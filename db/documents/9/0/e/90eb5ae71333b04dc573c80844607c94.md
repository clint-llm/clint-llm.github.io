The location of the coronary sinus within the right atrium allows convenient access to the myocardial capillary network. Clinicians use this access in retrograde cardioplegia, a procedure in which paralytic agents are delivered retrogradely through the coronary sinus and its tributaries to the myocardium during cardiac surgery. Retrograde cardioplegia is now commonly used in conjunction with the classical anterograde approach, in which cardioplegic agents are administered through the coronary ossia into the coronary arteries. The concomitant use of retrograde cardioplegia with anterograde cardioplegia accounts for the risk of significant arterial stenoses that may prevent cardioplegic agents from reaching the myocardium at adequate doses. The use of both approaches has shown a superior return of postop myocardial function than the use of anterograde cardioplegia alone. Limitations to retrograde cardioplegia include PLSVC, in which cardioplegic agents may unintentionally reach the systemic circulation. A rare, albeit major complication of retrograde cardioplegia is that of coronary sinus rupture.
