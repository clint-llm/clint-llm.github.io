IVUS obtains images from a piezoelectric transducer that produces sound waves. IVUS catheters divide into two main categories based on the mechanism of transducer design.  IVUS catheters currently in use are either solid-state phased array incorporating multiple stationary piezoelectric transducers or consist of a rotational design based on a single piezoelectric transducer.

Multimodality IVUS catheters, combining IVUS and an additional intravascular technology are now commercially available with combined IVUS and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and under investigation for future use with IVUS and optical coherence tomography (OCT).
