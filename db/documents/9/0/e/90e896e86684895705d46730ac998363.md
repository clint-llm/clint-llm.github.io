E. histolytica is a pseudopod-forming, protozoal parasite that causes proteolysis and tissue lysis. Humans are the natural hosts. Amoebic infection occurs by the ingestion of mature cysts in fecally-contaminated food or water or from the hands. Excystation of the mature cysts occurs in the small intestine, and trophozoites are released; the trophozoites then move to the large intestine. The trophozoites increase by binary fission and produce cysts.Â Both stages pass in the feces. The cysts can survive days to weeks in the external environment because of the protection provided by the cyst wall. The cyst is responsible for further transmission of the parasite. Ingestion of only a small number of organisms can cause disease.
