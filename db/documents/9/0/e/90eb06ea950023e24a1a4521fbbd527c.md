Actinic prurigo is typically diagnosed clinically with a detailed historyÂ and physical exam. Patients will report the characteristic symptoms of severely pruritic papulonodular erythematous skin lesions that began in the spring or summer months. Patients may or may not report a direct correlation between exposure to sunlight and disease onset. Diagnosis can be aided by skin photo-testing, histologic evaluation, and genetic screening for the HLA DR4 allele variant. Clinicians often perform laboratory testing and immunofluorescence studies to rule out lupus erythematosus and other photosensitive dermatoses.
