The diagnosis and management of vertebral osteomyelitis is not always simple and is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a radiologist, infectious disease expert, orthopedic surgeon, internist, pathologist, nurses, and pharmacists. The initialÂ treatment in all patients is antibiotics for a minimum of 6 weeks. Surgery is only recommended for complex cases, the presence of neurological deficits or failure to respond to antibiotics.

The final challenge of vertebral osteomyelitis management is determining the optimal follow-up strategy and diagnosing treatment failure. To date, there is low consensus for the definition of treatment failure. The current Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines define treatment failure as microbiologically confirmed pathogen persistence despite targeted antimicrobial therapy for an appropriate duration of treatment.

For treatment failure, management options are best selected by trending clinical, laboratory, and imaging data. If imaging suggests a persistent surgical target (paravertebral or epidural abscess), then a surgical consultation is appropriate.

The outcomes for patients with vertebral osteomyelitis are guarded. Even those who recover are left with mild to moderate degrees of functional and neurological deficits.
