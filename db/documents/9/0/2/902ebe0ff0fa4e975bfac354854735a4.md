The need for this test arises in cases in which a procedure that may compromise radial artery patency is being considered. A classic example is the harvest of a radial forearm flap wherein the radial artery is included to perfuse the tissue being transferred and is therefore no longer available to perfuse the hand. Likewise, if the radial artery needs to be cannulated or catheterized and there is a risk for thrombosis, the Allen test can help confirm that the hand will maintain adequate blood flow through the ulnar artery and collaterals in the event the radial artery becomes occluded. A positive Allen test means that the patient may have an adequate dual blood supply to the hand. A negative Alle test shows the patient may not have adequate dual blood supply, which would be a contraindication for catheterization, radial forearm flap harvest, or any procedure that may result in the occlusion of the vessel.
