Investigations include office-based tests and special laboratory tests.

Office-based tests:

- Schirmer’s test – Values are low in cases associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca.

- Stains  

- Fluorescein stains the necrotic epithelial debris and epithelial defects
- Rose Bengal and Lissamine green stains the plaque vividly
- Alcian blue and eosin stains the plaque faintly

Specialized lab tests:

In cases associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca, blood investigations are needed to diagnose Sjogren syndrome. Although salivary gland biopsy remains the gold standard, an examination of classic SS biomarkers ANA (anti-nuclear antibody), SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La and rheumatoid factor is a non-invasive way for the diagnosis of Sjogren syndrome.

Polymerase chain reaction for herpes zoster DNA may be indicated in delayed onset plaques and pseudodendrites.
