Laboratory tests are not necessary for pediatric patients with isolated facial fractures without suspected intracranial involvement. However, if there is concern that operative intervention will be needed, testing may be indicated according to local pre-operative protocols.

The preferred imaging study for evaluating suspected facial trauma at any patient age is a computerized tomography (CT). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), typically used to assess soft-tissue structures, is less sensitive for subtle fractures, and should not be used as a primary imaging modality. X-rays can be used for dental evaluation but do not reliably show facial fractures. Isolated soft tissue injuries without clinical suspicion for fractures do not benefit from imaging or isolated clinically suspected nasal bone fractures, which should be treated empirically.
