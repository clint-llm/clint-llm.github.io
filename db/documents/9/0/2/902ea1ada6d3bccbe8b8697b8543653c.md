ECT is an effective treatment for pharmacotherapy-resistant depression and other severe psychiatric disorders. Its effects are quickly seen, but some patients may require multiple sessions of this therapy. Providing general anesthesia for ECT is standard and has been the case since the 1950s. Anesthesia for ECT provides a safe environment for a generalized epileptic seizure to take place.Â  Treatment of hemodynamic instability and prevention of painful and detrimental side effects are possible through a carefully planned anesthetic.

The ideal anesthetic agent provides amnesia with minimal effects on hemodynamic stability and seizure duration. An anesthetic agent that does affect seizure duration might be desirable if the patients' previous seizure during ECT was too long or short. Muscle relaxation protects the musculoskeletal system from the tonic and clonic actions of a generalized seizure. There are enough options and ways to provide anesthesia for ECT to suit most patients' needs. Alterations are made by the anesthesiologist, who recognizes reactions, patient discomfort, and side effects. Today, ECT is seldom performed without the use of general anesthesia except in developing countries. Musculoskeletal injury and post-traumatic stress disorder are not uncommon when enduring ECT without anesthesia.
