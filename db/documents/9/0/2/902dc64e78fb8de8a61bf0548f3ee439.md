Treatment of tufted hair folliculitis is not codified, and there is no satisfactory therapy for this condition. If a cause can be identified for tufted hair folliculitis, treatment is aimed at the underlying disease. Otherwise, therapy should be directed toward decreasing discomfort and improve appearance. Topical treatment, such as shampoos containing salicylic acid or tar derivatives, can decrease scaling but are not sufficient. Topical steroids can decrease erythema, edema, and itching but their effect is minimal and not persistent. Systemic antistaphylococcal agents may be used in tufted hair folliculitis if evident clinical signs of infection, such as purulent exudate, are present. Prolonged treatment with oral rifampicin (300 mg daily) associated with oral clindamycin (300 mg daily) was found to give good results in tufted hair folliculitis. Topical nadifloxacin has been used in one patient with good clinical results but need further evaluation on large series of patients. Zinc sulfate, methotrexate, and isotretinoin are not efficient. Surgical excision of the plaques of scarring alopecia has been reported to give good cosmetic results in patients with tufted hair folliculitis. Caution is recommended, however, as post-surgical scarring can be a cause of this condition.
