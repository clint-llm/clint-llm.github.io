Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is a type of cerebrovascular disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide within the leptomeninges and small to medium-sized cerebral blood vessels. This disorder can have severe morbidity and mortality if it is not identified and treated promptly. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients with this condition.

- Describe the etiology of cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
- Outline the management options available for cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
- Summarize the importance of the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
