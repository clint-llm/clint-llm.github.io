Since the addition of the HIB vaccine to the infant immunization schedule in many countries worldwide, the annual incidence of epiglottitis in children has decreased overall. However, the incidence in adults has remained stable. Additionally, the age of children who have had epiglottitis has increased from three years old to six to twelve years old in the post-vaccine era.

While in the past epiglottitis was thought to be primarily a disease of young children, it is now much more likely practitioners will encounter epiglottitis/supraglottitis in adults as well.
