Presbyopia management and prescription glasses can call for reassessment or postponement in conditions that can alter the natural refractive status of the eye. These conditions include metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus; long-term chronic use of steroids; ocular trauma and/or surgery; high-order aberrations resulting from cornea ectasias and keratoconus; cornea plana, etc.

Individuals with irregular high astigmatism must first be addressed before any consideration is made for presbyopic correction. Preexisting ocular conditions need to be thoroughly diagnosed and addressed, which include trauma, infection, uveitis, inflammatory conditions, keratitis, glaucoma, surgery, etc. These conditions may require thorough management before the initiation of presbyopic intervention. There may also be other chronic neurological conditions affecting a patient's ability to function visually at near, and these should be considered.
