Locally advanced breast cancer encompasses a heterogeneous group of patients including those with advanced primary tumor size, extensive or widespread nodal disease, and inflammatory breast cancer. In 2013, 30 to 40% of patients diagnosed with breast cancer had regional lymph node involvement, and 10% of patients had a primary tumor 5 centimeters or greater in size. Unlike most other malignancies, the prognosis for patients with locally advanced disease is favorable, with 5-year breast cancer-specific survival ranging from 78% to 90%.
