**When to Initiate**

There are many factors to consider when deciding whether to initiate CRRT. Two main factors are the severity of the illness and the necessity of the procedure. The severity of the disease may be judged through the severity of the AKI and the observed trend. Further supporting factors would be the presence of electrolyte and acid-base disorders, evidence of fluid overload, and other significant organ dysfunction that requires renal support for promoting recovery. Without specific indications, the timing of initiation is up for debate.

Early initiation may allow for early correction of electrolyte abnormalities, volume status, and azotemia before significant disturbances can occur but must be weighed against complications. The trajectory of an AKI is difficult to predict, so isolating those patients likely to have a persistent AKI is not always reliable.

**When to Discontinue**

Every patient on CRRT should have daily monitoring for renal recovery. There are no standards for dialysis discontinuation. One way of monitoring renal recovery is by measuring urine output; increased urine output is an indicator of improving renal function. Once the intrinsic kidney function has improved enough that it is able to support the patientsâ€™ needs, CRRT may be discontinued.
