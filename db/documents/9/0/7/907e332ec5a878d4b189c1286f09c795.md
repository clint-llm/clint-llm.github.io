Partial tears of the ulnar collateral ligament are usually treated with splinting alone and, despite the long duration of immobilization, tend to heal well. In a minority of patients, there may be persistent stiffness and pain. As discussed in the treatment and management above, surgery typically can be performed without significant complications in the setting of complete ulnar collateral ligament tears. In those individuals who develop Stener lesions or go without treatment, chronic changes can be observed to the metacarpophalangeal joint space.

Generally, the patient should wait at least six weeks before returning to work or sports.
