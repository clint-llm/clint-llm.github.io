The primary function of the motor cortex is to generate signals to direct the movement of the body. It is part of the frontal lobe and is anterior to the central sulcus. It consists of the primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, and the supplementary motor area.

There are important differences in the cortical projections from the cortical motor neurons. Those fibers originating from the primary motor cortex (area 4) terminate mainly in the spinal cord, synapsing directly on motor neurons. The rostral frontal motor areas do not terminate directly at the spinal cord. They send fibers that terminate in various areas of the brainstem. Therefore they control movements indirectly through the brainstem such as the tectospinal and reticulospinal tracts. It is also more understandable that they will control more the proximal and axial muscles and movements.

Cortical afferents to the frontal motor cortex arise from three sources: the parietal somatosensory cortex, the prefrontal cortex, and the cingulate cortex.Â The parietal-frontal connections represent different sensory-motor circuits. The cingulate cortex sends fibers to the premotor and supplemental motor areas for limbic information, motivation, and decision. Finally, the prefrontal cortex sends fibers to the motor cortex serving important functions of motor planning and execution.
