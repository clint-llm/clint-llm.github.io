- All patients with asthma and CF, regardless of the severity of the level of control, should routinely have screening for ABPA using A. fumigatus-specific IgE levels.

- Glucocorticoids should be the first-line of therapy in ABPA, and itraconazole reserved for those with exacerbations and glucocorticoid-dependent disease.

- Establishing IgE sensitization to Aspergillus through either skin prick test or measurement of specific serum IgE is a reasonable first step in an asthmatic being evaluated for ABPA. The inability to establish IgE sensitization to Aspergillus virtually excludes ABPA from consideration. If skin testing and/or specific IgE are positive, then a total serum IgE, precipitins to Aspergillus, and an eosinophil count should be assayed. Furthermore, chest imaging, preferably with a high-resolution chest CT, is necessary as well.

- Early detection and treatment can prevent the development of bronchiectasis or pulmonary fibrosis that otherwise occurs in the later stages of the disease.
