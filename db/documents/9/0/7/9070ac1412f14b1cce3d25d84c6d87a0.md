Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients can present with symptoms at any phase of life and may have an elevated risk of sudden cardiac death based on risk factors. To avoid delayed treatment of this condition, health care providers need guidelines for timely and appropriate management of this condition. This activity reviews treatment of patients who present with symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
- Review the indications for cardiac interventions in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
- Outline the contraindications for certain cardiac interventions in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of patients with symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy for alcohol septal ablation.
