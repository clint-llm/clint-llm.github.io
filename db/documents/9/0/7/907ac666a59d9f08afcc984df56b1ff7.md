Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is a rare inflammatory disorder of the blood vessels of the brain and spinal cord occurring in the absence of any evidence of systemic vasculitis. Clinical manifestations of PACNS at the time of diagnosis are non-specific with various presenting symptoms. A headache is the most common presenting symptom in the majority of the PACNS cases. Other symptoms include focal neurological deficits including hemiparesis, aphasia, numbness, visual symptoms, ataxia, among others. This activity will assist practitioners in recognizing when to consider this diagnosis and how to manage it. This activity highlights the critical role of the interprofessional care team in caring for patients with primary angiitis of the central nervous system.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of primary angiitis of the central nervous system.
- Explain the difficulties inherent in making the diagnosis of primary angiitis of the central nervous system.
- Describe the management of primary angiitis of the central nervous system.
- Describe how coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to earlier diagnosis of primary angiitis of the central nervous system, allowing for earlier treatment and better patient outcomes.
