As the brachial artery divides into the radial artery and ulnar artery, the ulnar artery is usually the larger branch of the two, but sometimes these arteries will divide and be about the same size, or the radial artery will become the larger of the two. The palmar arches have many variations in how they anastomose to each other to form collateral blood flow. Some individuals have duplication of the palmar arches or no connection between the deep palmar arch to the ulnar artery.
