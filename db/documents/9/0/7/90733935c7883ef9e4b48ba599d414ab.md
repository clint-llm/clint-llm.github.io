Although many benign variants of the femoral artery exist, there are some that are considered to be rare and potentiallyÂ dangerous to the patient. The origins of smaller arteries off of the femoral artery can be highly variable. Less common abnormalities include a duplicated or absent deep femoral artery, lateral and medial circumflex arteries originating from the common or superficial femoral artery instead of the deep femoral artery.[12][7] The clinical significance of this variant is that the common femoral artery may appear to trifurcate instead of bifurcate.
