Explain the risks and benefits of a peripheral nerve block to the patient and obtain written informed consent if the patient is able. Lay the patient in a lateral decubitus position with the affected side up. This can also be performed with the patient supine and with the head rotated away from the physician. Set the ultrasound machine on the opposite side of the stretcher from where you will be standing. Sterilize the linear ultrasound probe and place it in a sterile probe cover. Cleanse the area of the auricle (both anterior and posterior surfaces), the postauricular area, including the mastoid process, the front of the ear, and the lateral neck along the sternocleidomastoid muscle with 2% chlorhexidine. Drape the patient with sterile towels with the prepped area exposed. Let the chlorhexidine dry completelyÂ before beginning the procedure. Apply sterile ultrasound gel to the site.
