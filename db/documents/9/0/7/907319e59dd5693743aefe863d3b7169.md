Diagnostic interventions are as follows:

**PAPVC**

**Electrocardiography**

ECG is oftentimes normal. It may show peaked P waves representing right atrial enlargement or rR’ pattern and the rSR’ pattern.

**Chest Radiography**

Chest radiograms may show cardiomegaly or increased pulmonary vascular markings. Based on the site of anomalous connections there could be the prominence of IVC or SVC shadows. In Scimitar syndrome, the course and coalescence of the scimitar veins are seen as a shadow (scimitar appearance of the chest radiograph).

**Echocardiography**

Detailed imaging of all the cardiovascular structures including pulmonary veins using 2D and doppler flow is the key to diagnosis.

Other imaging modalities including Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging may be required to diagnose the course of the individual pulmonary veins.

**Cardiac Catheterization**

Cardiac catheterization can provide a definitive diagnosis but is usually not necessary with the advent of the newer non-invasive imaging modalities.

**TAPVC**

**Electrocardiography**

Right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy are often present. In TAPVC without obstruction tall peaked P waves in lead II, suggestive of right atrial enlargement may also be seen.

**Chest Radiography**

In patients with TAPVC without obstruction, cardiomegaly may be seen. A characteristic figure of 8 or snowman appearance of the heart can be seen in supracardiac TAPVC. In patients with obstructed TAPVC signs of pulmonary venous congestion and edema including prominent pulmonary vascular markings, reticular opacities, and Kerley B lines can be seen.

**Echocardiography**

A thorough 2D and doppler interrogation are important for the diagnosis of TAPVC. It is important to image all the pulmonary veins and their course, determine if there is any obstruction to the pulmonary venous drainage and evaluate for interatrial communication or a persistent ductus arteriosus.

All patients with TAPVC have features of right ventricular overload. The right atrium and the right ventricle are enlarged. The most important finding is the inability to demonstrate the drainage of pulmonary veins into the LA. The LA can be small. In supracardiac lesions, the SVC or innominate vein may be dilated. When the pulmonary veins drain into the coronary sinus(CS), the CS can get dilated. In the infracardiac variant, TAPVC connections between pulmonary veins and the hepatic vein or portal vein can be demonstrated. The IVC can get dilated as well. One of the most important echo findings is the entire right to left shunting at the atrial septal level.

Other imaging modalities including CT and MR imaging can also be used for diagnosis, but are usually reserved for patients when Echocardiography is inconclusive or in patients with mixed type of TAPVC when individual veins are hard to see with an echocardiogram.

**Cardiac Catheterization**

Non-invasive techniques such as echocardiography, CT, and MR angiograms have largely replaced cardiac catheterization. However, in cases where additional hemodynamic information is be needed, cardiac catheterization can be considered. It can also be performed in individuals who need palliative interventional procedures (e.g. atrial septostomy) or stenting of the obstructive pulmonary vein.
