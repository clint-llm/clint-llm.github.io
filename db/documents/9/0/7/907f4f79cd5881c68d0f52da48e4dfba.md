The perfusionist is the main individual responsible for delivering cardioplegia by keeping track ofÂ the flow rate, volume, temperature, components, and timing of each dose. There is an important interplay between the cardiothoracic surgeon and perfusionist just prior, during, and coming off of bypass. The perfusionist also assesses and controls the intraluminal pressure through which the cardioplegia solution is being administered and alters the flow rate, volume, temperature, and pressure accordingly.
