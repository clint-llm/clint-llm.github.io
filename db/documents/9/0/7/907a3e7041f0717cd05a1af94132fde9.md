The clinical significance of Winslow’s foramen is 2-fold. First, it serves as a site for an internal hernia. Hernias in the foramen of Winslow are exceedingly uncommon. As with most internal hernias, the presenting symptoms are non-specific and are generally those of intermittent bowel obstruction. Prior to the advent of modern imaging techniques, the diagnosis was frequently made only at laparotomy, and the delay in diagnosis led to significant mortality. CT scans now help with the diagnosis, and treatment consists of reduction of the hernia, with or without resection depending on the viability of the herniated viscera.  Laparoscopic repair has been described as well.

More importantly, because the hepatic artery and portal vein, as well as the common bile duct, pass through the hepatoduodenal ligament immediately adjacent to the foramen of Winslow, rapid access to the blood supply to the liver can be obtained in the event of uncontrolled hepatic bleeding. With the forefinger inserted through the foramen, the vessels can be pinched off between thumb and finger. For more stability, one jaw of a vascular clamp can be inserted into the foramen, allowing for clamping off the hepatic artery and portal vein. Both of these techniques are variations of what is commonly called the “Pringle maneuver,” first described by surgeon James Hogarth Pringle in 1908. Pringle was born in Australia, of Scottish descent. His father was a famous surgeon and a contemporary of Joseph Lister. James Pringle emigrated to Scotland to attend medical school at the University of Edinburg and eventually was appointed surgeon at the Royal Infirmary of Glasgow in1896. He was well known for his expertise in the treatment of fractures and other injuries and radical amputations even before his 1908 publication of Notes on the Arrest of Hepatic Hemorrhage due to Trauma. He was known as a pioneer in trauma surgery.
