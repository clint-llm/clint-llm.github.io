Treatment of pediatric feeding disorder mainly depends on the cause. An interprofessional team is required to evaluate and manage the condition. This medical team includes a gastroenterologist, a psychiatrist, a nutritionist, a behavioral analyst, an occupational therapist, and a speech therapist.

For disruptive behaviors, the child is given positive reinforcement in the form of a reward.  This reinforcement promotes the child's good eating habits. Food is given to children on fixed schedules and in textures and forms easily accepted by them. Reflux is treated with proper positioning of the child before and after the feeds. After the posture trial, proton pump inhibitors may be added. Cleft lip and palate need surgical correction when it interferes with feeding. A feeding tube is placed until the surgery is planned. For swallowing dysfunction,****surgery is needed for correction, depending on the cause. Psychotherapy is the best modality to manage psychiatric eating disorders.
