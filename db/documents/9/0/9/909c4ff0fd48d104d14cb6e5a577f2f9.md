The physical exam is usually sufficient to identify tinea pedis. The diagnosis of tinea pedis may be confirmed by microscopy and culture of skin scrapings. Demonstration of the fungus by microscopic examination of the scrapings taken from the involved site establishes the diagnosis. Dry scales from the instep, heel, and sides of the foot can be gathered by scraping with the edge of a glass microscope slide. Bullae should be unroofed and either the entire roof-mounted intact or scrapings made from the underside of the roof. A few drops of a 10% to 20% solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) are added to the material on the glass slide. A coverslip is placed over the specimen and examined under the microscope. The addition of 20% to 40% Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) speeds clearing of keratin without the need for heating. A staining method using 100 mg of chlorazol black E dye in 10 mL of DMSO and adding it to a 5% aqueous solution of KOH can be helpful. Toluidine blue, 0.1%, can also be used on thin specimens. The mycelia may be seen under low power, but better observation of both hyphae and spores is obtained by the use of 10 times objective in a microscope.
