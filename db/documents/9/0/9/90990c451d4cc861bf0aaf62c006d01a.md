It is important to remember that the procedure also includes active simultaneous resuscitation. The first 4 types of equipment ensure adequate and effective resuscitation and the next 6 are required for the surgical aspects of the procedure. The physician and personnel taking part in the resuscitative portion of the procedure must be different than the physician performing the surgical aspect. In the setting of successful resuscitation, an operating room (OR) room must be available for subsequent closure. Finally, the last 3 pieces of equipment will be needed for the infant resuscitation.
