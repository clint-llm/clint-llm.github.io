Excessive daytime sleepiness

- Insufficient sleep syndrome/poor sleep hygiene

- Idiopathic hypersomnia

- Sleep apnea syndromes

- Chronic fatigue syndrome

- Sleep-related movement disorders (periodic limb movement disorder, restless leg syndrome, etc.)

- Circadian rhythm disorders (jet lag, shift work, delayed/advanced sleep phase disorder, non-24)

- Long sleepers (normal variant in which patient require longer sleep than average to feel well-rested with otherwise normal testing)

- Psychiatric (depression, malingering, conversion disorder, factitious disorder, etc.)

- Substance-induced sleep disorder (narcotics, benzodiazepines, antihistamines, beta-blockers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, antiretroviral, etc.)

- Kleine-Levin syndrome (recurrent hypersomnia that lasts days to weeks and recurs months later)

- Menstrual associated hypersomnia

- Hypersomnia due to a medical condition (Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, etc.)

Idiopathic hypersomnia patients have excessive daytime sleepiness and have a decreased mean sleep latency on MSLT, but these patients do not go into REM pathologically quickly. Unlike patients with narcolepsy, they also generally fall asleep quickly and stay asleep throughout the night, find naps to be unrefreshing, and typically have significant sleep inertia upon waking in the morning.

Sleep apnea can occur with narcolepsyÂ in up to 33% of patients, but narcolepsy can only be diagnosed after the patient has been adequately treated with CPAP for a sufficient period of time.
