**Limitations of Testing and Interfering Factors**

When evaluating PVR volumes with ultrasonography, there is a false positive rate of 9% for urinary retention. This may be due to many factors, including pelvic masses such as ovarian cysts or uterine leiomyoma with cystic degeneration, ascites, scarring, device miscalibration, improper measuring technique, etc.

No standard perfect calculation for measuring bladder volume exists; different measurement modalities and devices may produce different bladder volumes.

It is critical to do the PVR measurement shortly after a voluntary void. Less than 10 minutes is optimal, but logistical problems often delay measurements for 20 minutes or longer. It is optimal if the patient indicates they need to urinate rather than being forced to void on command to take a measurement.
