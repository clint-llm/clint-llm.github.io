When a transfusion reaction is suspected, the transfusion should be immediately stopped, and the intravenous line should be kept open using appropriate fluids (usually 0.9% saline). A clerical check should be performed by examining the product bag and confirming the patient’s identification. The patient’s vital signs should be monitored and recorded at 15-minute intervals. A post-transfusion blood sample should be drawn and sent to the lab, in addition to sending the bag and tubing if possible. The blood bank generally completes additional testing and clerical checks to rule out an incompatible transfusion.

Treatment of specific transfusion reactions is most often supportive. For example, antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine) can be given for a mild allergic reaction, or an antipyretic can be given for a non-hemolytic febrile transfusion reaction.
