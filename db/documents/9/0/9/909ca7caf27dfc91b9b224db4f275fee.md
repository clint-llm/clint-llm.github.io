Rifampin is a commonly administered antimicrobial agent, and drug resistance in bacteria to it is quite common. Hence, it should be administered along with other antimicrobial agents only in specific infections like tuberculosis or when the drug susceptibility of the organism to rifampin is determined. The interprofessional clinical team must obtain a systematic drug history to prevent significant drug interactions. The patients should be made aware of the common and significant adverse effects and advised to visit the hospital if they notice any such symptoms. Since rifampin's indications include diseases such as TB and leprosy, which require long-term treatment, the interprofessional team needs to educate the patient regarding the importance of administering the drug at the correct dosage and appropriate frequency. Pharmacists are involved in patient education, and social workers can help determine compliance. In an inpatient setting, proper communication between doctor, pharmacist, and nurse ensures dispensing the drug as per the recommended protocols. Complete utilization of the entire interprofessional healthcare team aims to ensure the patient is given the top priority with the best possible outcomes with minimum complications. [Level 5]
