The outcomes in volar carpal instability are severe than dorsal instability. A good outcome is expected after reduction and fixation following acute instability. Over a seven-year follow-up period, 83 percent of patients who underwent therapy within three months of a scapholunate ligament tear stayed symptom-free and sustained scapholunate joint reduction.

As compared to ligament repair, lunotriquetral arthrodesis is associated with higher complication and re-operation rates.

Chronic injuries and neglected fracture-dislocations lead to poor outcomes in terms of arthritis, wrist fusion, and proximal carpectomy.
