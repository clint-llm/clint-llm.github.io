Antenatal Sonogram:

Hyperechoic bowel seen in meconium ileus also presents in the following

- Down syndrome

- Intrauterine growth retardation

- Prematurity

- In utero cytomegalovirus infection

- Intestinal atresia

- Abruptio placenta

- Fetal demise

Bowel dilation seen in MI also presents in the following

- Midgut volvulus

- Congenital bands

- Bowel atresia

- Intestinal duplication

- Internal hernia

- Meconium plug syndrome

- Hirschsprung disease

Non-visualizing gallbladder seenÂ in MI also presents in the following

- Biliary atresia

- Omphalocele

- Diaphragmatic hernia

Sonographic features of fetal bowel obstruction are neither sensitive nor specific for meconium ileus. Therefore, the risk of the fetus of having cystic fibrosis should be a consideration at the time of interpretation.

In infants, MI will require differentiation from the following conditions

- Meconium plug (hard stool covered with mucous that is difficult to pass),

- Hirschsprung's disease

- Jejunoileal atresia

- Volvulus

- Bowel perforation
