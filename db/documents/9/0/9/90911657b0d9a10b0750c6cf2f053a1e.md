Pityriasis alba is a common, benign skin disorder consisting of characteristic round or oval hypopigmented lesions with fine scales and occurring predominantly in children and adolescents. Most patients have a history of atopy, and pityriasis alba may be a minor manifestation of atopic dermatitis. The lesions may initially be mildly erythematous, and over time become hypopigmented. They are most commonly located on the face, arms, and upper trunk and are more noticeable in people with darker skin types. Sun exposure accentuates the lesions. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of pityriasis alba and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.
