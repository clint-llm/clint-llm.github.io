The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy has proposed the following approach, which helps to stratify patients depending upon their probability of having choledocholithiasis. Following predictors are used for stratification:

**Very Strong Predictors**

- Serum bilirubin greater than 4 mg/dL

- The presence of a CBD stone on transabdominal ultrasound

- Clinical features of acute cholangitis

**Strong Predictors**

- Serum bilirubin of 1.8 to 4 mg/dL

- A dilated common bile duct on ultrasound

**Moderate Predictors**

- Age older than 55 years

- Abnormal liver biochemical test other than bilirubin

- Clinical gallstone pancreatitis

- Using the above predictors, patients are stratified as:

**High Risk**

- At least one very strong predictor and/or

- Both strong predictors

**Intermediate Risk**

- One strong predictor and/or

- At least one moderate predictor

**Low Risk**

- No predictors
