Craniosynostosis results from the premature closure of one or more sutures of the skull. Depending on the number of sutures involved, and the range of complications, the effect on the child's neurodevelopmental outcome varies. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of craniosynostosis and explains the role of the interprofessional care team in improving the care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the common presentation of a patient with craniosynostosis and the physical exam findings related to both syndromic and non-syndromic craniosynostosis.
- Outline the most effective imaging studies to confirm the diagnosis of craniosynostosis.
- Describe the treatment and management options available for craniosynostosis.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination and communication amongst the interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by craniosynostosis.
