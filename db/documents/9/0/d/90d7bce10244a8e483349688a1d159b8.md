Laboratory testing is not specific or sensitive in making a diagnosis of chronic cholecystitis. Leukocytosis and abnormal liver function tests may not be present in these patients, unlike the acute disease. However basic laboratory testing in the form of a metabolic panel, liver functions, and complete blood count should be performed. Cardiac testing including EKG and troponins should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.

The diagnostic investigation of choice when chronic cholecystitis is suspected clinically is a right upper quadrant ultrasound. This non-invasive study that is readily available in most facilities can accurately evaluate the gallbladder for a thickenedÂ wall or inflammation. It also aids in the evaluation of gallstones or sludge. Computerized tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast usually reveals cholelithiasis, increased attenuation of bile, and gallbladder wall thickening. The gallbladder itself may appear distended or contracted, however, pericholecystic inflammation and fluid collection are usually absent.
