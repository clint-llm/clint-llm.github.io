Medical conditions mimicking symptoms similar to Non-Hodgkin lymphoma are:

- Hodgkin lymphoma

- Epstein Barr virus infection

- Systemic lupus erythematosus

- Intussusception

- Appendicitis

- Toxoplasmosis

- Metastasis from the primary tumor (e.g., nasopharyngeal carcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma)

- Malignancies or lymphoproliferative disorders like granulocytic sarcoma and multicentric Castleman disease.

- Mycobacterial and other bacterial infections cause benign lymph node infiltration and reactive follicular hyperplasia.

Diseases mentioned above may have localized or generalized lymphadenopathy and should be differentiated from non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Whenever the diagnosis is confusing and unclear, a second opinion from expert hematopathologists should be considered before treatment.  Flow cytometry and cytogenetics can be done, which help in the differentiation of various conditions.
