Overlap syndrome, as the name implies, refers to patients presenting simultaneously with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and is associated with a poor prognosis and a higher burden of disease than either condition alone. David C. Flenley coined the term overlap syndrome in 1985.

Obstructive sleep apnea is a prevalent condition that affects approximately one billion people globally.

COPD is characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms and distal airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, with or without structural pulmonary abnormalities.
