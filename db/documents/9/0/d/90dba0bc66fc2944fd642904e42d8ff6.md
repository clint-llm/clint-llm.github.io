A thorough history and physical is all that is needed to diagnose mosquito bites. Typically, patients endorse the sensation of a bite before the onset of skin findings. The actual bite is painless, especially compared to other insects. Usually, wheals and papules are round and have a central bite mark. However, severe excoriations may obscure physical findings.
