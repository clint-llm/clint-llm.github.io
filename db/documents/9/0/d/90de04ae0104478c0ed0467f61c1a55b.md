Initial evaluation of a suspected lacunar stroke involves brain imaging with a brain CT and MRI. Since small perforating arteries are hard to visualize with CTA and MRA, the diagnosis is made by matching a patient’s clinical features with a small, noncortical infarct seen on CT/MRI. The initial CT/MRI is also useful in ruling out life-threatening conditions such as intracerebral hemorrhage or herniation.

MRIs have been shown to have a higher sensitivity and specificity than CT.

In most cases, mapping a patient’s history of hypertension or diabetes and his/her clinical features with findings of acute ischemia on brain imaging is all that is needed for the diagnosis of lacunar infarcts. However, if the patient is young and has no cerebral risk factors, further investigation may be required to determine if there is an embolic source. Vascular imaging and transcranial Doppler are warranted at the same time as initial CT/MRI to rule out large vessel ischemia.
