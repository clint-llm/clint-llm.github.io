Observations of physiologic variants of the prefrontal association cortex mainly occur in individuals exposed to stressors during the initial stages of growth and development. Studies have demonstrated a negative association between cumulative stress and the size of the PFC. Individuals with greater cumulative life stress tend to have smaller PFC, both in white and gray matter. The introduction of stressful events in the early stages of development impairs cognitive skills such as executive functions and spatial memory. Physiologic variations of the PFC also carry implications in neuropsychiatric disorders. Researchers also observed neuroanatomical differences of the PFC among individuals with genetic conditions such as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.
