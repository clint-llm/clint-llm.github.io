Most viral infections in the oral cavity resolve spontaneously and are managed with supportive therapy. However, severe untreated conditions may lead to significant comorbidity. Recognizing specific high-risk viral organisms that may impact patients' prognoses is vital. For example, HPV and herpes viruses are synergistic in developing oral malignancy.

Specifically, EBV, HHV-8, and CMV are associated with malignant neoplasms, including lymphomas, nasopharyngeal or gastric carcinomas, Kaposi's sarcoma, and Castleman's disease.
