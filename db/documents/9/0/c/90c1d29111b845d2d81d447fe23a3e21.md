Residual volume (RV) is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after maximum forceful expiration. In other words, it is the volume of air that cannot be expelled from the lungs, thus causing the alveoli to remain open at all times. The residual volume remains unchanged regardless of the lung volume at which expiration was started.

The residual volume is an important component of the total lung capacity (TLC) and the functional residual capacity (FRC). TLC is the total volume of the lungs at maximal inspiration which is about 6 L on average, though true values are dependent on the same factors that affect residual volume.
