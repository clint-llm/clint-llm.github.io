Carotid dissection can lead to minor symptoms or more commonly, to severe neurologic deficits and/or death. Prognosis is variable and depends on whether the diagnosis is made before the onset of stroke symptoms. All patients have a very high risk of stroke, intracranial bleeding, and are subjected to anticoagulation which has its set of risks.

Carotid dissection is a rare disease, and itÂ is an extremely difficult diagnosis to make. The presentation can vary from minor symptoms to more severe life-threatening symptoms, as discussed above. Treatment is aimed at minimizing the risk of stroke and the worsening of symptoms.
