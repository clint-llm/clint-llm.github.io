Baker cystÂ is often seen by the primary care provider, internist and nurse practitioner. It is important to get an ultrasound to ensure that there is no other pathology. If the patient is symptomatic, he or she should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon. The majority of patients require no treatment. Various treatments do exist for symptomatic patients but with all of them, recurrence is a possibility. The outcomes are good in most patients as the disorder is benign.
