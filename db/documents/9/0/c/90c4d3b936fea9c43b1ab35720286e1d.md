Traditionally, acetic acid has been used to obtain sheet preparations of the stratum granulosum from the epidermis and oral epithelium of rodents and man.

**Standard Method**

A standard method that was found to be effective is as follows.  Specimens should be immediately processed following surgical excision and washed once in 1X phosphate buffered solution.  Small pieces are typically best for preparation, typically sizes less than 1 mm.  Tissue can then be frozen in optimal cutting temperature medium for cryosection formation, or they can be fixed in formaldehyde or ethanol prior to paraffin embedding, after which they are sliced and placed on slides for further staining or analysis.

**Reconstructed human epidermis**

Models of RHE have are useful for the evaluation of physio-chemical properties of the epidermis,  metabolic studies of pharmaceutical products, epidermal responses to irritants and sensitizers, and assessment of cutaneous irritancy or phototoxicity.in vivo in the epidermis: a proliferating basal layer and differentiating spinous, granular, and cornified layers. Electron microscopy illustrated lamellar bodies, junctions, and keratohyalin granules.
