Appropriately managing patients inflicted with infectious diseases is of utmost importance to the entire healthcare team. As antimicrobial resistance is on the rise, ensuring the use of the proper antibiotic agent during the eradication of infection is essential. The interprofessional healthcare team needs to recognize the importance of targeted drug-susceptible therapy. The pharmacist should work collaboratively with the prescriber to ensure the tetracycline is the appropriate agent for the infection and verify dosing and duration. This approach will significantly benefit the patient and confer a societal benefit.

Along with the clinician and nursing, the pharmacist should provide patient counseling regarding the medication. Nursing will be the front-line contact for the patient and should instruct the patient on how to take the drug and what signs to watch for as it pertains to possible toxicity or adverse reactions. With this interprofessional cooperation, patient outcomes can be optimized while minimizing adverse events. [Level 5]
