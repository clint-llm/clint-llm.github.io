- Bleeding: due to the excellent blood supply to the scalp, lacerations may result in profuse bleeding that may even lead to hemorrhagic shock if not managed promptly.

- Infection: contaminated wounds, bite wounds, and retained foreign bodies pose a higher risk of wound infection.

- Scarring: poor healing outcomes may be related to delayed intervention or patient-related factors such as chronic medical conditions, social habits (smoking, alcohol), and history of keloids.
