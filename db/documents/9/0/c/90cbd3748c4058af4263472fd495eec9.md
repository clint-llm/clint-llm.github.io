The brain, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia all affect the micturition reflex. Afferent pathways from the bladder to the brain include the dorsal system and the spinothalamic tract. Efferent pathways from the brain to the bladder exist for micturition and storage, requiring the bladder and an outlet (bladder neck, urethra, and urethral sphincter). Sympathetic fibers originating from the T11-L2 spinal segments travel in the hypogastric nerve and link to the base of the bladder and urethra through the B3 adrenergic and a1 adrenergic receptor, respectively.

Parasympathetic preganglionic fibers from the S2-S4 spinal segments travel in the pelvic nerves and link to the bladder wall through the M3 muscarinic receptor. Somatic motor nerves from the S2-S4 motor neurons travel in the pudendal nerves and link to the striated muscles of the external urethral sphincter through the nicotinic cholinergic receptor.

When sympathetic postganglionic neurons release noradrenaline (NA), the B3 receptors are stimulated to relax the bladder smooth muscle while the A1 receptors become stimulated to contract the urethral smooth muscle to store urine. When the parasympathetic postganglionic axons release acetylcholine (ACh), the M3 receptors are stimulated to contract the bladder smooth muscle (detrusor). When the somatic axons release ACh, the nicotinic receptors become stimulated to contract the external urethral sphincter. These pathways conjunctively lead to urination.
