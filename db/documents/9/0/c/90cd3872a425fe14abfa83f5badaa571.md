The life support protocols must be initiated for every traumatized patient, even those sustaining a ground-level fall, to rule out associated morbidities that may preclude early definitive care. Clinically, shaft fractures manifest as pain, bruising, swelling, deformity, shortening, and instability around the thigh. In the polytraumatized individual, injuries are frequently masked by more severe or painful injuries; therefore, a complete examination is imperative.

Open fractures of the femoral shaft are exceptionally severe injuries and occur in about 2% of all femoral shaft fractures.

Documentation of neurovascular status is imperative. Although rare, a vascular injury may occur with femoral shaft fractures up to 2% of the time, particularly with gunshots and penetrating trauma.
