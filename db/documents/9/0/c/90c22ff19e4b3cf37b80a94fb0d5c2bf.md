Histopathological examination of a biopsied seborrheic keratosis from a patient suspected to exhibit the sign of Leser-TrelatÂ does not show any significant difference when compared to a seborrheic keratosis in a patient without underlying malignancy. Various subtypes of seborrheic keratoses exist including acanthotic (most common variant), hyperkeratotic, reticulated, clonal and melanoacanthoma. Any of these distinct variations may also become irritated or inflamed, displaying either squamous eddy formation (spindled cells) or lymphocyte infiltration, respectively. There does not appear to be an increased frequency of a specific histopathological variation of seborrheic keratoses that correlates with the sign of Leser-Trelat.
