Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that leads to the destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. Individuals with T1D require life-long insulin replacement with multiple daily insulin injections daily, insulin pump therapy, or the use of an automated insulin delivery system. Without insulin, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) develops and is life-threatening. In addition to insulin therapy, glucose monitoring with (preferably) a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and a blood glucose monitor if CGM is unavailable is recommended. Self-management education and support should include training on monitoring, insulin administration, ketone testing when indicated, nutrition including carbohydrate estimates, physical activity, ways of avoiding and treating hypoglycemia, and use of sick day rules. Psychosocial issues also need to be recognized and addressed. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of T1D. It highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to enhance outcomes.
