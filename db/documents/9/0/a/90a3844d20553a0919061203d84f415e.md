Efforts to prevent recurrence should include the following: teaching children to check socks and shoes before placing them on their feet, wearing gloves if occupational exposure is likely, and strict instructions to avoid handling millipedes are suggested. Home exposure may be more commonly associated with damp areas, and prevention includes the removal of all damp and decaying organic material. In many circumstances, chemical pest control is not needed, but many readily available pesticides are effective in eliminating larger infestations.
