The common causes in acute anemia are hemolysis or hemorrhage, which results in a sudden reduction in RBCs. When the drop is quick, hemoglobin of 7 to 8 g/dL is usually symptomatic since the body has inadequate time to compensate and replace the volume lost. Healthy individuals can tolerate 20% loss of their blood volume without significant symptoms, due to reflex vasospasm and redistribution of blood flow. With greater losses, patients develop the signs and symptoms of hypovolemia. Compensatory mechanisms such as redistribution of blood flow are no longer sufficient to maintain blood pressure, and clinical signs include postural hypotension, altered mental status, cool and/or clammy skin, tachycardia, and hyperventilation. In acute hemorrhage, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels can be normal, owing to concomitant loss of both red cells and plasma, which becomes apparent after patient’s plasma volume is restored, either spontaneously or with intravenous fluids.
