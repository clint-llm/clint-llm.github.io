The ulnar artery is one of theÂ major blood vessels in the upper extremity and is close to the flexor retinaculum. The ulnar artery is a continuation of the brachial artery and lies beneath the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. It lies on top of the flexor retinaculum lateral to the ulnar nerve. The ulnar nerve passes through Guyon's canal, but the artery does not. The ulnar artery supplies the medial aspect of the forearm and forms the superficial palmar arch providing blood to the hand.
