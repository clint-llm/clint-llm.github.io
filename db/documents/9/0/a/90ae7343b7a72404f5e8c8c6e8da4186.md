Team monitoring is not standard practice because of the departmentalized system in healthcare. On the other hand, interprofessional teams require collaboration among different healthcare professionals and should solely rely upon the clinicians, specialists, and other providers. Nursing, allied health (laboratory, pharmacy, etc.), and non-health (administration staff) can create teams with clinicians and specialists and conduct team monitoring via regular "peer review" (as a recommendation) so that each member of the team will get to realize the interconnectedness of the work they do in healthcare and its collective impact to patients. The specific steps in conducting a peer review of the interprofessional team, in the case of laboratory tube collection, for example, must be further studied.
