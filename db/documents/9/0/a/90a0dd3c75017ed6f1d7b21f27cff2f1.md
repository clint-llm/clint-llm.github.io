The semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris muscles comprise the hamstring muscle group.

**Biceps Femoris: Short Head**

- Origin: Lateral lip of the linea aspera

- Insertion: The fibular head and lateral condyle of the tibia

- Function: Knee flexion and lateral rotation of the tibia

- Innervation: Fibular (common peroneal) nerve

- Vascular supply: Perforating branches of the deep femoral artery

**Biceps Femoris: Long Head**

- Origin: Ischial tuberosity

- Insertion: The fibular head and lateral condyle of the tibia

- Function: Knee flexion, lateral rotation of the tibia, and hip extension

- Innervation: Tibial nerve

- Vascular supply: Perforating branches of the deep femoral artery

**Semitendinosus**

- Origin: Lower, medial surface of the ischial tuberosity

- Insertion: Medial tibia (pes anserinus)

- Function: Knee flexion, hip extension, and medial rotation of the tibia (with knee flexion)

- Innervation: Tibial nerve

- Vascular supply: Perforating branches of the deep femoral artery

**Semimembranosus**

- Origin: Ischial tuberosity

- Insertion: Medial tibial condyle

- Function: Knee flexion, hip extension, and medial rotation of the tibia (with knee flexion)

- Innervation: Tibial nerve

- Vascular supply: Perforating branches of the deep femoral artery

Beginning at the pelvis and running posteriorly along the length of the femur, the majority of muscles within the hamstring complex cross both the femoroacetabular and tibiofemoral joints. The short head of the biceps femoris is an exception to this rule as it originates from the lateral lip of the femoral linea aspera, distal to the femoroacetabular joint. For this reason, some argue that the short head of the biceps femoris is not a true hamstring muscle.

Unlike the short head of the biceps femoris, all other hamstring muscles originate from the ischial tuberosity. The proximal, long head of the biceps femoris and semitendinosus muscles are linked by an aponeurosis that extends approximately 7 cm from the ischial tuberosity. The distal hamstrings form the superolateral (biceps femoris) and superomedial (semimembranosus and semitendinosus) borders of the popliteal fossa. The gastrocnemius primarily forms the inferior border of the popliteal fossa.

The hamstring muscle group plays a prominent role in hip extension (posterior movement of the femur) and knee flexion (posterior movement of the tibia and fibula). Concerning the gait cycle, the hamstrings activate at the final 25% of the swing phase generating extension force at the hip and resisting knee extension. The hamstring muscles also play an essential role as a dynamic stabilizer of the knee joint. Operating in tandem with the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), the hamstrings resist anterior translation of the tibia during the heel strike phase of the gait cycle.

The longest muscle in the hamstring group is the semitendinosus, measuring an average of 44.3 cm, followed by the long head of the biceps, which measures an average of 42.0 cm. The other two muscles in the group, the semimembranosus and the short head of the biceps, measure an average of 38.7 cm and 29.7 cm, respectively.
