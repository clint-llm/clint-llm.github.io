When ophthalmia neonatorum is suspected, confirmation of the etiology is warranted. A sample from the eye discharge should be taken and sent for Gram stain and culture in Thayer-Martin media and chocolate agar, especially if N. gonorrhoeae is the possible causal agent; this guarantees that proper treatment is given and thus, ensures the prevention of potential complications which, is essential for a good prognosis and outcome. In Chlamydia trachomatis infection, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct fluorescent antibody staining, and Giemsa-stained epithelial cells from conjunctival scraping can help make the diagnosis. Some authors have recommended nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) from conjunctival swabs when chlamydial ophthalmia is suspected; however, these tests have not Food and Drug Administration approval for the detection of chlamydia in the conjunctiva. For herpetic conjunctivitis, the standard diagnostic test for the isolation of the virus is virus culture and viral DNA detection by PCR.

Patients with signs of systemic infection that look unwell may have spread disease manifesting as meningitis, bacteremia, arthritis, or sepsis; in those cases, additional investigation including blood culture, cerebrospinal fluid for gram stain are warranted.
