As more people participate in water related activities, the incidence of injuries by marine animals have also started to rise. The majority of people injured by marine creatures initially present to the emergency department. However, care of these patients is best done with an interprofessional team that includes an emergency department physician, toxicologist, infectious disease expert and an internist.

Patients should receive tetanus prophylaxis as indicated and antibiotic prophylaxis for most wounds other than those considered minor. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not standardized although general guidelines recommend broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis.

The primary care provider and nurse practitioner play a vital role in educating the public on how to prevent such injuries. Divers across the globe should be aware of the distribution of these fish and their appearance. Aquarium handlers or fishers should avoid handling the fish with their hands or use puncture-proof gloves and be wary that Scorpaenidae fish are still venomous up to 48 hours after death. Individuals who wade in coastal waters may shuffle their feet or clear their path with a walking stick to ward off rather than unsuspectedly confront the toxic fish. Protective footwear and leg guards may also help prevent injury although stonefish spines can penetrate the standard tennis shoe.

For most patients, the outcomes are good if treatment is undertaken promptly.
