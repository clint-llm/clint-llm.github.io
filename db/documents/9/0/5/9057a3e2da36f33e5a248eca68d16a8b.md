Most patients who present for evaluation of a foreign body in the esophagus do so after accidental ingestion of a known object, and the patient has mild symptoms and is in stable condition. The challenges come from patients who are unable or unwilling to provide a history of the object ingested or when it occurred. Examples are infants, children, mentally impaired, psychiatric, and prisoners. Also, the wide range of possible symptoms and clinical presentations, plus the wide range of potential complications, can make this a difficult condition to evaluate and manage. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of esophageal foreign body ingestion and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical etiology of an esophageal foreign body.
- Discuss the pathophysiology of an esophageal foreign body.
- Review the management options available for a patient who presents with an esophageal foreign body.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by foreign bodies lodged in the esophagus.
