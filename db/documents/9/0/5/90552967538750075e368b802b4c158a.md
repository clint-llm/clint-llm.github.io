The exact incidence of IVC thrombosis is difficult to measure due to the wide-ranging presentations that can occur with IVC thrombosis. For those patients diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis, there is a reported incidence of 4-15% of associated IVC thrombosis.  However, the true incidence may be under-represented due to the variability in clinical presentation. Patients diagnosed with pulmonary emboli may ultimately have an inferior vena cava thrombus, but if it is not suspected, there will not be appropriate diagnostic imaging leading to the identification of the thrombus.
