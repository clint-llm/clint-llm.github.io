Acute and chronic endometritis can be differentiated histologically. Acute endometritis is characterized by microabscesses and neutrophil invasion of the superficial endometrial epithelium, glandular lumens, and endometrial cavity.

Chronic endometritis, on the other hand, is characterized by infiltration of ESPCs, micropolyposis (multiple small protrusions, < 1mm), edematous changes in the proliferative phase, and dissociated maturation between the stroma and epithelium known as "out-of-phase" morphology.
