Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is broadly classified based on the histopathology and immune complex deposition as follows:

A) Linear antibody deposition, anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease: it is circulating antibodies IgG directed against an antigen normally present in the GBM and/or alveolar basement membrane, specifically the non-collagenous domain of alpha-3 chain of type IV collagen. It is approximately 10% to 15% of all diffuse crescentic GN. It can be presented as one of the following features:

1. Crescentic glomerulonephritis alone (renal limited variant)

2. or with pulmonary hemorrhage; The combination of glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage referred to as Goodpasture syndrome

3. or associated with the positive anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), sometimes called “dual antibody disease” or “double positive; in which patient has crescentic GN and positive for both ANCA and anti-GBM antibody, some literature showed 10% to 50% of patients with the anti-GBM disease have detectable ANCA (usually recognizing myeloperoxidase [MPO]), and up to 10% of patients with ANCA also have circulating anti-GBM antibodies.

B) Granular immune complex disorder: it can be idiopathic or secondary to the following:

1. Postinfectious GN, especially after a Streptococcus infection

2. Collagen vascular disease

3. Lupus nephritis

4. Henoch-Schönlein purpura – there is immunoglobulin A deposits and associated systemic vasculitis

5. Immunoglobulin A nephropathy without vasculitis

6. Mixed cryoglobulinemia

7. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis

8. Fibrillary glomerulonephritis

9. Idiopathic

C) Pauci-immune disorder: almost 80 to 90% of cases are positive for ANCA.

1. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis [GPA], previously called Wegener granulomatosis

2. Microscopic polyangiitis -MPA

3. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis – EGPA, Churg-Strauss syndrome

4. There are various drugs associated with the GN (renal limited or systemic)

-  Hydralazine

-  Levamisole contaminated cocaine

-  Propylthiouracil and methimazole

-  Allopurinol

-  Sulfasalazine

-  Minocycline

-  Penicillamine

-  Rifampicin

-  Aminoguanidine

-  Sofosbuvir

-  Anti-TNF alfa therapy for rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis

D) Idiopathic pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic GN: with negative anti-GBM antibody and negative ANCA, and it is approximately 5 to 10% of the cases.
