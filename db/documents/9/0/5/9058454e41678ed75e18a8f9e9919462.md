Annular tears are quite common and often associated with low back pain. The diagnosis of annular tear and its correlation to symptoms is not always easy. Many patients with mild annular tears have no symptoms and there are others who present with excruciating low back pain, but with minimal evidence of an annular tear. Thus, a thorough neurological exam is key. The decision to obtain imaging studies depends on the severity of symptoms. However, the treatment of annular tears also requires good clinical judgment. A number of patients do improve with conservative treatment like weight loss, regular exercise, discontinuation of smoking, adopting proper lifting techniques, using safety equipment at work and during sports, and avoiding a sedentary lifestyle.
