Mitomycin use requires a specialized care setting. Management of therapy and potential adverse effects is only possible with adequate facilities and a specialized interprofessional team. Myelosuppression may prove severe and can necessitate dose reductions. Therefore, mitomycin requires an experienced healthcare professional who is knowledgeable in the discipline of chemotherapy. It also requires close cooperation between primary care physicians, oncologists, hematologists, and pharmacists to enhance patient care, improve outcomes and quality of life.

Any practitioner who must give an intravesical treatment requires appropriate training and assessment. This will apply to all MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs attending to the patient. They should demonstrate a focused understanding of underlying malignancy, associated health care concerns, and matters of safety in the handling of these drugs, as well as demonstrating clinical competence related to the drug. Nurses attending the patient should also have specialty oncology experience. An oncological board-certified pharmacist must also monitor dosing and consult with the rest of the team regarding adverse events and potential alternative therapy. Interprofessional teamwork, collaboration, and communication are crucial to successful mitomycin therapy. [Level 5]

Both patients and the practitioner must be educated about mitomycin, its administration, and its adverse effects.
