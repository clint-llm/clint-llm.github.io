Penicillamine can chelate heavy metals such as copper, lead, and mercury and form a soluble complex that is renally excreted in the urine. It also can combine and form disulfide bonds with cysteine resulting in a more soluble compound that facilitates the excretion in urine; this also helps prevent the formation of cystine calculi.

In rheumatoid arthritis, it can depress T cell activity, although its precise mechanism of action remains unknown.

It has a plasma peak time of 1 to 3 hours and a peak plasma concentration of 1 to 2 mg/L for the 250 mg dose. The drug's half-life is 4 to 6 days. More than 80% is protein-bound, and it is excreted in the urine.
