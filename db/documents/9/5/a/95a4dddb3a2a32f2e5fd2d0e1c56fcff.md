Healthcare workers including nurse practitioners who see patients with vision loss or blindness should refer these patients promptly to an ophthalmologist.  Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is the sudden blockage of the central retinal artery, resulting in retinal hypoperfusion, rapidly progressive cellular damage, and vision loss. Retina survival depends on the degree of collateralization and the duration of retinal ischemia. Prompt diagnosis and early treatment to dislodge or lyse the offending embolus or thrombus is crucial to avoid irreversible retinal damage and blindness. The prognosis for these patients depends on the timing of diagnosis and initiation of treatment. Those who are treated promptly do get the sight back but in those in whom there is a delay, there is always some degree of vision loss and in some cases permanent blindness.
