Neglect disorder usually develops due to occlusion of cerebral blood flow, especially the main trunk of a right middle cerebral artery, the primary source of blood supply for the right-sided cerebral cortex. Commonly responsible areas of the right hemisphere are the right posterior parietal cortex with particular involvement of the inferior parietal lobe (IPL) or temporoparietal junction(TPJ). Gaze disturbance and anosognosia usually involve the perisylvian regions of the right hemisphere; however, biased line bisection and extinction are due to the involvement of posterior-inferior damage and the temporoparietal junction involvement.

Less commonly involved areas of the cerebral cortex are the superior temporal cortex and frontal lobe. In damage to subcortical regions, neglect can develop through indirect effects on cortical regions. Predominantly involved part of subcortex in causing neglect disorder is superior longitudinal fasciculus, while basal ganglia, thalamus, and cingulate cortex are least commonly involved.
