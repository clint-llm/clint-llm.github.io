Early diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease has shown to decrease mortality. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are important for survival. In patients where Legionella is suspected, urine antigen testing and sputum culture are recommended. Urine antigen testing has proven to be a quick diagnostic test with a sensitivity of more than 85% and specificity of more than 99%. However, it only tests for Legionella pneumophila serogroup, the most common serogroup to cause infection. Sputum culture takes three to five days to grow; however, this can identify other serotypes or species if present.

**Testing**

Chest X-ray - May show pneumonia with consolidation at the base of the lungs.

**Laboratory Findings**

Expect the following:

- Hypophosphatemia

- Hyponatremia (sodium less than 130 mEq/L) secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone is more common in Legionnaires disease than in most cases of pneumonia that are secondary to other pathogens

- Microscopic hematuria

- Elevated liver enzymes

- Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (greater than 90 mm/h)

- Elevated ferritin levels (greater than 2X normal)

- Elevated C-reactive protein levels (greater than 30 mg/L)

**Severe Disease**

Expect respiratory failure, bilateral pneumonia, pulmonary infiltrates, and the presence of at least two of the following:

- Diastolic blood pressure lower than 60 mm Hg

- Respiratory rate greater than 30/min

- Blood urea nitrogen greater than or equal to 30 mg/dL
