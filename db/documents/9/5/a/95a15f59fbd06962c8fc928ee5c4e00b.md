Approximately 6.2 million people in theÂ United States had clinically manifested heart failure from 2013 to 2016.

International statistics regarding the epidemiology of HF are similar to those of the United States. The incidence increases dramatically with age, and metabolic risk factors along with a sedentary lifestyle are major risk factors. Ischemic cardiomyopathy, along with hypertension, is a major cause of HF in developing countries.
