The buttock is often used for intramuscular injections. The usual concept is that the superolateral portion of the buttock is the safe side, whereas injection of the inferomedial portion of the buttock places the sciatic nerve at risk. A complication of this concept is many people have a fatty elevation on the inferomedial buttock. Using the “upper and outer” quadrant as a guide with this misconception places the sciatic risk in danger. Injection of the sciatic nerve can cause sciatic neuropathy. MRI of the sciatic nerve has been described in pediatric patients.

Experiments in rats have shown that lesions of the L4 and L5 segments that form the sciatic nerve produce inflammatory reactions in the alpha-motor neurons in the ventral horns. The NLRP3 inflammasome is greatly upregulated in the motor neurons during the first three days after injury. This inflammatory reaction greatly inhibits the regeneration of the sciatic nerve. Extracellular ATP is an important modulator in the pro-inflammatory process that increases microgliosis, inhibiting the regeneration of these motor neurons.
