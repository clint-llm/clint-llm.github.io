Management of coronary artery ectasia is fraught with uncertainty because the rarity of CAE prevents large randomized trials comparing different treatment approaches. When CAD coexists, intense primary and secondary risk factor modifications are mandatory. Management of isolated coronary artery ectasia in a case with angina or myocardial ischemia includes ASA, statin, and anti-ischemic medications.  Acute coronary syndromes associated with CAE may require thrombolysis, heparin administration, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors. Thrombus aspiration may be necessary during primary PCI. Percutaneous and surgical interventions are often beneficial for patients with CAE and stenotic lesions where angina persists despite maximal medical therapy. Optimal stent sizing is essential to prevent misplacement and embolization of stents. Many authors recommend chronic anticoagulation; however, no randomized trial demonstrates its benefit in CAE. The anticipated benefit must counterbalance the risk of hemorrhage.

Surgery is rarely done but is sometimes a necessity in patients who have recurring complications. The surgery involves ligation of the proximal and distal segment of the ectatic vessel and replacing it with a bypass graft. There should be no attempt to repair the ectatic vessel as the results are poor.
