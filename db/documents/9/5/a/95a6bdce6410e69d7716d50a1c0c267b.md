**Anesthesia-Related Complications**

- Pain

- Nausea and vomiting

- Damage to teeth

- Sore throat and laryngeal damage

- Anaphylaxis to anesthetic agents

- Cardiovascular collapse

- Respiratory depression

- Aspiration pneumonitis

- Hypothermia

**Intraoperative Complications**

- Bleeding

- Errors in graft contouring

- Iatrogenic bone fracture

- Damage to the neurovascular bundle

**Postoperative Complications**

- Graft fracture (most common complication)

- Infection (second most common complication)

- Hematoma

- Pin migration

- Leg length discrepancy

- Valgus malalignment

- Equinus deformity of the ankle

- Great-toe contracture (flexion contracture of the great toe may require flexor hallucis longus lengthening)

- Motor weakness (attributable primarily to pain)

- Peroneal nerve palsy

- Low hematocrit orÂ hemoglobin levels that require transfusion in the immediate postoperative period

- Delayed non-union

- Growth deformities due to physeal abnormalities or asymmetrical growth

- Inadequate soft-tissue coverage

- Early postoperative wound dehiscence

- Amputation due to failed treatment of the initial source of bone defect or failure of grafting union

- Failure of flap perfusion
