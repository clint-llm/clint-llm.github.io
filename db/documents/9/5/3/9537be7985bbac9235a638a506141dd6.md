Gardner syndrome, FAP, Turcot syndrome, and attenuated forms of familial polyposis are the main phenotypes that are associated with APC gene mutation. Molecular studies show that these four types have an associated mutation on chromosome 5q21. However, unlike the other phenotypes, Gardner syndrome is characterized by polyps in the colon, osteomas, and abnormalities in the retinal epithelium. Both Gardner syndrome and Turcot syndrome may present with skin manifestations, but the former presents more so with epi-dermoid cysts and the latter with cafe-au-lait spots.
