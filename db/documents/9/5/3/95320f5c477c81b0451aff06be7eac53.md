A molar pregnancy is best managed with an interprofessional team that also includes the nurses. Once molar pregnancy is diagnosed and an obstetric/gynecology consultation is obtained, patients are typically admitted to the hospital for surgery. Weekly serum hCG levels are obtained after surgeryÂ until an undetectable level of hCG is reached (usually done in an outpatient setting). Patients with previous molar pregnancy are advised to use reliable contraception to avoid a new pregnancy. It could conflict with weekly serum hCG level testing and make it impossible to determine the occurrence of invasive molar disease. The risk of invasive disease in a complete molar pregnancy is around 15% to 20%, and in a partial molar pregnancy is 1% to 5%.
