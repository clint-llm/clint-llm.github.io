Incidentally found asymptomatic simple hepatics cysts do not require any treatment. However, cysts larger than 4 cm in diameter should be monitored. Follow-up ultrasounds can be performed to monitor the size and stability of the cysts. They are done at 3- and 12-month intervals. If the cyst is stable for 2 to 3 years, there is no need for further ultrasound follow-up.

Regarding symptomatic hepatic cysts, there are three common procedures which can either decrease the cyst size or even remove the cyst altogether. These procedures include percutaneous aspiration, laparoscopic deroofing, and complete cyst excision.

Percutaneous aspiration can be performed on its own or alongside sclerosing agents such as alcohol or minocycline hydrochloride. On its own, percutaneous aspiration does not prevent recurrence. With the help of a sclerosing agent, the recurrence rate is decreased significantly. This method is safe and minimally invasive. Therefore, this approach is generally considered first-line treatment. If percutaneous aspiration is not a viable option or has not provided the patient with the desired outcome, deroofing can be performed laparoscopically. There is a much lower recurrence rate for this method with the downside of higher morbidity. Complete cyst excision or hepatectomy is the last line of treatment options.
