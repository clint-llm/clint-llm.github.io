Managing acetabulum fractures requires an interprofessional team approach, including physical therapists and orthopedic nurses. The emergency department and trauma services should recognize acetabulum fractures in trauma patients and be aware of the associated conditions and morbidity/mortality associated with these fractures.  Stabilization by the trauma services for early surgery (3 to 5 days) improves patient outcomes.  It is vital that all teams involved in the management of patients with acetabulum fractures are aware of the severity of these injuries.

Acetabular fracture treatment and management/rehabilitation require an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, physical and occupational therapists, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results.
