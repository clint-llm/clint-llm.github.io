Tofacitinib is FDA approved for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PA), ulcerative colitis (UC), and polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pcJIA). It is a second-generation selective Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor targeting the JAK1 enzyme. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors pertinent to interprofessional team members in the management of patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PA), ulcerative colitis (UC), and polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pcJIA) that is unresponsive to first-line therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of tofacitinib.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of tofacitinib
- Review the appropriate monitoring for patients receiving tofacitinib
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance tofacitinib use in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PA), ulcerative colitis (UC), and polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pcJIA) and improve outcomes.
