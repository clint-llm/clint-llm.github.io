Germinoma is a chemosensitiveÂ tumor and responds well to platinum-based CT. However, CT is more effective when combined with RT, decreasing the risk of morbidity associated with RT. A recurrence rate of 50% is observed in the patients treated with CT alone. This rate is reduced to 20% when combined treatment is executed.
