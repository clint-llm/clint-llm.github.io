Since rifaximin is poorly absorbed into the systemic blood system and passes through the digestive tract, there is no evidence to suggest there can be an accumulation of toxic levels in the body. There is no antidote to rifaximin. No specific information is available regarding the treatment of overdosage with rifaximin.

However, as per the manufacturer's label, in clinical studies at doses higher than the recommended dose, adverse reactions were similar in subjects who received doses higher than the recommended dosage. However, like in any case of overdose, the clinician should discontinue rifaximin, institute supportive measures, and treat symptomatically.
