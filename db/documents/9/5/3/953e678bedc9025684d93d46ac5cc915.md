All interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and therapists, need to be well-versed in the various study designs utilized to perform medical research. Such knowledge can help delineate strong studies and results from weaker ones, determine the clinical applicability of study results, and enhance patient care through the appropriate application of data-driven research results. Failure to understand study design and the strength of data provided by various types of studies can lead to improper decision-making and negatively impact patient outcomes.
