There is no cure for CVS. Treatment can be divided into three categories: prophylactic, abortive and supportive. Supportive treatment is the mainstay in emergency departments whether or not there has been a diagnosis of CVS. Intravenous fluids and nausea medications such as ondansetron or prochlorperazine are given. Ketorolac is often given for pain. Sometimes sedation with lorazepam or diphenhydramine is effective. Rest and a quiet, dark environment are recommended.

Because some studies have linked migraines to CVS, sumatriptan has been used as an abortive therapy once the diagnosis has been made. Amitriptyline has been tried in low doses for prophylactic therapy. Other medications that have been studied to prevent CVS are cyproheptadine, propranolol, topiramate, and erythromycin. Multiple studies have evaluated these medications with varying results. There is no clear evidence-based medication to use in every episode.

Labs should be ordered to assess hydration status. Other treatments would include correction of dehydration or electrolyte imbalance.

Many times patients present to the emergency department without a clear diagnosis. A thorough history is important to narrow the differential and treatment plan. Providers should have a high index of suspicion when repeated episodes are reported without any cause found. Previous abdominal surgeries without symptom resolution should cause the clinician to consider CVS. When the diagnosis is suspected, referral to a pediatric or adult gastroenterologist should be made.
