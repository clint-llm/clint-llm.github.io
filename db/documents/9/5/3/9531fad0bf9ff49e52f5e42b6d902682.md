While the presence of a granuloma may be easily confirmable with microscopic evaluation of a biopsy specimen using H&E staining, determining the underlying cause may be more challenging.

Histological features of the granuloma may provide clues as to the underlying pathology. The presence of caseating necrosis, for example, is strongly associated with Mycobacteria species. Some pathogens, such as Coccoides species, might be visible microscopically either in a necrotic region or within the macrophages themselves.

Mukhopadhyay et al.Â reviewed 131 resected necrotizing pulmonary granulomas, which were unexplained after the initial histological examination.

Other approaches that can improve diagnostic sensitivity include special stains and molecular testing. Grocott methenamine silver (GMS) and Ziehl-Neelsen stains are frequently used to evaluate granulomas to identify fungi and Mycobacteria, respectively.
