Office-based vergence therapy (OBVT) with home reinforcement is considered the first-line treatment option for symptomatic CI in children. OBVT has demonstrated to be significantly more effective in improving both symptoms and clinical signs than other accepted treatment options, including home-based pencil push-up therapy, home-based computer vergence therapy, base-in prism glasses, or surgery.

OBVT, as documented in the literature, follows a weekly, hour-long office visit practicing 4 to 5 different procedures with a trained therapist. Procedures commonlyÂ used in OBVT include Brock strings, barrel cards, vectograms, Life-Saver free-space fusion cards, and eccentric circles free-space fusion cards. After the visit, a handout is generally provided to the patient with instructions for home reinforcement procedures. Typical home reinforcement includes multiple procedures to be performed at home for 15 minutes per day, 5 times per week.
