Along with mesna administration, providers must monitor urine for signs of hematuria and monitor urine output and hydration status. Few patients often have breakthrough hematuria, even if they are on mesna prophylaxis. If the physician deems mesna administration subtherapeutic as hemorrhagic cystitis is still present, an additional IV bolus or oral tablet may be administered.

Finally, it is essential to monitor patients for signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity or dermatologic toxicity. Reactions associated with mesna are rare; however,Â mesna has the potential to lead to severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic shock.

Perform pregnancy tests for women of reproductive potential before initiating the medicine, as it is often used with other chemotherapeutic treatments.
