Evaluation should include a comprehensive metabolic panel including electrolytes and serum creatinine, creatine phosphokinase level, urinalysis for myoglobinuria, and arterial or venous blood gas to screen for metabolic acidosis. Diagnosis can be made clinically, but supporting lab work is usually consistent with rhabdomyolysis with an elevated CK and acutely declining renal function. The elevated CK can be profound and typically correlates with disease severity. Leukocytosis is common with white blood cell counts ranging from 10,00 to 40,000 mm3 with a left shift. Transaminases may also be mildly elevated. In patients where the diagnosis is less clear, neuroimaging and lumbar puncture may be necessary to exclude structural and infectious diagnosis from the differential. Additional laboratory testing such as a lithium level and screening for drugs of abuse may be helpful in selected cases.
