Eyes allow visualization of the world by receiving and processing the energy of light as it enters the eye. This light interacts with the structures and nerves of the eye to create images. Adjustments via the muscles connected to the lens, ciliary bodies, and muscles that make up the iris are stimulated by several nerves. This is known as the pupillary light reflex. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of the abnormal pupillary light reflex and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with abnormal pupillary reflexes. Primary care providers, optometrists, and nurses should work together to evaluate patients to improve outcomes.
