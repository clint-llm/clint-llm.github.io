The indications for bile duct repair are dependent on the mechanism, temporal recognition, and classification of the bile duct injury. The type of injury and its time of recognition will determine if and when an operation is required.

The other occasions when these techniques come in handy are while performing elective surgeries for gall bladder cancer (requiring resection of hepatic ducts), hepatic resections, or hepatic transplants.

**Bismuth-Strasberg Classification**

This is the most common system used (Type A to E; E1 to E5)

- Type A injuries are a cystic duct stump leak or a leak from a duct of Luschka

- Type B injuries are a transection of an aberrant right hepatic duct without a bile leak

- Type C injuries are a transection of an aberrant right duct with a bile leak

- Type D injuries are a partial common hepatic duct injury with a bile leak

- Type E injuries are a complete transection of a major duct and are further classified into:

- E1: Common hepatic duct transection greater than 2 cm away from the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts
- E2: Common hepatic duct transection less than 2 cm away from the confluence
- E3: Common hepatic duct transection at the confluence but the right and left hepatic ducts are still connected 
- E4: Common hepatic duct transection at the confluence with separation of the right and left hepatic ducts
- E5: Common hepatic duct injury with a concomitant clipped and transected aberrant right hepatic duct

**Timing of Recognition**(determines management)

Intraoperative recognition should typically prompt immediate surgical repair as this confers the best outcomes; however, less than 40% of bile duct injuries are recognized at the index operation. Stewart and Law reviewed bile duct repairs done by specialists and general surgeons and found that only 17% of patients repaired by the general surgeon had a favorable outcome.

- Early postoperative biliary injury recognition (typically within 24 to 48 hours) in a stable patient without signs of sepsis may be repaired immediately.

- Late postoperative recognition should generally be managed by immediate control of the sepsis with delayed reconstruction in about 12 weeks.

The procedure recommended for specific injuries requiring operative repair:

- Accessory duct injury: If the injured duct is less than 3 mm, the duct can be ligated; if greater than 4 mm, it requires operative repair. Larger ducts typically tend to be sectoral ducts and require repair.

- Thermal injury to a major duct: Requires a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (RYHJ)

- Lateral injuries to a major duct without thermal injury (Type D): Primary suture repair over a T-tube

- CHD transections greater than 2 cm away from bifurcation and the injured segment is less than 1 cm long (Type E1): Can consider end to end anastomosis with a T-tube at a different site

- CHD transections less than 2 cm from bifurcation (Type E2-E5): All require RYHJ

- Any CHD transection with an injured segment more than 1 cm long: All require RYHJ
