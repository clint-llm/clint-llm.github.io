The physiologic electrical coupling and synchronization of atria and ventricles are altered whenever a pacing device is implanted. This is less of a concern with temporary pacemakers which are implanted for a shorter duration, but with permanent pacemakers, this physiologic coupling gets impaired and leads to electrical dyssynchrony which effects both AV coordination and VV coordination commonly referred to as AV dyssynchrony and VV dyssynchrony.

AV dyssynchrony results in mistimed atrial contractions which cause back pressure in venous circulation systems that causes congestion (peripheral and pulmonary) as well as loss of atrial contribution leading to decreased cardiac output. Frequently a ventricular beat that is conducted upward to the atrium also gives rise to a similar phenomenon.

VV dyssynchrony leads to mistiming of contraction of opposing ventricular walls, as RV pacing causing left bundle branch block (LBBB) pattern which is associated with asynchronous contraction of the inter-ventricular septum and opposing LV walls. This event often leads to a loss in output of the left ventricle and increases back pressure in the pulmonary circulation.

Hence, AV dyssynchrony and VV dyssynchrony and retrograde conduction of ventricular beats form the pathophysiological basis of this entity.
