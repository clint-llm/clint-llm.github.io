ANP exerts its effects by increasing the amounts of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) circulating in target tissues.

BNP has since become clinically useful in the diagnosis of heart failure. Further, the PARADIGM trial in 2014 compared angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi) with enalapril in patients with heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction.

To further support this theory, we know that poorly controlled hypertension can lead to left ventricular hypertrophy and, ultimately, to heart failure. The heart failure can be with either a preserved or a reduced ejection fraction. Hypertension, itself, can result from sodium retention along with overactivation of RAAS and the sympathetic nervous system.

Studies have also determined that there is an inverse relationship between aldosterone and ANP so that patients with lower ANP levels actually have higher aldosterone levels, and therefore are more likely to be hypertensive.

With these correlations in mind, it stands to reason that a therapy mimicking the actions of ANP would be beneficial in the treatment of hypertension. Unfortunately, ANP has a very short half-life of only 2 to 5 minutes.

A few examples of these synthetic natriuretic peptides are anaritide and carperitide, which are forms of ANP. Carperitide actually received approval for use in Japan in 1995 for the treatment of patients with acute decompensated heart failure.

As it pertains to lipid metabolism, as described above, this is an area of ongoing research. The discoveries that the natriuretic peptides play a role in lipid mobilization within human white adipose tissue, skeletal muscle fat oxidation, and dissipation of energy in brown adipose tissue all point to the fact that the natriuretic peptides are possibly associated with glucose homeostasis, fatty acid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity.
