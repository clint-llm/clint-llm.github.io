Treatment of the aging face has become extremely popular in the United States, with a tenfold increase in cosmetic procedures performed from 1997 to 2010. Botulinum toxin has been the most popular aesthetic procedure performed since 1999, with almost 2 million botulinum injections performed by plastic surgeons alone in the U.S. in 2019, more than twice as many as the next most popular procedure, hyaluronic acid dermal filler.

Interestingly, postmarketing safety surveillance data has shown that botulinum toxin injection to the glabellar area is associated with a clinically significant antidepressant effect in cosmetically motivated patients. This effect was observed in patients seeking injection to treat migraines, blepharospasm, hyperhidrosis, neck pain, and solely for cosmetic enhancement. A proposed mechanism is via modulation of the reciprocal, mutually enforceable, interrelation of facial expression (and therefore muscle tension) and mood. Muscle tension is a common symptom in depression and may also act as a positive reinforcing mechanism. This is the basis of treatment of depression with progressive muscle relaxation. It is proposed that botulinum toxin injection to the glabellar region may decrease depression via a similar pathway.

The practitioner must carefully balance patient expectations, degree of psychosocial distress in light of the specific cosmetic concern, and the possibility of adverse side effects.
