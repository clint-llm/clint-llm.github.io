Timely diagnosis and management of testicular cancers result in excellent prognosis and near-normal life expectancy. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for ER providers and primary care providers to have a low threshold forÂ evaluating testicular symptoms in young patients, with a complete history and physical examination and urgent testicular ultrasound. Based on the results of the ultrasound and level of clinical suspicion, an urgent referral or consultation with a urologist is needed. Once orchiectomy is performed, the patient must be followed by a multi-disciplinary oncology team involving medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and surgical oncologists to discuss staging, adjuvant therapies, and surveillance.
