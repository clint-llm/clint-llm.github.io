Complications include death from eosinophilic meningitis or permanent blindness.

Ocular angiostrongyliasis has been reported in about 1% of all reported case reports. It occurs when the larva enters the anterior or posterior chamber. The exact mechanism of entry into the eye is unclear but has been thought to be secondary to travel along the retinal artery along between the optic nerve and sheath. Usually, only one larva is present, and symptoms include blurred vision, blindness, and pain. Usually, eosinophilic meningitis is also present in these cases.
