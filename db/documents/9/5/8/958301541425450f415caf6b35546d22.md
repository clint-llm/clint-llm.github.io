Preeclampsia and eclampsia account for greater than 50,000 maternal deaths yearly worldwide. Like hypertensive disorders, the incidence of preeclampsia is correlated to ethnicity and race, most prevalent among African-American and Hispanic patients, making up around 26% of maternal death among this population.

There are several risk factors and predeterminants of preeclampsia. These include nulliparity, multi-gestation pregnancy, advanced maternal age greater than 35 years old, in-vitro fertilization or other forms of assisted reproductive technology, maternal comorbidities (chronic hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, thrombophilia, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity with pre-pregnancy BMI greater than 30), family history, history of placental abruption or preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy, or intrauterine fetal growth restriction.
