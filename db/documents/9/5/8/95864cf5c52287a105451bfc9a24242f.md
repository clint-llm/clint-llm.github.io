The acute occlusion of one or multiple large epicardial coronary arteries for more than 20 to 40 minutes can lead to acute myocardial infarction. The occlusion is usually thrombotic and due to the rupture of a plaque formed in the coronary arteries. The occlusion leads to a lack of oxygen in the myocardium, which results in sarcolemmal disruption and myofibril relaxation.
