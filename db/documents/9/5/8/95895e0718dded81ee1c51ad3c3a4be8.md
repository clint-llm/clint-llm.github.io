The objective of treatment is to reverse the rejection episode at the earliest possible time, minimize donor endothelial cell loss,Â and preserve graft function. With the anatomical advantage that corneal transplants are superficial, intensive administration of a topical corticosteroid, such as dexamethasone 0.1%, successfully reverses most endothelial rejection episodes. In most cases in which topical steroid fails to reverse rejection, it is likely to be due to delay in recognition and initiation of treatment resulting in significant donor endothelial cell loss. In others, failure to reverse rejection may be due to the failure of topical steroids to reverse effector components of the allogeneic response.

In respect of additional systemic steroids, a single dose of intravenous methylprednisolone was more effective than oral steroids in patients with endothelial rejection who presented within eight days of onset. The second pulse of intravenous methylprednisolone at 24 or 48 hours gave no benefit compared to a single dose at the initial diagnosis. However, a subsequent randomized trial demonstrated no significant benefit of intravenous methylprednisolone in addition to a topical steroid in respect of graft survival or interval to a subsequent rejection episode within a 2-year follow-up period. In the same study, endothelial rejection was reversed in 33 of 36 patients treated, indicating that steroid-resistant rejection is uncommon. Other studies examining the efficacy of topical or oral cyclosporin administered with intravenous steroids have reported similar outcomes, with irreversible rejection in a small proportion of patients.

The best treatment for cornea graft rejection is treating and preventing an episode of immune-mediated graft rejection. The prevention can be divided into preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors for graft rejection.

**Preoperative**

The aim is to reduce the antigenic difference between the host and donor cornea and minimize the antigenic load of the donor tissue.

**Intraoperative**

The intraoperative factors contributing to graft rejection are decentred graft, suture knots exposed, loose sutures, graft host junction not well opposed, and less expertise in performing the procedure.

**Postoperative**

The postoperative factors important in managing corneal graft rejection are timely and regular follow-up and reducing the host immune response to the donor graft. Timely steroid administration and suture management in decreasing suture-related vascularization and rejection.

**Management**

The management of corneal graft rejection rests on prompt detection and aggressive steroid therapy. It is important to counsel the patient to present immediately if any symptoms of graft rejection like pain, redness, and decreased vision are noticed. It is highly important to know the varied drug options available to manage corneal graft rejection.

**Corticosteroids**

Corticosteroids are the drugs of choice and are considered the gold standard in the management of corneal graft rejection because of their numerous beneficial properties.

**Topical Corticosteroids**

Topical steroids are preferred due to good anterior chamber penetration and effective immunosuppressive properties. The steroid regimen varies from center to center. The commonly followed regimen is hourly for 2-3 days, then 6 times for 15 days, 4/3/2/1 times for 3 months each. Some Ophthalmologists used 2 hourly for 15 days after an hourly regimen for 3 days. An hourly regimen must be followed in acute graft rejection until the signs of reversal are observed or graft rejection is arrested. Topical steroid therapy must be supplemented with intravenous (IV) steroids. Once the IV therapy is complete, oral steroids must be given. The tapering regimen will depend on the response to treatment. The drug of choice can be 1 % prednisolone or 0.1% dexamethasone.

**Systemic Corticosteroids**

The systemic corticosteroids can be administered orally as well as intravenous therapy. It should be supplemented with topical treatment. The oral prednisolone should be initiated in a higher dose than usual dosage of around 60-80 mg daily and then tapered based on the response for 6-8 weeks.

**Intravenous Corticosteroids**

The recommended drug is methylprednisolone (MP). Pulse IV therapy is given with methylprednisolone 500 mg in 150 ml of saline two times per day for 3 days. Pulse IVMP causes transient lymphopenia, which peaks at 4-6 hours and lasts for 48 hours. The anti-inflammatory activity of IVMP lasts for 4-7 days. Another innovative approach of intravitreal triamcinolone acetate administration for chronic graft failure has also been described.

**Cytotoxic Agents**

**Azathioprine**

The most common drug implicated is azathioprine, which inhibits purine synthesis. As this is a phase-specific inhibitor of the cell cycle, the drug is helpful only in the early stages of graft rejection. The dose of azathioprine is 1-2 mg/kg/day orally and is given in combination with topical corticosteroids. The combination prevents the need for systemic steroids and, in turn, reduces steroid-induced side effects. The patient needs to be monitored with complete hemogram and liver function tests. Azathioprine is known to cause side effects like bone marrow suppression, thrombocytopenia, toxicity, and risk of cancer; hence its use is limited in graft rejection.

**Cyclosporin A**

This is an immunosuppressive agent derived from fungus tolypocladium inflatum gans. This agent is also helpful in the early stages of graft rejection.

**Topical Cyclosporin A**

Topical cyclosporine A is used as a 0.5% formulation in high-risk patients. It reduces the incidence of allograft immune-mediated rejection.

**Systemic Cyclosporin A**

This is again implicated for high-risk patients of corneal graft rejection. The recommended dose is 15 mg/kg/day for 2 days later, half dosage for 2 days, and then adjusted to reduce blood levels of 100-200 mg/l for 6 months to prevent or reverse the acute graft rejection episode. The patients should be monitored with liver and renal function tests.

**Combined Corticosteroids and Cyclosporin A Therapy**

This is an effective therapy for treating acute graft rejection and preventing future episodes.

**Newer Immunomodulators**

**Tacrolimus**

This is 100 times more potent than cyclosporine, also called FK-506. Tacrolimus is given in a dose of 0.16 mg/kg/day for preventing immune-mediated allograft rejection. FK-506 is a biodegradable polymer and is also available as an anterior chamber implant that is found to be effective for treating graft rejection.

**Rapamycin**

This drug is considered to be more potent than cyclosporine and tacrolimus. It is lipophilic, has better corneal penetration, and can be used for corneal graft rejection.

**15-Deoxyspergualin (DSG)**

This drug has been reported with many side effects and is still experimental.
