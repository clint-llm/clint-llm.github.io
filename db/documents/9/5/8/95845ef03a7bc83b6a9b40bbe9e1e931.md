Primary hyperparathyroidism is a disorder resulting in excessive, uncontrolled production of parathyroid hormone. It is the third most common endocrine disorder (after diabetes and thyroid disorders). Eighty percent of patients will present with a single adenoma, about fifteen percent will have hyperplasia of all four glands, 2%-4% will have multiple adenomas, and less than 1 percent will have a malignancy.

Rarely primary hyperparathyroidism will be associated with a heritable familial germline mutation syndrome such asÂ multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. In such cases, primary hyperparathyroidism is often the initial clinically identified abnormality and will be found in over 90% of these patients, usually between 20 and 25 years.

Parathyroid carcinoma is relatively rare, constituting <1% of all cases of hyperparathyroidism.

- Parathyroid carcinoma
              
              
- Parathyromatosis

- Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, autosomal dominant inactivating mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor

- Treatment with lithium (may also increase calcium reabsorption in the loop of Henle as well as disrupt calcium feedback mechanisms within parathyroid cells that would typically suppress PTH production

**PTH Independent Causes of Hypercalcemia**

- Malignancy

- Granulomatous diseases

- Hyperthyroidism

- Thiazide therapy

- Vitamin D intoxication

- Milk-alkali syndrome

- Adrenal insufficiency

- Vitamin A intoxication
