Due to the risk for celecoxib to cause new or worsening hypertension, fluid retention in patients with congestive heart failure, renal toxicity, liver toxicity, anaphylactic reactions, and skin changes ranging from a non-severe rash to more severe reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, prescribers need to monitor patients for adverse drug reactions. Prescribers should monitor a patient's blood pressure, renal and liver function and monitor for signs and symptoms of GI bleeding.

Patients taking such medications as lithium or warfarin should have the concentrations of these drugs monitored more carefully as well due to celecoxib's renal toxicity and inhibition of CYP2C9, respectively. Plasma concentrations of celecoxib are not routinely part of the monitoring to determine therapeutic efficacy.
