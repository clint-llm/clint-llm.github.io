When preparing the DLT for use, both the trachea and bronchial cuffs should be inflated to check for leaks and symmetrical cuff inflation. Consider adding water-soluble lubricant to the stylet and insert the stylet into the bronchial side, ensuring that the stylet is not protruding beyond the tube. The connector, which connects DLT to the ventilator circuit should be assembled and ready before intubation. A fiberoptic Bronchoscope should be available to confirm the position of the DLT.

There is a lack of objective guidelines in the proper selection of DLT sizes; 39-Fr and 41-Fr tubes are used for adult males while 35-Fr and 37-Fr DLTs are used for adult females. A properly-sized DLT is one in which the main body of the tube passes without resistance through the glottis and advances easily within the trachea and in which the bronchial component passes into the intended bronchus without difficulty.
