Anterior hip dislocations are usually caused by forceful abduction with external rotation of the thigh and most commonly following a motor vehicle accident or fall. Enormous force is required to dislocate a hip as it is quite stable due to its bony construction and the associated muscular and ligamentous attachments. This activity describes the classification, evaluation, and management of anterior hip dislocations. It also affirms the role of an interprofessional team consisting of the nurse, emergency physician, and an orthopedic practitioner in reducing the dislocation swiftly without surgery, and hence decreasing morbidity in patients with anterior hip dislocation.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical presentation of anterior hip dislocation.
- Describe the detailed evaluation of anterior hip dislocation.
- Outline the management including reduction of dislocation and interventional options for patients with anterior hip dislocation.
- Review the role of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to streamline diagnosis, joint reduction, and/or surgery for patients with anterior hip dislocation.
