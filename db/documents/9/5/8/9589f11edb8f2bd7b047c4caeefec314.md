The most important feature of diagnosis of monoarticular arthritis is to differentiate joint pain from the soft tissue conditions like bursitis or tendinitis that tend to mimic similar symptomology. Timing of symptoms is particularly crucial in this regard. For example, rapid onset of monoarticular pain in seconds or minutes can be signs of trauma, fracture, dislocation/derangement or presence of a loose body in joint. Pain that has onset over several hours to days generally indicates infection or crystal-induced arthritis, whereas pain over days to weeks may be an early sign of chronic conditions like osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.
