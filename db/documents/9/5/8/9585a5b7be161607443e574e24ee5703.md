The anatomical location of rectal cancer is critical as it dictates the surgical approach. Rectal tumors located in the upper and middle third are manageable with procedures sparing the anal sphincter, such as low anterior resection surgery.

During surgical dissection, nerves are at risk of injury leading to sexual dysfunction in men with symptoms of erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction.

In the dissection of the posterior plane of the rectum, rectal dissection is outside the fascia propria. Nerves sit adjacent to this plane of dissection and are easily injured if the surgeon does not take the correct dissection plane. Injury at this location results in purely sympathetic damage as the parasympathetic fibers have not yet joined.

In the anterior dissection of the rectum, the fascia between the rectum and the prostate alongside the seminal vesicles is divided; this is a very narrow space that is difficult to access, resulting in potential damage to mostly parasympathetic fibers causing impotence as the anterior dissection goes deeper into the pelvis.
