Most of the patients (80%) will get a mild form of the disease. The severe form of the disease occurs in about 15% of patients requiring hospitalization and the critical form occurs in about 5% of patients requiring intensive care. The current mortality rate ranges between 2% to 5% of all patientsÂ with COVID-19 but is much higher in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. The major cause of death in COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress (ARDS); however, there is also significant other vital organ involvement, including the cardiovascular system and shock.

In this COVID-19 pandemic, fewer cardiac patients have attended clinics or hospitals due to the fear of contracting the infection. On the contrary, cardiac patients irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 infection need prompt evaluation and management, more so during this pandemic as the resources and workforce are often compromised.

The prognostic significance of cardiovascular disease was amply illustrated in a cohort of 191 patients in which 30% had hypertension and constituted 48% of nonsurvivors, whereas 8% had cardiovascular disease and constituted 13% of nonsurvivors.
