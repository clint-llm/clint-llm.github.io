DDH (developmental dysplasia of the hip ) is a disorder that is due to abnormal development of acetabulum with or without hip dislocation. Early diagnosis and management will prevent long term complications like persistent dislocation and early hip osteoarthritis. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for the early identification of DDH.
- Describe the evaluation of DDH.
- Review the management options available for DDH.
