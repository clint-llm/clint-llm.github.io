Infantile hepatic hemangioma has been noted to have three distinct patterns of involvement: focal, multifocal, or diffuse.

Focal IHH is a single hepatic lesion that is typically asymptomatic and rarely associated with cutaneous IH. Of note, they also stain negative for GLUT-1, unlike other forms of IH, prompting some authors to pose that focal IH likely represents hepatic RICH.

Multifocal IHH is comprised of several distinct lesions in the liver, variably defined in the literature as at least five lesions or up to ten lesions. They also are often asymptomatic, although they are more likely to cause high output heart failure due to arteriovenous or portovenous shunting.

Diffuse IHH, also known as diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis, is marked by significant liver involvement with near complete displacement of the liver parenchyma.

CH may demonstrate three distinct patterns. Tumors may rapidly involute in infancy and are therefore known as rapidly involuting congenital hemangioma (RICH), do not involute and are therefore known as non-involuting congenital hemangioma (NICH), or partially involute and are known as partially involuting congenital hemangioma (PICH).

CH may be asymptomatic or identified on routine screening. When symptomatic, they may cause transient thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, which is distinct from the Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon, an aggressive and life-threatening process exclusively associated with kaposiform hemangioendothelioma and tufted angioma
