There is ample evidence indicating that exercise has many benefits in a healthy pregnant female, both physical and mental. As long as the pregnant female has no adverse effects during the pregnancy, almost any type of exercise can be performed- of course- this does require a common-sense approach and avoidance of activities that can lead to falls. Since pregnant females are routinely followed up by a prenatal nurse or a primary care provider, these professionals are in the ideal position to educate the patient on the benefits of exercise. Also, the pharmacist should use the opportunity to educate pregnant females who visit a retail pharmacy. Exercise can be continued as long as the pregnant female feels no adverse effects. At the end of the day, the pregnant female should be advised to rest with the legs elevated and wear compression stockings regularly.
