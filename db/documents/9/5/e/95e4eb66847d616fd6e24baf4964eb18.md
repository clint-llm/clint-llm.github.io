A lower eyelid laxity examination is usually performed as a part of the preoperative assessment. Some of the useful tools for completing the evaluations include a Snellen chart for visual acuity assessment, Hertel’s exophthalmometer in the evaluation of the axial eye position, a Schirmer test kit for assessment of dry eye syndrome, and slit-lamp ophthalmoscopy to assess different parts of the eye, especially corneal status.
