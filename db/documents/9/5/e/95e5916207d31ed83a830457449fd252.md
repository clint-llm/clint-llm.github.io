The first severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases were noted in the Guangdong province of China in November 2002 as an outbreak of atypical, acute community-acquired pneumonia cases.

The illness spread rapidly from the Guangdong province and Hong Kong globally to over 30 countries in Asia, Europe, and North America.Â SARS mostly affected adults. Children were affected though in lesser numbers and with similar or milder presentations, and no deaths reported.

SARS-CoV, like many other respiratory viruses, is transmitted predominantly person to person by face-to-face contact suggesting a droplet spread mechanism though also by direct contact with fomites or contaminated secretions.
