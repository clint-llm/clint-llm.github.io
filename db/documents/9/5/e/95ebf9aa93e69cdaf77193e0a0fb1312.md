Elastic fibers are not well-differentiated on traditional hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stains of tissue sections. They may appear somewhat refractile on H and E staining, but often cannot be clearly distinguished from collagen fibers and smooth muscle.

A variation of the elastin stain is the Masson trichrome-Verhoeff stain. The elastic tissue remains darkly stained as in the traditional Verhoeff stain, although the Masson stain results in a contrasting stain of muscle fibers and keratin red, while collagen and bone are stained green or blue. The use of this combination staining technique is most applicable for the study of vascular pathologies and can be used to differentiate arterioles, which have two or more elastic lamellae, from veins, which have a singular lamella.

A similar combination technique, known as the Verhoeff-Martius-scarlet-blue trichrome stain, can differentiate between new, mature and aged fibrin by staining them yellow-orange, red and blue, respectively. As with the standard Verhoeff stain, elastic tissue is stained darkly. This procedure is most appropriate for evaluation of connective tissue and vascular disorders, particularly necrotizing vasculitis.
