The veins in the arm are sometimes used in dialysis. In surgery, the surgeon may elect to place an arteriovenous shunt or fistula for patients needing dialysis.

The veins in the upper extremities can also suffer from varicosities, which is a condition where the veins become engorged and enlarged due to venous insufficiency. When the veins exist as varicose veins, an individual can elect to get them removed for cosmetic reasons.
