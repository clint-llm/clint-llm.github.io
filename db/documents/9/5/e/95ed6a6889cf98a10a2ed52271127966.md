Today numerous imaging modalities are used in medicine to evaluate a broad range of benign and malignant entities and how their volume has increased significantly over the past decades.

This modality plays a critical role in the diagnosis and surveillance imaging of superficial as well as deep venous thrombosis, evaluation of vascular malformations, and even in the long-term management of some intravascular devices. This manuscript will focus on the anatomic US appearance of veins, benefits/limitations of this modality, basic physics utilized in the creation of US images, Doppler interrogation, as well as highlight common standard protocols regarding peripheral venous duplex US.
