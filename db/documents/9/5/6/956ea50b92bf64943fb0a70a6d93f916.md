**Cyclosporine**

Cyclosporine intravenous solution is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or polyoxyethylated castor oil. In addition, cyclosporin is contraindicated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis with renal insufficiency, uncontrolled hypertension, or malignancies. Patients with psoriasis who are treated concomitantly with PUVA, UVB therapy, or other immunosuppressants and those receiving coal tar or radiation therapy should not be administered cyclosporin. Cyclosporin eyedrops should not be used topically during an active eye infection.

**Tacrolimus**

Tacrolimus is only contraindicated if a previous hypersensitivity history to the drug or polyxyl 60 hydrogenated castor oil (HCO-60) is found.

**Pimecrolimus**

Pimecrolimus is contraindicated when a patient has hypersensitivity to the drug or excipients.

**Voclosporine**

Voclosporine is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of hypersensitivity to the drug and in patients concomitantly treated with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, including ketoconazole itraconazole, and clarithromycin. This is due to the risk of acute and chronic nephrotoxicity by increasing the plasma concentration of the drug.

Finally, there are some relative contraindications to CNIs that are important to mention, including concurrent malignancies, poorly-controlled hypertension, and infections.
