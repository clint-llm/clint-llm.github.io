Multidisciplinary management is required in patients with NF2 including oncologists, neurologists, neuroradiologists, ophthalmologists, geneticists, and neurosurgeons. For the tumor surveillance, annual brain MRI is recommended. If there is no brain tumor seen on the initial imaging, then MRI can be done every 2 years. If the tumor is seen, then MRI should be done twice in the first year with an annual follow-up after that.

Small asymptomatic vestibular schwannomas can be managed conservatively with MRI follow-up. Surgery is the primary treatment for large symptomatic vestibular schwannomas. Meningiomas are also treated surgically with radiation treatment reserved for non-surgical candidates.

Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is a new systemic immunotherapy for a wide range of tumors. Some studies have shown tumor regression and hearing improvement in NF2 patients treated with bevacizumab.
