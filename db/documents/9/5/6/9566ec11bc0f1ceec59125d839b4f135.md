Women inquire about breast reduction for both physical and psychological reasons. The most common indication for breast reduction is the relief of physical pain and discomfort associated with heavy, pendulous breasts. Patients will complain of chronic back and neck pain, headaches, shoulder pain, deep bra-strap grooves, and rashes beneath both breasts. The breast can become chronically painfulÂ as well. Upper extremity neuropathy and postural changes, along with intertrigo, maceration, irritation, rashes, and other dermatologic manifestations are common. Excessively large breasts can affect daily functioning. This can include difficulty with many forms of exercise and the inability to find properly fitting clothes. The psychological impact of hypermastia is significant, and many patients are embarrassed and self-conscious about their size. Reduction mammaplasty can eliminate or decrease these problems in most instances. Breast reduction may also be indicated to correct asymmetry caused by unilateral hyperplasia or to achieve symmetry after unilateral breast reconstruction.
