Ischial bursitis is a relatively uncommon clinical condition. Although the diagnosis is often unrecognized, it may present in patients of all ages.  Bursitis as whole accounts for less than one percent of total primary care visits. This condition is most common in persons with sedentary careers with constant irritation of the ischial bursa due to prolonged periods sitting on hard surfaces, which gives this condition its colloquial name, “weaver’s bottom.” Weaving as a profession has been around since approximately 6000 BCE, and people have been suffering from this condition for as many years.
