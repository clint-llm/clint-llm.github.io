When a severe adverse event occurs, it must be evaluated. Evaluation of adverse events should include a patient assessment and related causes. A patient who is receiving treatment should be educated about any potential side effects, and the health care provider should be monitoring the patient for such effects. Symptoms reported by the patient should be assessed. Severe adverse events, such as patient injury or death, are reported and evaluated as sentinel events. The agency will assess the event and discuss the outcome and potential alternative treatments that may have been necessary.

As information technology continues to evolve, there are many systems developed to record or even prevent these events.

In the United States, many of our healthcare facilities include electronic event reporting systems to collect the voluntary report of an adverse event, but the rates vary widely among facilities.

The study pertaining to the incidence of adverse events in the hospital can be analyzed by the usage of the Global trigger tool and the Harvard method.

There are various strategies in improving the patient's safety and upraising the quality of the relevant tools of quality assurance, such as Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) and the Root Cause Analysis (RCA).
