Patients taking pimozide should not take neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists. Inhibition of CYP3A4 enzyme by neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists, e.g., aprepitant, could precipitate elevated plasma concentrations of pimozide, which is a CYP3A4 substrate. Drug interaction between pimozide and aprepitant could cause serious or life-threatening reactions, such as QTc prolongation, which is a known adverse reaction of pimozide. Neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists, e.g., aprepitant, is also contraindicated with the following drugs:

- Astemizole

- Cisapride

- Flibanserin

- Lomitapide

- Pimozide

- Terfenadine

- Ivabradine

Do not take neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists if pregnant or planning to get pregnant or breastfeeding. During treatment with neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonist, if a patient is on birth control medication, the patient should use an additional method of birth control to avoid unplanned or unwanted pregnancy.
