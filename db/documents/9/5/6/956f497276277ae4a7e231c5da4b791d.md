Severe chronic small intestinal bacterial overgrowth can result in significant weight loss and severe malnutrition, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Early recognition of SIBO can treat the maldigestion of nutrients and prevent malnourishment. If left untreated, SIBO can lead to intestinal failure.

In patients with underlying liver disease, SIBO is associated with excess ammonia production and precipitate hepatic encephalopathy. SIBO from short bowel syndrome or jejunal bypass can present with D-lactic acidosis (confusion and ataxia from bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates).
