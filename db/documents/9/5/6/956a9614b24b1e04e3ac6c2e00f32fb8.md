Patients with abnormal or depressed left ventricular function are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes primary care providers, cardiovascular nurses, dieticians, and pharmacists. The majority of these patients may have chronic heart failure or ischemic heart disease. The treatment varies depending on the cause, but a low ejection fraction correlates with a poor prognosis in many cases.
