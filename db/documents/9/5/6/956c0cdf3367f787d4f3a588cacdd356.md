Chronic aortic disease is staged A to D. Stage A (at risk) is a patient with no change in hemodynamics of the valve and no symptoms but the presence of at least one risk factor, i.e., bicuspid valve, sclerotic valve, history of rheumatic fever, etc. Stage B (progressive) has mild hemodynamic changes with or without left ventricular dilation of early left ventricular diastolic dysfunction along with the presence of known risk factors, but the patient remains asymptomatic. Stage C1 (asymptomatic severe) includes severe hemodynamic changes on echocardiogram, presence of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, without decrease left ventricular function, and no symptoms in daily life (however, symptoms may be precipitated with exercise stress testing). Stage C2 has the same hemodynamic parameters as C1 with a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (under 50%). Stage D1 (symptomatic severe) is the high gradient (Vmax less than 4m/s) with left diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, and potentially pulmonary hypertension accompanied by angina or heart failure symptoms on exertion. D2 (symptomatic severe) is low flow/gradient with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (Vmax greater than 4m/s), decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (under 50%) and symptoms at rest. D3 (severely symptomatic) is the last stage and characteristically presents with a low gradient with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (aka paradoxical low flow), ejection fraction less than 50% is present, but stroke volume is less than 35mL/min; consequence small left ventricular chamber and restrictive diastolic filling. Stage D3 aortic stenosis also has symptoms at rest.
