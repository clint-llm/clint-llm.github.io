RNAP is the multisubunit enzyme that transcribes template DNA into RNA. While bacteria (prokaryotes) and archaea contain only one RNAP, eukaryotes contain three RNAPs: RNAP I, RNAP II, and RNAP III. Though there are drastic differences between these multisubunit RNAPs, they are also many significant similarities. Clearly related and forming a family, these RNAPs have three highly conserved subunits. Though archaea RNAP is more complex than bacterial RNAP and is more closely related to eukaryotic RNAP II, about 50% of the enzyme is still conserved.

All RNAPs contain a core. This RNA-synthesizing core generates 5’ to 3’ RNA chains by hydrolyzing pyrophosphate from nucleoside triphosphates. Bacterial core RNAP is the simplest, comprised of five subunits: beta, beta prime, two alphas, and omega. Together, the large beta and beta prime subunits form a claw with the reactive magnesium ion.
