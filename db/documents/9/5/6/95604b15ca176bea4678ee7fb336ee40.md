All materials should be obtained before splint application to avoid the premature setup of the plaster/fiberglass. A careful history and physical exam, including a motor, sensory, and neurovascular exams, should be performed before treatment. Open wounds or soft tissue injuries should be addressed during the preparation phase. Depending on the clinical circumstances., wounds may require antibiotics, wound irrigation, debridement, or tissue closure. The patient’s clothing should be covered with a sheet or pad to prevent plaster or fiberglass from being deposited onto them. A bucket of water must be obtained to activate the plaster or fiberglass. The splint materials should be measured to fit the desired area, precut, and laid out in the order of use; specifically, a stockinette should be cut to a size that is 8-10cm longer than necessary to cover the splinted area. The plaster or fiberglass should also be measured and cut to an appropriate length, spanning the entire injured area and then stacked 8-10 sheets thick to ensure adequate strength. Additional layers may be necessary for larger joints or larger body habitus, and similarly, fewer may be required in the setting of pediatric cases. Analgesia may be required either by oral or intravenous (IV) routes. Conscious sedation may be needed for pediatric patients.
