Characteristically, gentamicin reaches high concentrations in the renal cortex and the inner ear. The latter may be injured, leading to auditory and, especially, vestibular dysfunction. The first manifestation of cochlear damage is often high-pitched tinnitus, which may last a few weeks after the gentamicin is interrupted. A high-frequency hearing loss may be present in almost two-thirds of the patients receiving aminoglycosides, including gentamicin, but only a small number complain of hearing impairment.

Although a rare event, the neuromuscular blockade is a serious adverse effect of virtually all aminoglycosides. The known risk factors are concurrent conditions (e.g., myasthenia gravis) or medications (e.g., vecuronium) that interfere with the neuromuscular junction. The blockade probably results from a reduction of presynaptic release of acetylcholine and interference of acetylcholine postsynaptic receptors function, both effects mediated by aminoglycosides. The intravenous administration of calcium can overcome this toxicity.
