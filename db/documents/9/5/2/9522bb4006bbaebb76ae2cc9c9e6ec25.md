There is no indicated antidote to mesna overdose. Mesna administration is usuallyÂ via IV bolus or an oral tablet, and therefore, unlike a drip, it cannot be immediately stopped with the appearance of adverse effects. If a hypersensitivity reaction is present after administration, supportive care with fluid administration is recommended.
