**Wheat or Grain Allergy**

Grain allergies are common. The most commonly studied of them is a wheat allergy, which can be IgE mediated or non-IgE mediated. It causes a wide range of clinical syndromes such as atopic dermatitis exacerbations, exercise-induced anaphylaxis, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), or CD.

IgE-mediated reactions are typical allergic and anaphylactic issues that range from hives and cutaneous discomfort and itch to oropharyngeal edema and cardiovascular collapse. These are commonly encountered in children.

Non-IgE mixed with IgE reactions can present as atopic dermatitis or EoE. Wheat (after egg and milk) is the third cause of atopia in children and also a frequent cause of eosinophils in the esophagus that causes inflammation and reflux-like symptoms that are not responsive to reflux treatments.

**DH**

Pathogenesis is the same as CD with autoantibodies causing the rash and manifestations. This is confirmed with the observation that the treatment of CD also cures DH and also by sub-epidermal deposition of IgA and neutrophilic dermal infiltrate. Like CD, most DH cases have HLA DQ2 and DQ8 haplotypes. Also, there is a strong familial association with the disease. More than 90% of DH cases have small bowel biopsies compatible with gluten sensitivity.
