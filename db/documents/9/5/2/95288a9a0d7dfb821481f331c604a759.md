The vessels supplying the area postrema are large and form a closed network. The path of the vasculature contains capillary loops beneath the ependyma of the ventricle. The arteries reach the area postrema externally, whereas the veins leave the structure internally. The arteries and veins rely on the larger vessels located on the dorsal medulla. There is not much consistency in the anastomoses that connects the vasculature of area postrema to that of the choroidal plexus or the underlying nervous tissue.

Although the central nervous system does not have defined lymphatic channels as those present in the body, the CSF, and interstitial fluid drain into the regional lymph nodes.
