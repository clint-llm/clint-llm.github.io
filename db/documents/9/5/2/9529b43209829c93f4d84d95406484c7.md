It is challenging to report with any precision the frequency of facial nerve trauma in the general population, but when viewed as a subset of facial paralysis as a whole, the epidemiology of traumatic facial palsy becomes easier to describe. In a 2014 study of 1,989 patients with facial nerve palsy, Hohman and Hadlock reported that 5.6% of cases resulted from accidental trauma, but this figure excluded iatrogenic injury; including iatrogenic cases, the figure approached 27%.

A 2009 study published by Junior and colleagues reviewed the charts of 54 patients with facial paralysis and determined that 24% of patients had traumatic etiologies, while a 1996 paper written by Bleicher and colleagues, however, indicated that only 8% of facial paralysis were traumatic in origin.

For higher-volume trauma centers, temporal bone fractures may be the most common cause of traumatic facial palsy; facial paralysis occurs in 7 to 10% of all temporal bone fractures. The pyramidal shape and high density of the temporal bone mean that a significant force is necessary to cause a fracture.
