The patient is usually seated in the upright position on a chair or wheelchair for the duration of the examination to emulate the optimal physiological position for swallowing, with study views made in both the anterior-posterior and lateral views. The field of study is from the oral cavity to the upper esophagus. Fluoroscopic images are recorded on a screen of the patientâ€™s oral intake, allowing the healthcare professional to review the study retrospectively.

The clinician provides a selection of food and drink of different consistencies to chew and swallow under fluoroscopy. The selection of test food is based on the swallowing difficulty being investigated. The varying viscosities used are carefully selected by the speech and language therapist to account for the potential severity of dysphagia posed by the subject, as well as any known anatomic or functional abnormalities. These test foods/liquids are pre-mixed with barium as the contrasting agent, though water-soluble contrast agents such as gastrograffin can also be utilized. With the radio-opaque bolus, images are obtained at different stages of the swallowing process to highlight and analyze the cause of dysphagia.
