Magnesium deficiency is commonly encountered in clinical practice. The key is to find the primary cause. Asymptomatic patients can be managed with supplements prescribed as outpatients. Symptomatic patients need admission and parenteral magnesium. The prognosis for most patients with a reversible cause is excellent.

Clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists must coordinate care to resolve magnesium deficiency rapidly. This often involves the education of the patient and family and a team approach from the health practitioners.
