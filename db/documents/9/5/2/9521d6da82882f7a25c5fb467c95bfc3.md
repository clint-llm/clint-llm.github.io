Branches of the internal carotid artery supply the majority of the visual system. The retina and the extracranial part of the optic nerve receive their blood supply from the ophthalmic artery.

The intracranial part and optic chiasm receive supply by the anterior cerebral, superior hypophyseal, and anterior communicating arteries.

The optic tract is perfused by the posterior communicating and anterior choroidal arteries.

The anterior and posterior choroidal arteries supply the lateral geniculate nucleus.

Both middle and posterior cerebral arteries perfuse otic radiation.

The posterior cerebral artery primarily supplies the primary visual cortex (Brodmann area 17), with watershed areas processing peripheral information.

The optic nerve is one of the ways followed by the glymphatic system to drain a part of theÂ cerebrospinal fluid.

The ophthalmic veins drain the back, top, and bottom of the orbit. Their congestion and, therefore, their inadequate drainage produces retro-ocular headache, heavy and pulsating eyes. They pass through the sphenoid fissure, also known as the upper orbital fissure, and continue into the cavernous sinus.
