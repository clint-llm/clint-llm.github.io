Though the use of IRV does not dictate a specific mode of mechanical ventilation, it is often used as a modification of pressure control mode as this is the most straightforward. In such a case, just as the clinician sets the PEEP and Inspiratory Pressure in conventional pressure control ventilation, in PC-IRV, the clinician sets the low pressure (P-low) and the high pressure (P-high). The clinician must also set the frequency of pressure changes and the proportion of time spent at each level, analogous to respiratory rate and I: E ratio. Whether the proportions are dictated through setting a ratio (2:1, 4:1, 10:1, and so on) or by directly setting the P-high time and P-low time is ventilator dependent.

Inverse ratio ventilation can be significantlyÂ uncomfortable, and patients may need to be heavily sedated or paralyzed to achieve patient-ventilator synchrony. Some IRV modes will allow a patient-driven respiratory cycle to be superimposed on the IRV cycle to increase ventilation and improve the management of dysynchrony.
