Hirschsprung disease (HD) is a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells (GC) at the Meissner's plexus (submucosa) and Auerbach's plexus (muscularis) of the terminal rectum that extends in a variable distance proximally. It is responsible for non-specific symptomatology, including chronic constipation and intestinal obstruction. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of Hirschsprung disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the different methods of histopathological confirmation of Hirschsprung disease.
- Review the appropriate evaluation process for Hirschsprung disease.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for Hirschsprung disease.
- Summarize the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve the outcomes of children with Hirschsprung disease.
