Simulation-based education encompasses a wide variety of training methods for healthcare professionals.  Methods include computer-based virtual environments, high-fidelity mannequins, task trainers, and standardized patients.  This article will focus on using standardized patients (SPs), individuals who have had the training to portray patients, family members, and even colleagues. This modality is widely implemented in simulation throughout the world and for various healthcare providers at all levels of learning. SPs can be useful in a variety of simulation activities, from communication-based scenarios to observed structured clinical exams (OSCEs).

**Recruitment**

SPs recruitment can be from various sources; local theater or acting troupes, theater schools, or even hidden talent in someone who did not know they could act. Individuals who portray nurses often get recruited from pools of retired nurses or other healthcare professionals. Methods of compensation vary widely from SPs considered volunteers to those who receive pay as regular staff or independent contractors.
