Bacteroides fragilis is usually a commensal organism that, when the mucosal barrier becomes disrupted, results in abscess formation and bacteremia. Bacteroides species have involvement in the prolongation of the intrinsic pathway of clotting in human blood.B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron cause the release of significant levels of bradykinin in human plasma, a mechanism that will provide the bacteria with an opportunity to spread by inhibition of clot formation.

Bacteroides fragilis virulence is mostly by toxin production. Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) strains are strains of B. fragilis that secrete an enterotoxin termed the B. fragilis toxin (BFT) and may have a role in inflammatory diarrhea and flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease.

Outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) are vesicles that bud out of the outer membrane of bacteria and are commonly produced by gram-negative bacteria and may play a role in trafficking bacterial biochemicals.
