The first step in the management of SIG is the discontinuation of steroids, if clinically possible.

The three modalities of management of steroid-induced glaucoma are:

- Medical management: medical management of this condition is similar to that of primary open-angle glaucoma. The agents which may be used include beta-blockers, prostaglandin analogs, alpha-2 agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Beta-blockers tend to be the first-line agents in this condition.

- Laser trabeculoplasty: argon laser trabeculoplasty(ALT) and selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) may be considered if medical management is unsuccessful and there is a threat of impending optic nerve damage. It may also be considered in patients experiencing undesirable side effects with antiglaucoma drugs. The disadvantages of laser include that the IOP effect may last several months, and retreatment is usually required.

- Surgical management: surgery is indicated in those patients who fail to respond to medical and laser therapies. It may also be indicated in those patients who may be expected to have further exposure to steroids. The most commonly employed surgical procedure is trabeculectomy; other options include deep sclerectomy, canaloplasty, tube shunt surgeries, or cyclophotocoagulation procedures.
