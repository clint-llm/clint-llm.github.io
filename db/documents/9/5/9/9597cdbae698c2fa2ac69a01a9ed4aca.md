This activity addresses the modalities used in the performance of compressed air work; caissons, tunneling, and commercial diving, and the various modalities used to accomplish this work. This activity outlines the indications, mechanisms employed, the potential complications encountered, adverse effects, and health monitoring of compressed air workers.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the various modalities used during compressed air work. 
- Summarize the appropriate use of each type of compression and decompression modalities and articulate the associated health complications related to each.
- Identify the various techniques employed in compressed air work and how each effect these modalities have on the healthcare of these workers.
- Outline strategies that can improve collaborative working relationships among interprofessional teams to help promote the safe care of compressed air workers.
