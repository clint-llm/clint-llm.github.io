The clinician’s objective is to identify factors that may be contributing to the hand stiffness. A detailed history from the patient should be sought including age, occupation, hand dominance, comorbidities, and drug history. The mechanism of the initial injury is important and will help to guide on-going management. Outline any management for both the initial injury and subsequent hand stiffness.

The hand should be examined thoroughly using a systematic approach. Firstly inspecting, then palpating for any skin changes, swelling, contractures, or deformity. The neurovascular status of the hand should be fully assessed and documented. Range of movement of the wrist, hand, and phalanges should be tested both actively and passively and any tender regions noted.
