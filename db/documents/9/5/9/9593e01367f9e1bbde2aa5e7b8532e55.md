Epinastine is a safe and well-tolerated drug. It is used topically as an eye drop, and it does not cause any systemic side effects.

It is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier, and hence it doesnâ€™t cause any adverse effects related to the central nervous system. There is no diffusion at the central nervous system because of its polarity and cationic charge at the ph of the physiological state.

Epinastine is not teratogenic, even at high doses in the animal model
