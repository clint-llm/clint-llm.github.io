Clozapine is an FDA-approved atypical antipsychotic medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Clozapine is not the first-line drug of choice due to its range of adverse effects, making compliance an issue for many patients. However, it also has some advantages, including lowering the risk of suicide and tardive dyskinesia and fewer relapses. Regarding suicide risk, clozapine has been demonstrated to reduce suicidal behavior even in non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder patients. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of clozapine pertinent for members of the interprofessional team where this agent is indicated.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of clozapine.
- Review the indications for initiating clozapine therapy.
- Describe the adverse effects associated with clozapine.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients receiving therapy with clozapine.
