In 1965, Listgarten provided electron microscopy (EM) data of the invasion of spirochetes in what was previously referred to as necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG) and differentiated between various zones within NUG. The zones are listed in order of increasing depth.

- Bacterial zone

- Neutrophil-rich zone

- Necrotic zone

- Zone of spirochete infiltration

The most superficial bacterial zone contains a variety of bacterial species. The neutrophil-rich zone contains various leukocytes, with the most prominent cell type being the neutrophil. In the next deeper zone, the necrotic zone, an abundance of dead cells and fragmented connective tissue can be found. Up until this final zone, a variety of bacteria species could be found, including spirochetes. However, in the zone of spirochete infiltration, spirochetes are the sole organism present and can be found in the deep, preserved tissue.
