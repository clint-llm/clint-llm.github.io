The blood supply and nerve innervation of the opponens pollicis muscle and the thenar eminence is essential in hand surgery. The knowledge of the blood supply and innervation allows for proper precautions to avoid damage to these structures.

The compression of the median nerve may cause atrophy of the thenar muscles and pain in the first three digits. The median nerve usually gets compressed under the flexor retinaculum forÂ several reasons; this leads to the condition called carpal tunnel syndrome. The last resort in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome is surgery.
