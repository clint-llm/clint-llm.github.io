Catheter ablation, particularly radiofrequency ablation has revolutionized treatment for tachyarrhythmia. It has evolved rapidly over the years and has proven to be first-line therapy for many tachycardias in most of the patients having recurrent symptoms, which limit their productivity and hinder their lifestyle.

Current ablation equipment allows temperature monitoring and temperature control, which is a valuable tool during radiofrequency ablation procedures as it provides important information regarding the adequacy of tissue heating, minimizes the development of coagulum and lesion size. Newer technical modifications, including a larger distal electrode and saline cooling, have helped to minimize impedance rise and allow the creation of larger and deeper lesions.
