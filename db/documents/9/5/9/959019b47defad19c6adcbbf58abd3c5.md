The prognosis of breast cysts varies depending on the etiology of the underlying lesion. If the cyst is a simple breast cyst with no solid componentsÂ which resolves with aspiration, then the cyst is entirely benign. If the cyst has solid components and/or is recurrent after aspiration, then this could reflect an underlying malignancy. While intracystic carcinoma is exceedingly rare, presenting as 0.1% to 1% of all breast malignancies, it must be kept in the differential when evaluating a breast cyst.
