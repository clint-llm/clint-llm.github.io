# Continuing Education Activity

Acral lentiginous melanoma is a subtype of cutaneous malignant melanoma. It is comprised of malignant melanocytes, which can become invasive with time. It is often diagnosed at a later stage than the other forms of cutaneous malignant melanoma and in populations that are at a low risk for UV-induced melanomas, which highlights the need for early screening and detection. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and management of acral lentiginous melanoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of acral lentiginous melanoma.
- Summarize appropriate evaluation of acral lentiginous melanoma.
- Review the management options available for acral lentiginous melanoma.
- Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance early detection of acral lentiginous melanoma and improve outcomes.

# Introduction

Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM), also sometimes referred to as, simply, acral melanoma, is melanoma occurring on the hands and feet (palms, soles, fingers, toes, and nail units). The word acral derives from the Greek word referring to the highest or topmost portion of the limbs (extremities). The same stem word is used for the city of Akron (in Summit County, Ohio, the highest elevation on the Ohio and Erie Canal), and the acropolis (the rocky outcrop in Greece on which the Parthenon sits). Lentiginous refers to the initial origin of these tumors as a macular (flat) brown spot, resembling a benign lentigo.

The term melanoma refers to a malignancy of melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells in the epidermis. Acral melanoma was first separated as a distinct subtype of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) by Arrington et al. in 1977.

# Etiology

Multiple studies proposed stress, or shearing force as a mechanism for the induction of ALMs, as the incidence is higher in the weight-bearing areas of the foot, such as the heel, forefoot, and lateral side of the foot.

# Epidemiology

ALM accounts for 2 to 3% of all new melanomas. The average age of diagnosis for ALM is 62.8 years. The incidence of ALM in all populations increases with age, and a sharp increase is seen in incidence per person year after the age of 80. Similar numbers of males and females are affected; however, females are more commonly diagnosed at an earlier stage than males. ALM has a disproportionately higher incidence in non-white patients compared to other melanoma subtypes.

Although studies from Mexico, Taiwan, and China have found it to be the most common subtype in their populations.

# Pathophysiology

ALM, like mucosal melanomas, is a low mutational burden sub-type of melanoma and does not carry UV-radiation induced mutations that are commonly seen in other CMMs.

In a paper on FISH analysis of ALM, CCND1 gains, MYC gains, and CDKN2A loss were common alterations seen in their cohort. TERT promoter mutations, commonly found in UV-radiation induced melanomas, are not prevalent in ALM; however, other mutations involving the TERT gene including copy gains, translocations, missense, and promoter mutations were found in up to 41% of cases.

# Histopathology

ALM is characterized by a broad radial growth phase in which the melanocytic neoplasm remains in-situ. In this phase, single atypical melanocytes are increased predominately at the dermo-epidermal junction in a lentiginous pattern with a propensity to involve the adnexal structures.

Histopathologic evaluation of acral melanocytic lesions is difficult as the lesions may be subtle and heterogenous microscopically.

# History and Physical

ALM is most commonly an acquired lesion and is associated with a previously existing nevus in less than 11% of cases.

It has been proposed the that classical “ABCDE” approach for melanoma be replaced on acral surfaces with the “CUBED” acronym which stands for colored lesions where any part is a different color, uncertain diagnosis or a lesion without a clear clinical diagnosis, bleeding lesions, enlargement of a lesion, and a delay in healing beyond two months.

The dermoscopic examination is a useful adjunct for pigmented acral lesions to help identify worrisome pigment patterns.

ALM of the nail unit will often present as diffuse pigmentation of the nail, pigmented striping of the nail, or other non-pigmented changes, such as ulceration. The thumb and great toe are the site of subungual ALM in 92% of cases.

# Evaluation

For clinically suspected melanomas, narrow margin excisional biopsy is recommended; however, it is acknowledged in the recommendations that this may be impractical on an acral site.

If the patient is shown to have the local cutaneous disease and is otherwise asymptomatic, imaging studies and other laboratory tests such as blood work are not recommended.

Radiologic assessment to detect occult nodal disease or distant metastases has a high rate of false positives. However, if imaging is obtained, a chest x-ray should be considered as a cost-effective option. Gratuitous imaging may result in unnecessary invasive procedures. The American Academy of Dermatology suggests yearly skin exam and regional lymph node palpation as sufficient to assess for recurrence.

Sentinel lymph node biopsies have high prognostic value in intermediate and thick melanomas. In patients with intermediate thickness melanomas and sentinel lymph node metastases, the melanoma-specific survival (MSS) was 62.1% when sentinel lymph node biopsy and completion lymphadenectomy were performed, but only 41.5% in the observation group who had a completion lymphadenectomy after clinical nodal metastases were identified.

# Treatment / Management

Wide local excisions are the mainstay for ALM. Definitive surgical margin recommendations are based on tumor thickness at the time of biopsy, which is further discussed in the surgical oncology section. Foregoing surgical excision of in-situ lesions when surgery is not practical can be considered.

Off label use of topical imiquimod has been studied; however, the persistence of in-situ lesions, failure to detect invasive lesions due to lack of excision, the progression of lesions, and the high cost of treatment are all potential pitfalls of this treatment. If metastases are detected clinically, by palpation of local lymph node beds, or by sentinel lymph node biopsy, systemic treatment with chemotherapeutic agents, targeted mutational therapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors may be indicated which is further discussed below in the oncology section. Patients who have asymptomatic high stage disease do not show a survival benefit from treatment before symptoms arise.

# Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for ALM is relatively broad. The differential includes other melanocytic neoplasms such as lentigo, congenital acral nevi, and acquired acral nevi. The differential for subungual ALM includes ethnic pigmentation, lentigo, and nevi. Other non-melanocytic lesions that may mimic ALM on the glabrous skin and subungual nail include fungal and bacterial infections, trauma-related hemorrhage (talon noir), terra firma-forme dermatosis, chronic wounds, verrucae, and other skin cancers which may be secondarily pigmented such as squamous cell carcinoma or porocarcinoma.

# Surgical Oncology

Wide local excision is the primary treatment for ALM.

The suggested excision depth is to the fascia or deep adipose, depending on the location. The AAD and AJCC guidelines suggest variable clinical, surgical margins depending on Breslow depth

- In-situ lesions: 0.5 to 1 cm clinical margins

- Breslow depth less than 1 mm: 1 cm clinical margin

- Breslow depth between 1.01 to 2 mm: 1 to 2 cm clinical margin

- Breslow depth greater than 2 mm: 2 cm clinical margin

Large defects on acral surfaces are hard to close primarily and may require skin grafting or flap reconstruction. Primary closure has better functional results, heals faster, leads to fewer patient complications, and has a lower cost.

Subungual melanomas are difficult to resect due to the proximity to the phalanx. The previous gold standard of treatment involved digit amputation.

# Radiation Oncology

Radiation therapy is not commonly viewed as a primary approach to treating these lesions since melanocytes are not highly radiosensitive. However, this treatment has been used for adjuvant treatment, palliation, and for patients with recurrent disease.

# Medical Oncology

Dacarbazine had been the mainstay of metastatic melanoma chemotherapy, until the recent advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors and mutation-driven therapy; however, it never showed a clear survival benefit.

Metastatic ALM has been shown to be less susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitors owing to a poor immune response to the tumor.

While other types of CMM harbor frequent BRAF mutations, ALM rarely has these mutations and is thus less susceptible to the commonly used BRAF/MEK inhibitors. NRAS mutations may cause the resultant tumor to be susceptible to BRAF and MEK inhibitors due to the location of the NRAS upstream of BRAF.

# Staging

Staging for all subtypes of melanoma is the same and based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 8th Edition.

- Stage 1: T1a, T1b, T2a primary lesions with no nodal, regional, or distant metastases

- Stage 2: T2b, T3a, T3b, T4a, T4b primary lesions with no nodal, regional, or distant metastases

- Stage 3: Any primary lesion with regional nodal or in-transit metastases

- Stage 4: Any primary lesion with distant metastases.

# Prognosis

Prognosis in ALM depends on the evaluation of multiple clinicopathologic factors. Disease-specific survival is affected by gender, race, age, Breslow thickness, ulceration, pathologic stage, and sentinel lymph node positivity.

# Complications

Large excisions of ALM, particularly on the hands, can lead to contractures and painful scarring, which can lead to significant morbidity.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Because the causation of ALM cannot be attributed to any specific exposure, avoidance is difficult. Patient education and early detection make the most difference in disease-specific survival. Increased education is necessary for populations who have a low incidence of sun-induced melanoma as they have decreased MSS compared to non-Hispanic White populations and may be less aware of the warning signs of melanoma.

# Pearls and Other Issues

1. Benign acral nevi are more likely to have pigment found in the furrows of the dermatoglyphic lines, as opposed to acral melanomas, which are more likely to have pigment accentuated in the elevated ridges. There is an adage saying "furrows are fine, ridges are risky," referring to the pigment accentuation viewed with magnification or dermoscopy.

2. Dirt on the soles (terra firma-forme dermatosis) can resemble acral nevi, but usually will rub off with an alcohol prep.

3. Tinea nigra, a pigmented fungus found in warm climates, has been mistaken for melanoma, and unnecessary surgeries have been performed on these lesions. A simple KOH-preparation will reveal the hyphae.

4. Talon noir (French for black heel) can resemble acral melanoma. This is simply blood in the stratum corneum from trauma, common from running or other activity. Examination with dermoscopy can often eliminate the need for biopsy.

5. Small incomplete biopsies can be misinterpreted as benign by the pathologist. It is best to sample the entire lesion, when possible. If the lesion is large, then alert the pathologist of the total lesion size on the requisition, to increase suspicion.

6. Shave biopsies are difficult to perform on thick acral skin and often result in samples that are too superficial. Usually, a punch biopsy or excisional biopsy is better.

7. Benign acral nevi can have pagetoid melanocytes (cells that ascend upward through the epidermis as do adenocarcinoma cells in Paget's disease) in one-third of cases, causing a misdiagnosis of acral melanoma. In benign acral nevi, the pagetoid cells are more likely to be limited to the central portion of the lesion, whereas in melanomas, the pagetoid cells are more likely to extend into the margins. Acral nevi have been called MANIAC nevi (melanocytic acral nevus with the intraepidermal ascent of melanocytes).

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

An interprofessional approach is paramount in providing care for patients with ALM. Primary care providers play an important role in patient education and the detection of early changing skin lesions. Once detected, dermatologists are often consulted to confirm the suspicious nature of the lesion and perform the initial biopsies.  Evaluation of the lesional biopsy by a trained dermatopathologist is also necessary as the diagnosis is difficult and requires significant clinicopathologic correlation. Treatment may involve multiple specialties include Mohs surgeons, general surgeons, or orthopedic surgeons for definitive excision of the lesion. If metastases are expected, surgical oncology and hematology/oncology should be consulted to facilitate sentinel lymph node biopsy and consider systemic therapies as warranted.
