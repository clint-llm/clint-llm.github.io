There is no longer any question about the effectiveness of thrombolytic agents for the treatment of several medical disorders, but nurses, pharmacists, and radiologists must be fully aware of their indications and contraindications. For these agents to be effective, not only do they require administration within a certain timeframe, but one also has to ensure that the patient has no condition that contraindicates the therapy. Also, the nurse should educate the patient about the procedure, the need to remain at bed rest for several hours after the procedure, and the need to constantly monitor for bleeding.  Plus, the pharmacist must be familiar with the recent novel anticoagulants and any possible interactions with the thrombolytic drugs. Only through close communication and constant vigilance between the various healthcare professionals can the serious complications of these drugs be prevented.

**Outcomes**

There have been many clinical trials undertaken to determine the effectiveness of thrombolytic agents in patients with acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, acutely ischemic limb, and an embolic stroke. When used to treat acute MI, embolic stroke, and pulmonary embolism, the outcomes are fair to good. The biggest drawback to this therapy is a patient delay in arriving at the emergency room or a delay in diagnosis. These drugs have saved many lives and are cost-effective and reduce hospital stays.
