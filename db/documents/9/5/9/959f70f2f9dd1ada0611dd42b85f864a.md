Phentermine and extended-release (ER) topiramate have been used separately in various ways. Phentermine was first introduced in 1959 as part of an anti-obesity combination drug. Topiramate was discovered in 1979 but was not released for commercial use until 1996. Phentermine on its own has been used for short-term treatment of obesity in combination with exercise and caloric restriction. Topiramate on its own has been used to treat partial-onset or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and as a prophylactic treatment of migraine headaches.

The United States Food and Drug Administration approved the combination of phentermine and topiramate drugs in 2012 to treat obesity. The drugs are to be used in combination with a reduced-calorie diet and exercise program in individuals with an initial body mass index (BMI) over 30 kg/m or in those with a BMI of over 27 kg/m in combination with at least one obesity-related comorbidity.
