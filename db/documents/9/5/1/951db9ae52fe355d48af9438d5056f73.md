The illness is mostly mild and self-limited. Treatment should be symptom-based with antipyretics for the fever, and fluids may be given if there is dehydration. Occasionally oxygen is needed for the treatment of hypoxemia. If bronchospasm is prominent, inhaled beta-agonists and glucocorticoids may be helpful. A chest X-ray may be helpful in the rare cases of pneumonitis, more typically due to cadmium.
