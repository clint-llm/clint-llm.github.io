Amantadine keratopathy is swelling of the cornea secondary to damage of cells responsible for keeping the cornea deturgescent and transparent. Although the damage is irreversible, the swelling usually resolves with discontinuation of the drug. If symptoms that were previously controlled with amantadine therapy worsen with discontinuation, the neurologist and ophthalmologist need to discuss how to optimize the patient's therapy.
