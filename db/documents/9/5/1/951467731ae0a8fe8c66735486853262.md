Pressure ulcers are skin or soft tissue injuries that form due to prolonged pressure exerted over specific areas of the body. They should receive prompt treatment; otherwise, complications associated with these injuries can be fatal. The cornerstone of treatment is to reduce the pressure exerted at the site of the lesion. Treatment options vary according to the stage/grade of the pressure ulcer. This activity involves the etiology, pathophysiology, and histopathology of the pressure ulcers, as well as highlighting evaluation and treatment options based on an interprofessional approach, so that patient care and outcomes are optimal.

**Objectives:**
- Describe different etiological factors that cause pressure ulcers.
-  Identify various medical conditions that lead to pressure ulcers. Explain complications that result from these ulcers.
- Outline treatment options based on grade and complication of pressure ulcer. 
- Explain the importance of coordination and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance optimum patient care and improve patient outcomes.
