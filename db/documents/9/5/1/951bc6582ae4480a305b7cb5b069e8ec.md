The superior sagittal sinus drains the bilateral cerebral hemispheres and serves as the common midline venous structure that receives blood from multiple draining vessels within the cortical hemispheres themselves.The superior sagittal sinus, in particular, also drains the cerebrospinal fluid from the subarachnoid space by way of the arachnoid villi (figure 1). Regarding the draining vessels of the superior sagittal sinus, there are numerous normal variants and the average number of draining vessels ranges from 13 to 19 vessels for each hemisphere of the cortex. This number is generally equal on each side for any given individual. The superior sagittal sinus ultimately drains into the transverse sinus and then into the straight sinus (figure 2)

The most significant draining vessel of the superior sagittal sinus is the vein of Trolard which connects the superficial middle cerebral vein and the superior sagittal sinus. The Rolandic vein, which drains the primary motor and somesthetic sensory cortices of the brain, is another significant tributary of the superior sagittal sinus.
