Edrophonium is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with rapid onset and short duration of action resulting in an increase of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction (NMJ).

Edrophonium was classically used for differentiation of cholinergic crisis from the myasthenic crisis.

Edrophonium is FDA-approved for use in the reversal of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) after a surgical procedure. Nonetheless, neostigmine is preferably utilized instead of edrophonium to reverse non-depolarizing NMBA.

Novel use of edrophonium challenge test for diagnosis of blepharospasm has been suggested. The clinical features of blepharospasm are augmented by edrophonium. However, further research is needed before instituting this test into clinical practice.
