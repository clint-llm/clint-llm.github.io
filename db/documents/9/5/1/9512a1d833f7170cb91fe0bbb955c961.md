Patients presenting to the clinic for routine ocular examination and diagnosed with a refractive error are the primary candidates for contact lenses. The other main indications in the younger age group are keratoconus and recurrent corneal erosion syndrome. The optometrist, contact lens paramedical experts, cornea and contact lens specialists, and the counselor have a crucial role in patient management.

In a patient with contact lens-related complications, the examining cornea specialist plays a vital role in the diagnosis. The nursing staff helps explain the medication required and the need for regular follow-up. The pharmacists help in arranging the required medicines. The patient's visual outcome results from interprofessional communication and coordination among the staff.
