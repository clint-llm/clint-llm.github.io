Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis is a frequently encountered cause of nephrotic syndrome, accounting for 40% of cases in adults and 20% in children.

Several features predict outcome in FSGS, including race (Blacks have worse outcomes), degree of proteinuria, presence of renal insufficiency, histological variant (tip variant had the best outcome and collapsing variant had the worst outcome), degree of IFTA (interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy) and response to treatment with patients attaining partial or complete remission having a better prognosis. Also, patients with primary FSGS did worse than those with adaptive/secondary causes of FSGS.
