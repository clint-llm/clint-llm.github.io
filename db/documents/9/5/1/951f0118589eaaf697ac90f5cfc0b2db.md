Asymptomatic patients with CMI are managed conservatively, with smoking cessation and antiplatelet therapy. These patients have a five-year mortality of 40%, with the majority of deaths attributed to myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death.

**Indications for Surgery**

- Signs of peritonitis on physical exam

- Massive lower GI hemorrhage

- Ongoing signs of abdominal pain, fever, or  sepsis

- Symptoms that have persisted for more than 14 to 21 days

- Chronic malabsorption leading to protein-losing colopathy

- Colonoscopic evidence of segmental colitis with frank ulceration

- Presence of an ischemic stricture and abdominal symptoms

Open revascularization is accomplished via antegrade inflow (aortomesenteric or aortoceliac bypass) or retrograde inflow (from the iliac artery), with either a vein or prosthetic conduit. Endovascular revascularization has surpassed open revascularization as the preferred initial treatment as it is minimally invasive with few perioperative complications. The occluded vessels are accessed via the femoral artery, and blood flow is reconstituted by balloon angioplasty followed by stent placement.

Nutritional status is an important preoperative assessment as patients are often malnourished at the time of diagnosis; total parenteral nutrition may be necessary both pre- and postoperatively. The optimal revascularization approach depends heavily on the anatomy and preoperative condition of the patient.

**Surgical Complications**

Because these patients have diffuse atherosclerosis, they are prone to myocardial infarction during and after surgery. Thus, prior to any elective surgery, the patient must be well hydrated and the medical condition optimized. Recovery is best done in the intensive care unit.

A very common complication in the postsurgical period is renal failure, which can be permanent. Thus, the patient must be seen by the nephrologist prior to surgery. Hydration is the key to preventing renal dysfunction.
