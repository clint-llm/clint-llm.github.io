Before performing any regional anesthetic technique, a review of the patient’s past medical and surgical history should be performed. The patient’s coagulation status should be ascertained, and knowledge about using any potential anticoagulants should be. A discussion should be had with the patient regarding the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure. The patient should express understanding and consent to undergo the block.

The patient should have intravenous access and be hooked up to American Society of Anesthesiology standard monitors, including blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and electrocardiography. If done while the patient is awake, anxiolysis with midazolam or another agent may be needed, as well as a local anesthetic for skin and subcutaneous infiltration.

As mentioned previously, a universal protocol or time-out should be performed before beginning, where the patient’s name, date of birth, site, and laterality of the block and/or surgery are verified with the proceduralist, patient, and a nurse or second healthcare provider. Only when this is done, and all agree, should one proceed with the block.
