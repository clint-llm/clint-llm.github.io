There is no specific treatment for MERRF, similar to other mitochondrial disorders. This condition cannot be cured. Multiple therapeutic agents are tried to decrease the decrease progression with variable results. These therapeutic agents include coenzyme Q10 (CoQ), vitamin B-complex supplementation, and L-carnitine.

The symptomatic management of the complications is the cornerstone in patients with MERRF. Antiepileptic drugs are given for myoclonic seizures and epilepsy. Although sodium valproate is typically the recommended drug for myoclonic epilepsies, it should be used with caution in mitochondrial diseases as it inhibits carnitine uptake and may precipitate liver failure. Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and phenytoin may worsen the myoclonic episodes. No head-to-head clinical drug trials are available for the treatment of epilepsy in patients with MERRF, but some authors recommend levetiracetam, topiramate, clonazepam, or zonisamide.
