The diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis is made by the presence of characteristic clinical features, histopathology, direct immunofluorescence testing, and serology.

Direct immunofluorescence samples are best taken from the perilesional skin, as characteristic changes may be lost in lesional tissue. The diagnostic finding is that of deposition of IgA in the papillary dermis in a granular or fibrillar pattern. The latter has been particularly associated with dermatitis herpetiformis in Asian patients. Complement 3 also may be found in association with the IgA deposits.
