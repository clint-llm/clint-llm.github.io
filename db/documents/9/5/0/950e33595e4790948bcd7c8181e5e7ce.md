Local reactions such as pain, swelling, and rash are the most common adverse effects following cefotaxime administration. Like other cephalosporins, cefotaxime does not cause disulfiram-like reactions. Cefotaxime used concurrently with nephrotoxic agents may promote nephrotoxic effects on the kidney, and such use requires caution. Patients with hypersensitivity to the cephalosporin or penicillin group may result in an anaphylactic reaction and are manageable with epinephrine, antihistamines, vasopressors, or corticosteroids.
