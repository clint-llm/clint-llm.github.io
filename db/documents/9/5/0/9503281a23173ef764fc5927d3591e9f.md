Cholesterol screening is an integral part of primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD. It can detect a vulnerable population that may be asymptomatic but with a high risk of ASCVD due to genetic predispositions. Additionally, it can detect cholesterol elevations secondary to other diseases, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and HIV infection, or due to drug usage, such as oral contraceptive drugs and others.

Occasionally, when screening for cardiovascular disease by cholesterol test, the result might reveal low or even untraceable levels of LDL-C. When the LDL is < 80 mg/dL, hypobetalipoproteinemia might be suspected, whereas an undetected level of LDL signifies abetalipoproteinemia.
