Regardless of maternal age, all women should be given information regarding an option to pursue aneuploidy screening and follow-up diagnostic testing. Women should discuss these options with their providers in order to decide the best test for them. Factors affecting the choice of screening include, but are not limited to, the motherâ€™s desire for prenatal information, previous pregnancies, family history, gestational age at the first visit, cost, and desire to pursue follow-up pregnancy care or termination in the case of an abnormal diagnostic test.

Individual screening procedures are dependent upon the gestational age of the fetus and the type of screening being done. The earliest genetic screen is carrier screening, which ideally would be done preconception, but is also offered prenatally. Cell-free fetal DNA can be reliably detected after 10 weeks of gestation.

There are several options for first-trimester screening. Maternal serum analytes can be measured alone or in combination with a nuchal translucency measurement. Maternal serum markers measured in the first trimester are PAPP-A and free beta-hCG. Nuchal tissue thickness is measured in a lateral view using the caliper function of the ultrasound (US) machine.

Second-trimester serum screening options are the triple, quadruple screen, and penta screen. In addition, there are combinations of first and second-trimester screening that include the integrated screen, the stepwise screen, and the contingent screen. The triple screen measures hCG, MSAFP, and unconjugated estriol.
