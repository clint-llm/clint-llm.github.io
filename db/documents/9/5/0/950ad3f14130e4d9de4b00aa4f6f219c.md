The main function of the adductor pollicis is to adduct the thumb. Because of the altered plane of the thumb in relation to the palm and other digits, adduction, in this case, refers to bringing the thumb into a position of opposition at the center of the palm.Â  Additionally, the adductor pollicis can bring the thumb alongside the palm and index finger.

The ability to adduct the thumb is critical for hand dexterity. Pinching and gripping are the two principal movements that necessitate that the adduction processes of the thumb be intact.
