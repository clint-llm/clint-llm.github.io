Galactokinase deficiency or galactosemia type II is a rare inborn error of galactose metabolism. Galactosemia type II is rarer and more insidious than other galactosemia types and results in the formation of nuclear cataracts without provoking intolerance symptoms. Early recognization and dietary restrictions are important to prevent long term complications. This article reviews the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of galactokinase deficiency and highlights the role of an inter-professional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of galactokinase deficiency.
- Outline the typical clinical features that are part of the evaluation of a patient with galactokinase deficiency.
- Outline the management options available for galactokinase deficiency patients.
- Discuss the importance of collaboration and coordination among the inter-professional treating team to enhance patient care outcomes in galactokinase deficiency patients.
