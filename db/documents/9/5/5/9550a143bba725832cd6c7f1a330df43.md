Physical therapy following coronoid fracture fixation is usually surgeon dependent and is variable. The elbow is typically immobilized initially in a position of 90 degrees of flexion. In cases of associated lateral instability, the forearm often gets placed in a pronated position to increase stability and protect ligamentous repair or reconstruction.Â  Immobilization in supination is the recommended approach for cases with involved medial ligament injuries.
