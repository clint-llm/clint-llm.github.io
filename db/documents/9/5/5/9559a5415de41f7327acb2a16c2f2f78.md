The Watanabe classification is used for discoid meniscus.

A: complete. The complete type has a disc-shaped meniscus that completely covers the lateral tibial plateau. It has a normal posterior meniscotibial attachments.

B: incomplete. The incomplete type covers less than 80% of the lateral tibial plateau.

C: Wrisberg variant. The Wrisberg type has a more normal shape compared to the incomplete or complete type of discoid meniscus. The normal posterior meniscal attachment (coronary ligament) is missing, and only the Wrisberg ligament remains as a connection to the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus, making it an unstable variant.
