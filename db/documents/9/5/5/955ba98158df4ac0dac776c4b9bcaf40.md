Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is not FDA-approved to treat any medical condition. However, it is widely available over-the-counter as a dietary supplement and recommended by primary care physicians and specialists alike. Diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, fibromyalgia, migraine, diabetes, cancer, mitochondrial diseases, muscular diseases, and heart failure are associated with decreased circulating levels of CoQ10.

A recently published systematic review showed that supplementation with CoQ10, in addition to standard therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure, is associated with symptom reduction and reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events.

Supplementation has shown promising results in improving endothelial function in several subsets of patients. CoQ10 can improve endothelial function in patients with ischemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction heart failure.

There is also some evidence that, when combined with selenium, CoQ10 supplementation in healthy elderly patients and elderly patients with diabetes, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease, may decrease cardiovascular mortality risk.

CoQ10 has shown the potential to decrease pain, fatigue, and morning tiredness compared to placebo in patients with fibromyalgia.

Supplementation with CoQ10 in men with Peyronie disease may decrease penile plaque size, reduce penile curvature, and improve erectile function.

Statin drugs, of note, block the production of an intermediate in the mevalonate pathway, a biochemical pathway that leads to the production of CoQ10.

Although most studies have used patients with preexisting medical conditions, one study of healthy participants did show that oral supplementation improved subjective fatigue and physical performance during bicycle exercise routines.

CoQ10 has also shown promise in migraine prophylaxis. A cohort study of 1550 children and adolescents with headaches found that this population has low CoQ10 levels.

Interestingly, CoQ10 levels may be decreased in those with acute influenza infection.

When supplemented alongside standard psychiatric medical therapy, CoQ10 appears to lessen symptoms of depression in patients with bipolar disorder.

In patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, supplementation may improve fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, and total testosterone levels.
