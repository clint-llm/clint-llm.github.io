The differential diagnosis of Edwards syndrome is relatively wide. It includes the following.

- Fetal akinesia sequence (Pena-Shokeir syndrome type I), is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by facial anomalies, including micrognathia, multiple joint contractures, intrauterine growth restriction, polyhydramnios, and lung hypoplasia.

- Patau syndrome (trisomy 13)

- Distal arthrogryposis type I with joint contractures

- CHARGE syndrome (coloboma, heart malformations, choanal atresia, retardation of growth, genital and ear abnormalities)

- VACTERL association (vertebral defects, anal atresia, cardiovascular defects, tracheoesophageal fistula, esophageal atresia, renal anomalies, and limb defects)
