The neural crest cells are important in the development of anterior segment structures.

The neural crest cells migrate between surface ectoderm and lens vesicle in three waves:

- The first wave gives rise to the trabecular meshwork and the corneal endothelium.

- The second wave gives rise to the keratocytes, and

- The third wave is the precursor to iris stroma.

By the 7th month of gestation, the anterior segment structures form, the iris insertion recedes back, exposing the trabecular meshwork, and aqueous drainage starts.

This impedes the aqueous flow and causes raised intraocular pressure (IOP).

Apart from various environmental and stochastic factors, the role of genetics (PAX6) has also been implicated in anterior segment dysgenesis.

The abnormalities of the third wave result in Axenfeld and Rieger's anomaly.
