Cranial nerve III is divided into upper and lower divisions, with the upper division innervating the superior rectus as well as the levator palpebrae superioris, and the lower division innervating the medial rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique. The superior oblique is innervated by cranial nerve IV (trochlear), while the lateral rectus is innervated by cranial nerve VI (abducens).
