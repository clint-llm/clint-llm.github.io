Oxygen transport is the primary means by which the circulatory system perfuses tissue. Oxygen gets carried in the body in two major forms: bound to hemoglobin and dissolved. Hemoglobin is the major oxygen carrier in the body. The formula for the oxygen content of blood is as follows:

- CaO2 = 1.34 x [Hgb] x (SaO2 / 100) + 0.003 x PaO2

- CaO2 = oxygen content in blood

- [Hb] = hemoglobin concentration

- SaO2 = percentage of heme groups that are bound to oxygen

- PaO2 = Partial pressure of oxygen

Four subunits comprise hemoglobin, each containing a heme-moiety that binds to iron. One molecule of O2 can bind to each iron atom of the heme group; therefore, each hemoglobin group can bind to four molecules of O2.
