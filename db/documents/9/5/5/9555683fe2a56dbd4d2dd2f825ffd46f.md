There is no useful screening test for the detection of testicular cancer. Hence, the young population needs to be aware of the importance ofÂ self-examination. Early detection of the disease has an excellent prognosis. Therefore, self-examination should be encouraged in the patient with a positive family history of testicular cancer or a history of cryptorchidism.

Sperm banking should be discussed in all patients of reproductive age. The discussion should take place before the patient undergoes any procedure that may compromise fertility, including orchiectomy, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. If the patient desires sperm banking, it may be performed before or after surgery, but must be completed before radiation therapy or chemotherapy.
