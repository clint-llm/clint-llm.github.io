The carotid body is an extremely vascular organ and receives vascular supply via the internal and external carotid arteries. Two types of capillary beds are responsible for the perfusion of the organ. Type I has capillaries that are large in diameter, fenestrated, and come in close contact with type I cells. The second type of capillary bed has vessels that are narrow, not fenestrated, surrounded by pericytes, and do not make close contact with type I or glomus cells. Blood exits the carotid body through the internal and external jugular veins.
