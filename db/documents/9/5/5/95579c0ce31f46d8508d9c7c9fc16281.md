Successful repair of the fractured bone(s) can lead to excellent recoveries with a good long-term prognosis. Some cases require fusion of the C2 and C3 vertebrae. Researchers studied fusion surgery performed via the posterior approach; this method demonstrated excellent results in 3-part fractures of the axis.

In another study of over 30 people with a hangman’s fracture, researchers found that 85 percent of patients with a hangman's fracture experienced a full recovery within a year.
