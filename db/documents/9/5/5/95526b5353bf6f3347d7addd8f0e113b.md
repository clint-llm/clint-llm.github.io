At a molecular level, the etiopathogenesis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome broadly divides into

- 
**Damage Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP)**

- **Pathogen Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP**)

Although the list is not all-inclusive, some common etiologies from a clinical perspective include

**Damage Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP)**

- Burns

- Trauma

- Surgical procedure-related trauma

- Acute aspiration

- Acute pancreatitis

- Substance abuse and related intoxications

- Acute end-organ ischemia

- Acute exacerbation of autoimmune vasculitis

- Medication adverse reaction

- Intestinal ischemia and perforation

- Hematologic malignancy

- Erythema multiforme

**Pathogen Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP)**

- Bacterial infection

- Viral syndrome-like influenza

- Disseminated fungal infection in immunosuppressed

- Toxic shock syndrome derived from both exotoxins and endotoxins

PAMP can also beÂ classified based on the location and extent of dissemination of infection, ranging from localized organ-specific infection to disseminated bacteremia and sepsis.
