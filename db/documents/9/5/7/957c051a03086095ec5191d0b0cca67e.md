Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is endemic to southern China, other parts of Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa. The rate varies from a minuscule value of less than 1 per 100,000 individuals in non-endemic areas to a high of 25 to 50 cases per 100,000 males and 15 to 20 cases per 100,000 individuals in females in endemic regions.
