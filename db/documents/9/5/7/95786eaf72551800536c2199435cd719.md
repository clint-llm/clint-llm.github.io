**Arterial Blood Supply**

Each section of the internal capsule receives vascular supply from perforating branches of the main cerebral arteries. These include the anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, anterior choroidal artery, and internal carotid artery.Â The superior levels of the anterior limb, genu, and posterior limb get their supply from perforating arteries of the middle cerebral artery. The inferior levels of the anterior limb obtain their blood supply from the Heubner artery and perforating arteries of the anterior cerebral artery. The inferior levels of the genu get supplied by perforating arteries of the internal carotid artery and proximal perforating arteries of the anterior choroidal artery. Perforating arteries of the anterior choroidal artery supply the inferior levels of the posterior limb. The retrolenticular limb and sublenticular limb of the internal capsule are vascularized primarily by distal perforating arteries of the anterior choroidal artery.

**Venous Blood Supply**

The striate veins drain the corpus striatum and internal capsule. The superiorstriate veins run dorsally and drain into the tributaries of the internal cerebra veins. The putamen, caudate nucleus, and internal capsule are all drained by the inferior striate veins. These inferior striate veins converge to exit through the anterior-perforated substance and join the deep middle cerebral and basal veins.
