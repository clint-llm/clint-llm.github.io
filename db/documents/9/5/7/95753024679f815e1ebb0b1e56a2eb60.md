Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for calciphylaxis in a patient with end-stage renal disease who presents with painful skin lesions. Calciphylaxis is a devastating disease with high rates of morbidity and mortality. A definitive diagnosis for calciphylaxis is made with a skin biopsy which predominantly shows arteriolar medial layer calcification, although the diagnosis can at times be made on clinical grounds. Some medications have been implicated as risk factors for calciphylaxis, and a patient's medication list must be carefully scrutinized if calciphylaxis develops. Treatment of calciphylaxis requires a multidisciplinary approach.
