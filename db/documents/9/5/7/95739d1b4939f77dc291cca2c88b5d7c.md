The serratus anterior muscle originates from the anterior aspect of ribs 1 through 7-10 and inserts on the medial border of the scapula. It consists of 7Â to 10 serrated tendinous projections that originate on each rib and is innervated by the long thoracic nerve.

The SAPB targets the lateral cutaneous branches of the thoracic intercostal nerves, which arise from the anterior rami of the thoracic spinal nerves and run in a neurovascular bundle immediately inferior to each rib. At the midaxillary line, the lateral cutaneous branches of the thoracic intercostal nerve traverse through the internal intercostal, external intercostal, and serratus anterior muscles innervating the musculature of the lateral thorax.
