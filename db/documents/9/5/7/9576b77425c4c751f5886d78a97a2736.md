In a small number of people, there may be an accessory branch of the phrenic nerve. An accessory phrenic nerve will follow the true phrenic nerve down its course to the diaphragm but often terminates at the pericardium. This variation will be located laterally and posteriorly to the main phrenic nerve and anteriorly to the subclavian vein. This variant is mostly C5 contribution and will branch off proximally at the root of the neck to provide motor innervation to the subclavius muscle.
