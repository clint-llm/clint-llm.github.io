Diagnosing and managing patients with esotropia is not a one-time affair. Detailed repeated examinations, with close observation for fixation patterns for each eye, retinoscopy, orthoptics evaluation, development of any eye dominance, refractive error correction, amblyopia therapy, orthoptics exercises, and planning a surgical intervention if needed at the correct time need efforts from a well-coordinated team to ensure good outcomes.

The physicians and other clinicians, health care professionals, orthoptists, and optometrists need to be well versed with the diagnosis and provide timely referrals for management of these patients to the ophthalmologists. Pediatric neurologists have an equally vital role in ruling out any underlying associations. The psychological issues, if associated, should not be ignored and need to be addressed well in time to ensure the overall sound quality of life for these patients.
