Normal findings would include imaging consistent with normal hepatic and splenic uptake by their respective reticuloendothelial systems. The distribution of colloid in the liver and spleen would not be markedly different on imaging. Critical findings would include decreased uptake by the liver’s Kupffer cells paired with increased uptake by the spleen, indicating functional damage to the liver’s reticuloendothelial system. In patients with splenic infarction secondary to cirrhosis and portal hypertension, liver/spleen scan may often show areas of diminished uptake of Tc-99m in the spleen.
