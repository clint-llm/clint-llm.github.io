Depending on the severity of the hypodontia, treatment may be relatively straightforward to extensive. Early diagnosis can provide optimal management for the patient by initiating treatment planning and treatment at an early age. Detecting a developmental disturbance early can reduce complications later in life and decrease the complexity of treatment.

Treatment of missing teeth should be performed by licensed dental professionals. The least invasive treatment option for missing teeth is a removable prosthesis. This treatment modality rarely involves the augmentation or removal of tooth structure. There are several restorative options for a single missing tooth, ranging from no treatment to fixed prosthodontics to implants requiring surgery. With multiple missing teeth, treatment modalities can become more complicated and invasive.

Hyperdontia can generally be managed by extraction if the supernumerary tooth presents a periodontal, restorative, or masticatory concern. If there is adequate room in the arch for the tooth, no treatment is an appropriate option. Supernumerary teeth can sometimes be impacted and fully encased in soft tissue or bone, potentially predisposing them to develop pathology. These teeth should be continuously monitored via radiographic imaging to evaluate for any changes. If crowding is a concern due to an additional tooth or teeth, it is important to emphasize good oral hygiene and regular maintenance appointments.
