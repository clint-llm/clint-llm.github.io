Ezetimibe is a medication used in the management and treatment of hypercholesterolemia. It is among a novel class of selective cholesterol-absorption inhibitors. It is indicated to reduce total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), apolipoprotein B (apo B), and non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in patients with primary hyperlipidemia, mixed hyperlipidemia, familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), and homozygous sitosterolemia (phytosterolemia). This activity describes the indications, actions, and contraindications for ezetimibe as a valuable agent in treating hypercholesterolemia. In addition, this activity highlights the administration and monitoring principles that the interprofessional team should employ to manage patients with hypercholesterolemia using ezetimibe.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for initiating ezetimibe therapy.
- Review the contraindications for ezetimibe therapy.
- Summarize the common and less common adverse effects of ezetimibe therapy.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure appropriate monitoring of patients receiving ezetimibe.
