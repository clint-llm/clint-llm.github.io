The thymus serves as a site for T-cell development. Epithelial cells in the thymus have a unique ability to express most proteins in the human genome, which allows for screening and destruction of self-reactive T cells. This process plays a significant role in the prevention of auto-immune conditions.

Lymph nodes are structured to optimize the coordination between the innate and active immune responses. The outer follicles house B cells, follicular dendritic cells, and macrophages. Dendritic cells that present antigens and activate T cells are present within the paracortex. The inner-most medulla contains B cells, T cells, and plasma cells.

The spleen has a function similar to lymph nodes. T cells and B cells are in the white pulp. Germinal centers within the white pulp contain many memory cells, follicular dendritic cells, and macrophages.
