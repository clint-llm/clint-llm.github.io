Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and its clinical role in ophthalmology were discovered by two medical students, Herald Novotny and David Alvis.

Novotny and Alvis used the new fundus camera and two different filters, blue and green, to image the fluorescence of the dye. They successfully got the first fluorescein angiogram images, which were reported in their published paper in 1961.

FFA is a diagnostic procedure where a series of photographs of both eyes are taken after injecting sodium fluorescein intravenously. Interpretation and understanding of FFA help in the accurate diagnosis and evaluation of various pathologies. This review also discusses the complications and the role of the interprofessional approach in managing patients undergoing FFA.
