Apremilast is a selective inhibitor of the enzyme phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), hindering the conversion of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to AMP, further causing an intracellular accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).

The diminished inflammatory response by PDE4 inhibition is what is reported to confer a therapeutic benefit and clinical improvements in psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, and Behcet disease, although the specific mechanism of apremilast is not well defined.
