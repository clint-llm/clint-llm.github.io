Aniridic fibrosis syndrome is a rare complication of invasive intraocular surgery (especially cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation) that may occur in patients with congenital aniridia. It is characterized by a progressive fibrotic membrane within the anterior chamber that occurs after ocular surgery. In this activity, we review the clinical presentation and management of aniridic fibrosis syndrome. We also discuss the pathophysiology, risk factors, and differential diagnosis.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pathophysiology and histopathology associated with aniridic fibrosis syndrome
- Describe the physical examination findings in a patient with aniridic fibrosis syndrome
- Outline the treatment regimen for patients affected with aniridic fibrosis syndrome
- Identify the differential diagnoses to consider in a patient with apparent aniridic fibrosis syndrome
