A sudden tear in the intimal layer of the carotid artery occurs due to the factors listed above. These may be due to trauma or they can be spontaneous. This tear allows blood to flow into this intimal layer of the vessel and allows a hematoma to form within the blood vessel wall. This is commonly known as a false lumen. As blood enters this false lumen, it causes stenosis which may lead to complete occlusion of the carotid artery. This is a dynamic process that may lead to stenosis of the vessel or dilatation of the artery. This depends on where the hematoma develops, either toward the intima or adventitia. This process may lead to a stroke from a complete vascular occlusion at the site of the dissection. It may also be a nidus for thrombus formation that may later migrate distally, causing a strokeÂ or transient ischemic attack. If the vessel ruptures intracranially, it may lead to a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Also, a pseudoaneurysm may result from a carotid dissection.
