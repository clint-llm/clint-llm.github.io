Conductive hearing loss can be produced by any defect in the pinna, external auditory canal, tympanic membrane, and ossicles, up to the footplate of the stapes. Problems with the external ear and auditory canal may be due to congenital abnormalities such as aural atresia, which results in the incomplete formation of the external ear. This anomaly occurs due to the maldevelopment of the first and second branchial arches and the first branchial cleft.

Pathologies in the middle ear resulting in a conductive hearing loss include acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion (commonly referred to as glue ear). Otitis media with effusion is the most common cause of acquired hearing loss in children.

A defect in the ossicles of the middle ear will also give a conductive hearing loss. This could be due to head trauma resulting in ossicle discontinuity, or it could be due to a disease process such as otosclerosis.Â Otosclerosis is an osseous dyscrasia within the temporal bone.
