Albendazole sulfoxide, the active metabolite of albendazole, causes selective degeneration of cytoplasmic microtubules in intestinal and tegmental cells of intestinal helminths and larvae. The metabolite binds to the B-tubulin subunit of the helminth's microtubules and thus inhibits microtubule polymerization.

Albendazole also causes impaired glucose utilization and causes a decrease in the parasite's glycogen stores. At high concentrations, albendazole inhibits parasitic metabolic pathways such as the Kreb cycle by inhibiting key enzymes such as malate dehydrogenase. A subsequent decrease in ATP production occurs, which causes energy depletion, leading to the immobilization of theÂ parasite and subsequent death.
