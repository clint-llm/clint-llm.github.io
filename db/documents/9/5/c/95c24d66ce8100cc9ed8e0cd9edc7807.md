The patient should fast for at least 4 hours to avoid aspiration during vomiting in an unconscious state (which is rare). The examination may be performed when the patient is dressed in their usual clothes. The procedure and expectations should be explained to avoid unnecessary anxiety about the test. The patient should be informed about the risk of urinary incontinence or vomiting and have clothes to change into, if necessary.
