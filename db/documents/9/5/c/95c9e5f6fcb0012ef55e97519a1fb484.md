Eumycetoma most characteristically occurs on the lower extremities and appears as plaques with hard woody swelling, discharging sinuses, and characteristic granular grains or microcolonies. Communicating sinuses and fistulae actively drain purulent material and granules that vary in color from white to yellow to black. Scarring and hyperpigmentation are noted in the surrounding skin. Eumycetomas are endemic to barefoot walking populations of Africa and Southeast Asia.

Men between the third and fourth decades of life are most frequently affected. After inoculation of the causative agent, subcutaneous mycosis develops over the course of months to years. If left untreated, the infection can track down fascial planes and involve muscle and bone, leading to complications such as osteomyelitis, making it more resistant to treatment.Â Less commonly, mycetomas may be found on the hand, leg, or other parts of the body.
