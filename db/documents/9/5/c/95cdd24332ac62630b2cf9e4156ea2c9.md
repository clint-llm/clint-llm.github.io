Depending on the patient's age, bone density, and comorbidities, bone healing can take between 4 to 8 weeks. Most patients are not weight-bearing for at least four weeks after surgery. Older patients may require a skilled nursing facility or rehab. After a period of non-weight-bearing, patients are typically able to walk in a CAM (controlled ankle motion) boot and begin physical therapy. Full recovery tends to take six months or more. Lower extremity swelling can last for up to 1 year after surgery.
