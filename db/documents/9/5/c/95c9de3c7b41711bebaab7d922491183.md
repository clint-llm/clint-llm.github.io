The evaluation of cardiac arrhythmias, in conjunction with a non-invasive diagnostic assessment, is the main indication toÂ conduct an electrophysiological study.

More specifically, EPS can provide valuable diagnostic and prognostic information in the assessment of:

- Sinus node dysfunction

- Atrioventricular (AV) conduction abnormalities

- Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVTs)

- Ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT)

- Result of an ablation procedure
