Epithelial cells are derived from each of the three embryonic layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Ectoderm develops into the epithelial lining of the skin, nose, mouth, and anus. Mesoderm creates endothelium, composed of epithelial cells that line vessels and lymphatics. Endoderm forms the epithelium lining the airways and most of the digestive system.
