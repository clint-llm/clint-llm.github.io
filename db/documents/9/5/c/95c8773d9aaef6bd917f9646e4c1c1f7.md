According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), motor vehicle collisions (MVC) in 2013 accounted for over 2 million injuries and more than 32,000 deaths annually in the United States (US)

**Mechanism of Injury**

Mechanism of injury (MOI) specifically refers to the method by which trauma and its associated forces directly or indirectly impacts the human body.  MOI implies a specific transfer of energy from one source (i.e. the environment) to another (i.e. the human body).

These injury patterns assist in the determination of the extent of an injury and fundamental decision-making process regarding trauma triage guidelines.

Energy transfer from the environment can result from a variety of causes. The intensity of the energy transfer will cause damage to the surrounding tissues, organs, muscles, and other body structures when it exceeds the body’s ability to resist such rapid, forceful energy changes.

According to the Law of Conservation of Energy, “Energy can neither be destroyed or created, but it can change form.” This law goes to the essence of trauma. The kinetic or moving energy must be transferred onto the object impacted. So, if a vehicle is traveling at a high rate of speed when it impacts an object, the energy force can be quadrupled. Spinal injuries may be a result of axial loads.
