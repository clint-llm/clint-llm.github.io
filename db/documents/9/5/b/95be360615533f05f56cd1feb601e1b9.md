Patients prescribed with prisms need to be followed up closely for compliance. Those prescribed prisms for exercise might experience an initial exacerbation of asthenopic symptoms and thus require the motivation to continue the exercise till the fusional reserves improve. Patients might experience confusion and practical difficulties with the use of prisms. Therefore, it is essential to review them closely and attend to the patients' issues.

A few patients might show an increased angle of deviation with the prescribed prisms, and thus close monitoring is again vital in these cases. In patients presenting with long-standing palsies or partially accommodative esotropias, a decision might be taken to operate the residual squints. Thus, nurses and counselors need to motivate the patients and follow them closelyÂ after surgical intervention.
