Although meant to harm rodents, rodenticides are also toxic to humans, as described previously. A variety of sequelae can lead to organ failure and even death. One should always follow label instructions and take steps to avoid exposure. All rodenticides should be kept out of reach of children and pets, whether they are in use or storage. Children may find rodenticides to be visibly appealing in addition to their taste.

For this reason, tamper-resistant bait stations should be employed to prevent accidental ingestion. When disposing of dead rodents in secure bins, always use gloves to avoid contact with their carcass. It is reasonable to seek medical evaluation even if asymptomatic or with mild symptoms like nausea, as it can be an early manifestation of severe illness.
