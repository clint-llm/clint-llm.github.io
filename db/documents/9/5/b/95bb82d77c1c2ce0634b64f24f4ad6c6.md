The most common presenting symptoms of lesions involving the CPA include hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness, vertigo, headaches, and gait dysfunction. Hearing loss is mostly unilateral sensorineural and is due to the involvement of the cochlear nerve. Other cranial nerve deficits, brainstem compression symptoms, and hydrocephalus can also be seen with larger tumors compressing these structures.
