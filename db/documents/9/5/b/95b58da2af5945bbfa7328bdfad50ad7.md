Shrinking lung syndrome is typically suspected in patients who present with dyspnoea with or without pleuritic chest pain and who have a background of a relevant systemic autoimmune disease, most commonly SLE.

Reduced chest expansion and less commonly auscultatory crackles are possible examination findings. Patients may be tachypneic with shallow breathing. Approximately half of the patients have active extra-thoracic disease at the time of diagnosis.
