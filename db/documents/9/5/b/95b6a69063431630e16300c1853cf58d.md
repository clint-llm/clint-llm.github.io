A herald patch is an erythematous, 2 to 10 centimeter, round to oval scaly patch or plaque with a depressed center and raised border. It is a common presenting sign in pityriasis rosea. It is called the herald patch because it is frequently present a few days to 2 weeks before the full eruption of pityriasis rosea, a common, self-limiting papulosquamous disorder, appears.
