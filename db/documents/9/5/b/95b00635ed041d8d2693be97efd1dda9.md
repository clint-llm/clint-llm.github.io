**Novel Therapies**

- **Antisense Oligonucleotides (AONs):**work by degrading the CUG expansion, or by binding to CUG expansion to inhibit RNA sequestration and sites for abnormal MBNL binding.

- **Recombinant Adeno-associated viral (rAAV):**stimulates overexpression of MBNL1, to prevent sequestration.Â Inhibition of CUG-BP1 activity via small molecules (pentamidine) or by inhibiting protein kinase C (involved in activating CUG-BP1) can also prevent sequestration.

- **Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas):**cleave and degrade CUG mRNA expansion.

- **Others:**agents to increase muscle anabolism, such as testosterone, creatine, dehydroepiandrosterone, and recombinant insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), and myostatin inhibitors.
