Older patients presenting with acute back pain should be evaluated with imaging to assess for vertebral column fracture. If imaging is positive for vertebral fractures outside the trauma setting, the underlying cause should be sought out; these will include osteoporosis, metastatic disease, and primary bone pathology. All high-impact trauma patients should undergo imaging diagnostics.
