Optic nerve drusen on their own do not necessitate treatment. Typically, patients have a good visual prognosis, and drusen can be re-evaluated periodically. There is no strong evidence for initiating treatment for those individuals without visual field loss, although treatment with IOP lowering therapy or optic nerve sheath fenestration has been undertaken in some cases.Â  Additionally, there are no established surgical interventions for removing optic nerve drusen. Surgical excision and radial optic neurotomy have been attempted without evidence to back their utilization. On the contrary surgical excision has been shown to have negative consequences.

Complications associated with optic nerve drusen may require treatment. Choroidal neovascularization occurring in association with the presence of nerve drusen, though rare, may lead to complications such as central retinal vein occlusion or ischemic optic neuropathy. These entities are treated with intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF medication, laser photocoagulation, and photodynamic therapy.
