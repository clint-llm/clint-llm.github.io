According to the FDA, dexrazoxane classifies as a Category D drug.

In a study conducted on pregnant mice and rabbits, dexrazoxane dispensation led to toxicities in embryos and their mothers, as well as embryonal malformation at doses notably lower than those clinically approved for human use.

Dexrazoxane use could also lead to infertility in males based on its effects on a repeated dose toxicology research. During this study, rats and dogs received the drug every week for six weeks, in doses that were significantly lower than the specified human dose, with the dogs receiving doses equal to those given to humans. These led to notable cases of testicular atrophy in these test subjects, subsequently attributed to dexrazoxane use.
