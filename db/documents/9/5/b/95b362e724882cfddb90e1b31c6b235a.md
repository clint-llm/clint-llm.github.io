Germ cell tumors of the mediastinum are a rare entity, making up only 15% of all tumors located in that area. They are the most common type of germ cell tumors outside the gonads but only account for approximately 1%Â to 3% of all germ cell malignancies. Mediastinal germ cell tumors are predominantly seen in men (97%) and occur in younger patients with a mean age of 31 years.
