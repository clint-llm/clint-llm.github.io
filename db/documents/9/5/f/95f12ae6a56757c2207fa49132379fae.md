Most work-related injuries among firefighters are minor, with muscle pain, strains, or sprains accounting for 46% of fire ground injuries.Â  Wounds, bleeding or bruising, cause approximately 14% of injuries. In a 2016 study, smoke or gas inhalation accounted for 8% of fire ground injuries, and thermal stress or exposure (frostbite, heat exhaustion) caused 7% of injuries.

As firefighting became professionalized during the 1970s and 1980s, firefighter related deaths declined significantly. While the overall number of injuries among firefighters responding to incidents has decreased over the past 30 years, and the number of fires has also declined; overall, the rate of fire ground related injuries have been relatively stable. The number of firefighter deaths has been relatively stable, with a slight decrease in the past ten years.
