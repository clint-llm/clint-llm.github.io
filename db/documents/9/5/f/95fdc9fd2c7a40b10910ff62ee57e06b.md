Cosyntropin stimulation test (CST) is a frequently used dynamic test for the evaluation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in patients suspected of adrenal insufficiency (AI). Adrenal insufficiency is a potentially life-threatening condition with a variable clinical presentation and requires a high level of clinicalÂ investigation for diagnosis. Without timely intervention, untreated AI can lead to grave complications, including death.
