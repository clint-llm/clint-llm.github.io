Plain radiographs of the ankle and, possibly, the foot are the initial imaging study of choice. These may help identify any structural abnormalities including osteophytes, hindfoot varus and valgus, tarsal coalition, or evidence of previous trauma. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is not sensitive for the diagnosis of the tarsal tunnel but may help include or exclude other causes of the patient's symptoms. Ultrasound can be used to evaluate the soft tissue structures. The nerve and its bifurcations can be observed. Either ultrasound or MRI can evaluate other soft tissue abnormalities including tendonitis or tenosynovitis, lipomas or other growths, varicose veins, and ganglion cysts.

Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) are frequently abnormal in patients with tarsal tunnel syndrome. Sensory nerve conduction studies are more likely to be abnormal than motor nerve conduction studies; however, the sensitivity and specificity are suboptimal. False-negative tests are not uncommon and thus do not rule out the diagnosis.
