Many patients progress to legal blindness due to the loss of central vision, although peripheral vision tends to remain preserved. However, the prognosis is widely variable and is highly dependent on the age of onset of the disease. The patients presenting with early onset have poor outcomes. Visual acuity in such patients declines rapidly along with the appearance of progressive retinal degeneration and may even lead to profound chorioretinal atrophy. Thus, patients with this phenotype have a severe disease with a poor prognosis.

Rapid-onset chorioretinopathy (ROC) is a distinct sub-phenotype characterized by rapid disease progression.
