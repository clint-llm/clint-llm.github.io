Diagnostic challenges of EBV positive mucocutaneous ulcer included distinguishing it from other lymphoproliferative disorders, which may be EBV related such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, or classic Hodgkin lymphoma. EBVMCU typically is a localized condition and does not involve the bone marrow, lymph nodes, liver, or spleen and is not associated with EBV viremia. Work up of this condition typically involves histologic evaluation with immunohistochemistry.  Imaging with or without bone marrow biopsy may be performed to rule out systemic involvement.
