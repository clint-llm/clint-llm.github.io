The most common source of error in blood pressure measurement is a failure to adhere to the proper technique. Multiple studies have attempted to quantify the impact of common mistakes. Smoking within 30 minutes of measurement can raise the systolic blood pressure to 20 mmHg, while a distended bladder can increase systolic and diastolic measurements by 10 to 15 mmHg. Sitting in a chair lacking back support can raise systolic blood pressure to 10 mmHg, and a similar increase is observed when both legs are crossed. Cuff placement over clothing can affect measurements by an astonishing 50 mmHg. Talking/listening during measurements can increase systolic and diastolic measurements by 10 mmHg. The use of an improperly sized cuff can affect blood pressure in either direction; larger cuff results in falsely low measurements, while smaller cuff results in falsely elevated measurements. Similarly, incorrect arm positioning also results in a bidirectional error; placing the arm below the level of the right atrium results in higher values, whereas placing the arm above the right atrium generates lower values. The vast range of these errors highlights the importance of adhering to the appropriate technique when measuring blood pressure.

In addition to the adjustable source of error, there are also unavoidable sources. Multiple studies have found differences between measurements obtained in clinical settings and those taken in ambulatory settings. Hypertension can be inaccurately diagnosed in patients prone to “white-coat hypertension,” a phenomenon in which the apprehension of being in the presence of medical professional results in a transient rise in blood pressure. These patients are normotensive in ordinary settings and are hypertensive only in clinical settings. Similarly, hypertension can be inadvertently overlooked in patients who appear to be normotensive in the clinic but are hypertensive throughout other points of the day. This “masked hypertension” may be due to lifestyle changes made before medical appointments.
