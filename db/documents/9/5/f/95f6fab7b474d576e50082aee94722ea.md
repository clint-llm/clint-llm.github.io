**Membrane Composition**

At the basic level, the cell membrane is a collection of lipids (namely phospholipid) and protein components. The phospholipid structure forms from a hydrophilic phosphorylated glycerol "head" and two hydrophobic fatty acid "tails." The cell membrane possesses a phospholipid bilayer, with the hydrophilic heads facing outwards and the hydrophobic tails facing inwards.

**Membrane Transportation**

Transport across the cell membrane takes the form of simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. Simple and facilitated diffusion occurs without the use of energy expenditure and depends on a molecule's electrochemical gradient and the intrinsic size and solubility of the molecule. Tiny, uncharged, nonpolar substances with high lipid solubility, like oxygen and carbon dioxide, move quickly through the cell membrane via passive diffusion, while water, though small, is insoluble in lipids and thus needs to travel through a membrane channel protein to flow into the cell. This transport through a channel protein is an example of facilitated diffusion.
