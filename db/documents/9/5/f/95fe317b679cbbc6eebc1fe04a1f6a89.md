The mammillary bodies are one of the primary nuclei within the Papez Circuit (Figure 1B). The circuit assists with spatial and episodic memory consolidation and storage.

The primary function associated with the mammillary bodies is recollective memory. Memory information begins within the hippocampus. Theta waves activate CA3 neurons in the hippocampus. Information about memory transmits through the fornix to the mammillary bodies (orange line, Figure 1C). Mammillary bodies project to the anterior thalamic nuclei through the mammillothalamic tract. The anterior thalamic nuclei projects to the cingulate cortex, and the cingulate cortex to the entorhinal cortex. There is then a bi-directional projection between the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex that completes the circuit; the Papez circuit (Figure 1B).

Beyond the transmission of memory information, the mammillary bodies help facilitate the creation of appropriate behavioral reactions through reciprocal connections with the tegmentum (blue line, Figure 1C). The medial mammillary nucleus has bi-directional projections to the ventral tegmental area. The lateral mammillary nucleus has bi-directional connections to the dorsal tegmental nucleus. The ventral tegmentum is rich with dopamine neurons, and thus functions as a reward (pleasure) center of the brain. Memory information from the hippocampus combines with information about reward or aversive attributes about a specific stimulus or set of stimuli in the environment, which allows the processing of the salience of environmental stimuli.

The dorsal tegmental connections to the lateral mammillary nucleus function to process goal-directed movement. The location of the dorsal tegmental nucleus is between the trochlear nuclei within the midbrain.

The mammillary bodies do not have interneurons. The processing of information within the mammillary bodies occurs from projection neurons of other regions of the brain. It receives both dopaminergic and acetylcholine reciprocal projections from the tegmentum (blue line, Figure 1C) that help to regulate what information the mammillary bodies send forward to the anterior thalamic nucleus (Papez circuit) and the cerebellum. Because tegmental connections are reciprocal (bi-directional), the mammillary activity also influences the tegmentum and other connections of the tegmentum (e.g., amygdala, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens). Activation of the acetylcholine and dopamine circuits activate norepinephrine and serotonin systems downstream.
