Although in the United States, the manufacture of sulfur mustard in the has ceased, stockpiles of sulfur mustard are located in several storage sites across the country. After the First and Second World Wars, sulfur mustard-containing shells, and other undetonated artillery shells were disposed of in vast chemical dumping off the coast of New Jersey. To this day, periodic exposures occur when fisherman inadvertently dredge up unused shells containing sulfur mustard. There is also the potential for exposure at U.S. stockpile sites. Although none reported recently, chemical agents still have the potential to be employed in modern warfare and were last used against American troops in the Gulf War.
