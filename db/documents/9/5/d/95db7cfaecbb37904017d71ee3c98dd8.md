The management of esophageal varices is with an interprofessional team that consists of a gastroenterologist, internist, surgeon, invasive radiologist, and an intensivist. The treatment selected depends on the severity of the disease and patient status.this is a serious life-threatening disorder and all patients should be in a monitored setting. The role of the nurse in monitoring is crucial. Vitals and oxygenation should be continuously monitored. Blood work should be followed to ensure that the patient is not anemic and developing renal or liver dysfunction. The pharmacist should have the key medications to stop the variceal hemorrhage. In addition, all drugs that are liver toxic should be discontinued. Because patients tend to have other comorbidities, nurses should ensure that the patient has DVT and pressure ulcer prophylaxis. Several treatments to stop variceal bleeding have the potential to cause complications including perforation of the esophagus. Thus, close monitoring of the patient is critical; nurses should regularly check for emphysema. Close communication between the team is vital if outcomes are to be improved.

Unless the primary cause of portal hypertension is controlled, recurrence is common with all treatments. The prognosis for patients with esophageal varices is guarded. Multiorgan failure, complications from procedures and infections often lead to premature death.
