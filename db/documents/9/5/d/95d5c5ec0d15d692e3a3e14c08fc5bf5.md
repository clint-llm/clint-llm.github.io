THC binds to cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, which are part of the endogenous cannabinoid system. THC binds primarily to CB1 receptors though there is a weak binding of CB2 receptors. The expression and pathway of these receptors are still the focus of research; however, it is known that CB1 receptors predominantly express in the central nervous system(CNS), while CB2 receptors are expressed in the peripheral nervous system(PNS) immune cells and organs.

THC’s effects on emesis, appetite, and pain are attributed to its binding of CB1 receptors in the CNS, through which it modulates sensory, somatic, and cognitive perception.****Regarding its possible benefits in OSA, THC appears to be an antagonist of serotonin in the PNS.
