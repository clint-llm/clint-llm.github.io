Migraine is a disorder that usually occurs as recurrent attacks. A migraine attack can last from hours to days. A typical migraine attack passes through 4 phases: the prodromal phase, the aura phase, the headache phase, and the postdromal phase.

**Prodromal Phase**

This involves symptoms usually occurring 24 to 48 hours before the headache onset. Some of the common prodromal symptoms are irritability, depression, increased yawning, neck stiffness, and craving for specific foods.

**Aura Phase**

Aura is seen in about 25% of patients with migraines. Aura can precede the headache, or sometimes headaches start along with aura. A typical aura can present with positive or negative symptoms and is completely reversible.

Aura can be visual, auditory, somatosensory, or motor. Visual aura can be a flickering, jagged arc of light, bright lines, or a blind spot in the visual field.

Some patients experience isolated aura without the development of migraine headaches. This is called 'migraine equivalent' or 'acephalgic migraine.'

**Headache Phase**

A migraine headache can be unilateral or bilateral. The pain is usually described as throbbing or pulsatile. Headaches can be accompanied by nausea or vomiting. Intensity can vary from moderate to severe. Many patients report phonophobia or photophobia during the attacks. They get relief from sleeping in a dark, quiet room.

**Postdromal Phase**

In this phase, patients can report transient headaches on sudden head movements. Patients can also experience extreme tiredness and exhaustion.
