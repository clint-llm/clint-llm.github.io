Parotidectomy is a common procedure in head and neck surgery. An appropriate incision and identification of multiple anatomical landmarks are necessary to accurately localize the facial nerve to avoid facial paralysis, a potentially devastating condition with a tremendous impact on the patient's quality of life. The most common indication for parotid surgery is benign and malignant tumors of the parotid gland. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of parotid disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the presentation of a patient with a parotid tumor.
- Describe the utility of preoperative imaging and cytology for parotidectomy.
- Outline key surgical steps of parotidectomy.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate preoperative evaluation of the patient's disease-specific and general condition in an attempt to optimize postoperative outcomes of parotidectomy.
