- Cortical spreading depression is the probable cause of the aura. It can activate trigeminal nerve afferents and alter hematoencephalic barrier permeability. Trigeminovascular system activation can initiate neurogenic inflammation related to migraine headaches.

- The attacks are recurrent and occur through a cascade of events over hours to days.

- Typical migraines progress through a prodrome, an aura, a headache, and the postdrome.

- There is no one approach to treating migraines. Each case must be individualized according to its comorbidities.
