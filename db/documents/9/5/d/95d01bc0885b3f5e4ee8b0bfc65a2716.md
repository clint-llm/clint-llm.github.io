A multidisciplinary approach is required in the management of trauma patients, especially with suspected tracheobronchial injuries. The patients are often attended initially by the emergency room provider, and a high index of suspicion is essential not to miss a tracheobronchial injury. Anesthesia, pulmonary, or otorhinolaryngology support may be required to endoscopically intubate the patients in the initial part of safe airway management. A small group of hemodynamically unstable and uncooperative patients with profuse bleeding in the airway might need a rigid bronchoscopic approach to clear out the blood and secretions along with the performance of a bridging procedure for the airway defects (if required) under inhalational anesthesia with the patients breathing on their own. Optimal intensive care monitoring and management is an integral part of trauma care.

Otorhinolaryngology and cardiothoracic surgery consults are often required in such patients for a thorough expert evaluation and execute any surgical measures if indicated. Follow up by thoracic surgeon/otorhinolaryngologist may be necessary to monitor for long term sequelae. Interventional pulmonary follow up will be required in select patients, especially those with iatrogenic trauma, or those patients in whom the initial surgical intervention was deferred due to high risk, hence needed endoscopic stenting.
