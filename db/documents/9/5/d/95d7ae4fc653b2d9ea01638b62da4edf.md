Potential complications in the setting of pulsus alternans are varied. Of chief concern are life-threatening cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias. While the risk for developing ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of pulsus alternans is unknown, there is theoretically increased risk due to potential changes in cardiac conduction.
