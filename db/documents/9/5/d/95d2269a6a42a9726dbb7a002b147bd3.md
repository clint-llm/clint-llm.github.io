Hydrocarbons are compounds containing hydrogen and carbon. These are typically the chief components in many types of fuels. They can come in the form of a gas, liquid, solid, or polymers. Exposure to these substances can cause significant health risks. Toxicity is dependent on multiple variables including compound properties, viscosity, surface tension, volatility, and additives. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of hydrocarbon toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for afflicted patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of hydrocarbon toxicity.
- Describe the typical presentation of a patient with hydrocarbon toxicity.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for hydrocarbon toxicity.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of hydrocarbon toxicity and improve outcomes.
