Unfortunately, no treatment is effective for CRAO or ION. If the peri-operative vision loss is secondary to cortical visual loss and on imaging, the patient is found to have occlusion of a cerebral artery contributing to deficits within the defined time-sensitive window. There may be a role for intravascular clot retrieval and/or thrombolysis if not contraindicated.

Due to the inherent risk of POVL occurring more frequently in patients with prolonged operations greater than five or six hours in duration, it is unlikely that many patients would be candidates for thrombolysis within the defined three to four and half-hour window. In major surgery, such as posterior spine surgery, the risk of thrombolysis must also be weighed with the elevated risk of surgical site hemorrhage, which may lead to cord compression and paralysis.

Management of cortical vision loss secondary to PRES includes prompt control of seizures, blood pressure, and discontinuation of possible responsible medications and other contributing factors.
