Presentation of bacterial tracheitis can occur in various ways depending on the patient's age and whether or not they are tracheostomy-dependent. The most common presentation in non-tracheostomy-dependent children and adults is a more insidious development with prodromal symptoms that suggest a viral respiratory tract infection. Viral symptoms including rhinorrhea, post-nasal drip, cough, fever, myalgia, and sore throat are present up to a week before the acute worsening of the patient.

Drooling and tripoding are less common and suggest an alternative diagnosis such as epiglottitis, as children with bacterial tracheitis do not have as much difficulty swallowing their oral secretions. Patients with severe subglottic obstruction may have cyanosis, appear lethargic, or can be combative, suggesting hypoxemia and/or hypercarbia.

In patients who are tracheostomy-dependent, symptoms of bacterial tracheitis can include high fevers, chills, productive cough, thick mucopurulent secretions, hemoptysis, peristomal skin breakdown or cellulitis, high ventilatory peak pressures, and/or tracheostomy obstruction.
