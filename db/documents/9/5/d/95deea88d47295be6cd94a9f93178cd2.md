Glomus jugulare is a rare, slow-growing neuroendocrine paraganglioma of the head and neck that arises within the jugular foramen and is localized to the jugular fossa in the temporal bone of the skull base.

Throughout the head and neck, paragangliomas can have a wide range of locations including the carotid bifurcation (carotid body tumor), at the superior vagal ganglion (glomus jugulare tumor), at the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (glomus tympanicum tumor), and at the inferior vagal ganglion (glomus vagale tumor). Although their natural history is usually slow-growing, glomus tumors can cause significant complications due to the associated mass effect and compression, and even erosion of local structures.
