Hematuria is commonly seen in clinical practice. Because of the vast number of conditions that can cause hematuria, the presentation is best managed by an interprofessional team.

In most cases, initial management will involve a primary care physician or emergency medicine physician. After getting initial workup, referral to a nephrologist or urologist may be indicated.

Inpatient or outpatient referral decision depends on the severity of presentation, abnormal lab findings, and the presence of risk factors for serious etiology.

Clinicians including the nurse practitioner should inform the parents that hematuria by itself should not prevent the child from undertaking sporting activities, however, the type of activity should be regulated. The pharmacist should educate the patients on some medications that may cause hematuria. However, the pharmacist should consult with the team members before making any recommendation on discontinuation of the drug.

Because some of the causes of hematuria are caused by malignancies, the key is to communicate with the members of the team so that there is no delay in diagnosis. Educating the patient and communication among the team will result in the best clinical outcomes. [Level 5]
