The patient should be evaluated for signs that intubation may be difficult: the presence of upper front teeth, history of difficult intubation, any Mallampati status different from 1 (2.55) or equal to 4, and mouth opening less than 4 cm. The likelihood of difficult intubation increases continuously from 0 (when no risk factor is present) to 2, 4, 8, and 17%, when one, two, three, and more than three factors are present.

The Mallampati score alone does not offer complete coverage in ascertaining the ease of intubation. The presence of vomitus or foreign bodies in the airway and surgical alterations can make intubating very difficult, even with a normal Mallampati score. The basic anatomy evaluation is also limited due to the ability, or lack thereof, of the patient to participate. If one is considering medication-facilitated intubation, the patient is already semi-comatose or in extremis and may not be able to follow directions. Direct visualization in the mouth, along with external landmarks, is needed to assess the risk/benefit ratio of attempting to intubate with medication-facilitated intubation versus rapid sequence intubation or to simply continue with non-invasive methods of ventilation.
