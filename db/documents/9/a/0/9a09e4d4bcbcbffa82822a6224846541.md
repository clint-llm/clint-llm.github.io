On entry, EHEC strains produce Shiga-like toxins (Stx) which mediate the dysregulation of membrane ion channels in the epithelial membrane of the intestine that leads to loss of ions and a massive amount of water. This toxin also acts as a cell transduction and immune modulator leading to pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic sequela. Endothelial lesions in the microvasculature of the kidney and less frequently of other organs are found to be responsible for sequela of the hemolytic uremic syndrome. The kidney and gastrointestinal (GI) tract are the most commonly affected organs in HUS, but evidence of central nervous system (CNS), pancreatic, skeletal, and myocardial involvement has also been shown in the studies conducted. The mechanism of this microvascular injury is unknown, but evidence shows that verocytotoxin plays a role in mediating cell injury with a resultant change in the normal anti-coagulant profile of the endothelial cell to a procoagulant state.

After E. coli infection, several factors determine the progression of the disease to HUS like:

- Bacterial strain: Serotype O157:H7 is most often found to be responsible

- Age: The rate of progression to HUS is higher in young children. A study showed it to be 12.9% in children younger than 5 years of age, 6.8% in children between 5 to 10 years, 8% in children older thanÂ 10 years of age.

- Antibiotic: Treatment with antibiotic therapy for E. coli O157:H7 has shown to increase the risk of HUS
