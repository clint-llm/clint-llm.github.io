Bypass surgery with a greater saphenous vein graft, or another alternative autologous venous graft, is a well-established treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the lower limbs. A wide spectrum of PAD with different underlying causalities, including chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), intermittent claudication, peripheral limb aneurysms, and major arterial trauma, might be managed with bypass procedures. The long-term patency and success of venous grafts in bypass surgery remains a challenge due to various complications, such as the accelerated rates of atherosclerosis compared to their arterial counterparts. Treatment of vein graft stenoses ranges from primary prevention to revascularization. This activity will discuss vein graft stenosis etiology, diagnosis, prevention, and management, emphasizing the role of the multidisciplinary team in caring for patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of vein graft stenosis.
- Outline the presentation of vein graft stenosis.
- Describe the treatment options for vein graft stenosis.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among multidisciplinary team members to improve patient outcomes with vein graft stenosis.
