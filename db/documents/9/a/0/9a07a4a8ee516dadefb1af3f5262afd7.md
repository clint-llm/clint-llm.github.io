The existence of the MMPI has been concurrent with vast reforms in societal convention and increased understanding of behavioral health.

These shortcomings led to the release of the MMPI-2 by James N. Butcher, W. Grant Dahlstrom, John R. Graham, Auke Tellegen, and Beverly Kaemme in 1989.

In 2003, 9 restructured clinical or ‘RC’ scales were introduced as a prospective replacement for the original clinical scales.

- RCd, or ‘demoralization’ – misery or depression

- RC1 or ‘somatic complaints, – the fixation on bodily symptoms of illness or somatization

- RC2 or ‘low positive emotions’ – weakened positivity, lack of enjoyment

- RC3 or ‘cynicism’ – low regard for the merit of others and their actions

- RC4 or ‘antisocial behavior’ – selfish and sociopathic conduct

- RC6 or ‘ideas of persecution’ – belief in the malintent of others toward oneself

- RC7 or ‘dysfunctional negative emotions’ – experiences on a spectrum of anxiety and irritability

- RC8 or ‘aberrant experiences’ – uncommon beliefs or interpretation of experiences

- RC9 or ‘hypomanic activation’ – energetic drive and desire for exertion

The RC scales were devised to provide a streamlined interpretation and less overlap with an increased focus on the growth in understanding within psychiatry over the past 70 years. Combinations of high-scoring categories represent distinct psychiatric constructs rather than the nebulous findings of the original clinical scales tying the patient to a specific diagnosis. Arguments also exist that this information is limited in that it categorizes the responder rather than providing data on an individual patient within a personalized spectrum of behavior.

The RC scales were incorporated into the most current form of the MMPI, known as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Revised Form, or the MMPI-2-RF, which was released in 2008 by Yossef Ben-Porath and Auke Telleger of the University of Minnesota. The MMPI-2-RF is composed of 338 items measured by 51 scales broken into 9 validity scales, 3 higher-order scales, the 9 RC scales, 23 specific problem scales, 2 interest scales, and 5 revised personality psychopathy scales.

The 9 validity scales assess incongruent answering or deceptive test-taking and include:

- VRIN-r or ‘variable response inconsistency’ – inconsistent reporting of items

- TRIN-r or ‘true response inconsistency’ careless reporting of items

- F-r or ‘infrequent responses,’ – overreporting of infrequent responses compared to the norm

- Fp-r or ‘infrequent psychopathology responses’ – overreporting of infrequent responses compared to those with psychopathy

- Fs or ‘infrequent somatic responses’ – overreporting of infrequent responses compared to medical patients

- FBS-r or ‘symptom validity’ – overreporting of nonvalid symptoms compared to both physical and mental standard symptomology

- RBS or ‘response bias’ – overreporting associated with a statistically invalidated presentation of the disease

- L-r or ‘uncommon virtues’ – underreporting through infrequently declared values or actions

- K-r or ‘adjustment validity’ – underreporting by tailoring answers to give the impression of healthy psychological adjustment

The 3 higher-order scales broadly categorize psychopathic presentation and include:

- EID or ‘emotional/internalizing dysfunction’ – problems concerning mood and affect

- THD or ‘thought dysfunction’ – problems concerning disorganization of thought

- BXD or ‘behavioral/external dysfunction’ – problems concerning impulsive or inappropriate behavior

The problem scales highlight responses consistent with the presence of specific psychopathic and psychosomatic presentations and include:

- MLS or ‘malaise’

- GIC or ‘gastrointestinal complaints’

- HPC or ‘head pain complaints'

- NUC or ‘neurological complaints’

- COG or ‘cognitive complaints’

- SUI or ‘suicidal/death ideation’

- HLP or ‘helplessness/hopelessness’

- SFD or ‘self-doubt’

- NFC or ‘inefficacy’

- STW or ‘stress/worry’

- AXY or ‘anxiety’

- ANP or ‘anger proneness’

- BRF or ‘behavior-restricting fears’

- MSF or ‘multiple specific fears’

- JCP or ‘juvenile conduct problems’

- SUB or ‘substance abuse’

- AGG or ‘aggression’

- ACT or ‘activation’

- FML or ‘family problems’

- IPP or ‘interpersonal passivity’

- SAV or ‘social avoidance’

- SHY or ‘shyness’

- DSF or ‘disaffiliativeness’

The interest scales are designed to assess cognitive skills, aptitude, and learning preferences which include:

- AES or aesthetic-literary interests – pursuits related to fine art

- MEC or mechanical-physical interests – pursuits related to kinesthetic activities

The revised personality/psychopathology five scales are based on 107 distinct items and include:

- AGG-r or ‘aggressiveness-revised’ – preference for excess and antagonism

- PSYCH-r or ‘psychoticism-revised’ – preference for disconnection from reality

- DISC-r or ‘disconstraint-revised’ – preference for impulsion and compulsion

- NEGE-r or ‘negative emotionality/neuroticism-revised’ – preference for anxiety

- INTR-r or ‘introversion/low positive emotional-revised’ – flat affect and timidity

It has been suggested that while the MMPI-2-RF has many additional metrics, the reduction in question number limits the amount of information about psychiatric diseases to about 60% of the original test. There has also been considerable debate over whether the new metrics are inaccurate in detecting psychopathy.
