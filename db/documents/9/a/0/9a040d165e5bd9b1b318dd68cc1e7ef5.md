Eyelid lesions are evaluated in the clinic with the naked eye or with a biomicroscope providing between 10 to 40X magnification. A dermatologist may employ dermoscopy that provides about 10X magnification.

- Anatomical location relative to other structures such as the orbital rim, eyebrow, and eyelid margin

- Size: It can be measured with a measuring stick or the slit lamp beam

- Shape:  For example, papillomatous, dome-shaped, flat, and spherical

- Surface appearance and color:  For example: smooth, rough, ulcerated, necrotic, red, inflamed, dark brown

- Consistency:  A range from hard to firm to soft can be used

- Fluctuation: Pressing the lesion between the fingers can indicate fluid or fat-filled lesions

- Mobility: Observation of whether the lesion moves with muscle contraction (of the orbicularis)

- Transillumination. This is done using a penlight. Lesions, such as cysts filled with fluid or fat, will transilluminate

History should include questions regarding predisposing factors, duration and rate of growth of the lesion, symptoms of tenderness or itching, and the presence of discharge or bleeding. When an associated systemic disease, including inherited syndromes, is suspected, applicable questions of pertinent family history and exam findings by other specialists will need to be determined.
