Radiation induces secondary malignancies - absolute risk ranges between 0.2% to 1% per year in cancer survivors after radiotherapy. There is a bimodal distribution of radiation-induced secondary malignancies (RISMs) in relation to occurrence after radiotherapy. The first peak is within three years of radiation exposure, predominantly driven by hematological malignancies like acute leukemias. The second peak, seen over ten years after therapy, is driven primarily by solid malignancies.
