Cricoid pressure is a technique that has become part of rapid sequence intubation to prevent aspiration of gastric contents. The technique has limited evidence to support its utility; however, it is still recommended in select populations. This activity reviews the technique, indications, and contraindications of the cricoid pressure procedure, and it also highlights the role of an interprofessional team in applying this technique.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the proposed mechanism of cricoid pressure.
- Describe the structures of the cricoid pressure unit.
- Summarize the current guidelines/practice recommendations involving cricoid pressure.
- Identify the importance of an interprofessional care team in caring for patients requiring intubation to advance the cricoid pressure technique and improve clinical outcomes.
