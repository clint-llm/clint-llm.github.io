CTS is a condition often seen in the outpatient setting. Patients frequently come with complaints of pain and paresthesias in the hands. Imaging studies, in addition to electrodiagnostic studies, can be routinely ordered. Physicians must be cautious, however, as imaging findings may not correlate with the patient's symptoms. Interprofessional care must use an evidence-based approachÂ for evaluation and management. When CTS is left untreated, mild symptoms may subsequently lead to weakness and atrophy.

Treatment of CTS generally involves the use of conservative management such as wrist splints and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Should these fail, other more invasive options may include local corticosteroid injections and surgery involving carpal tunnel release.

It is essential to take an interprofessional team including physiatrists, orthopedists, hand surgeons, neurosurgeons, physical/occupational therapists, and social workers who can work together to coordinate outpatient therapy, aggressive multifaceted rehabilitation, and ultimately, surgery to improve a patient's functional status.
