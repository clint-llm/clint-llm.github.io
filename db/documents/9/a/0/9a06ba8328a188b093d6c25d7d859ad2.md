Travelers to countries where Salmonella typhi is endemic should be educated on the importance of avoiding unpeeled fruits or vegetables and only drinking bottled or boiled water. Typhoid vaccinations are available and are indicated for travelers to endemic countries. Patients that have been diagnosed with typhoid fever should be made aware of the importance of medication adherence and the potential consequences of inadequate treatment.
