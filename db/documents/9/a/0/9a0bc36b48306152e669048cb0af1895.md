The blood supply to the mental nerve and its sensory territory comes from four main arteries: inferior labial artery, mental artery, submental artery, and inferior alveolar artery. In addition, many anastomoses form the vascular network around the lips that provides collateral blood flow to the lips and chin region. The submental and the submandibular lymph nodes collect lymph from the sensory territory of the mental nerve. These lymph nodes will eventually drain back into the central circulation. The right side of the chin drains back into the central circulation via the right lymphatic duct, whereas the left side via the thoracic duct.
