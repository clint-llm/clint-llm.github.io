Early detection and prevention of further deterioration of kidney function is the cornerstone of therapy in chronic interstitial nephritis in agricultural communities. The most important early step is to move the patient away from agrochemical contact. In addition, supportive care with fluids and electrolytes, adequate hydration, and correction of electrolyte abnormalities are important in early-stage management. Once chronic kidney disease has developed, the patient is generally managed on the lines of chronic kidney disease secondary to other causes. In the final stage of chronic kidney disease, renal replacement therapy should be implemented.

The recent findings suggestive of a lysosomal inclusion body tubulopathy are of great interest to those trying to find therapeutic options to slow down or eliminate the renal damage. It has been argued that despite these findings, oxidative stress might play a key role and that anti-oxidants could be a pertinent treatment option, such as Vitamin C and E.

CINAC prevention measures can include establishing reverse osmosis plants to purify the water and lessen the exposure to possible nephrotoxins via drinking water.

Poor awareness and agrochemical handling practices lead to occupational exposure; hence focusing on farming practices, lifestyle, agrochemical handling, and awareness of health effects could prevent this disease.
