Studies suggest that burnout is not an individual issue alone but also a hazard of organizational dysfunction. Though initiatives at the individual level are important to tackle this epidemic, studies have shown that changes must be made at the organizational level as well to maximize the effectiveness of either.

**Personal Initiatives**

- Improving provider wellness and resilience. Resiliency refers to the stress coping abilities of a person.

- Mindfulness is one of the proven techniques which has been shown to provide the coping mechanism to deal with stress.

- Reducing personal work effort has also been shown to decrease burnout. A longitudinal study was done by Shanafelt et al. at Mayo clinic found that increased burnout is inversely proportional to professional work effort. Another study by the Association of American Medical Colleges demonstrated an increase in burnout in US providers between 2011 to 2014. This result translated into approximately a one percent decrease in provider professional effort, which equals a loss equivalent of the entire graduating class of 7 medical colleges.

- Self-care practices (e.g., exercise, regular health check-up)

- Self-awareness.

**Organizational Intiatives**

-  Recognizing organizational issues and assessing the extent of burnout of employees regularly

- Effective leadership

- Developing specific and targeted interventions

- Improving collegiality at work (e.g., peer support group/provider discussion initiative).

- Recognizing work and incentivizing using a compensation model

- Value alignment is important to make sure that providers and organizations are committed to similar goals. Also, organizational culture must support these shared values.

- Providing providers with more flexibility

- Investment in provider wellbeing

- Development of evidence-based strategies
