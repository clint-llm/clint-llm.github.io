Chronic systemic hypertension is the most critical risk factor for developing Charcot Bouchard aneurysms that subsequently rupture and cause hemorrhage. The risk factors broadly classify as follows:

**Modifiable Factors**

- Hypertension

- High-fat diet

- High waist to hip ratio

- Smoking

- Excessive alcohol consumption

- Low low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels

- Illicit drug use such as cocaine, heroin

**Non-Modifiable Factors**

- Old age

- Male sex

- Race and ethnicity such as Asians and African Americans who are at higher risk

Systemic diseases such as chronic kidney disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, vascular malformations, and coagulopathies, whether hereditary, acquired, or due to drugs such as warfarin and antiplatelet medications, also increase the risk of the development of microaneurysms and intracerebral hemorrhages.
