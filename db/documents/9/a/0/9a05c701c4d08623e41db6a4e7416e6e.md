Treatment includes short-term rest (not more than 48 hours), use of muscle relaxants, NSAIDs, and physical therapy (which entails stretching the piriformis muscle, range of motion exercises, and deep-tissue massages). In some patients, injection of steroids around the piriformis muscle may help decrease the inflammation and pain.

Anecdotal reports suggest that botulinum toxin may help relieve symptoms. However, the duration of pain relief is short-lived, and repeat injections are required.

Surgery is the last consideration in patients with piriformis syndrome. It should only be considered in patients who have failed conservative therapy, including physical exercise. The surgery may help decompress the nerve if there is any impingement, or the surgeon may lyse any adhesions or remove scars from the nerve. However, the results after surgery are not always predictable, and some patients continue to have pain.
