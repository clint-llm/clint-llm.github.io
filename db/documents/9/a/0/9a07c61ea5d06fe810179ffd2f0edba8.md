CFRD management is best with an interprofessional team consisting of an endocrinologist, pulmonologist, nutritionist, primary care provider, specialty care nursing staff, and pharmacists. Routine self-monitoring of blood glucose at least three times a day is recommended in CFRD. CFRD requires strong communication between providers and patients to achieve optimal glycemic control. Nurses and pharmacists can both be invaluable in training for proper glucose meter use, injecting insulin, and answering questions the patient and/or their family may have. Pharmacists need to perform medication reconciliation and verify dosing to prevent adverse reactions. Nursing can monitor treatment progress as well as be alert for adverse medication reactions as well. Only with a full collaborative interprofessional team approach can CFRD patients achieve optimal results. [Level 5]
