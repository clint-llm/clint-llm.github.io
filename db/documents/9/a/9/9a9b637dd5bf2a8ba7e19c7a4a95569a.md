Korsakoff syndrome is a neuropsychiatric condition causing damage to multiple areas of the brain that results in cognitive impairment and amnesia.

Korsakoff syndrome can result from any condition leading to thiamine deficiency but most often seen in chronic alcohol abuse.

Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a clinical diagnosis, andÂ Wernicke encephalopathy should be suspected in anyone at risk for thiamine deficiency who presents with oculomotor findings, ataxia or confusion. Once amnesia and executive deficits are present, Korsakoff syndrome should be suspected.

The key to good outcomes is catching Wernicke encephalopathy early and treating with thiamine.
