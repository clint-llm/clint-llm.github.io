In absolute terms, the most common EIs are iatrogenic. Commonly associated medical conditions include esophageal strictures and achalasia. Iatrogenic EIs can also result from intraoperative injury to the esophagus (e.g., during thoracotomy or neck exploration). In approximately 15% of non-traumatic EIs, the cause is a spontaneous rupture, not otherwise associated with any pre-existing condition. Some causes include forceful vomiting, retching, or increasing in intra-abdominal pressure as seen in Boerhaave syndrome.

Non-iatrogenic, traumatic EI patterns vary depending on mechanistic considerations. In this broad grouping of EIs, penetrating mechanisms predominate. Both stab and gunshot wounds can be problematic because the associated tissue damage may not be immediately apparent, resulting in diagnostic (and therapeutic) delays. Injury patterns and modalities can vary across different geographic areas. For example, gunshot wounds are more common in the United States while stab wounds tend to be more prevalent in other countries. Penetrating cervical EI is present in less than 1% of all penetrating traumas but has been identified in 5% to 12% of all penetrating neck injuries. Penetrating thoracic EIs have been reported to occur in less than 1% of all penetrating thoracic wounds.

Depending on projectile velocity and other characteristics, gunshot wounds can cause significant amounts of shearing, stretch, and blast injury to surrounding tissues. The associated tissue ischemia and full-thickness necrosis may evolve over time, contributing to either a missed diagnosis or delayed presentation, both of which can substantially increase morbidity and mortality. Stab wounds generally cause less injury to surrounding tissues but can difficult to visualize if minimal/focal in character. The increasing availability of advanced imaging for trajectory determination, especially for gunshot wounds, is important in the assessment, diagnosis, and operative planning for EI. This may not be true for stab wounds, mainly to the lesser extent of tissue injury.

Blunt EIs tend to affect the abdominal/distal esophagus and are commonly associated with motor-vehicle crashes. The pathophysiologic mechanism is due to the sudden application of a blunt force to the abdomen, usually with a full stomach. This then leads to the sudden stretching of the gastroesophageal junction, tissue stretching against the hiatal crura, and the presence of shear forces that results in the tearing of the esophageal wall. The lack of an esophageal serosal layer further exacerbates the injury potential and the risk of perforation. Finally, EIs can result secondarily as a result of other nearby anatomic structures either eroding into or puncturing the esophagus. For example, vertebral injuries associated with bony fragmentation can injure the esophagus, especially in the mid-cervical and upper thoracic locations, and in the presence of osteophytes. Mediastinal abscesses and hematomas may also cause external compression of the esophagus and resultant symptoms and/or secondary injury.

Because the esophagus can be considered to be in an anatomically “protected” mediastinal location, it is inherently surrounded by a highly crowded number of other, often critical anatomic structures. Consequently, many traumatic EI's are associated with other, potentially serious injuries to surrounding tissues. This is why some traumatologists consider the presence of EI to be a “marker” for other associated injuries. In fact, nearly 9 out of 10 patients with penetrating esophageal trauma had major associated findings, including tracheal, vascular, pulmonary, diaphragmatic and spinal injuries.
