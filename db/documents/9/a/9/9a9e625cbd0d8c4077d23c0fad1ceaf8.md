Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Acute strokes require hospitalization and neurological evaluation. Other pathologies require management by a physician (e.g., MS, infections, SLE). Most patients with demyelination, infectious, and traumatic etiologies show complete recovery. Patients with cerebrovascular disorders had a less favorable recovery. Recovery is said to be more likely if internuclear ophthalmoplegia is isolated than if other neurological signs accompany it. According to some studies, recovery is also said to be less likely if there was a visible lesion causing internuclear ophthalmoplegia.

The majority of patients with persistent internuclear ophthalmoplegia have minimal symptoms. Those with diplopia may benefit from botulinum toxin injections or Fresnel prisms. Surgical correction of strabismus may be used for patients with wall-eyed bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia.
