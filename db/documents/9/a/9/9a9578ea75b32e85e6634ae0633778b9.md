Mortality ranged from 13% for Mallory-Weiss tear to 34% for gastritis & duodenitis, 38–41% for duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, and oesophagitis, 52% for varices, and 95% for upper GI malignancy. Mortality was also higher for bleeds that occurred as inpatients (54%) than for bleeds presenting at admission (36%). In the case of traumatic hemorrhage, prognosis depends on whether the hemorrhagic site is compressible or non-compressible, the time to medical treatment, and whether a tourniquet is applied or not.
