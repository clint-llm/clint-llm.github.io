**Diagnostic Workup**

**Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Analysis**

Unexplained hypoxemia with a normal chest radiograph should raise the clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE). Widened alveolar-arterial gradient for oxygen, respiratory alkalosis, and hypocapnia are commonly seen findings on ABG, as a pathophysiological response to pulmonary embolism. It is important to note that hypercapnia, respiratory, or lactic acidosis is not common but can be present in patients with massive PE associated with obstructive shock and respiratory arrest.

**Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)**

Elevated BNP has limited diagnostic importance in patients suspected of having PE.

**Troponin**

Serum troponin I and T levels are beneficial prognostically but not diagnostically.

**D-dimer**

D-dimer levels are elevated in plasma whenever there is an acute thrombotic process in the body because of the activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways at the same time. D-dimer testing has high negative predictive value; hence, a normal D-dimer level makes acute PE or DVT unlikely. But since the positive predictive value of elevated D-dimer levels is low, D-dimer testing is not useful for confirmation of PE. As many D-dimer assays are available, providers should become aware of the diagnostic performance of the test used in their clinical setting. The quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has a diagnostic sensitivity of at least 95%. It can be used to exclude the diagnosis of PE in patients with either low or intermediate pretest probability. A negative ELISA D-dimer, along with low clinical probability, can exclude PE without further testing in approximately 30% of suspected patients.

The specificity of D-dimer decreases steadily with age to approximately 10% in patients greater than 80 years of age. The use of age-adjusted cut-offs for patients older than 50 may improve the performance of D-dimer testing in the elderly. In one study, the use of the age-adjusted cut-off instead of the standard D-dimer cut-off of 500 ng/mL or more increased the number of patients in whom the possibility of PE could be ruled out from 6.4% to 30%, without additional false-negative findings.

The formula is age (years) x 10 mcg/L for patients more than 50 years of age. Example: Patient age 75 = age-adjusted d-dimer of 750 mcg/L.

**Electrocardiography (ECG)**

ECG abnormalities, in patients with suspected PE, are nonspecific.

**Chest Radiograph (CXR)**

In PE, CXR is usually normal or might show nonspecific abnormalities such as atelectasis or effusion. It helps to rule out alternative diagnoses in patients presenting with acute dyspnea.

Hampton's hump is a shallow, hump-shaped opacity on CXR in the periphery of the lung, with its base lying against the pleural surface and hump towards the hilum (Figure 1). Westermark's sign is the sharp cut-off of pulmonary vessels with distal hypoperfusion in a segmental distribution within the lung; both of these findings are rare but specific for acute PE.

**Computed Tomographic Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA)**

Multidetector CTPA is the diagnostic modality of choice for patients with suspected PE. It allows appropriate visualization of the pulmonary arteries down to the subsegmental level.

The present data suggest that a negative CTPA result is adequate for the exclusion of PE in patients who have a low or intermediate clinical probability. Besides, it remains controversial whether patients with a negative CTPA and a high clinical probability should be further investigated.

CTPA may be relatively contraindicated in moderate to severe iodinated contrast allergy or renal insufficiency (eGFR less than 30 mL/min per 1.73-meter square). The risk of these contraindications must be measured against the clinical significance of performing the CTPA examination and the availability of other imaging modalities (e.g., V/Q scan). If clinically feasible, CTPA should be postponed for premedication for a history of allergy or intravenous hydration for renal insufficiency.

CTPA can detect RV enlargement and other indicators of RV dysfunction. Enlarged RV has prognostic value, and it is supported by the results of a prospective multicentre cohort study in 457 patients.

**Lung Scintigraphy**

The planar ventilation/perfusion scan (V/Q scan) is an established diagnostic test for suspected PE. V/Q scanning is mostly performed for patients in whom CTPA is contraindicated or inconclusive, or when additional testing is needed. A normal chest radiograph is usually required before V/Q scanning. Scans performed on patients with abnormal chest radiographs are most likely to be false positives because the images do not appear normal or low probability of PE in such patients.

For those with a normal chest radiograph, V/Q scanning remains the test of choice for the diagnosis of PE in pregnancy. Other groups of patients include those who have a history of contrast medium-induced anaphylaxis and patients with severe renal failure.

Planar lung scan results are frequently classified into three-tiers: normal scan (excluding PE), high-probability scan (considered diagnostic of PE in most patients), and nondiagnostic scan.

**Pulmonary Angiography**

In pulmonary angiography, contrast is injected via a catheter introduced into the right heart under fluoroscopy, which was the gold standard in the past for the diagnosis of PE. The diagnosis of acute PE is made on the evidence of a thrombus either as amputation of a pulmonary arterial branch or filling defect.

**Magnetic Resonance Angiography**

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has been assessed for several years regarding suspected PE. However, the results of large-scale studies show that this technique, although promising, is not recommended as a first-line test for the diagnosis of PE due to its low sensitivity, low availability in most emergency settings, and the high proportion of inconclusive MRA scans.

**Echocardiography**

Transthoracic echocardiography can very rarely diagnose PE definitively when the thrombus is visualized in the proximal pulmonary arteries. The diagnosis of PE on echocardiography is supported by the presence of clot in the right heart or new right heart strain, especially in hemodynamically unstable patients with suspected PE wherein echocardiogram may be useful to establish a possible diagnosis and justify the emergency use of thrombolytic therapy.

There are significant considerations with using echocardiography to establish a diagnosis of PE. Given the peculiar shape of the RV, there is no single echocardiographic parameter that gives quick and accurate information on RV size or function. That is why echocardiographic criteria for the diagnosis of PE have varied between different studies. Because of the negative predictive value of 40% to 50%, a negative result cannot exclude PE.

RV dilation is seen in 25% or more of patients with PE on echo and is useful for risk stratification of the disease.

**Compression Ultrasonography (US)**

PE originates from a lower limb DVT in a majority of patients, and only rarely from upper-limb DVT (mostly following venous catheterization). In one study, DVT was found in 70% of patients with proven PE.

Wells criteria and Geneva score are scoring systems most commonly used to estimate the pretest probability of having a PE. This allows the classification of patients with suspected PE into categories of clinical or pretest probability, based on which the diagnostic tests are chosen and interpreted.

Since symptoms of PE are very nonspecific, The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) was developed for emergency department patients to select patients whose likelihood of having PE is so low that diagnostic workup should not even be initiated.absence of PE.

The PERC rule has eight criteria:

• Age <50 years

• Heart rate <100 beats per minute

• Oxyhemoglobin saturation ≥95 percent

• No hemoptysis

• No estrogen use

• No prior DVT or PE

• No unilateral leg swelling

• No surgery/trauma requiring hospitalization within the preceding four weeks

Patients having a low probability of PE who fulfill all eight criteria, the likelihood of PE is sufficiently low that further testing is not indicated.

PERC is only valid in clinical settings with a low prevalence of PE (<15 percent).

**Diagnostic Approach to Hemodynamically Stable Patients with Suspected Pulmonary Embolism**

For most patients with suspected PE who are hemodynamically stable, an approach that combines clinical and pretest probability assessment, D-dimer testing, and definitive diagnostic imaging is usually applied.

**For a Patient with a Low Probability of PE (Wells Score****<2)**

If PERC criteria are fulfilled, there is no need for further testing, and PE can be excluded. If PERC criteria are not met, then D-dimer should be obtained. If D-dimer is negative(<500 ng/ml), PE can be ruled out if D-dimer is positive (>500 ng/ml) in patients age <50 or high after age-adjusted D-dimer value, CT pulmonary angiography should be performed. If CTPA is inconclusive or contraindicated, V/Q scan should be performed.

For a patient with intermediate probability of PE (Wells score 2 to 6)

Measure D-dimer levels, if negative, PE can be excluded. If positive, then CTPA is done. If CTPA is inconclusive or contraindicated, V/Q scan should be performed.

**For a Patient with a High Probability of PE (Wells Score >6)**

CTPA should be performed emergently. Feasibility requires adequate scanner technology, and the patient must be able to lie flat, to cooperate with exam breath-holding instructions, have a body habitus that can fit into the scanner, and no contraindications for iodinated contrast. If inconclusive or not feasible, perform a V/Q scan. V/Q scan could be normal, ruling out PE. It could also have resulted as a "high probability for PE," which would be diagnostic of PE if V/Q scan results as intermediate probability, further testing with lower extremity compression ultrasonography with Doppler is appropriate.

For patients who are hemodynamically unstable and in whom definitive imaging is unsafe, bedside echocardiography or venous compression ultrasound may be used to obtain a presumptive diagnosis of PE to justify the administration of potentially life-saving therapies.
