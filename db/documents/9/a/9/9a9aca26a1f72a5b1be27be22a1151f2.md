CD4 count, although an essential part of HIV management, is not primarily used for the diagnosis of HIV infection. However, an absolute CD4 count of fewer than 200 cells/microliter is one of the criteria utilized by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the definition of AIDS. This clinical-stage indicates high susceptibility to opportunistic infections.
