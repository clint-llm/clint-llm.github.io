**Clinical Domain**: In this domain, particular clinical features suggestive of an underlying CTD are included. While they are specific findings, their presence alone does not allow the diagnosis of a defined CTD. Among the clinical domain features, physical signs include digital fissuring at the distal phalanges (mechanic’s hands), or ulceration at these areas, inflamed joints, or multiple joint morning stiffness that lasts more than sixty minutes, Raynaud phenomenon, palmar telangiectasia, not otherwise explained finger edema, and unexplained fixed rash on the fingers extensor aspects (Gottron sign).

**Serological Domain:**Included in this domain autoantibodies with solid CTD connection (Table 1) and by requiring moderately high titers for less specific autoantibodies, such as antinuclear antibodies ANA ≥ 1:320 or rheumatoid factor (RF) at two or more than two times the higher level of normal.

**Morphological Domain****:**The morphologic domain is subdivided into three underlying sub-domains: radiographic, pathologic, and multi-compartment.

- The radiographic subdomain describes patterns from high-resolution chest tomography (HRCT) that include non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), organizing pneumonia (OP), and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP).

- Pathological subdomain: Patients classified as IPAF had tissue specimens demonstrating non-specific interstitial pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, interstitial lymphoid aggregates, or diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate.

- Since CTD often has intrathoracic extra-parenchymal findings, this showed a need to add a multi-compartment subdomain. Such manifestations incorporate inexplicable pericardial or pleural effusion or thickening, pulmonary vasculopathy, and intrinsic airways disease.
