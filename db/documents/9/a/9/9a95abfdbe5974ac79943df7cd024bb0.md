At the end of the nineteenth century, two pathologists, Julius Arnold (1835-1915) and Hans Chiari (1851-1916), described a complex clinical and pathological condition involving deformity of the cerebellum and brainstem, in children. Chiari malformations are now defined as a spectrum of hindbrain abnormalities involving the cerebellum, brainstem, skull base, and cervical cord. According to the type of herniation of the brain tissue displaced in the spinal canal, and the characteristics of the anomalies of the development of the brain or the spine, four types of Chiari malformations (types I to IV) are classified. Together with basilar invaginations, Chiari malformations represent the most common craniocervical junction malformations seen in adults.

Among Chiari malformations, Arnold-Chiari I malformation, otherwise known as the Chiari type I malformation, is the more common variant. It is characterized by the caudal descent of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum.
