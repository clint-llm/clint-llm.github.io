Suboptimal biotin level is common in pregnancy. Despite a normal dietary biotin intake, about half of the pregnant women in the US are marginally biotin deficient. According to the worldwide neonatal screening survey, the incidence of profound biotin deficiency is one in 112,271, and the incidence of partial deficiency is one in 129,282. The combined incidence of profound and partial deficiency is one in 60089 live births. Biotinidase deficiency has been diagnosed more commonly in children of the White race. Research has observed a higher incidence of biotin deficiency in Brazil, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia.

Worldwide profound biotinidase deficiency is reported to be 1 in 137401; partial biotinidase deficiency is estimated to be 1 in 109,921, and the comprehensive incidence is 1 in 61067. In countries with higher rates of consanguinity, such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey, the prevalence is higher. Neto et al. reported an incidence of 1 per 9,000 population in Brazil.

Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency isÂ observed to be 1 in 87,000.
