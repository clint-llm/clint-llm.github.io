The efficacy and therapeutic index of teprotumumab are assessable with subjective and objective findings. Before starting the drug, the following should be undertaken:

- A thorough history (in particular, a history of diabetes and IBD).

- Physical examination (e.g., measurement of weight and blood pressure).

- Complete ophthalmologic examination (including visual acuity, color vision, exophthalmometry, extraocular motility, anterior segment, and fundus examination).

- Standard clinical laboratory evaluation (e.g., complete blood count, liver function tests, fasting blood glucose, and hemoglobin A1c).

- Objective audiology testing (if available).

Patients with diabetes who receive teprotumumab are advised to have monitoring of blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels and should be co-managed with an endocrinologist. Tests recommended include fasting blood glucose after each of the first two infusions and self-monitoring at least twice a day.

Dosing in both clinical trials involved eight infusions over six months. However, the duration and total infusion numbers are debatable, as an improvement has been reported by injection 2 or 3. Smith et al.Â showed that the therapeutic effects were rapid, with 43% of patients in the teprotumumab group and 4% of patients in the placebo group responding at week 6.

Patients with severe disease who continue demonstrating response at 24 weeks to teprotumumab can be considered for additional infusions using the same dosing schedule.
