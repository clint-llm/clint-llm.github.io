As described previously, hydatiform moles arise from gestational tissue. In complete hydatidiform mole, there is no fetal tissue present; in partial hydatiform moles, there is some residual fetal tissue. Both are due to the over-proliferation of chorionic villi. It is still unclear if the trophoblastic transformation causes vascular obliteration and fetal death or, in another theory, a spontaneous stillbirth causes villous dysmorphism and trophoblastic proliferation.
