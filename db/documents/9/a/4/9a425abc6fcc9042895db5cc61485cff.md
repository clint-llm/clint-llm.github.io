Carotidynia is best managed with an interprofessional team approach. Early recognition of this rare entity is critical to protect patients from unnecessary and possibly harmful investigations. Clinicians must be educated to keep carotidynia in the list of differential diagnoses for lateral neck pain. The importance of a careful history and physical examination in patients with neck pain must not be underestimated, as these might be sufficient to exclude most of the differential diagnoses of neck pain and save patients from unnecessary investigations.
