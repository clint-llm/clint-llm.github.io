Noninvasive imaging modalities such as SPECT, PET, and CMR are playing an increasing role in the assessment of tissue characterization, cardiac function, and area of infarction to further guide patient management and therapeutic strategy. In addition to functional and anatomic information, the pattern and extent of radiotracer uptake, along with the duration of a positive study, provide prognostic information. Using this information allows the clinician to strategize a therapeutic approach with the optimization of medical therapy or revascularization with invasive techniques to improve cardiac dysfunction.

The spectrum of ischemic heart disease can encompass temporary impairment in cardiac function that’s often reversible with restoration of blood flow to infarcted areas from myocyte necrosis, rendering them irreversible. As rates of obesity increase in the United States, the rates of coronary artery disease are also expected to increase concurrently. Various imaging modalities, as discussed above, serve as a key component in the evaluation and management of coronary artery disease. It is important to consider the indication of the study, costs, contraindications, and procedural risks based on the unique characteristics of each patient to decide which is the best study to perform. Appropriate consultation should be considered to ensure appropriate studies are ordered to obtain the intended information.
