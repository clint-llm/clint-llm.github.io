Patients who present with jaundice, fever, and right upper quadrant pain should undergo evaluation for obstructive biliary disease utilizing serology and cross-sectional imaging. If a diagnosis is not possible with cross-sectional imaging, the interprofessional team should consider whether or not ERCP or percutaneous cholangiography is more appropriate. It is important to determine the overall goal of patient management based on the patient’s clinical presentation and comorbidities. Collaboration with all members of the health care team is essential to ensure that successful diagnosis and the appropriate management take place. A radiology nurse can prepare the patient for the procedure and provide post-procedural care and monitoring, reporting to the clinicians of any changes in status. Interprofessional cooperation will enhance the effectiveness of hepatic cholangiography and improve the process as well as the subsequent care through accurate diagnosis leading to better-targeted treatment.
