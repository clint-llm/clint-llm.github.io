Identification of risk factors on clinical history helps to distinguish VLUs from other causes of lower extremity non-healing wounds. Patients with CVI and VLUs often refer pruritus with or without a rash, aching pain in the gaiter area, evening pedal edema, and night cramps.

Early CVI physical findings must be identified on examination. The initial manifestations are telangiectases and reticular veins.

The clinical, etiological, anatomical, and pathophysiological (CEAP) classification is used to document these findings for therapeutic and research purposes.
