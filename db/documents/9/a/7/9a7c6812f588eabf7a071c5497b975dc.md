When EBV is introduced into the oropharynx, the virus begins the replication process. There is a predilection for infection of the B-cells of lymphoid tissue. Subsequently, the infection spreads through the lymphatic system. The body reacts by developing antibodies against the virus. In 90% or more of cases, heterophile antibodies are produced in response to the infection with EBV. EBV is a lifelong infection with periodic reactivation.Â  In poor immune response systems, there is a small risk of EBV-induced malignancy, such as Hodgkin lymphoma.
