The cause of appendicitis is an obstruction of the appendix, either from inflammation of the wall or a fecalith.

- Fecalith (hard stools)

- Appendicoliths (calcified deposits)

- Lymphoid hyperplasia: The appendix containsÂ large masses of lymphoid tissue in the mucosa and submucosa, and is, therefore, prone to develop lymphoid hyperplasia resulting in luminal obstruction.
