Methamphetamine affects the central nervous system (CNS)  by enhancing the release of monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.

- Discharging the monoamines out of their storage and freeing them into the synaptic space by making reversal action of the dopamine transporters

- Obstructing the reuptake of monoamines by preventing the activity of transporters of monoamine[6]

- Methamphetamine can increase the expression of CRE-Luc by TAAR1 in transfected cells. Methamphetamine interacts with TAAR1, which triggers a definite inhibition in dopamine uptake dependent on TAAR1 in transfected cells. Methamphetamine has a similar effect on brain striatal synaptosomes.

- Reducing the dopamine transporters expressions at the cell surface

- The proliferation of the cytosolic levels of monoamines by inhibiting the monoamine oxidase activity

- Enhancing the expression and activity of the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase

Methamphetamine is highly lipid-soluble, which helps to be transferred relatively fast across the blood-brain barrier and has an immediate effect on the CNS.
