- AKs are common premalignant epidermal skin lesions that can transform into squamous cell carcinoma.

- The most important independent risk factor for the development of AKs is chronic sun exposure.

- Patients with AKs may present complaining of skin lesions that are pruritic, painful, and may bleed with minor trauma such as shaving.

- A thorough history and full-body skin exam are essential for AK diagnosis and treatment planning.

- On exam, AKs may appear as scaly, erythematous macules, papules, or plaques on sun-exposed areas of the body.

- A variety of lesion-directed and field-directed treatment options are available for AKs.

- Treatment should be tailored to the clinical presentation, as well as the specific needs of the patient.

- Long-term follow-up of AKs is required to monitor for new lesions, recurrences, and progression to malignancy.

- Patients need to be appropriately educated about the importance of preventative strategies to reduce the risk of AK development and progression.
