All healthcare workers, especially emergency department physicians, nurses, urgent care workers, internists, intensivists, and trauma specialists, must be certified in ACLS. While there are many causes of cardiac arrest, one needs to be aware of pulseless electrical activity, which carries a high mortality rate.

The first step in managing pulseless electrical activity is to start chest compressions according to the ACLS protocol along with using epinephrine, while simultaneously looking for any reversible causes. Once a diagnosis is made, begin immediate management, i.e., decompression of pneumothorax, pericardial drain for tamponade, fluids infusion, correction of body temperature, administration of thrombolytics, or surgical embolectomy for pulmonary embolus. A successful outcome very much depends on the combined efforts of an interprofessional team.
