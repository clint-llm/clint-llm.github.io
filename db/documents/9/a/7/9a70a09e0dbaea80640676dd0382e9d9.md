An impairment in lipoprotein metabolism could lead to catastrophic implications in an affected individual. A pathologic increase in LDL, for example, is a known risk factor in cardiovascular disease as it leads to premature atherosclerotic changes of vessels. Disorders of lipoproteins have both genetic and environmental underpinnings. In Western countries specifically, lifestyle has been identified as an insidious precipitant of these disorders. Studies, campaigns, and public health interventions are underway to encourage positive lifestyle changes to prevent lipoprotein disorders from becoming prevalent.
