Standardizing clinical education on how to discuss death and dying among healthcare providers opens the conversation for patients and their families toÂ palliative care and how to best care for their loved ones. Palliative care is underused which may be due to the stigma related to giving up fighting one's illness or the stigma related to death in our culture. When healthcare providers are more comfortable with this topic, patients and their families are the beneficiaries. The interprofessional team can provide higher quality holistic care.
