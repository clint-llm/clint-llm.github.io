Side effects are common with the administration of general anesthesia. These can include transient confusion or memory loss, dizziness, urinary retention, nausea, vomiting, chills, and sore throat. Older, sicker patients undergoing lengthy procedures are at increased risk of serious complications, including persistent confusion, memory loss, heart attack, pneumonia, thromboembolism, and cerebrovascular accident. Death due to general anesthetic is rare and estimated to be approximately one in 150,000.
