Since most foot ulcer management is done as an outpatient, where the patient must continue a proper level of care outside of a clinical setting, patient education plays a crucial role in managing these patients' conditions. We should provide the patients with proper care, such as home nursing visits, to aid them in daily changes in dressing. The patient should be provided with educational materials on the importance of keeping the dressing dry, clean, and intact and ambulating with proper assistive devices such as a CAM walker, surgical shoe, crutches, and canes.
