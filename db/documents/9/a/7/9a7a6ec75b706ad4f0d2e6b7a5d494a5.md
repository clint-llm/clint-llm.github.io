Women who are at increased risk of breast cancer or endometrial cancer should not begin Estradiol therapy.

Overweight women with exposure to increased estradiol levels in their lifetime should not add supplemental estradiol to their post-menopause regimen.

Women who have angioedema or anaphylactic reaction to estradiol or its components, abnormal genital bleeding, blood clotting disorders such as deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary thromboembolism, cardiovascular disease (a stroke or myocardial infarction), protein C or S  or antithrombin deficiency as well as thrombophilic disorders, or pregnancy are contraindications to estradiol treatment.

Estradiol HRT can increase a patient's risk of cardiovascular disease, DVT, and stroke and, therefore, is not a viable option in at-risk patients.

Women at risk can consider other alternatives such as laser therapy, lubricants, dilators, and even physical therapy to strengthen pelvic floor muscles if patients complain of dyspareunia.
