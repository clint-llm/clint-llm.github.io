In general, laboratory monitoring is not necessary for patients taking amlodipine. Since amlodipine is an antihypertensive medication, clinicians and patients should regularly measure blood pressure to achieve target levels per the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) hypertension guidelines. Furthermore, the healthcare team should monitor patients for adverse side effects such as peripheral edema, dizziness, and flushing.

Amlodipine may increase the AUC of tacrolimus. In one study,Â  amlodipine decreased the tacrolimus clearance by 2.2 to 3.8 folds, increasing AUC and systemic exposure in CYP3A5 expressers. Consequently, monitoring of trough blood levels of tacrolimus is suggested.
