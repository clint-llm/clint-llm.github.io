The first step in evaluating patients who present with the symptoms above would be to exclude mechanical obstruction and peptic ulcer disease. All patients should undergo an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. This should be followed by either a CT scan with oral and intravenous contrast or other imaging such as a small bowel follow-through to exclude obstruction beyond the duodenum. Retained food is seen on endoscopy without mechanical obstruction, and in rare cases, bezoars suggest gastroparesis.

The conventional test that is cost-effective and widely used for gastroparesis diagnosis is measuringÂ gastric emptying by scintigraphy, which is considered the gold standard by many.

Breath testing is another validated study for gastroparesis. Most commonly, 13C-labelled octanoate, a medium-chain triglyceride, is bound to a solid meal and ingested. After emptying from the stomach, it is absorbed by the small intestine and metabolized to 13CO2, which is expelled from the lungs during respiration. Currently, it has limited penetrance into the clinical practice and is performed for clinical research and pharmaceutical studies.

Electrogastrography and gastroduodenal manometry are other tests based on myoelectrical activity that are potentially helpful but are not yet available for widespread clinical use.
