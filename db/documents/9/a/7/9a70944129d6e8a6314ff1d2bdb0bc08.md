**Glabella lines or glabellar rhytids** are the short vertical skin wrinkles between the eyebrows, over the glabella. They are often the first wrinkles to show on the forehead. Glabellar rhytids are usually intermittent and are most prominent when angered or perplexed.

Glabellar rhytids appear deep due to the thick skin of the glabella compared to the crows' feet (wrinkles at the lateral end of the eyes).

**Glabellar tap reflex**is one of the primitive reflexes; tapping the glabella elicits blinking that normally disappear after 4 to 5 taps.****Some works have reported enhanced glabellar tap reflex in patients with anterior cerebral artery infarction.
