The most common variant from canonical anatomy are ovaries that contain cysts. Simple ovarian or function cysts occur naturally with the changing levels of hormones during the menstrual cycle. However, some patients have persistent or extremely large cysts, which leads to an increase in volume; this increases the rate of ovarian torsions. While cysts of any size may cause pelvic pain or cause abnormal bleeding.

Another physiologic variant is the number of ovaries that developed. There have been cases of accessory and supernumerary ovaries as well as patients having a single ovary.

An accessory ovary, which is uncommon, is when there are more than two ovaries attached to the typical ligaments. These ligaments include the utero-ovarian ligament, broad ligament, or the infundibulopelvic ligament.

Supernumerary ovaries, on the other hand, are extremely rare. Unlike accessory ovaries, supernumerary ovaries do not connect via the typical ligaments (utero-ovarian ligament, broad ligament, or the infundibulopelvic ligament) but develop connections to other structures, such as the large intestine, the bladder, or rectum.

These extraneous ovaries are typically smaller and found incidentally during surgery. They may be asymptomatic, or if they do produce symptoms, they are commonly non-specific, including abdominal or pelvic pain. It is common for these ovaries to have cysts, which may play a role in the produced abdominal or pelvic pain. Removal is necessary as they have a higher risk of neoplastic transformation.

Single ovaries are not common, and the etiology is not fully understood, but some prevailing theories include genetic defects or mechanical errors which lead to degeneration of one of the ovaries.

One of the most common pathophysiological variants is in patients with Turner syndrome who have “streaked” or atrophied ovaries. The ovaries start developing and functioning normally, but the ovarian tissue will soon begin to degenerate before birth. Instead of having over two million oocytes, patients with Turner syndrome will have markedly less, thus leading to infertility in the majority of patients. However, cases of spontaneous pregnancy have occurred in a small sub-set that carries the mosaic karyotype. The ovaries are described as “streak ovaries” due to the degenerate tissue forming waves of connective tissue with intermittent groups of granulosa cells.
