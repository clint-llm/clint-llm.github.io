Lymphangiomas result from congenital or acquired abnormalities of the lymphatic system. The congenital form typically occurs before the age of 5 years and is due to improper connection of lymphatic channels to the main lymphatic drainage duct.   Acquired lymphangiomas occur as a sequela of any interruption of previously normal lymphatic drainage such as surgery, trauma, malignancy, and radiation therapy.
