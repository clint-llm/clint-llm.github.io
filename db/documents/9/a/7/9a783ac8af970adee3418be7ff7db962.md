Pancreatic fluid collections, necrotic debris collections, and abscesses are usually complications of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. According to the most recent classifications, complications of acute pancreatitis can be divided into acute, defined as a collection being present for less than 4 weeks, or delayed defined by a collection being present for more than 4 weeks. In the acute phase, the fluid collection is not well defined and is labeled as a peripancreatic fluid collection. After four weeks, the fluid collection becomes much more organized with a definite fibrous wall, and it is then referred to as a pseudocyst. The pseudocyst is a cyst containing pancreatic enzymes, defined by a fibrous wall but lacks an epithelial lining. If this pseudocyst gets infected, it is referred to as a pancreatic abscess.
