The long thoracic nerve and its blood supply are vulnerable to both compression and stretching anterior to the lower segment of the scapula. The subscapular artery via the inferior angle of the scapula is responsible for the blood supply to the lowest four to six digitations of the serratus anterior muscle as well as the peripheral portion of the long thoracic nerve. As such, nerve damage may result after poor epineural blood flow as a consequence of compression or traction of the subscapular artery. Both the long thoracic nerve and its blood supply are anchored to the serratus anterior muscle by the fascia, thus moving with the muscle as it contracts. With arm adduction, the scapula moves anteriorly, while simultaneously bringing the nerve and blood vessels anteriorly as well, out of the way of the scapula. During arm extension, the serratus anterior muscle prevents winging of the scapula, thereby preventing stretching of the nerve and vasculature.
