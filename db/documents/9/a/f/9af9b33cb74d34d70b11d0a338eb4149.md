Heart Failure is a major public health problem and is now the most common cause of hospitalization in the US among patients 65 years and older, and approximately 915000 new cases of heart failure are diagnosed each year in the United States. The increasing prevalence of heart failure is most likely secondary to the aging of the population, increased risk factors, better outcomes for acute coronary syndrome survivors, and a reduction in mortality secondary to improved management of chronic conditions.  Incidence rates for heart failure increase with age for both sexes.

The lifetime risk of developing heart failure for those over age 40 years residing in the U.S. is 20%. The risk and incidence of heart failure continue to increase from 20 per 1000 people age 60 to 65 years to over 80 per 1000 people over age 80.  There are also differences in risk for heart failure based on the population, with African Americans having the highest risk and greater five-year mortality for heart failure than the white population in the U.S.  The European Society of Cardiology states that the prevalence of heart failure is 1 to 2% and rises to greater than 10% in the over 70 population.

**Heart Failure Statistics**

- Heart Failure survival has improved over time, yet the absolute 5-year mortality rates from diagnosis for HF have remained at 50 percent.

- Heart failure is the number one diagnosis among all hospitalizations, and the cost of annual heart failure care exceeds $30 billion every year.

- Most of the cost spent on heart failure patients is for hospitalizations and re-admissions.

**Acute Heart Failure**

While consensus guidelines tend to use the term heart failure to refer to those with established chronic disease, acute heart failure is defined as a more rapid onset of signs and symptoms or the gradual worsening of chronic symptoms that necessitate intravenous treatment. Acute heart failure exacerbation that requires hospitalization tends to occur in the more elderly population mean age of 79 years old with a slightly higher preponderance of women affected than men.
