The differential diagnosis of cutaneous angiosarcoma includes both benign and malignant lesions such as hemangioma, hemangioblastoma, squamous cell carcinoma, Kaposi sarcoma, and anaplastic melanoma. Cutaneous telangiectatic metastatic breast disease should often be considered as well. There have been case reports of angiosarcoma mimicking rosacea and eczema as well as rare reports of mimicking eyelid edema and solid, non-pitting facial edema.
