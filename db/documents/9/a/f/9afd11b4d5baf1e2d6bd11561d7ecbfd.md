Doppler flow imaging relies on ultrasound, and its interpretation can be greatly user-dependent; this is a potential limitation of the study. Modern ultrasounds come equipped with tools to identify flow velocities and volumes. This technique can be incredibly beneficial to the clinician in clinical correlations for conditions such as aortic stenosis, in which ultrasound findings and flow diagnostics are critical to the staging of the disease. Personalized adjustment of ultrasound settings to optimize the image is a skill that is essential to every user of ultrasound and color flow imaging studies.
