The majority of vulvar hematomas are small and can be managed conservatively. However, large (>10 cm in diameter) or progressively enlarging hematomas causing intense pain and distress to the patient require surgical intervention. Urgent surgical management is also warranted if the hematoma is large enough to cause hemodynamic instability, or urological or neurological signs and symptoms.

Conservative management usually involves the use of ice packs, local compressions, bed rest, and analgesics. In the event that conservative management has not been effective, surgery may be performed. In fact, conservative management of large hematomas has been found to be associated with a longer period of hospitalization, greater need for antibiotics, and blood transfusion

Surgical management includes surgical drainage of the hematoma, evacuation of any clots present, ligation of bleeding points, and the assessment for signs of pressure necrosis (a complication of vulva hematoma).

Alternatively, selective arterial embolization may be performed. This procedure was first described by Brown et al.Â for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage.
