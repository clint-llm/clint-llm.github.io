Mitral stenosis (MS) is a progressive valvular disorder that results in left atrial enlargement, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure.

The key physical examination findings in hemodynamically significant mitral stenosis may include irregularly irregular pulse (due to atrial fibrillation), prominent a wave in the jugular venous examination, tapping apex beat, signs of pulmonary hypertension/right-heart failure, an opening snap, and the classic low-pitched, mid-diastolic rumbling murmur with presystolic accentuation.

Medical therapy is used as an initial symptomatic treatment for severe mitral stenosis; however, it does not improve the long-term outcomes of the disease.
