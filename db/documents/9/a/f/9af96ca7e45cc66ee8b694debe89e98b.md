Vibrio vulnificus is a bacterium that causes septicemia, severe wound infections, and gastroenteritis. Failure to recognize and treat this infection promptly leads to high morbidity and mortality. This activity reviews the recognition and treatment of V. vulnificus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in executing a coordinated and effective response.

**Objectives:**
- Review the three discrete presentations of Vibrio vulnificus infection
- Identify predisposing conditions predicting poor outcomes in Vibrio vulnificus infection.
- Summarize laboratory tests that quickly identify the presence of Vibrio vulnificus infection
- Outline the necessary steps that the interprofessional team must coordinate in order to rapidly identify and treat Vibrio vulnificus infection.
