In a substantial portion of patients, an exact cause of sensory neuropathy is not readily apparent, and the disease is considered idiopathic.

Other diseases that may present in a similar clinical fashion include distal acquired demyelinating symmetric neuropathy as well as sensory chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. These symptoms may also mimic those of other radiculopathies, myelopathies, and various autoimmune diseases.
