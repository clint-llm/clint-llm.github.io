A light ray passing through the prism obeys Snell's law.

The characteristics of the light deviated through prism include:

- No magnification/minification of the image

- No change in vergence of the rays

- Disperses incident pencil rays into component colors

- A virtual, erect image is formed

- The image should deviate through the apex of the prism

Prentice's rule measures the deviation produced by the prism.

- D = cF

- c = image displacement in cm

- F = lens power

The deviation of a light ray through prisms depends on not only the power of the prism but also the refractive index of the material it is made up of and the position in which the prism is held. Prisms can be held in three ways â€“ position of minimum deviation, prentice position, and frontal position.

- The position of minimum deviation is defined as the position in which the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of refraction. Plastic prisms are preferably used in the position of minimum deviation, but it is challenging to obtain this in clinical practice.

- Prentice position is defined as the position in which the prism is held perpendicular to the visual axis. This position is used for ophthalmic glass prisms.

- The frontal position is defined as the placement of prism parallel to the frontal plane of the patient.
