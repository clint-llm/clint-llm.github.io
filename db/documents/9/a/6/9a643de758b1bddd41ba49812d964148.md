The triceps brachii can undergo training in a variety of different ways. It can be worked out in isolation or with compound elbow extension movements. It can also be contracted statically to keep the arm straight against resistance.

Examples of isolation movements include lying triceps extensions, behind-the-back arm extensions, cable push-downs, and standing triceps "kickbacks." The compound exercises that work out the triceps include any pressing movements like push-ups, bench presses, close grip bench presses, tricep dips, and military presses.

Static contraction movements include pullovers, straight-arm pull-downs, and bent-over lateral raises, which are also used to build the deltoids and latissimus dorsi.
