Pyocystis is a rare but severe lower urinary tract infection resulting in a collection of infected debris accumulating within the bladder.

In the context of bladder cancer, patients who have supra-vesical diversion usually have a cystectomy.

Though mild cases of pyocystis can be managed with conservative treatments of broad-spectrum antibiotics and intermittent bladder irrigation, a cystectomy may be necessary in cases with resistant infection. There is some debate about whether a cystectomy should be offered at the time of urinary diversion procedures in some cohorts of patients. This is not currently a recommended preventative intervention due to the rarity of pyocystis occurring even in cohorts most at risk relative to the risks of cystectomy.

As pyocytis is a rare condition, there are limited case reports describing it and low numbers of patients involved in the published meta-analysis. This may affect the statistical validity of analysis on occurrence and treatment outcomes.
