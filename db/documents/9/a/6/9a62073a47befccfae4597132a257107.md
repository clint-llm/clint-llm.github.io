Differential diagnosis includes bacterial tracheitis, epiglottitis, foreign body aspiration, hemangioma, peritonsillar abscess, neoplasm, retropharyngeal abscess, and smoke inhalation. It is extremely important to distinguish croup with epiglottitis because of the rapid deterioration in patients. A cough is highly sensitive and specific for croup, whereas drooling is highly sensitive and specific for epiglottis.
