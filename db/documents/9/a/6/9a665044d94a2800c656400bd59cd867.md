Understanding the concept of half-life when establishing dosing schedules is an important first step in the pharmacological treatment of a patient. Arguably more important, though, is the communication of this management plan from physician or pharmacist to the interprofessional care team. Effective communication continues to be a significant determinant of quality care delivery. One literature review suggests that communication requires heavy emphasis before entering clinical settings so that healthcare professionals during training can have an adequate mastery of these skills by the time they have patient interactions.

Unsurprisingly, interprofessional communication has been correlated with patient satisfaction, as well.
