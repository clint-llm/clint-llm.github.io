If a core biopsy identifies atypical ductal hyperplasia, it is important to take a larger excisional biopsy to ensure a large enough specimen to rule out carcinoma of the breast. It is also important to note that on biopsy, low-grade DCIS and ADH share many morphologic similarities. Therefore the pathology specimen at hand should be carefully examined to rule out DCIS.
