The CDC has defined Reye syndrome using the following criteria:

"Acute noninflammatory encephalopathy that is documented clinically by a) an alteration in consciousness and, if available b) a record of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) containing less than or equal to 8 leukocytes/cu.mm or a histologic specimen demonstrating cerebral edema without perivascular or meningeal inflammation.

Hepatopathy documented by either a) a liver biopsy or an autopsy considered to be diagnostic of Reye syndrome or b) a threefold or greater increased in the levels fo the serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) or serum ammonia.

No more reasonable explanation for the cerebral and hepatic abnormalities."

Lab abnormalities associated with Reye syndrome include elevated liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin), hyperammonemia, abnormal coagulation studies, elevated amylase, and lipase, decreased serum bicarbonate and lab values consistent with dehydration. The most common lab finding is an early rise in ammonia occurring within 1 to 2 days of mental status changes. If lumbar puncture is performed to obtain CSF, the leukocyte count must be below 8 to meet diagnostic criteria. Opening pressure may be elevated in later clinical stages of disease but may remain normal early on.
