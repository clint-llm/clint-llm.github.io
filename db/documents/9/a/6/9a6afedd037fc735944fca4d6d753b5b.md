All patients who present to the emergency department for acute alcohol intoxication should be screened for alcohol use disorder. If a patient is found to have alcohol use or dependence, they should be referred for alcohol treatment. In patients who consume alcohol at harmful levels, it is important to intervene early. Presentation to the emergency department for drunkenness should be considered an indicator of pathological use.
