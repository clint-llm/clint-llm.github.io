There are many causes of syncope, and thus, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an emergency department physician, primary care physician, nurse practitioner, cardiologist, neurologist, pharmacist, and specialty trained nurses.

The etiology of syncope varies greatly. Benign causes include dehydration and vasovagal, known as neurocardiogenic syncope. Vasovagal syncope is the predominant cause of syncope worldwide, particularly in young patients. More worrisome etiologies of syncope include dysrhythmias, cardiac conduction disease, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease (such as Brugada, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, and long QT syndrome), acute anemia or gastrointestinal bleed, and pulmonary embolism. All of these etiologies result in the hypoperfusion of the brain and require evaluation in the emergency department. The prognosis depends on the cause.

Nurses are involved in triage, patient monitoring, patient education including discharge instructions. Pharmacists should review prescribed medications, check for drug-drug interactions, and counsel patients on side effects and the importance of compliance. [Level 5]
