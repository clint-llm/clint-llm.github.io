Healthcare professionals can advise patients with allergies about environmental control at home and work. Every attempt to reduce high humidity and to decrease house dust-mite exposure should be done. The bedroom should be clean, mattress covers should be used, and bed linens should be washed regularly. Pets, including cats and dogs, are often the source of allergens and should not be in convivence with the affected patient, nor should living plants and flowers, which are "a sack of antigens." Patients should be encouraged to explore therapeutic options for acute or chronic desensitization for "bad allergens." This may be the only way to control their allergic bronchial asthma.
