The etiology of SCH is multifactorial. In the deoxygenated state, HbS molecules end up binding to each other at the site of the substitution resulting in the formation of long-chain polymers causing sickling of the erythrocytes. This sickling can cause vaso-occlusion intrahepatically leading to ischemic liver damage from sinusoidal obstruction. Recurrent episodes of acute damage can result in chronic liver disease.

When sickling occurs in the liver, it results in dilated sinusoids which causes compression of the biliary tree. A rare yet fatal entity of SCH is acute intrahepatic cholestasis, which also occurs due to sinusoidal sickling. Only this time, it causes diffuse ischemia and diffuse dilation of sinusoids resulting in intrahepatic cholestasis.
