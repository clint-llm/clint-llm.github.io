**Scheduled Teaching Days**

Orthopedic registrars (residents) receive regular teaching; this is often didactic teaching led by senior colleagues or consultants (attendings). To improve learning, we must consider engaging training methods that encourage active participation. Effective simulation-based DP requires structure, and trainees must be facilitated in developing well-defined goals.

**On-the-job Training**

Trainees should plan educational activities or learning events with trainers well ahead of the training activity such as theatre lists or clinics; this will avoid a top-down approach and stop WBAs being considered summative (rather than a formative) based assessment tool. Also, this will manage trainee perception and reduce the likelihood of WBAs being completed as a tick-box activity.
