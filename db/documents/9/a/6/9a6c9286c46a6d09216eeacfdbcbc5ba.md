There have been no serious reported complications of the oral or skin pathergy test in BD patients. The papules and pustules that result from the skin prick usually become maximum in 48 hours and disappear within 45 days.

Complications related to pathergy in PG patients have also been well documented. Surgical debridement of PG ulcers has occasionally resulted in the rapid progression of the ulcers with an exponential increase in size.
