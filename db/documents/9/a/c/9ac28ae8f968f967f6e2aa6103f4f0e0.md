CAH is a relatively common disorder, but the clinical presentation does vary with the severity of enzyme deficiency. Besides disordered genital development, many of these infants present with other systemic features like electrolyte abnormalities and hypoglycemia. Thus, CAH is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a geneticist, endocrinologist, a pediatric surgeon, a fertility expert, and a nurse specialist. Pharmacists review medicines prescribed and drug-drug interactions. Specialty care nurses provide teaching to patients and parents. Nurses communicate changes in patient to conditions the team. Referral to a mental health counselor may be appropriate because many patients develop emotional distress over the ambiguous genitals. These infants need lifelong monitoring because too little or too much glucocorticoids can have detrimental effects. Even as adults, many of these patients need assessment of their genitals because problems like vaginal stenosis and dyspareunia are not uncommon.
