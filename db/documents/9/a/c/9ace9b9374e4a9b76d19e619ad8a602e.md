The molecular structure of calcium pyrophosphate has the potential of triggering inflammatory responses.

Rarely, patients may present with palpable nodules or masses that resemble gout tophi after several episodes of acute CPP crystal arthritis. These nodules localize in the periarticular tissue and represent CPP crystal accumulations within the synovium and adjacent soft tissue; they may lead to further degradation of the affected joint.

A subset of patients may present with spinal involvement, occasionally causing clinical manifestations such as spine stiffness and bony ankylosis resembling ankylosing spondylitis. Some individuals may have clinical manifestations similar to diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) with calcification of the posterior longitudinal ligament leading to spinal cord compression symptoms.
