Many healthcare professionals prescribe H2 blockers, and there are also agents in the class available over the counter. While these drugs are relatively safe, they may produce severe adverse effects when combined with other CNS drugs. Patient education by the pharmacist, nurse, and clinician, working as an interprofessional healthcare team, is key to preventing toxicity and driving improved patient outcomes when using H2 receptor blocking therapy. Pharmacists would do well to check for drug interactions and even inquire of patients in the retail setting if they encounter a patient purchasing H2 receptor antagonists as an over-the-counter option. Patients should be advised not to combine these agents with other CNS drugs/alcohol and refrain from taking them for prolonged periods.
