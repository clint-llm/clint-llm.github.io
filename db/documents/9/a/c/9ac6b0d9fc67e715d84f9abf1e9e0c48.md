In 2010 it was estimated that 8.2 million women and 2.0 million men in the United States had osteoporosis, while approximately 27.3 million women and 16.1 million men had osteopenia.

As stated before, males present with higher mortality risk following a fracture in any site. An observational study in Australia revealed that mortality ratios in women were 2.18 (95% CI 2.03–2.32) for proximal femur, 1.66 (1.51–1.80) for vertebral, and 1.92 (1.70–2.14) for other major fractures, compared to 3.17 (2.90–3.44) for proximal femur, 2.38 (2.17–2.59) for vertebral, and 2.22 (1.91–2.52) for other major fractures in males.

Fracture incidence in men has classically a bimodal peak at 15-45 years and after 70 years. The first peak is likely secondary to traumatic fractures while the second peak is related to osteoporosis or osteopenia.  Men have hip fractures on average 10 years later than women. This fact is especially important in aging populations since both males and females are experiencing longer life expectancy. A 50-year old man has a lifetime risk of osteoporotic fractures of 13-25%, but this frequency depends on other factors, including race, ethnicity, and geography.
