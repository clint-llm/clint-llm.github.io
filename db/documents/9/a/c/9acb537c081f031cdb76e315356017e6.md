The endothelial cells perform several critical actions including but not limited to: maintenance of the tunica intima, regulation of vascular tone, and promotion of antithrombotic activity.

The differences in endothelial continuity are important to the transendothelial exchange between blood, plasma, and the interstitial space. In continuous capillaries, the tight junctions occlude the passage of large molecules, while fenestrated capillaries allow not only the exchange of water but also small solutes. Sinusoidal vessels have gaps between endothelial cells, making them highly permeable.

As previously mentioned, the tunica media of the large vessels contains elastin and elastic fibers primarily. These fibers allow them to respond to pressure coming from the heart by expanding and contracting the wall. This activity is essential to mitigate oscillations in blood flow, allowing blood to reach smaller vessels. Medium and small-size arteries contain less elastic fibers and are rich in smooth muscle cells since they constrict and dilate to distribute blood to the capillary net.

The capillaries are where the exchange of water, solutes, and other molecules occur. After blood exchange, deoxygenated blood passes from the capillary net to the postcapillary venules and later to larger veins and then back to the heart.
