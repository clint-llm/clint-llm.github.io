The principal function of the small intestine is to break down food, absorb nutrients needed for the body, and get rid of the unnecessary components. It also plays a role in the immune system, acting as a barrier to a multitude of flora that inhabits the gut and to make sure no harmful bacteria enter the body.

- The duodenum is the initial portion of the small intestine and is where absorption actually begins. It is often described as being split into four parts: superior, descending, horizontal, and ascending. The superior portion is the only section that is peritoneal; the rest is retroperitoneal. Pancreatic enzymes enter the descending duodenum via the hepatopancreatic ampulla and break down chyme, a mix of stomach acid and food, from the stomach. Bicarbonate is also secreted into the duodenum to neutralize stomach acid before reaching the jejunum. Lastly, the liver introduces bile into the duodenum, which allows for the breakdown and absorption of lipids from food products.Â A significant landmark for the duodenum is the ligament of Trietz, a ligament made of skeletal muscle that tethers the duodenal-jejunal flexure to the posterior wall.

- The primary function of the jejunum is to absorb sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids. Both the jejunum and ileum are peritoneal.

- The ileum absorbs any remaining nutrients that did not get absorbed by the duodenum or jejunum, in particular vitamin B12, as well as bile acids that will go on to be recycled.
