The paramesonephric ducts, otherwise known as the Mullerian ducts, form in female embryos at around week five or six due to the absence of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH). With estrogen stimulation, the cranial ends of these ducts eventually form the fallopian tubes. Caudally, the paramesonephric ducts fuse in the midline and ultimately form the uterus and superior vagina. Most cranially, a remnant of the paramesonephric duct may persist as a vestigial structure called the vesicular appendage or the hydatid cyst of Morgagni.
