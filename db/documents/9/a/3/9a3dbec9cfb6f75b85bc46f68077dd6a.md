Henoch-Schönlein purpura is an IgA-mediated immune vasculitis involving the small vessels of the joints, kidneys, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, skin, and less commonly, the central nervous system and lungs. Patients with this disorder typically present with gastrointestinal complaints, palpable purpura, arthralgias, and renal involvement. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Henoch-Schönlein purpura and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Henoch-Schönlein purpura.
- Describe the role of IgA in the pathophysiology of Henoch-Schönlein purpura.
- Outline the management of Henoch-Schönlein purpura.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to be aware of the possible complications and improve outcomes for patients affected by Henoch-Schönlein purpura.
