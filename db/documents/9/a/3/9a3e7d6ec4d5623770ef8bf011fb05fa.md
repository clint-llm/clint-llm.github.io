Venous thrombosis refers to the formation of a platelet and fibrin clot within the vascular lumen. Clinically significant thrombi are formed in vessels with large lumens, such as the deep veins of the legs, pelvis, and arms. The clot can then propagate with proximal extension. Clinical symptoms of the thrombus are seen when the clot propagates enough to have obstruction of vascular flow. If the clot dislodges, it can then embolize to a distant site. The most common site of embolization for these clots is in the pulmonary vasculature. Obstruction to pulmonary vascular flow can cause impaired gas-exchange, alveolar edema, or even pulmonary alveolar necrosis. Chronic repetitive pulmonary embolization can lead to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and, eventually, pulmonary hypertension.Â In the presence of cardiac abnormalities such as a patent foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect, paradoxical embolism of the clot into the systemic arterial vascular can occur.
