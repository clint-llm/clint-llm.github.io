The mylohyoid nerve innervates the mylohyoid muscle. The inferior alveolar nerve is a branch from the posterior division of the mandibular division (V3) of CN V (trigeminal nerve). The mylohyoid nerve is a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve which contains both sensory and motor components.

The mylohyoid nerve forms before the inferior alveolar nerve enters the mandibular foramen. The mylohyoid nerve travels in the mylohyoid groove located within the medial portion of the ramus towards the medial pterygoid muscle. Within this portion of the mandible, the mylohyoid nerve travels anteroinferior and pierces the sphenomandibular ligament. It continues its course until it meets the inferolateral segment of the mylohyoid muscle where it yields motor branches to innervate both the mylohyoid muscle inferiorly and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle superiorly. The mylohyoid nerve also carries afferent sensory innervation to the mandibular molars and the skin inferior of the chin and lower lip. Additionally, when the mylohyoid nerve approaches the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle, it is associated with the medial aspect of the submandibular gland.
