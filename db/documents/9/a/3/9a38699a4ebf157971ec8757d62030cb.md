Considering thatÂ postherpetic neuralgia is difficult to treat and outcomes are variable, prevention is of paramount importance. Therefore, primary care physicians and geriatricians are tasked with administering vaccinations to at-risk populations. When preventative measures fail or are never instituted, experts in the field of pain management who have experience with the condition and multimodal treatment techniques should be consulted. An interprofessional approach to managing patients with postherpetic neuralgia is the best way forward.
