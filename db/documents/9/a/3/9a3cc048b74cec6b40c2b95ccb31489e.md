All patients with sickle cell disease should be referred to the ophthalmologist for detailed peripheral retinal examination by indirect ophthalmoscopy through a dilated pupil. This should be repeated annually from the age of 10 years. Fluorescein angiography is the ideal investigation for evaluation of retinal blood flow and detection of neovascularization. OCT may help reveal areas of macular thinning.

Annual fundus examinations after the second decade are recommended in all patients with thalassemia. Those with angioid streaks require close follow up with fundoscopy and fluorescein angiography for early detection and appropriate management of choroidal neovascularization. Patients with suspected DFO retinopathy may be evaluated by fluorescein angiography, OCT, Microperimetry, ERG, and EOG, all of which show signs of widespread damage. A key examination in DFO retinopathy is fundus autofluorescence, which may be abnormally increased or decreased bilaterally and correlates with the extent of RPE damage.
