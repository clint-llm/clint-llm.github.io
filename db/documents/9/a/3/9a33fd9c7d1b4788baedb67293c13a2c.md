An M-plasty is an excisional technique used to remove standing cutaneous deformities, also known as dog ears, from the end of a linear wound repair. Dog ears arise from the bunching of tissue when overly obtuse angles (>30 degrees) are used at the ends of surgical excisions. Many different techniques address dog ears. The primary non-excisional technique involves distributing the excess skin on one side of the incision evenly relative to the other side by placing sutures at larger intervals on the longer side of the incision relative to the shorter side. This approach may not work in all situations and is dependent upon the amount of excess tissue and the length of the wound. For example, this technique will have a limited impact on short incisions or large dog ears. The most commonly employed surgical option to remove a dog ear is to excise the excess tissue directly. A triangular piece of tissue, known as a Burow's triangle, can be removed anywhere along the length of the incision. Typically, a Burow's triangle is taken at the end of the incision, increasing the scar's final length.

An M-plasty is an alternative to this technique and has the additional benefit of shortening the final wound length to conserve normal tissue.
