PVB procedures can be accomplished via anastomosis with any of the main arteries except those located in the head.

Arteries within the upper extremity and chest that may require bypass include:

- **Subclavian artery**– located between the anterior and medial scalene muscles

- **Axillary artery**– originating at the lateral aspect of the first rib

- **Brachial artery**– a continuation of the axillary artery as it passes the inferior margin of the teres major muscle, which bifurcates at the level of the antecubital fossa into the radial and ulnar arteries

- **Radial artery**– located on the lateral aspect of the ventral lower arm

- **Ulnar artery**– located on the medial aspect of the ventral lower arm

Arteries often bypassed within the lower extremity include:

- **Common Femoral Artery**– a continuation of the external iliac artery, running into the thigh distal to the inguinal ligament

- **Superficial Femoral Artery**– the continuation of the common femoral artery after it gives off the profunda femoris artery

- **Popliteal artery**– a continuation of the superficial femoral artery after passing through the abductor canal, running dorsally and medially in the popliteal fossa, and then bifurcating into the anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries

- **Anterior Tibial Artery –**courses through the anterior compartment of the leg, having originated posterior to the tibia at the distal aspect of the popliteus muscle

- **Posterior Tibial Artery –**courses through the posterior compartment of the leg, having originated at the tibial-peroneal trunk from the popliteal artery

- **Peroneal (Fibular) Artery –**courses through the lateral compartment of the leg, originating at the tibial-peroneal trunk from the popliteal artery

Arteries often bypassed with the abdomen include:

- **Abdominal Aorta –**a continuation of the thoracic aorta after passing through the diaphragm at the level of T12

- **Common Iliac –**arises from the bifurcation of the aorta at the level of the 4 Lumbar Vertebrae

- **External Iliac –**a continuation of the common iliac, following the medial aspect of the psoas major muscles
