The common complaints that bring attention to cognitive decline are memory loss, a decline in daily functioning, confusion, deteriorating language skills, and changes in behavior.

As a result, the patient might have one or more of the following on physical examination: decreased hearing, decreased vision, psychomotor slowing, and decreased Achilles reflex. In normal aging, attention span, simple copy, procedural memory as well as remote memory stay intact while multitasking capability, learning of new information, time of reaction, cognitive processing speed, and language fluency decline.

Patients with MCI tend to be aware of their impaired memory and are commonly troubled by it. This awareness is lost in patients with dementia, particularly in AD.

Close friends and family members must be interviewed separately from the patient to gather collateral information. The progression from MCI to dementia is also considered when the number of family member and friend-reported symptoms is greater than the patient-reported symptoms.

The patient or family members might explain that the patient quickly forgets things, has trouble putting objects in the correct places at home, repeats stories and questions, has wording finding difficulty, others fill in missing words while the patient is speaking, has difficulty learning new routines, hyperorality, behavioral changes, and may have some delusions.
