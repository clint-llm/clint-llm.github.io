The prompt identification of ureteral injury is often difficult; therefore, whenever a patient undergoes a procedure with a higher risk for ureteral manipulation/injury, there should be a high index of suspicion for ureteral injury. Likewise, several trauma scenarios should raise suspicion for ureteral injury, including penetrating wounds in proximity to the ureter or sudden deceleration injuries. UPJ avulsion is more common in children because their spine is more mobile, which allows spine hyperextension that can cause UPJ avulsion.

Delayed diagnosis can present as persistent flank or abdominal pain, flank mass, prolonged ileus, urinary tract infection, or hydronephrosis and elevated creatinine and BUN. If a patient has an abdominal drain after surgery and has prolonged high output, this can be another potential indicator of ureteral injury. Hematuria may be present, but the absence of hematuria does not exclude ureteral injury, and in fact, hematuria is not a reliable finding in ureteral injuries.
