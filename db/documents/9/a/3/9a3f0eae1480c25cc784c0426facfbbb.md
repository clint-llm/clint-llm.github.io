**Pressure Release Device**

The release of pressurized gas can be hazardous, and extreme caution should be exercised. Gas pressure levels should be reduced from stored high pressure to a workable, usable level. A pressure regulator should be used in this situation, and any time contents are being removed or used from the cylinder. Do not tamper with pressure-release devices. Do not use any cylinders with visibly defective pressure-release devices. Pressure-release devices and gas outlets should never be pointed in any direction that could cause harm.

While attached to an anesthesia machine, the cylinder valves should be in the off position while not in use. This is to prevent leakage and to allow for notification via an alarm of failure of the pipeline supply of gas. If the cylinder were to be left open and a pipeline gas supply failure occurred, the anesthesia machine would consume the oxygen in the cylinder, and the provider would not be notified until the cylinder was depleted.

**Safe Usage**

A cylinder should be inspected for malfunctions and defects before use. Full cylinders are usually placed with a tamper-evident seal. This is generally a tear-off seal on the valve outlet and is removed before use. Proper cylinder inspection includes the outlet, pin index safety system, and pressure relief device. The valve outlet should be cleaned before use. Only use cylinders marked with DOT (Department of Transportation) or ICC (Interstate Commerce Commission). In Canada, cylinders may be marked with BTC (Board of Transportation Commissioners) or CTC (Canadian Transport Commission). A cylinder should be connected to a regulator to reduce the compressed, stored pressure to a working, usable pressure. Inspect the regulator for signs of damage or foreign materials.

**Safe Storage and Transportation**

Cylinders must be stored upright and secured using a rack, strap, or chain to minimize the chance of falling over. Cylinders should be transported using a cart or carrier. Never drop or hit cylinders, and never drag, roll, or slide cylinders, even for a short distance. Only qualified personnel should refill cylinders. While using cylinders, avoid flammable substances, smoking, open flame, or any other incendiary sources. Cylinders should be stored in a dry, cool, well-ventilated area away from exposure to weather. Cylinders should be stored at temperatures less than 125^oF (52^oC).

Oxygen cylinders have more specific storage requirements than other medical gases. While oxygen cylinders can be stored in the same space as other non-flammable medical gases as long as they are properly segregated, full oxygen cylinders and empty oxygen cylinders cannot be stored together. The separation of full and empty cylinders prevents the accidental usage of an empty cylinder during an emergency. Partially full oxygen cylinders may be stored in the same location as full cylinders, provided that they are adequately labeled.
