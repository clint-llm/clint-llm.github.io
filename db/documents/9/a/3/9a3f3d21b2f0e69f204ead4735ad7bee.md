A local anesthetic (lidocaine 1% or 2% with or without epinephrine) may be administered before skin incision depending on the acuity of the situation and status of the patient. Try to palpate the saphenous vein anterior to the medial malleolus (harder to locate in patients with hypovolemic shock). Have all equipment open and available before making the skin incision.
