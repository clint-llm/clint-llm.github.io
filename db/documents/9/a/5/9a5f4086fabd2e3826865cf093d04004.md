**Epidural Hematoma**

Initial evaluation includes airway, breathing, and circulation as patients can rapidly deteriorate and require intubation. A detailed neurologic examination helps identify neurologic deficits. With increasing intracranial pressure there may be a Cushing response (hypertension, bradycardia, and bradypnea). Emergent CT head without contrast is the imaging choice of the test due to its high sensitivity and specificity for identifying significant epidural hematomas. Historically cerebral angiography could identify the shift in cerebral blood vessels, but cerebral angiography has been supplanted by CT imaging.

Laboratory studies should also be considered including a complete blood count to check for thrombocytopenia, coagulation studies (PTT, PT/INR) to check for coagulopathy, and a basic metabolic panel to check for electrolyte abnormalities.

**Subdural Hematoma**

After ensuring the medical stability of the patient, a detailed neurologic exam can help identify any specific neurologic deficits. Most commonly a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head without contrast is the first imaging test of choice. An acute subdural hematoma is typically hyperdense with chronic subdural being hypodense. A subacute subdural may be isodense to the brain and more difficult to identify.

Laboratory studies should also be considered including a complete blood count to check for thrombocytopenia, coagulation studies (PTT, PT/INR) to check for coagulopathy, and a basic metabolic panel to check for electrolyte abnormalities.

**Subarachnoid Hemorrhage**

Initial evaluation includes assessing and stabilizing the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs). Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage can rapidly deteriorate and may need emergent intubation. A thorough neurologic examination can help identify any neurologic deficits.

The initial imaging for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage is computed tomography (CT) head without contrast. If the patient is given contrast, this can obscure the subarachnoid hemorrhage. Acute subarachnoid hemorrhage is typically hyperdense on CT imaging. If the CT head is negative and there is still strong suspicion for subarachnoid hemorrhage a lumbar puncture should be considered. The results of the lumbar puncture may show xanthochromia. A lumbar puncture performed before 6 hours of the subarachnoid hemorrhage may fail to show xanthochromia. Additionally, lumbar puncture results may be confounded if a traumatic tap is encountered.

Identifying the cause of non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage will help guide further treatment. Common workup includes either a CT angiogram (CTA) of the head and neck, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck, or diagnostic cerebral angiogram of the head and neck done emergently to look for an aneurysm, AVM, or another source of subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Laboratory studies should also be considered including a complete blood count to check for thrombocytopenia, coagulation studies (PTT, PT/INR) to check for coagulopathy, and a basic metabolic panel to check for electrolyte abnormalities.

**Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage**

Once the medical stability of the patient is ensured, CT head without contrast is the first diagnostic test most commonly performed. The imaging should be able to identify acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage as hyperdense within the parenchyma. Depending on the history, physical and imaging findings and patient an MRI brain with and without contrast should be considered as tumors within the brain may present as intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Other imaging to consider include CTA, MRA, or diagnostic cerebral angiogram to look for cerebrovascular causes of the intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Evaluation should also include a complete neurologic exam to identify any neurologic deficits.

Laboratory studies should also be considered including a complete blood count to check for thrombocytopenia, coagulation studies (PTT, PT/INR) to check for coagulopathy, and a basic metabolic panel to check for electrolyte abnormalities.
