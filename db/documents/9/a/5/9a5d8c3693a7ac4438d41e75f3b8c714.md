Growth abnormalities are often seen with early childhood bronchopulmonary sequestration. Although various theories could explain this, including recurrent infection, high output failure, shunting of blood from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract resulting in malabsorption is possible.

Hemoptysis is the most common complication in adulthood due to high pressure derived from systemic vessels. Hemorrhagic pleural effusion is also common with fibrinoid necrosis in the sequestered tissue.

Recurrent infection is common in intralobar sequestration, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most commonly identified agent. Other agents include tuberculosis, Nocardia, or Aspergillus.

Rare cases of extra lobar sequestrations communicating with the GI tract have been reported and need barium studies for diagnosis.

Finally, there has been reported the development of malignant tumors within intralobar sequestration.
