The original CA 125 test is a homologous double-determinant assay wherein the capture and tracer antibodies are the same. The OC 125 antibody would be adsorbed onto the solid phase (capture antibody), followed by the addition of the serum. The OC 125 moieties on the CA 125 antigen would then bind to the antibody. Finally, a second radiolabelled (IRMA) or an enzyme-labeled (EIA) antibody would be added (tracer antibody), which would bind to the antigen-antibody complexes.
