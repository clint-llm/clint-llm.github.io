Craniosynostosis, in association with facial bone maldevelopment and brachysyndactyly, are the major diagnostic clues for PS.

Elbow ankylosis, cloverleaf skull, broad toes, and visceral anomalies are typical of PS, type II.

Type III PS is almost similar to type II except in the absence of a cloverleaf skull.

Visceral anomalies are common in types II and III PS.
