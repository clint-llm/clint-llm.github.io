All suspected or confirmed Galeazzi fractures will require orthopedist consultation. While awaiting consult, patients should be placed in a sugar-tong splint. In most cases, conservative management is indicated in children while surgical intervention is warranted in adults. Prior reports suggested treatment with closed reduction and immobilization alone, in adults, yielded poor outcomes in greater than 90% of patients.

**Initial Management**

Initial management for a presumed fracture includes rest, ice, immobilization, and elevation. In most cases, closed reduction of the radius followed by reduction of the ulna in the DRUJ should be attempted in the acute setting.

**Pediatrics**

Children tend to have overall better long-term outcomes compared to adults. The approach is usually conservative with closed reduction and splinting. Above-elbow casting in supination is the preferred immobilization. Irreducible and unstable injuries, as well as variants of the Galeazzi fracture, may require surgical intervention with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).

**Adults**

Adults tend to have poor outcomes with closed reduction and immobilization. Multiple reports have shown high rates of nonunion and secondary displacements with conservative management. Surgical intervention is the preferred intervention. The radial shaft fracture is first repaired with rigid fixation. Intra-operatively, after rigid fixation of the radius, the DRUJ stability should be assessed while in supination. If the joint is stable, two K-wires pinned. If instability is noted, the TFCC should be repaired followed by pinning.  If an ulnar styloid fracture accompanies the unstable DRUJ, the TFCC should be repaired followed by fixation of the styloid using a lag screw or tension band wire. Patients with irreducible DRUJ will require open reduction with the removal of obstructing soft tissue and repair of the TFCC. Patients are placed in an above the elbow splint/cast in supination.

As with all fractures, length of recovery is dependent on multiple variables including the severity of the injury, individual's ability to heal, and the intended use of the extremity. Rehabilitation usually begins six to eight weeks after surgical fixation. The goal of rehab is the return of full range of motion and fine motor skills with the absence of pain. Full return to activity depends upon the severity of the injury as well as the patient’s intended use of their upper extremities. Manual workers and athletes may require more prolonged rehabilitation. Typical return to full activity in patients with low physical demands can happen after 8 to 12 weeks. Patients with high demand activity (manual workers and athletes) may need up to 12 to 16 weeks of rehab. Surgical hardware is usually permanent, with less than 10% of patients needing hardware removal.
