Signs and symptoms will vary on a case-by-case basis but will be similar in presentation to hyperglycemic DKA, although perhaps without polyuria, polydipsia, or severe mental status changes. EDKA patients can present with nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, generalized malaise, lethargy, loss of appetite, fatigue, or abdominal pain. Patients may not have polydipsia or polyuria since serum glucose is normal. The onset can be more insidious compared to hyperglycemic DKA due to the mechanism of subacute starvation required to induce ketosis and dehydration. There may or may not be an inciting infection or stressors, such as pregnancy, surgery, pancreatitis, alcohol use, or fasting.

Patients may present with deep, rapid breathing, known as Kussmaul respiration, which represents respiratory compensation for severe metabolic acidosis. They may have a fruity odor to their breath due to the loss of acetone. Tachycardia, hypotension, altered mentation, increased skin turgor and delayed capillary refill are all signs of total body fluid loss. In severe cases, severe dehydration and metabolic derangement can lead to hypovolemic shock, lethargy, respiratory failure, coma, and death.
