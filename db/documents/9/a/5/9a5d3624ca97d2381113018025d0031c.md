Acute attacks of acute intermittent porphyria usually last for up to a week.

The symptoms progress as follows:

The**abdominal pain**is typically severe, epigastric, and colicky. It tends to last for several days. It can be associated with constipation and vomiting.

Patients can present with a broad spectrum of **psychiatric symptoms,**such as depression**,**which are accompanied by concurrent abdominal and/or neurologic symptoms. A study conducted in Sweden demonstrated an increased risk of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in patients with AIP, as well as in their relatives.

**Peripheral****neuropathies**can manifest as a weakness that begins in the lower extremities and ascends, although any nerve distribution may be affected. This presentation can mimic Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). Hypertension and tachycardia secondary to autonomic neuropathies can also occur.

**Central nervous system**signs may include delirium, weakness with progression to quadriplegia and respiratory failure, cortical blindness, and even coma. In 5% of cases, patients can develop seizures, with partial seizures being the most common subtype.

In conventional terms, patients have been reported to be completely free of symptoms in between the attacks. However, it is also suggested that 20% to 64% of patients may suffer from disabling chronic manifestations such as pain, nausea, fatigue, and neuropathic features, including numbness and tingling sensations.
