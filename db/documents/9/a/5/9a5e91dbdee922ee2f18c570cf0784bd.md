Sulfonylureas bind to and inhibit the ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K) on the pancreatic beta cells. As a result, potassium efflux decreases, and the beta-cell membrane depolarizes. Membrane depolarization causes calcium channels to open, leading to calcium influx and increased intracellular calcium, which stimulates insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cells.

The SUR1 is mostly present in the brain and on the beta cells in the pancreas. SUR2 is present in the cardiac muscle (as isoform SUR2A) and the smooth muscle (as isoform SUR2B). Sulfonylureas differ in their affinity to the SUR subtype receptors and their efficacy in closing the K channels. Unlike the other sulfonylureas, glimepiride has a lower affinity to the cardiac muscles and is not associated with cardiovascular safety concerns.
