Vestibular and cognitive behavior therapy are the best options for helping patients return to their activities of daily living.Â The earlier a patient receives vestibular and cognitive behavioral therapy, the better their outcome. Vestibular therapy can be helpful for the management of unsteadiness and balance-related issues. In addition, vestibular therapy can help patients manage events that exacerbate their symptoms. Cognitive-behavioral therapy can aid in patients learning to cope with their anxiety related to their symptoms.
