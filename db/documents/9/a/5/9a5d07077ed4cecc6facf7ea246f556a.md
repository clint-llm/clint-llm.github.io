The relatively recent use of biological agents such as ricin and anthrax demonstrates how even small-scale biological warfare attacks will quickly become international news. Once a patient has been diagnosed with a disease caused by a biological warfare agent, healthcare providers will be responsible for communicating with numerous colleagues and staff and public health officials, law enforcement agencies, members of the media, and elected officials. In attacks involving numerous casualties or high-profile targets such as elected officials, the marshaling of resources to respond will almost certainly reach the national level.

Important communication points early in patient care among the interprofessional healthcare team, including clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and public health officials, will include adequate decontamination of the patient and appropriate precautions for first responders and hospital staff to avoid the spread of contagious diseases or additional casualties. Training and education before such an event will be more effective than just-in-time training after an event has occurred when emotions run high and resources may run low. In large-scale events, it will be essential for healthcare staff to have a clear understanding of their available resources as well as the anticipated demands on those resources, and continuously communicating with government officials to access medical supply stockpiles and resources for the capacity to treat large numbers of patients will be vital.
