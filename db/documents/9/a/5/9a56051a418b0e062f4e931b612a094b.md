The entire nervous system forms starting from the neural plate, a thickening of the ectoderm present at the level of the floor of the amniotic sac. During the third week of embryonic life, the plaque forms two neural folds, which join together to form the neural tube and the neural canal; the process of formation of the neural tube is called neurulation. The cells placed on the free edge of each neural fold detach from the union line and form the neural crests, situated along the sides of the neural tube. Cell types derived from neural crests include spinal and sympathetic ganglia cells, melanocytes, and Schwann cells of peripheral nerves.

Around the fifth week, one can start to see the growth of the first spinal nerves towards our own myotomes.
