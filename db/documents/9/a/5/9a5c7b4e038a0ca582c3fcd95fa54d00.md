There are multiple indications for central line placement:

- Drug administration - vasopressors, chemotherapeutic agents, or hypertonic solutions are damaging to peripheral veins and often require the placement of a central line.

- Prolonged intravenous therapies - medications that need to be delivered for extended periods of time like parenteral nutrition or intravenous antibiotics are administered through a central line.

- Difficult peripheral venous access - when it is difficult to maintain peripheral venous access like in obese patients, scarred veins from previous cannulations, and the agitated patients then a central line is placed.

- Monitoring - central venous line is also maintained to monitor central venous pressure, central venous oxygen saturation, and directing fluid resuscitation.

- Special treatment - hemodialysis, plasmapheresis, and transvenous cardiac pacing require central venous access.

Any patient requiring these during their hospital stay will need appropriate care to maintain and use this central access. The care should encompass a routine of insertion checks, daily monitoring, monitoring as the patient's condition changes, and clinical governance standards to ensure they are used correctly.

The daily care of the CVC insertion site should concentrate on keeping the area dry, clean, and uncontaminated.
