Although it occurs very uncommonly, an untreated stye may evolve into a localized cellulitis of the eyelid and surrounding skin. Periorbital, or rarely, orbital cellulitis, may ensue if progression of the infection is allowed to occur. Any worsening erythema and edema beyond a localized pustule should be monitored closely for cellulitis, which may require systemic antibiotics. For infections that are not well localized, blood tests including a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and blood cultures may be needed, in addition to an orbital CT scan if orbital cellulitis is a possibility.

Blepharitis is a related condition that involves inflammation of the eyelid margin characterized by erythematous, pruritic eyelids, conjunctival injection, crusting or matting of the eyelids, and occasionally flaking of the eyelid skin. In contradistinction to hordeolum and chalazion, blepharitis should not have a discrete nodule within the eyelid. Treatment involves warm compresses, gentle washing of the eyelids with warm water or diluted baby shampoo, and if these attempts are unsuccessful, a topical antibiotic such as erythromycin.
