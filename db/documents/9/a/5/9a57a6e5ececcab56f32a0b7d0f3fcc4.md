# Introduction

Therapeutic communication as a concept emerged early in medicine and has since shown significant benefits borne out in research. Two of the earliest reported cases of therapeutic communication, which primarily involved the idea of the therapeutic relationship and the benefits of such a relationship, were documented during the moral treatment era of asylums.

In the late 1800s, Florence Nightingale had previously commented on the importance of the “communication that develops between the nurse and the patient” in the late 1800s.

In the 1950s, Harry Stack Sullivan and Jurgen Ruesch, prominent figures in interpersonal theory and communication, respectively, both published the importance of communication in providing therapeutic benefit, specifically in mental illness.

Of note, Hildegard Peplau published her original paper in 1952 and later published subsequent reviews and revisions in 1991 and 1997, which provided a foundation for the concept of therapeutic communication.

“Therapeutic communication” ultimately emerged as a term in PubMed-indexed literature as early back as 1964 to 1965, in the setting of psychotherapy, psychiatry, sociology, medicine, rehabilitation, and nursing literature.

# Function

Since the emergence of therapeutic communication as a concept in literature, it has been studied in various contexts. However, the definition of therapeutic communication has varied depending on the author and the context.  C. M. Rossiter, Jr. brought this to attention in 1975, outlining several issues to consider with the definition of therapeutic communication.

Later, a now generally accepted definition of therapeutic communication was proposed by Gwen van Servellen in 1997.  In her text, therapeutic communication was defined as an exchange between the patient and provider using verbal and non-verbal methods. The ultimate goal of this communication style was considered to help the patient overcome some form of emotional or psychological distress.

# Issues of Concern

**Personalize the Communication**

Medical diagnoses are commonly accepted as providing a classification of understanding etiologies, epidemiology, and pathophysiology of signs and symptoms that frequently cluster. In turn, these diagnoses provide a way of categorizing and providing treatment, prognosis, support, and education to patients with the same diagnosis.

Simultaneously, identifying and appreciating individual differences between patients is often considered important, as these differences account for many healthcare outcomes.

**Specific Techniques**

Specific therapeutic communication techniques have been discussed as early on as 1969 by Goldin and Russell and have been reiterated and expanded upon since then.

These techniques are summarized in the following table:

**Technique**

**Explanation**

Genuine therapeutic relationship

Present oneself in a genuine and boundaried manner to foster a therapeutic relationship.

Respect privacy and try to minimize interruptions

Depending on the setting, close the door or the curtain to demonstrate respect for the patient's privacy.

Introduce yourself using first and last names and refer to the patient by “Mr.,” “Mrs.,” “Miss,” or another appropriate term

This can demonstrate respect for the patient, their dignity, and their autonomy. Consider gender neutrality and preferred pronouns.

Social pleasantries to start the interview

This may help put the patient at ease.

Open-ended questioning

Ask open-ended questions to begin the interview and allow free-flow discussion prior to closed-ended questioning.

Active listening techniques

Foundation for therapeutic communication that itself can be therapeutic.

Non-verbal and verbal cues to continue the conversation.

Nodding one's head and using statements like, “Uh-Huh,” “I see,” and “Go on” can encourage the patient to provide history and demonstrate that they are being listened to.

Reflecting

Repeat back what the patient said, sometimes word for word, to demonstrate active listening.

Exploring feeling tones

Identify and empathize with the emotional state of the patient, and reflect this to the patient.

Silence

Demonstrate attentiveness by minimizing interrupting the patient.

Clarify

Provide guiding statements to help the patient clarify statements and to obtain additional information.

Provide rationale

Provide rationale upfront regarding the need for information and treatment recommendations.

Non-verbal communication through expression, stance, and gestures

Use eye contact and facial expressions demonstrating interest, leaning forward to signify active listening, and sitting near the patient.*

Summarizing

Summarize what the patient said in the provider’s own words to demonstrate active listening, develop a shared understanding, and occasionally complete the interview.

*Note that eye contact and sitting near the patient for some individuals, including those with psychotic disorders and paranoia, could be destabilizing and should be used with caution. In cases where provider safety is uncertain, consider sitting at a safe distance without making the patient feel isolated.

**Common Pitfalls**

Additionally, there are several commonly used approaches with negative therapeutic value. These are summarized in the following table.

**Pitfalls**

**Explanation**

Value judgments

Identify one’s personal biases and judgments, and avoid placing these value judgments on the patient.

Negative body language

This includes crossing arms, appearing distracted, or standing over the patient.

Unsolicited advice

Unsolicited advice can be experienced as intrusive and unempathetic unless the patient has specifically asked for advice.

Providing false reassurance

This can lead to a severe and significant rupture in the relationship, especially if the desired outcome is not achieved.

Agreeing or disagreeing

Occasionally agreeing can be helpful as it can provide validation, but in general, more room for the patient’s views can be facilitated if the provider avoids agreeing or disagreeing.

Using approving or disapproving responses

As above, this can be similar to placing value judgments and can be experienced as intrusive.

Changing the subject abruptly

This can occasionally be perceived as dismissive. Consider using transition phrases such as, “If it is ok with you, I’d like to change the subject and talk about….”

Responding defensively

Though this can be particularly difficult to avoid, avoiding defensive responses can allow more room for the patient to express their frustration and allow them to identify a solution collaboratively with their provider, rather than against their provider.

# Clinical Significance

Therapeutic communication has been widely studied and has been shown to have multiple benefits.

Most recently, therapeutic communication has been primarily adopted to structure communication in physician, nursing, mental health, and social work interactions.

Unfortunately, some studies have shown deficiencies in the training and implementation of empathetic or therapeutic communication.

As might be apparent, some of these identified barriers can be addressed at a systems level, and others at the level of patient-provider communication. One frequently expressed concern regarding therapeutic communication is that providers may not have enough time to address emotional concerns. This issue regarding lack of time has not been supported in the literature. Studies in physicians have demonstrated only a marginal change in the consultation time when an empathic response is given, and improved communication skills did not show an association with a longer duration of the consultation.

Other predictors of successful therapeutic communication include differences in language, education difference between patient and provider, patient’s education level, and perceived patient view scores.

# Other Issues

Communication can be complicated by other factors, including agitation/aggression, psychosis, delirium, and intubation.  For these cases, utilizing therapeutic communication techniques and tailoring the individual patient's interaction can be particularly important.

In agitation, verbal de-escalation techniques are generally accepted as good clinical practice; however, it is an understudied field, especially in the setting of psychosis-induced aggression or agitation.

Other complex communication issues include challenges that occur in critically ill patients, including delirium, intubation, and intellectual and developmental disabilities as well as autism.

Finally, psychosis presents a challenging communication barrier, especially concerning hallucinations and delusions.  Development of a shared understanding in the setting of psychotic experiences becomes particularly challenging, both from the standpoint of the patient communicating their concerns to the provider and the provider reflecting an understanding of these concerns.

One way to develop a shared understanding with patients with psychosis is to understand the meaning of the psychotic experiences to the patient, rather than focusing on the nature and content of the experiences themselves.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

As noted above, therapeutic communication has shown multiple clinical benefits in the literature. Indeed, therapeutic communication has demonstrated improved patient satisfaction, among other noted benefits. Patient satisfaction as a concept is a complex and subjective concept, but it has contributed to improved medical outcomes. The mechanism by which therapeutic communication improves patient satisfaction is thought to occur by fulfilling the patient’s expectations and values for the encounter. In turn, this fosters maintenance of the patient-provider relationship.

Each healthcare team member plays a vital role in therapeutic communication with the patient. Each team member gathers information from and subsequently communicates information to the patient in various contexts. This can be illustrated through a sample inpatient medical-surgical admission, where it is estimated that patients may see nearly 18 different healthcare providers through the course of the admission.

The American Nurses Association released guidelines in 2014 regarding psychiatric-mental health nursing and the importance of therapeutic communication as a standard of practice.

Pharmacists also play an important role in therapeutic communication with patients and providers.

Effective interprofessional communication is also considered critical in improving patient safety and improving outcomes. IPEC, in collaboration with the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, American Dental Education Association, Association of American Medical Colleges, and the Association of Schools of Public Health, developed expert consensus guidelines on interprofessional collaborative practice.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

Given that team-based interventions primarily drive healthcare, all healthcare team members must be aware of and utilize therapeutic communication techniques. As such, the specific information gathered by each team member may also differ, and thus the collective information can allow for a more holistic treatment approach if all team members are involved and communicating. Tools like SBAR and STICC can provide efficient methods of interprofessional communication, and opportunities within the healthcare organization or system are important for supporting such communication.

Interprofessional communication within teams has also shown benefits in attaining efficient and safe outcomes.

In addition, frequent and effective interprofessional communication is important to enhance treatment and prevent splitting behaviors in patients, where some providers may be considered "good" and others "bad." This is done by providing clear and consistent treatment recommendations that are from a “unified front,” as well as a consistent message of compassionate treatment from all team members. Therapeutic communication can facilitate this through the use of consistent empathetic approaches provided by each healthcare team member.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring

Through therapeutic communication, the healthcare team can provide holistic monitoring of the patient’s adherence, treatment response, adverse effects, and patient satisfaction, and identification of barriers to treatment. The biopsychosocial model of care provides a guide to approaching patients, and therapeutic communication techniques integrate well in identifying biopsychosocial contributors to health and illness in the patient.

Interprofessional approaches to monitoring for and identifying these contributors to health and illness can also provide a powerful tool for approaching patient care. Monitoring the patient’s emotional states from an interprofessional standpoint can also prove beneficial. In particular, monitoring these emotional states can allow for early identification of reactions a patient may be having towards a treatment or provider. In this way, one provider may provide liaison between these potential disruptions to care, address them early and directly with the patient, and simultaneously alert other team members to help patients work through these issues. Fostering therapeutic communication amongst interdisciplinary teams contributes to improving patient experience and enhancing health care outcomes.
