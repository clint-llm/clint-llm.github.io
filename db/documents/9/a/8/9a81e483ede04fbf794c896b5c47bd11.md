To help get rid of your cough, you can:

- Use a humidifier in your bedroom (if your cough is from a cold)

- Use an over-the-counter cough medicine, or suck on cough drops or hard candy

- Stop smoking, if you smoke

- If you have allergies, avoid the things you are allergic to (like pollen, dust, animals, or mold)

If you have acid reflux, your doctor or nurse will tell you which lifestyle changes can help reduce symptoms.
