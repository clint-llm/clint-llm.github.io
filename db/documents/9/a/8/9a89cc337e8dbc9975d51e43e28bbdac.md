Multiple organ systems maintain metabolic homeostasis. Adipose tissue and muscles are a few of them. Adipocytes secrete hormones/chemicals known as adipokines which act on multiple cells or organs to regulate metabolism. Further research needs to be done to understand better the concentrations of these hormones in different populations, including elderly and overweight/obese people, and the role these hormones play in obesity.

It is also important to understand how lifestyle choices such as dietary intervention, regular exercise (aerobic or resistance), supplementation, or combination of any of these affect adipokines/hormones concentrations so there is a better insight into their regulation and pathophysiology.
