Nocturia is defined as the need for patients to get up at night on a regular basis to urinate. A period of sleep must precede and follow the urinary episode for it to count as a nocturnal void. Nocturia is often described as the most bothersome of all urinary symptoms and is also one of the most common. Nocturia can be associated with long-term sleep deprivation, in addition to the inconvenience that it causes. Many patients are reluctant to mention nocturia to their providers or mistakenly believe it is a normal part of aging. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of nocturia and stresses the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.
