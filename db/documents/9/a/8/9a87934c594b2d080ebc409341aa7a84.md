In both diabetic and non-diabetic populations, hyperglycemia in the perioperative period is an independent marker of poor surgical outcomes (delayed wound healing, increased rate of infection, prolonged hospital stay, higher postoperative mortality).

The stress of surgery, anesthesia and illness increases secretion of counter-regulatory hormones (cortisol, glucagon, growth hormone, catecholamines), which in turn causes decreased insulin secretion, increased insulin resistance, decreased peripheral utilization of glucose, increased lipolysis, and proteolysis. As a consequence, gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis increase, which subsequently results in worsening hyperglycemia termed as stress hyperglycemia. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia instigates osmotic diuresis (causing fluid and electrolyte imbalance), ketogenesis, and increased generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines with resultant mitochondrial injury, endothelial dysfunction, and immune deregulation.

The severity of hyperglycemia also depends on the type of anesthesia and surgery, with increased glucose elevations seen in cases of general anesthesia or thoracic/abdominal surgeries as opposed to epidural/local anesthesia or peripheral/laparoscopic surgeries, respectively.
