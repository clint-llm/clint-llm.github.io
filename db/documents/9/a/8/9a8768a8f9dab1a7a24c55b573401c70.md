The regular duochrome (bichrome) chart is a visual acuity chart projected on an equally divided red and green background. The arrangement may vary for manufacturers. For example, the letters, numbers, and symbols may be projected symmetrically on both backgrounds to yield the desired design. The duochrome test equipment is usually positioned six meters or twenty feet from the patient and is generally contained on the visual acuity chart.

These charts can also be digitally installed in projectors and TV charts (See images of duochrome charts). Dim illumination is preferred when performing the test due to the effect of bright illumination on the pupils and accommodation. Some studies, however, suggest minimal ambient room illumination.
