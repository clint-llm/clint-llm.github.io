Vascular resistance is used to maintain organ perfusion. In certain disease states, such as congestive heart failure, there is a hyper-adrenergic response, causing an increase in peripheral vascular resistance. Prolonged increases in blood pressure affect several organs throughout the body. In conditions such as shock, there is a decrease in vascular resistance thus causing decreased organ perfusion which leads to organ malfunction. Peripheral vascular resistance is mediated locally by metabolites, and over a distance on a neuro-hormonal level, therefore, many different components may become altered leading to changes in peripheral vascular resistance.
