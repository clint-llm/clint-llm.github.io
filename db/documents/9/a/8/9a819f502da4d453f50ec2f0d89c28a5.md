Neonatal complications of chorioamnionitis include premature birth, cerebral palsy, retinopathy of prematurity, neurologic abnormalities, respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants, neonatal sepsis, and neonatal death. Neonatal sepsis is suspected as a complication of chorioamnionitis; however, in more than 99% of cases, cultures are negative. Perinatal listeriosis is associated with high morbidity. Current antibiotic regimens may not cover listeriosis in chorioamnionitis.

Maternal complications of chorioamnionitis include severe pelvic infections, subcutaneous wound infections, preterm delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, operative delivery, and maternal sepsis.

Chorioamnionitis is associated with vertical transmission of HIV in pregnancy.
