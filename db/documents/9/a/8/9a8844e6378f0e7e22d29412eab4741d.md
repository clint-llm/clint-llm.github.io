Solar urticaria is an uncommon type of urticaria. It accounts for less than 0.5% of all urticaria cases and 7% of all photodermatoses. The disease usually begins in young adulthood (median age 35 years), but cases of onset in neonates or elderly persons have been reported. There is a female predominance but no ethnic difference. In the largest series of patients, a history of atopy is noticed in less than 30% of cases. The association of solar urticaria with other types of chronic urticaria may be seen in up to 16% of patients.
