The sacroiliac (SI) joint articulates surfaces of the sacrum and the ilium and functions as the transition between the spine and the pelvis. The main roles of the SI joint are to provide stability and offset the load of the trunk to the lower limbs. The stability of the joint is providedÂ by an extensive architecture of ligamentous structures.
