The principal differential diagnoses for infective endocarditis include the following:

- Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis which was formerly known as marantic endocarditis - causes small sterile vegetations on the valve leaflets; predisposing conditions for this include certain malignancies and hypercoagulable states

- Libman–Sacks endocarditis: causes verrucous vegetations and is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus

- Vasculitis

- Connective tissue disease

- Fever of unknown origin
