# Continuing Education Activity

Keratitis is a clinical entity wherein inflammatory cells infiltrate different corneal layers in response to noxious stimuli, either infectious exogenous agents or self-antigens. The inflammatory reaction may result in the suppurative melting of corneal epithelium and stroma, resulting in the formation of ulcers. This results not only in the loss of corneal clarity but also threatens the integrity of the globe. Such cases may result in corneal blindness. This activity helps clinicians identify the etiological agent at the earliest based on clinical features and appropriate diagnostic tests and manage these patients with the latest treatment options. It reviews the role of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Review different types of keratitis 
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of keratitis.
- Summarize the management options available for keratitis.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of keratitis and improve outcomes.

# Introduction

Keratitis is the inflammation of the cornea and is characterized by corneal edema, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and ciliary congestion. It is associated with both infectious and non-infectious diseases, which may be systemic or localized to the ocular surface. Amongst the types of keratitis discussed above, "microbial keratitis" accounts for the majority and is primarily a cause of major concern in developing countries. However, noninfectious keratitis can not be looked down upon, especially in developed nations.

Our first line of defense is strong enough to dispel most of the infection, causing insults; however, there exist some organisms which can evade this line and cause infection. The corneal epithelium is one such barrier. Most of the organisms cannot penetrate intact epithelium, so they cannot incite keratitis in the absence of cellular injury. Neisseria meningitides, N. gonorrhea, Corynebacterium diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae, and Listeria species are the virulent organisms with the potential to penetrate even intact epithelium and cause keratitis.

# Etiology

Based on the etiological agent, keratitis can be classified as:

**Infectious Keratitis**

- Bacterial keratitis - including Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Moraxella, Nocardia, and Atypical Mycobacteria

- Protozoal keratitis - including Acanthamoeba

- Keratitis by Oomycete - Pythium keratitis. Morphologically, very similar to fungi; however, unlike fungi, the cell wall here contains (1-3)(1-6) beta D glucan

- Fungal keratitis - This includes infection by Aspergillus, Fusarium, Candida (yeast), Cladosporium, Alternaria, Curvularia, and Microsporidia

- Viral keratitis - This includes infection by Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Herpes zoster virus (HZV), Adenovirus, and others.

- Helminths- Onchocercal keratitis (sclerosing keratitis).

**Non-infectious Keratitis**

- Local causes - includes  trichiasis, giant papillae, foreign body in sulcus subtarsalis

- Peripheral ulcerative keratitis 

- Collagen vascular diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, polyarteritis nodosa, relapsing polychondritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and others

- Neurotrophic corneal ulcer (post- herpes zoster ophthalmicus, trigeminal nerve damage due to surgery or tumor)

- Xerophthalmia

# Epidemiology

In an epidemiological study in California, the incidence of ulcerative keratitis was found to be 27.6/100000 person-years.

As per a study conducted in South India, middle-aged males were more likely to get corneal ulcers compared to females.

Autoimmune disorders related to keratitis accounts for an estimated incidence of 3 per million per year.

The prevalence of xerophthalmia was almost 21% in a study in rural Ethiopia and was largely associated with other features of generalized malnutrition.

# Pathophysiology

**Stages of Corneal Ulcer**

- Stage of progressive infiltration

- Stage of active ulceration

- Stage of regression

- Stage of cicatrization

**Infectious Keratitis**

Infection incites the recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages. The hydrolases, proteases released by these inflammatory cells are primarily responsible for corneal stromal melt and necrosis.

**Adenoviral Keratoconjunctivitis**

- Stage 1- It lasts for 7 to 10 days and characterized by diffuse punctate epithelial keratitis.

- Stage 2- After 7 days, subepithelial to anterior stromal infiltrates appear. NK cells are the first to come in action and further involve cell-mediated immunity.

- Stage 3- This is characterized by persistent subepithelial to anterior stromal infiltrates.

**Onchocerca Volvulus Induced Keratitis**

Corneal infection by motile worms does not per se cause blindness; however, as they die after chemotherapy or naturally, they incite inflammation and cause corneal punctate opacification. Repeated episodes result in complete opacification of the cornea and result in blindness.

**Peripheral Ulcerative Keratitis**

Exact etiology is not clear; however, both cell-mediated and humoral immunity plays an important role. In response to a corneal antigen, the immune complex gets deposited in the peripheral cornea. The hypersensitivity reaction to an exogenous antigen is other described mechanisms.

**Xerophthalmia**

Vitamin A deficiency is needed for the maintenance and integrity of the epithelial lining of the ocular surface. Loss of epithelial lining with subsequent liquefactive necrosis of cornea results in keratomalacia.

# Histopathology

Corneal infections often start as epithelial ulceration. This is followed by stromal infiltration by polymorphonuclear (PMN) and lymphomononuclear cells, which in turn causes the destruction of Bowman's layer and then stromal necrosis. In severe cases, there can be perforation of the Descemet's membrane. Suppurative infections lead to infiltrates in the anterior two-thirds of the stroma and abscess formation. Epithelial regeneration, vascularization, edema, giant cell reaction, myofibroblatic transformation and stromal remodeling (scarring), and round cell infiltration can occur with chronic infections.

# History and Physical

The most common complaints of patients with keratitis include redness, pain, and irritation in the eye. The patients may also present with photophobia, visual decline, or cosmetic blemish.

**Bacterial Keratitis**

Keratitis by gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcal keratitis can be either because of direct invasion of the organism or because of staphylococcal antigen. Staphylococcal antigen-induced keratitis is usually affecting the peripheral cornea and hence the name 'marginal keratitis.' Marginal keratitis is invariably associated with staphylococcal blepharitis. The corneal lesions usually start at 10, 2, 4, and 8' o'clock positions, where the lid margin is in contact with the limbus. There is always a clear area between the limbus and the ulcerative lesion, unlike HSV marginal keratitis.

The most common cause of Streptococcal keratitis is a blocked nasolacrimal duct. So, lacrimal duct patency or regurgitation on pressure over the lacrimal sac (ROPLAS) should be evaluated in corneal ulcer cases.

In early-stages of Gram-positive infection, the cuff of cellular infiltration is noted around the corneal focus of infection and is not diffuse, unlike Pseudomonal keratitis.

Pseudomonas keratitis: In early-stage, diffuse and dense corneal cellularity is noted much beyond the focus of infection. Pseudomonas is a gram-negative bacteria with predominantly greenish-yellow corneal infiltrate and extensive collagenolysis.****The symptoms are more acute and rapidly progressive. Corneal melt might progress to corneal perforation or endophthalmitis if not taken care of in the early stages.

Nocardia keratitis: Nocardia is a weakly acid-fast bacteria (Modified Kinyoun stain).

Atypical mycobacteria: The Atypical mycobacteria are acid-fast bacilli causing keratitis with a protracted course. There may be a history of trauma with corneal foreign bodies or a history of corneal surgery (LASIK).

**Viral Keratitis**

Adenoviral keratitis: Adenoviral keratitis often has associated conjunctivitis, so the exact terminology would be Epidemic adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis (Human adenovirus types 8,19,37 and 54). Presentation is usually unilateral to start with; however, it becomes bilateral later. A predominantly follicular reaction is noted.****The patients at this stage often complain of photophobia, glare, and haloes.

Herpes simplex keratitis: HSV keratitis can present as epithelial disease, stromal keratitis, and endotheliitis.

HSV necrotizing stromal keratitis is a variant where both the viral load and the inflammatory component play roles simultaneously.

Herpes zoster keratitis: The diagnosis of Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) is very obvious. Associated unilateral rashes over the forehead and eyelids with rashes reaching the tip of the nose (Hutchinson's sign) suggest likely involvement of the corresponding eye also.

Thus, the absent terminal bulbs and poor fluorescein uptake by the ulcer base differentiate HZO keratitis from HSV keratitis.

**Protozoal Keratitis**

Acanthamoeba keratitis: History of exposure to soil or contaminated water is very often seen in Acanthamoeba keratitis in the developing world. However, in developed countries, contact lens wear has been found to have a strong association with Acanthamoeba keratitis. The spectrum of clinical features can vary from superficial punctate keratitis, pseudo-dendrites to peri-neuritis in the early stages.

**Keratitis by Oomycetes**

Pythium keratitis: This keratitis is caused by an oomycete, a distinct phylogenetically related lineage of fungus-like eukaryotic micro-organism. Pythium insidiosum species causes disease in human. The corneal lesions often mimic fungal infiltrate, and careful examination reveals dry-looking corneal infiltrates denser in the periphery of the whole infiltration with hyphate edges. Pin-head like lesions and tentacular extensions of the main lesion is very characteristic for Pythium keratitis.

**Fungal Keratitis**

Microsporidial keratitis: Previously, microsporidia was considered to be a primitive protozoan.

Filamentous fungal keratitis: History of trauma with vegetative matter is very often noted. Corneal infiltrates in fungal keratitis is usually dry-looking and having feathery edges with the presence of multiple satellite lesions. Plaque-like (with or without pigmentation) or fungal ball-like surface lesions can also be very commonly seen. At times, retained corneal vegetative foreign body lies in close association with the infiltrate. Endothelial plaque or exudates in the absence of anterior stromal infiltrate can also be seen. In such a scenario, careful examination often reveals a track from the anterior corneal surface to endothelium. This track is usually the path of entry for fungal infection and usually follows penetrating trauma. The hypopyon is usually thick and does not shift with a change in head position. The course of the disease is usually longer. Compared to bacterial keratitis, the outcomes of fungal keratitis is poor.

Alternaria sp., Bipolaris sp., Curvularia sp. are the pigmented fungal species causing infections in humans. The infiltrate may have pigmentation (brown) in dematiaceous fungal keratitis.

Candida keratitis: Clinical features are indistinguishable from fungal keratitis.

Onchocerca volvulus keratitis: This results in sclerosing keratitis. Corneal opacity starts from the periphery, and the visual axis gets affected at last. Deep vascularization is noted 360 degrees.

**Non-infectious Keratitis**

**Local Causes**

Trichiatic eyelashes, giant papillae, or any foreign body lodged in sulcus subtarsalis can result in persistent epithelial denudation mechanically and subsequent stromal ulceration. To start with, these corneal epithelial defects are usually sterile; however, they can get secondarily infected. Ulcers due to trichiatic lashes are very often seen as sequelae of cicatrizing conjunctivitis. The corneal ulcers in trichiatic lashes of the lower lid are usually present in, the lower half of the cornea.

Patients with severe allergic conjunctivitis often develop giant papillae and can result in the formation of an ulcer on superior half of cornea called "Shield ulcer." Patients will give a history of previous allergic eye disease.

In both****the above-mentioned cases, the onset of ulcer development will be gradual.

Patients with a foreign body in sulcus subtarsalis often come with a short history and acute onset of symptoms. Patients usually give a history of the fall of the foreign body in the eye. On careful examination, multiple linear abrasions in superior cornea may also be very obvious.

**Systemic Causes**

Various systemic causes can result in alteration of the local ocular surface milieu and subsequent development of severe dry eye and keratitis.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA): RA is known to cause the spectrum of ocular abnormalities. Severe dry eye, scleritis, sclerokeratitis, and peripheral ulcerative keratitis are various manifestations of the disease.

Wegner granulomatosis (WG)/granulomatosis with polyangiitis: WG is a connective tissue disorder (necrotizing vasculitis) that is known to cause keratitis, episcleritis, and scleritis.

Other systemic conditions resulting in keratitis are also known, like systemic lupus erythematosus, relapsing polychondritis, and polyarteritis nodosa. Careful history taking helps to reach the diagnosis.

Xerophthalmia: The keratolysis in xerophthalmia results in a punched out corneal ulcer and have a high propensity to perforate, if left untreated.

# Evaluation

Regurgitation on pressure over the lacrimal sac area (ROPLAS) and/or sac syringing constitute important routine investigation in all corneal ulcer patients to rule out obstructed nasolacrimal duct induced keratitis. The routine protocol for any corneal ulcer is to look for the characteristic features of the ulcer, followed by corneal scraping to identify the causative organism.

The patient is started on medications based on direct microscopy findings, and subsequently, the treatment is further modified based on culture reports. Commonly used culture media are blood and chocolate agar for bacterial growth. Potato dextrose agar and Saboraud's dextrose agar are used for fungal growth and non-nutrient agar with E. coli for Acanthamoeba.

Serology forms the basis for the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. However, the diagnosis of xerophthalmia is largely clinical.

# Treatment / Management

**Bacterial Keratitis**

For bacterial keratitis, patients are started on fortified topical antibiotics empirically until culture reports are available. Fortified cefazolin 5% or vancomycin and fluoroquinolones or tobramycin or gentamicin give complete coverage against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. For keratitis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), topical vancomycin is the drug of choice.

Pseudomonas Keratitis: Direct smears on Grams staining shows gram-negative rods and culture grows Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient is started on topical fluoroquinolones hourly. Treatment is modified once the culture and sensitivity report is available. Oral doxycycline is added to halt the progression of collagenolysis.

Nocardia Keratitis:  Corneal smears are subjected to routine Gram staining and 1% acid-fast staining.

Atypical mycobacteria: Ziehl Neelsen stain is used to identify the organism in smears. Topical fortified amikacin (4%) is the treatment of choice.

**Protozoal Keratitis**

A clinician needs to have strong suspicion for making a diagnosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis based on the history and clinical features. Previous topical steroid use might increase the yield of the organism in smears and culture; however, it worsens the prognosis. As the clinical picture often mimics viral keratitis, pre-treatment with antivirals may alter the clinical picture. In Gram staining, the cysts are visible as multiple double-walled cysts with inner polyhedral lining. 10% KOH-mount and 10% KOH with 0.1% calcofluor white also demonstrate Acanthamoeba cysts. Non-nutrient agar seeded with E.coli is used for culture. Biguanides and pentamidine are the mainstays of treatment.Pseudomonas aeruginosa) for the development of acanthamoeba keratitis has also been described.

**Keratitis by Oomycete**

Pythium insidiosum on Gram staining and 10% KOH with 0.1% calcofluor white show fungus-like broad aseptate filaments with ribbon-like folds.Pythium insidiosum and may help in early diagnosis.****(500mg daily for 3 days in a week) was found to be effective in treating keratitis in the earliest report.Pythium keratitis was further substantiated by Bagga et al. in his study with these agents over 3 years.Pythium insidiosum to minocycline and tigecycline was also fairly acceptable.

**Fungal Keratitis**

Microsporidial keratitis: Microsporodial spores stain well with Grams, silver, and 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) with 0.1% calcofluor white. The keratoconjunctivitis variant has a self-limiting course.

Filamentous fungal keratitis: Routine microscopy with 10% KOH alone or 10% KOH with 0.1% calcofluor white reveal hyaline/ pigmented, septate (Aspergillus, Fusarium)/ aseptate (Mucor, Rhizopus) fungal filaments. Preferred culture media for fungal growth are Saboraud's and potato dextrose agar. Topical natamycin****(5%) is the drug of choice for filamentous fungal keratitis.****(1%) is added as an adjunct to natamycin inAspergillus keratitis, not responding to natamycin alone. Voriconazole is not given as a primary drug for fungal keratitis.Fusarium keratitis.

**Viral Keratitis**

Dual staining with Rose-Bengal and fluorescein stain is a very important clinical tool to make a diagnosis of HSV epithelial disease. Fluorescein stain makes the dendrites and geographical ulcers more evident by staining the base of ulcer, and Rose-Bengal stains the cells at the margin of the ulcer, which are loaded with viruses. The diagnosis of epithelial disease is mostly clinical.****and oral (acyclovir 400 mg 5 times daily ) is given for the initial three days.

The diagnosis of HZO is clinical. The skin lesions associated with corneal dendritiform lesion is very characteristic. Unlike the chickenpox lesions, here, the skin lesions are in the same stage. The ends of dendritiform lesions are tapering, unlike in dendritic ulcers in HSV epithelial keratitis. The pseudodendrites are because of swollen epithelial cells, so they do not take up fluorescein stain. Oral acyclovir (800 mg, 5 times daily for 1 week) is very effective in its treatment in the early stages.

Adenoviral keratitis: The diagnosis of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis is primarily clinical. However, wherever in doubt, it can be confirmed using PCR techniques. Considering the contagious nature of the disease, maintenance of personal hygiene has a very important role in preventing its transmission. Topical 1% povidone-iodine, in combination with 0.1% dexamethasone, has shown good results.

**Non-infectious Keratitis**

**Local Causes**

Patients with ulcers related to trichiatic lashes, entropion, or distichiasis need early correction of pathology. The diagnosis is largely clinical. Either electrolysis of eyelash hair root follicle, lid everting procedures, or lid splitting procedures, respectively, need to be done without compromising the gross anatomical relationship.

Shield ulcer is an ulcer due to the mechanical effect of giant papillae. Diagnosis is obvious on lid eversion. Topical steroids, along with topical cyclosporine**(**0.05%) and lubricants, are sufficient enough to control the disease.

Patients with corneal ulcers related to sulcus subtarsalis foreign body needs immediate removal of a foreign body under topical anesthesia either on slit lamp or under the microscope in the operating room.

**Systemic Causes**

Rheumatoid arthritis: The diagnosis is largely by serological methods; however, clinical findings like finger deformities are suggestive. RA factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) are important serological markers.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis: The clinical features are suggestive; however, the serological test is diagnostic. C-ANCA is the serological marker.

Xerophthalmia: Vitamin A supplementation, as per WHO guidelines, need to be done at the earliest.

Some patients do require surgical interventions, like the application of tissue adhesives, amniotic membrane transplantation, patch graft, or penetrating keratoplasty, to maintain the integrity of the globe. This holds for all keratitis reaching a fate of severe corneal thinning or perforation. Therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty is planned for limbus threatening infective keratitis.

Apart from various diagnostic and treatment modalities discussed above, now nanoparticles and antimicrobial peptides are being devised for sustained and targeted drug delivery.

# Differential Diagnosis

Making a diagnosis of keratitis is not difficult; however, finding the etiology is not always easy. Many times the direct microscopy and culture reports are unremarkable, and the patient has to be treated based on clinical findings. In early-stage, Acanthamoeba keratitis and HSV stromal keratitis are often indistinguishable; however, late stages of Acanthamoeba keratitis may simulate fungal keratitis.

- Atopic keratoconjunctivitis

- Bacterial endophthalmitis

- Band keratopathy

- Blepharitis

- Corneal ulcer

- Entropion

- Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis

- Fungal keratitis

- Herpes simplex virus keratitis

- Herpes Zoster

- Interstitial keratitis

- Neurotrophic keratitis

- Nasolacrimal duct obstruction

- Ocular rosacea

- Pseudophakic bullous keratopathy

- Scleritis

- Viral conjunctivitis

# Prognosis

Overall corneal ulcers take longer for healing. Bacterial ulcers heal relatively early than fungal corneal ulcers. Acanthamoeba keratitis might take even months for complete remission. Corneal scarring is the most common outcome following corneal ulcers. These cases can be managed later with glasses or with optical iridectomy or optical keratoplasty to restore vision.  Perforated corneal ulcers often tend to have a worse prognosis. The use of prior topical steroids in fungal and Acanthamoeba keratitis worsens the prognosis.

# Complications

**Complications**

- Toxic iridocyclitis

- Secondary glaucoma

- Descemetocele

- Perforation of corneal ulcer

**Sequelae of Corneal Perforation**

- Iris prolapse

- Anterior dislocation of lens

- Anterior capsular cataract

- Corneal fistula

- Purulent uveitis

- Intraocular hemorrhage

- Corneal scarring- nebula, macula, leucoma, adherent leucoma

- Keratectasia

- Disorganized anterior chamber

- Autoevisceration

- Phthisis bulbi

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Considering the majority of cases of keratitis due to agricultural trauma in developing nations, it is advisable to use eyeshields during harvest season in fields. Apart from these, cases with recurrent HSV keratitis (more than 3 episodes in a year) should take oral antiviral prophylaxis for 1 year.

# Pearls and Other Issues

To conclude, comprehensive treatment for keratitis would be first to find the etiology using various clinical and/or microbiological findings and serological markers and then to address it. It can be addressed with topical and/or systemic drugs. In the case where globe integrity is compromised, measures like tissue adhesive application, amniotic membrane transplantation, patch graft, or penetrating keratoplasty are done. Each treatment modality has to be tailored as per the requirement. This article tries to bring out a comprehensive idea about keratitis and its management.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

It is always good to have an inhouse microbiologist so that reporting of direct smears can be done at the earliest. Ophthalmologist and a rheumatologist should also work hand in hand. Many patients are referred to a rheumatologist by an ophthalmologist for systemic evaluation and starting immunomodulators. The patients need to follow at both places. An ophthalmologist can suggest a rheumatologist for titrating the dose of immunomodulators based on clinical response. Apart from these, patients are also evaluated for any adverse effect profile. These kinds of work models not only ensure better clinical outcomes and patient safety but also a healthy work atmosphere.
