Common adverse effects, rarer autoimmune reactions, and hepatotoxicity warrant discontinuation of minocycline and switching to an antibioticÂ outside of the tetracycline class. It is important to note that minocycline carries a significantly higher risk of developing SLE than other tetracyclines. Thus a high index of suspicion and immediate discontinuation of the medication and supportive measures is recommended if symptoms develop.

The adverse events more commonly observed in minocycline overdose are dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. There is no specific antidote for minocycline. In the case of minocycline overdosage, discontinue the medicine, treat the patient symptomatically, and institute supportive measures. Minocycline can not be removed in significant quantities by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.
