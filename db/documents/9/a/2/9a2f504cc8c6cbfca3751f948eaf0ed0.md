- Atrial septal defects are one of the most common types of congenital heart defects and are present in about 25% of live births.

- The most common type of ASD is an ostium secundum defect.

- The transcutaneous percutaneous approach to ASD closure is only indicated in patients with ostium secundum defects. Surgical intervention is required for the ostium primum, sinus venosus, and coronary sinus defects.

- Transcutaneous percutaneous closure of ASD is contraindicated in patients with increased pulmonary hypertension.

- Dysrhythmias occurring due to ASDs are treated with cardioversion followed by anticoagulation. If cardioversion is not successful, rate control with medications and anticoagulation are necessary.

- Eisenmenger syndrome is a late complication of ASD that occurs secondary to pulmonary hypertension.
