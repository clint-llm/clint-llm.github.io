In general, the finding of an acute abdomen is indicative of a surgical problem, and in the past, the patient was taken directly to the operating room. Unfortunately, there are also some medical disorders that can present with acute abdominal pain that requires medical therapy. These conditions include acute pancreatitis, sickle cell anemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, adrenal crisis, and pyelonephritis. Today, ultrasound and/or CT scans are widely used to determine the cause of acute abdomen, so that the surgeon knows beforehand what to expect during surgery. It also avoids unnecessary surgery in patients with medical causes of an acute abdomen. All patients with an acute abdomen need to be seen by a surgeon. If the patient is stable, imaging studies can be obtained. If the patient is unstable, immediate surgical intervention may be necessary. The prognosis of patients depends on the cause.
