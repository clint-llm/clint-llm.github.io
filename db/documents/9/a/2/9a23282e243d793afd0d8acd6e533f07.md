Syncope accounts for around 1 to 3.5% of visits to emergency department visits in the US. Syncope is more common in older patients due to multiple comorbidities and multiple medications. Cardiac etiology is more common in older patients and noncardiac etiology (vasovagal) common in young adults. There is no significant difference in incidence between men and women.
