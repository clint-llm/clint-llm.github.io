Amino acid metabolism may play a critical role in the development of T2DM. Studies have shown that there is a 4-fold increase in isoleucine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine in individuals with hyperglycemia. Researchers found that these amino acids were elevated up to 12 years before the onset of the disease.

Low levels of lysine, in particular, were associated with increased inflammation and elevated blood glucose. Thus, increased dietary lysine may promote anti-inflammatory effects.
