Patients with such injuries usually complain about difficulty in bearing weight or excruciating pain on ambulation. Proper history taking in such patients regarding suggestive mechanisms of injury is essential.Â Clinically, there is tenderness, crepitus, bruising, deformity, and swelling over the forefoot. Gross deformities are usually seen only with complex injuries, which include multiple fractures and dislocations.

Sometimes it is hard to differentiate soft tissue injury and fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal because the pain and swelling for both injuries lie just inferior to the lateral malleolus. Hence thorough examination and proper evaluation are needed in cases of metatarsal injuries.
