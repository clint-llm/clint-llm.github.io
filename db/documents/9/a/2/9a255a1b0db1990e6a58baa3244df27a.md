Carpal instability secondary to ligamentous disruption is a broad, complex topic that includes a number of causes. Carpal instability must be differentiated from carpal misalignment. With carpal misalignment, the carpus may show deviation from normal radiographic alignment, but the joints will remain stable when loaded under physiologic conditions. This activity will cover the two most common carpal instabilities and their respective chronic complications: scapholunate dissociation, lunotriquetral dissociation, dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI), and volar intercalated segment instability (VISI). This article will highlight anatomy, pathophysiology, evaluation, treatment, and the interprofessional team's role in caring for patients with carpal instability.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of carpal instability.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with carpal instability.
- Outline the treatment options for carpal instability.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interdisciplinary team to enhance care delivery for patients affected by carpal instability.
