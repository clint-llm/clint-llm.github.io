The brainÂ vasculature provides the nutrients necessary for the well functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). Anatomical and angiographic studies considerably detail the topography of the arterial architecture and the related relationships. We review the arterial blood supply to the brain. Awareness of its normal anatomy and its common variations and anomalies are critical for the diagnostic and treatment of stroke and associated vascular disorders.
