The surgeon can usually reach the ulna without endangering other structures because of its proximity to the skin surface. In contrast, the radius, particularly the proximal portion, is encircled by muscles. Additionally, the posterior interosseous nerve abuts the proximal radius. As such, an approach to the radius is typically more complicated. There are three primary surgical approaches to the forearm bones:

- The approach to exposing the shaft of the ulna is typically considered the simplest of approaches because of the proximity of the bone to the skin. The patient is usually supine with the arm placed across the chest to best identify the ulna. Identification and preservation of the ulnar artery and nerve are essential.

- The volar (Henry) approach to the radius can safely expose the entire length of the bone. The patient is typically supine with an arm board securing the arm in supination. Care must be taken to identify and avoid damaging the posterior interosseous nerve, the superficial radial nerve, and the radial artery.

- The dorsal (Thompson) approach to the radius provides access to the extensor side of the bone, where the placement of the plates should be, if possible. The patient is again supine with the forearm either pronated on an arm board or supinated and placed across the chest. The critical aspect is protecting the posterior interosseous nerve.
