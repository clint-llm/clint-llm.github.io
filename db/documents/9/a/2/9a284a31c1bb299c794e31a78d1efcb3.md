Hyperhidrosis is a common complaint in clinical practice, and while there are many treatments available, many are unsatisfactory. Thus, the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the primary care provider, nurse specialist, thoracic surgeon, plastic surgeon, and internist. The goal is to reduce sweating with minimal complications.

The pharmacist should educate the patient on all the topical and systemic products available to manage sweating. The patient should be aware of the adverse effects and potential complications.

A dermatologist should be consulted if the cause is unknown.

For recalcitrant cases, a thoracic surgeon should be consulted.

A mental health nurse and psychiatrist should assist with mental health support as the disorder can cause severe emotional distress.

Most topical and nonsurgical treatments do not work reliably. Surgery can be done, but recurrences are not uncommon. Patients need to be educated about all the potential treatments, including their effectiveness and any associated morbidity. A team approach can deliver the optimal treatment for hyperhidrosis and improve outcomes.
