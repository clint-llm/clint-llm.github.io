The majority of the patients who seek treatment for lipomas are due to cosmetic reasons. Lipomas do not involute spontaneously, although dramatic weight loss may make lesions more clinically prominent as they may not regress at the same rate as normal adipose tissue. Stable lesions often are observed clinically. The decision to treat depends on numerous factors, including lesion size, anatomic location, symptoms such as pain, and patient comorbidities. If treatment is desired, surgical excision is commonly employed. Large lipomas have been removed via liposuction.

Therapies such as endoscopy and colonoscopy are utilized for the lipomas of the gastrointestinal tract (GI). Colonoscopic removal of lipomas is associated with a higher risk of colon perforation.

Complete surgical excision of the capsule is recommended. Intracardiac lipomas are usually lobulated, and all lobules must be removed for a better outcome. Subcutaneous lipomas are removed for cosmetic reasons. Therefore a cosmetically pleasing incision should be used. The incision is usually placed directly over the mass in a line of skin tension. Local removal is indicated in intestinal lipomas, causing obstruction and hemorrhage; the uncertainty of diagnosis for an intramural intestinal mass also warrants resection. If esophageal lipomas can not be endoscopically removed, surgical excision is indicated, whether by a transhiatal or a transthoracic approach.
