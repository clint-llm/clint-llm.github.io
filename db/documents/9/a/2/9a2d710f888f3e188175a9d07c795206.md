Thyroid eye disease (TED) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammation of the orbit. It is the most common cause of unilateral and bilateral proptosis in adults.

Avicenna and Al-Jurjani first described goiter-associated ophthalmopathy in AD 1000. Robert Graves, an Irish physician, described four young women with thyrotoxicosis, palpitations, thyroid gland enlargement, and exophthalmos. Graves ophthalmopathy (or TED) is an orbital inflammation or infiltration involving the soft tissues, proptosis, and ophthalmoplegia.
