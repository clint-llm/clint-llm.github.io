The tibialis posterior is the only muscle to attach to the cuboid bone. The tibialis posterior muscle originates from the posterior compartment of the lower leg. It travels distally as the tibialis posterior tendon to insert on several tarsal bones, including the underside of the cuboid bone. The tibialis posterior is the principal inverter and secondary plantar flexor of the foot. Part of the flexor hallucis brevis muscle arises from the plantar aspect of the cuboid. The flexor hallucis brevis aids in the flexion of the great toe.
