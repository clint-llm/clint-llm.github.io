The ACA is divided into five segments, denoted A1 through A5. Its distal part runs along the corpus callosum and is sometimes called the pericallosal artery. The largest branch of this pericallosal segment is the callosomarginal artery, which can be present in more than half of individuals. Most branches of the ACA serving the cortex branch either from the callosomarginal artery or, if it is not present, directly from the pericallosal artery. There are numerous additional variants, of which significant examples are the azygos ACA, in which the A2 segments of the two ACAs fuse before dividing again; bihemispheric, in which the A2 segment of one ACA diminishes and the other divides to feed both hemispheres; and medial ACA, in which a third ACA appears and feeds the distal territories.

The MCA is divided into four parts, denoted M1, from the ICA bifurcation, through M4, to the lateral cerebral cortex. Corresponding with their relative locations, they are alternatively called the sphenoidal, insular, opercular, and cortical segments, respectively.

The PCA divides into four sections, P1, P2A (anterior) and P (posterior), P3, and P4. The anastomosis with the posterior communicating artery separates P1 and P2.
