Yersinia. enterocolitica is mainly a disease of the GI tract. It results from direct contact and ingestion of contaminated material, water, and food. It is carried and harbored by virtually all species of animals, water, and soil. After it is ingested, it resides and replicates in the terminal ileum of humans. It then progresses to mesenteric lymph nodes causing mesenteric lymphadenitis. Often this will mimic acute appendicitis, thus the term pseudoappendicitis. This disease is usually self-limiting in healthy individuals. The most common complaint being GI symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain, but it can progress to more severe symptoms such as bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and severe abdominal pain. More advanced cases may develop sepsis, bacteremia, and abscesses of the liver and spleen.
