The characteristic histopathologic features of polymyositis and dermatomyositis (PM/DM) are the presence of mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates and degeneration and regeneration of muscle fibers. Atrophy of muscle fibers in a perifascicular fashion is the hallmark feature of dermatomyositis.

Immunopathology: Endomysial inflammatory cell infiltrates are mainly composed of CD8+T cells, and in addition, CD4+T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells are seen in polymyositis. Perivascular and perimysial infiltration of CD4+T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells are seen in dermatomyositis. The difference in immunohistopathologic features of these two subsets of myositis suggests that different pathogenic mechanisms could be involved in them, with T-cell-mediated muscle damage in PM and a role for microvessels in DM.

Increased expression of MHC class I and II molecules are present both on regenerating fibers and normal-appearing muscle fibers in patients with myositis. The MHC Class I antigen expression is more frequently observed than MHC class II, and the mechanism by which the MHC expression in muscle is induced has not been elucidated.
