Calcitriol is administered intravenously through a catheter, orally without regard to meals, and topically for external use only. For intravenous administration, no dilution is necessary, and a bolus dose is given at the end of a hemodialysis session. During the initial titration period, serum calcium and phosphorous levels should be monitored twice weekly. Calcitriol capsules and oral solutions may be taken with or without meals but should be protected from prolonged light exposure. Topical administration is performed by applying a thin film to the affected area with gentle rubbing, being careful not to apply to the face or eyes.
