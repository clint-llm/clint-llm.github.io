The UGH syndrome is a late complication of cataract surgery. It has to be managed by an interprofessional team. The key to management is the patient's compliance and knowledge of the patient regarding the outcomes. The optometrist plays a vital role in refraction and documenting the patient's visual acuity. The anterior segment surgeon should discuss all the management options, and the patient should have realistic expectations.

A retina specialist should be consulted if neovascularization of the iris, vitreous hemorrhage, or CME is present. The pharmacist should explain the dosage of the eye drops to be used. Ophthalmic technicians play an important role in glaucoma or retinal investigations. In patients with systemic disorders and patients taking anti-coagulants, physicians and/or cardiologists must be consulted. Excellent interprofessional coordination may ensure the best outcomes for patients with UGH syndrome.
