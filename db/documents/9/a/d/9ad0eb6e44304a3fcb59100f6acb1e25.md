FFI has been described to have four stages:

- Stage 1: The first stage of the disease is identified by the subacute onset of insomnia, which worsens over a period of few months and causes psychiatric symptoms such as phobia, paranoia, and panic attacks. During this time, patients may report lucid dreaming.

- Stage 2: In the next 5-month period, psychiatric symptoms worsen along with worsening insomnia, and patients experience hallucinations. Autonomic dysfunction in the form of sympathetic hyperactivity is seen.

- Stage 3: This short stage of around three months is typically dominated by total insomnia and complete disruptions of the sleep-wake cycle.

- Stage 4: The final stage of the disease can last for six months or more and is defined by rapid cognitive decline and dementia. Patients experience an inability to voluntarily move or speak, whichÂ is followed by coma and eventual death.
