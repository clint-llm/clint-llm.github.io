A spigelian hernia is a rare, abnormal protrusion of abdominal contents or peritoneum through a defect (spigelian fascia), which is comprised of the transversus abdominis and the internal oblique aponeuroses. It typically results from an underlying pathology that increases intra-abdominal pressure, abdominal wall trauma, or degeneration of abdominal aponeurotic layers. This activity examines the diagnosis and evaluation of spigelian hernia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe spigelian hernia.
- Outline the frequency of a spigelian hernia.
- Identify the pathophysiology of a spigelian hernia.
- Summarize the importance of cooperation among the interprofessional team members diagnose and treat a spigelian hernia.
