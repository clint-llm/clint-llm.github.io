Necrolytic migratory erythema as a part of the glucagonoma syndrome is an exceedingly rare disease process with an estimated incidence of 1 in 20 million per year.

Rarely has it been seen in patients with MEN1, and in these cases, the onset of the disease is earlier.

NME in the context of pseudoglucagonoma syndrome is an even rarer phenomenon; as such, data on its incidence and prevalence in this setting is not currently available.
