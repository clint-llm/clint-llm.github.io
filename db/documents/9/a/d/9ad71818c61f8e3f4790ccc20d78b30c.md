The Japanese encephalitis virus attaches to host cell membranes, initially propagating at the site of the bite and nearby lymph nodes. Subsequent viremia develops but most cases are cleared before the virus enters the central nervous system, resulting in subclinical disease. If the virus is transmitted to the brain hematogenously with the invasion of the blood-brain barrier, neuroinvasive disease develops. Japanese encephalitis virus has both direct neurotoxic effects and the capacity to alter neuro stem cell development.
