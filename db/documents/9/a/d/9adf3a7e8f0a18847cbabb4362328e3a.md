There are five subtypes of cardiorenal syndrome:

- Type 1: a sharp decline in cardiac function that results in an acute decrease in renal function

- Type 2: chronic cardiac dysfunction that results in a sustained reduction in renal function

- Type 3: a sharp decline in renal function that results in an acute reduction in cardiac function

- Type 4: a chronic decline in kidney function that results in chronic cardiac dysfunction

- Type 5: systemic diseases that result in both cardiac and renal dysfunction

Each type has its unique pathophysiology with unique management strategies and varying prognoses.
