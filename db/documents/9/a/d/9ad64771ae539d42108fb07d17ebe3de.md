The radial club hand encompasses a spectrum of complex congenital malformations of the radial side of the forearm. These are uncommon and can range from a mildly hypoplastic thumb to a completely absent radius. Radial club hand is commonly associated with a number of syndromes for which evaluation must occur. Mild deficiency can be managed nonoperatively, whereas severe cases are usually treated with surgery. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of radial club hand and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.
