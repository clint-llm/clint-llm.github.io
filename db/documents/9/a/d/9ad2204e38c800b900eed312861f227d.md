Erlotinib is a medication used in the management and treatment of some types of non-small cell lung cancer and advanced pancreatic cancer. It is in the tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor class of medications.

**FDA Labelled Indications**

**Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)**

The FDA originally approved erlotinib for the treatment of NSCLC in November 2004. According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), erlotinib is recommended as a first, second, or third-line therapy in advanced NSCLC, depending on patient characteristics. Erlotinib is recommended as a first-line agent only if the patient has a known EGFR mutation (1-line treatment in NSCLC). Erlotinib may be given as second-line therapy if there is no treatment response after four treatment cycles or there is disease progression on or following platinum-based first-line therapy. Guidelines indicate that erlotinib may be given as third-line therapy if there is disease progression and the patient is na√Øve to erlotinib and gefitinib.

**Pancreatic Cancer**

The FDA approved erlotinib in the treatment of pancreatic cancer in 2005. Many pancreatic cancers in humans have the EGFR mutation; patients with this mutation typically have a worse prognosis. Previously, gemcitabine monotherapy was regarded as the standard of care in advanced pancreatic cancer. While combinations of gemcitabine and other anti-cancer agents, gemcitabine and erlotinib dual therapy show the most promise. Erlotinib/gemcitabine has demonstrated superiority in benefit compared to gemcitabine monotherapy in locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Erlotinib has not been studied as a monotherapy in the setting of pancreatic cancer.

**Non-FDA Labelled Indications**

There are currently no indications for off-label use of erlotinib.
