Based on the findings in his study, Denis went on to classify thoracolumbar injuries into four major types, based on column involvement and mechanisms of injury:

**1. Compression**

Structures involved:

- Fracture of the anterior column of the vertebral body with an intact middle column

- Failure of the anterior column in compression

- May involve the superior or inferior endplate, or both

Mechanism

Anterior flexion & axial loading

**2. Burst**

Structures involved:

- Compression fractures of the anterior and middle columns.  The posterior column may or may not be involved if lamina fractures are present or if dural tears or nerve entrapments occur

- May involve the superior or inferior endplate, or both

Mechanism

Axial compression

**3. Flexion-Distraction (Seatbelt-Type)**

Structures involved:

- Usually involvement of all three columns

- No associated translation

Mechanism

Flexion injuries to the middle and posterior columns with distraction posteriorly from tensile forces.  The ALL serves as the axis of rotation, and the anterior column may fail secondary to compression.

**4. Fracture-Dislocation**

Structures involved:

- Involvement of all three columns

Mechanism

Variable mechanisms: shear, rotation, compression, and tension

The classification systems for thoracolumbar injuries have evolved over time. However, there is no universally accepted system yet at this time.  As such, there is not a current standardized treatment algorithm explicitly designed for the Denis classification.  Instead, general treatment principles may be applied to the following fractures, although significant controversy still exists in operative indications:

**Compression Fractures**

Nonoperative:

Bracing, kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty

Operative:

Posterior instrumentation and fusion

- Indications
- 30 degrees traumatic kyphosis 
- 50% vertebral body height loss

**Burst Fractures**

Nonoperative:Bracing

Operative:

Anterior/posterior decompression and instrumented fusion

- Indications:

- Neurologic deficit
- Spinal canal compromise
- Degree of deformity
- Disruption of the posterior ligamentous complex

**Flexion-Distraction Injuries**

Nonoperative:

Bracing

- Indications: minimally displaced bony or ligamentous injuries

Operative

Posterior instrumentation, with or without fusion

- Indications: kyphotic deformity greater than 20 degrees

**Fracture Dislocation Injuries**

Operative:

All require open reduction with instrumented fusion
