They should also be given information on the early signs and symptoms of shellfish allergy so that they can seek medical attention earlier. Interprofessional teams should make patients aware that medical treatment should be sought immediately if they are unable to tolerate oral liquids if fever is noted, if blood is observed in the stool, or if other worrying symptoms develop.
