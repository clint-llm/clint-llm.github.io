The most common complication associated with rTMS is the likely induction of seizure. Although in patients without epilepsy, the risk of seizure induction is <0.01% per session. In patients suffering from epilepsy, the risk is higher, although less than 3% per session. However, less serious complications include local pain, mostly headache or neck pain, and transient tinnitus. Hyperacusis is another complication due to the loud clicks during rTMS sessions. Hence hearing protection becomes essential during the sessions. The adverse effects are usually short-lived and mild. rTMS does not require sedation with anesthesia during the treatment. At times, the patient's inability to follow-up for the sessions also determines the patient's response to rTMS.
