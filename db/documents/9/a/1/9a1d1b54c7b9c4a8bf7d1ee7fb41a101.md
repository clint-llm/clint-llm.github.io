Patients with an increased risk for serious cardiac events due to increased heart rate (patients with stable coronary disease) require close monitoring during treatment with cilostazol. Patients also need monitoring for bleeding episodes and easy bruising or other signs such as pyrexia and sore throat, suggesting the early development of blood dyscrasia. A complete blood count is necessary if a suspected infection or other clinical evidence suggests blood dyscrasia. If the patient shows any clinical or laboratory evidence of a hematologic abnormality, cilostazol therapy should be discontinued immediately.

Caution is necessary when co-administering cilostazol with any other pharmacologic agent that can reduce blood pressure due to the possibility of an additive hypotensive effect with reflex tachycardia. Dual administration of cilostazol with other antiplatelet drugs also requires caution as there is a risk for spontaneous, prolonged, or excessive bleeding.
