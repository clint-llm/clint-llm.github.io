The nearest differential diagnosis to pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis is pulmonary tumor embolism. Signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale are much more common in the latter. Although clinical and radiological overlaps are common, both conditions represent end-stage malignancy and are evaluated and managed similarly. Pulmonary lymphangitic sarcomatosis is a rare but closely resembling entity with similar clinical and imaging features.

Pulmonary embolism(thrombotic as well as non-thrombotic), obstructive airway disease, community-acquired pneumonia, especially viral, atypical, or fungal pneumonia with an interstitial pattern(eg.pneumocysis jirovecii), ARDS, pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure could easily mimic lymphangitis carcinomatosis clinically and radiologically.

Interstitial lung diseases to be considered include acute idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, severe eosinophilic pneumonia, sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, alveolar hemorrhage syndrome, connective tissue disorder associated interstitial lung diseases,drug-induced lung disease, radiation pneumonitis, lymphomas, and vasculitis.

Erdheim-Chester disease, a rare proliferating form of non-Langerhans histiocytosis presenting with respiratory symptoms with radiology closely mimicking lymphangitic carcinomatosis, has been described in the literature.
