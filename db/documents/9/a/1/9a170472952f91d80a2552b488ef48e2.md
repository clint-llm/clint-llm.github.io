Researchers estimate that 30,000 to  70,000 deaths are attributable to rabies each year, with less developed countries affected more. In the United States, there are few human cases reported, though that may be due to the widespread use of post-exposure prophylaxis and the prevention programs in place. In developed countries, domesticated animals have only been responsible for about 10% of cases of rabies transmission, while wild animals such as skunks, raccoons, foxes, and especially bats are responsible for the rest of the cases. Any mammal may carry rabies, and so while small rodents and the rabbit family usually are considered safe as they are not expected to survive an inoculating wound from a rabid animal, there have been anecdotal reports of rabies caused by transmission from rats. As animal carriers vary by region, it is important to know your region’s carriers to help determine who may need prophylaxis.
