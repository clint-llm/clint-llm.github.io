Telemedicine offers both physicians and patients an alternative to in-person visits and services. As such, both parties can enjoy several benefits, whether using telemedicine for follow-up visits, medication management, remote post-hospitalization care, assisted living support, or school-based services. Overall, patients benefit from potentially less time away from family, home, and work. Patients can save money on travel expenses. Patients can have a new layer of privacy and also not physically expose themselves to other patients who potentially harbor contagious illnesses. Physicians benefit from reaching new patient populations without requiring additional travel, improved revenue, and often excellent private payer reimbursement. Furthermore,  physicians gain from having less missed appointments and better patient follow through and compliance.

The two critical care physicians, Dr. Rosenfeld and Dr. Breslow, at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, developed the initial technology for the electronic ICU (e ICU) in 1998. Ever since then, the eICU has expanded to many hospital systems across the world.

The 21st-century telemedicine applications go well beyond the remote clinician’s capabilities of diagnosis and therapeutic interventions to demonstrated capabilities in telesurgery, remote psychotherapy, and virtual home visits to manage chronic medical problems.
