Allgrove syndrome is a syndrome of unknown incidence and variable presentation with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. The probable recurrence risk with Allgrove syndrome is 25%. However, the actual incidence is difficult to determine because of the variable presentation. Most of the reported cases appear in Black, Native Americans, Arabs, and Asian descent males and females. Specific symptoms such as adrenal insufficiency are not prominent until the first two decades of life, whereas, alacrima typically occurs in early infancy, and symptoms of achalasiaÂ can be present in 6 months of age or late adolescence.
