Getting to know the injured worker and the kind of work is imperative. The history should record:

- Probable cause of the injury

- Date and time of the injury and start of symptoms

- History of prior injuries or related disease

- Location of where the injuries occurred

- Mechanism of injury

- Whether or not the injury was witnessed

- When the injury was first reported

- Whether any psychiatric issues are present

The physical exam should include:

- Assess the genuineness of injury

- Observe the patient as they enter or leave the examination

- Observe movement from the chair to the examination table and removal of clothes

- Compare behavior, attitude, and movements with the office staff

- Note the time it takes to change into an examination gown.

- Note how they grip a pen.

Observational signs may help, especially when assessing low back pain. The clinician may identify various data during the evaluation that do not correlate. Consider all of the following:

- Does the patient easily bend over?

- Is the patient guarding with superficial palpation?

- Does the same wincing and guarding persist with distraction?

- Is motor weakness due to a lack of effort, or does it correlate with changes in reflexes and muscle atrophy?

- Is motor weakness consistent?

- Is the range of motion different with each visit?

- Is the area of tenderness different with each visit?

All observations cannot be made during a single evaluation because they often require special effort and consideration from visit to visit.
