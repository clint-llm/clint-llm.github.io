A peripheral venous Doppler US scan may be performed for several reasons. The most common reason is for evaluation of possible venous thrombotic disease or venous obstruction. This may occur either because the ordering provider suspects disease or follow-up is required for patients with known/prior DVTs when the outcome may affect therapy. Additional indications include assessment of venous insufficiency, reflux, or varicosities; vein mapping in preparation for future procedures, such as providing hemodialysis access via arteriovenous grafts or fistulas; evaluation of suspected or known vascular anomalies; evaluation of peripheral vessels status-post interventional procedures; or evaluation of peripheral veins before venous access. Peripheral venous duplex US has the benefits of non-ionizing radiation, non-invasive nature, portable, and generally well-tolerated by patients.
