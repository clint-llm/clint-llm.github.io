Impairing enterohepatic circulation of bile acids decreases cholesterol because the liver is driven to use more cholesterol to make more. This state is the basis behind treating hyperlipidemia with bile acid resins like cholestyramine, colestipol, and colesevelam, which bind bile acids in the gut, preventing their reabsorption in the intestines. The bound bile acids are then fecally removed. However, because bile acid sequestrants also interfere with the absorption of fat, the absorption of drugs and fat-soluble vitamins are impaired.

Structural/functional abnormalities of the biliary tract can produce an increase in bilirubin, causing jaundice, as well as an increase in serum bile acids. This observed cholestasis (disrupted bile flow to intestines) may also present with primary sclerosing cholangitis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, and primary biliary cholangitis, where the buildup of bile acids can lead to pruritus because of the bile salts in skin.

Bile that has diluted concentrations of bile acids or phospholipids, in addition to increased cholesterol, leads to a decrease in the solubilization of cholesterol. This situation increases the risk for microcrystal formation from this supersaturated bile--eventually leading to the formation of cholesterol stones. Fibrates like gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, and fenofibrate also increase the risk of cholesterol gallstones by inhibiting cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase, resulting in decreased bile acid production.

Too much bile acid in the colon may precipitate chronic diarrhea, which may occur in conditions that impair the ileal absorption of bile salts, as seen with surgical removal for Crohn disease (which normally causes fat malabsorption by affecting the terminal ileum). Such malabsorption of bile acids is treatable with bile acid resins.

There may also exist a link between bile acids and colorectal cancer.

Bile acids have also been used to get rid of undesired fat, i.e., mesotherapy, with deoxycholic acid being one such drug.
