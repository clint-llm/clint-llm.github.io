Aspiration can affect any age group, but the youngest and oldest are at the highest risk because of a higher incidence of risk factors. It equally affects both genders.

The exact number of individuals who develop aspiration pneumonia is not known but they are not minuscule. Hospitalized patients develop aspiration pneumonitis as a result of a drug overdose, stroke, and other CNS pathology.
