In addition to assessing the functional status of the reticuloendothelial systems of the liver and spleen, the liver/spleen scan may aid in the diagnosis of the following conditions:

- Liver damage from cirrhosis

- Splenic injury/infarction in trauma patients

- Hepatic hemangiomas

- Hepatic cysts

- Hepatic abscesses

- Splenic infarction in patients with cirrhosis

- Functional hyposplenism in patients with amyloidosis

- Budd-Chiari syndrome (due to classic decrease in uptake in the left and right lobes of the liver)

- Thrombocytopenia following splenectomy in patients who may have accessory spleens

- Evaluation of liver and spleen involvement in patients with Gaucher disease
