Hyperthyroidism is a common thyroid disorder with multiple underlying etiologies. This disease is characterized by excess thyroid hormone production. Hyperthyroidism can be overt or subclinical. Overt hyperthyroidism is defined as low or suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with elevated triiodothyronine (T3) levels and/or elevated thyroxine (T4) levels. Hyperthyroidism is associated with significant short-term and long-term morbidity. Therefore, early recognition of this condition and timely instruction of appropriate therapy is critical. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of hyperthyroidism and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the various etiologies that lead to a presentation of hyperthyroidism.
- Describe the presentation and expected examination findings when evaluating a patient with hyperthyroidism.
- Summarize the various treatment options available for hyperthyroidism, depending on specific etiology.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in prompt diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
