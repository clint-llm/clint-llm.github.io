**History**

- Include questioning about the history of dental procedures and denture use.

- Pain need not be a major complaint and, when present, is usually mild and the feeling is usually described as “dry,” “itchy,” “sore,” “irritated,” “burning”. The sensation does not extend beyond the lesion itself. If present, opening the mouth exacerbates pain. AC may be severe enough to make eating difficult and worsen malnutrition, but it is rarely a primary cause.

- Asking about symptoms of systemic disease such as diarrhea, hematochezia, abdominal pain (for Crohn disease), or dry eyes and dry mouth (for Sjogren syndrome) is appropriate.

- If thrush is present, ask about appreciable risk factors such as people suffering from diabetes, proton-pump inhibitor use, steroid use, HIV status.

**Physical**

- As an inflammatory process, angular cheilitis presents with classic features of red, edematous, often painful patches of skin at the labial commissures. They are roughly triangular lesions. Mild cases may just show some pinkish erythema with adjacent lips either normal or chapped. As the condition progresses, moisture causes the superficial skin to macerate and erode, leading to small, gray-white lesions bordered by reddened mucosa. In more moderate cases, skin becomes papular, eczematous, and more fissured. These more established lesions can be bluish-white with an associated exfoliative scale surrounded by erythema. In severe cases, fissuring is deep enough to cause bleeding, but this is rare in AC. If the inflammation is enough, damaged skin can exude and crust, but this is more typical of late lesions. Bacterial AC is more likely to have honey-colored exudates, pustules, and purulent exudates. Leukoplakia can infrequently be observed.

- Longstanding AC may also be suppurative, exfoliative, and develop granulation tissue.

- AC is usually isolated to the angles of the mouth with limited involvement of the adjacent face or lips. When AC extends beyond the vermillion border, it radiates from the angles as fissures (rhagades) and follows existing marionette lines, as this is the natural streambed for salivary flow.

- AC is frequently bilateral and symmetrical unless there is a risk factor for developing the lesion that disproportionately affects one commissure over the other. Asymmetric cases that do not have an obvious mechanical cause contributing to unilateral salivary exposure should raise red flags for less frequent etiologies.

- Always examine the oral cavity for oral candidiasis (thrush) and treat it, if present. Oral candidiasis may be one of the following:
- Acute or chronic pseudomembranous (thrush) - white, well-defined plaques on the bucca, tongue, palate, and uvula; reveal erythematous (sometimes hemorrhagic) mucosa when scraped off
- Acute or chronic atrophic or erythematous patches and plaques - large, diffuse, well-demarcated, on the palate and tongue, associated with soreness
- Chronic hyperplastic nodules or plaques - firm, leathery, and irremovable lesions on the bucca, palate, tongue, and labial commissures; they may also extend to the skin and nails
- Candida-associated lesions

- Denture stomatitis
- Median rhomboid glossitis – erythematous patches of atrophic papillae on the central dorsum of the tongue
- Angular cheilitis – as described above


- Keratinized primary lesions superinfected with Candida

- Leukoplakia
- Lichen planus
- Lupus erythematosus

**Syndromic Presentations**

- Ariboflavinosis (vitamin B2 deficiency): Cheilosis, angular cheilitis, photosensitivity, magenta glossitis, stomatitis, pharyngitis, and pseudo-syphilis (seborrhea-like dermatitis of the scrotum, vulva, philtrum, or nasolabial folds). As iron absorptions may be impaired, this deficiency can also lead to normocytic anemia.

- Pellagra (hypovitaminosis B3): Classic signs are dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, and glossitis. AC can occur.

- Vitamin B5 deficiency: Rare; AC, glossitis, seborrheic dermatitis-like rash around the eyes, nose, and mouth

- Vitamin B6 deficiency:Sideroblastic anemia, cognitive or psychiatric depression, hypertension, and hyperhomocysteinemia, neuropathy, conjunctivitis, oral (aphthous-like) ulcers called stomatitis, atrophic glossitis, angular cheilitis, and intertrigo.

- Folate/Vitamin B12 deficiency: Megaloblastic anemia (pernicious anemia) and neurological symptoms. The latter include peripheral neuropathy (paresthesia, ataxia, decreased sensation), cognitive impairment/dementia, motor deficits (absent reflexes.) Lack of vitamin B12 can also cause glossitis and angular cheilitis. Patients susceptible to hypovitaminosis B12 also usually are folate deficient.

- Iron deficiency: Microcytic anemia (fatigue, exertional dyspnea, palpitations, headache, pica), glossitis, angular cheilitis, koilonychia (spoon nails), and alopecia areata (non-scarring hair loss). If the patient is also experiencing dysphagia, a barium swallow or upper endoscopy may reveal esophageal webs, making the diagnosis of Plummer-Vinson syndrome (AKA, sideropenic dysphagia or Paterson-Brown-Kelly syndrome).

- Zinc deficiency: Constellation of AC along with alopecia, diarrhea, dermatitis, and oral ulcers (especially on the tongue and buccal surfaces). Causes include acrodermatitis enteropathica, an autosomal recessive condition that impairs zinc absorption.
