The study of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and how the body affects the drugÂ falls under the term pharmacokinetics. The application of pharmacokinetic methods to ensure patients are treated safely and effectively is known as clinical pharmacokinetics. The introduction of pharmacokinetics as a discipline has facilitated the development of rational drug therapy, understanding drug action and metabolism, understanding of concentration-effect relationship, and the establishment of dosage regimens.

The most important principle in pharmacokinetics theory is drug absorption which is defined as the transportation of the unmetabolized drug from the site of administration to the body circulation system.
