****LH, FSH, and Gonads****

GnIH induces a significant decrease in the expression of LH and FSH mRNA, as seen in in-vitro studies of quail birds and chickens.

Immunochemistry done on the avian population detected GnIH peptide in the ovary (theca and granulosa cells) and testicle (interstitial, germ, and pseudostratified columnar cells of the epididymis) suggesting the possibility of autocrine/paracrine regulation of gonadal steroid production, germ cell differentiation, and maturation.

Human RFRP-3 (human GnIH) has potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of the reproductive cycle and hormone-dependent diseases due to its ability to decrease levels of gonadotropins and steroid hormones.

**Reproductive Behavior**

GnIH may also act in the brain to regulate reproductive behaviors (sexual and aggressive) by controlling the synthesis of neurosteroids. Recent research done on quail suggests that GnIH may affectÂ neurosteroid biosynthesis. GnIH increased neuroestrogen production by stimulation of the cytochrome P450 aromatase through dephosphorylation which subsequently increases aggressive behavior.

In addition, intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of GnIH in mammals showed reduced sexual behavior in male rats, reduced sexual motivation and vaginal scent marking in hamsters, and altered fos expression in different parts of the hamster brain, which also suggests GnIH has implications in reproductive behavior.

**Thyroid Hormone-Mediated GnIH Regulation**

Thyroid hormones are essential for body growth, brain development, metabolism, and proper function of the reproductive system. Therefore, children with thyroid disorders can experience a delay in pubertal development.

Researchers have conducted molecular studies in an attempt to understand the effect of thyroid hormone on puberty.

**Glucocorticoid and Melatonin-Mediated GnIH Modulation**

Stress is known to inhibit reproductive function mediated via the hypothalamic GnIH system. Studies on birds and mammals have shown that the inhibitory effect of stress on reproductive function becomes mediated by high concentrations of circulating glucocorticoids acting via the GC receptor (GR) and GC response element (GRE) in the GnIH promoter region.

Avian and hamster studies suggest that melatonin also modulates both GnIH expression and release.
