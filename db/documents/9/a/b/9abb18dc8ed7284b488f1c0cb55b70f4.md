Necrotizing enterocolitis is potentially fatal and may present with vague signs and symptoms. Early recognition is paramount. The mainstay of treatment involves cessation of enteral feedings, gastric decompression with a nasogastric tube, intravenous antibiotics, and total parenteral nutrition. The most important diagnostic study is the abdominal plain film, which will show dilated loops of bowel and may show portal venous air or pneumatosis intestinalis, which is pathognomonic. Early surgical consultation is necessary, and many of these patients require NICU admission.
