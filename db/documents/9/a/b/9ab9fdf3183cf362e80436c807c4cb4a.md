As hairy leukoplakia is a benign condition with a low morbidity rate and a tendency to resolve spontaneously, every case does not need to be specifically treated. Treatment is given for providing relief for symptoms caused by the condition or when the patient wishes to treat the condition for esthetic reasons. Treatment options include anti-retroviral drugs. Highly active antiretroviral therapy drugs usually reduce hairy leukoplakia, but the condition may reoccur when the drug dosage is reduced.

Systemic management using antiviral drugs usually resolves the condition within 7 to 14 days of treatment. Oral treatment with antiviral medication such as acyclovir needs to be given in a high dosage of about 4000 mg per day in divided dosages for at least seven days to achieve the required therapeutic levels.

Topical treatment can be done using podophyllin resin. This resin solution is used in a concentration of 25% that usually resolves the condition after a few applications.

Retinoic acid can also be used for topical treatment. Tretinoin (e.g., 0.1% vitamin A) is generally applied two or three times a day until the patches have disappeared. Retinoic acids inhibit the replication of the virus. However, the condition recurs several weeks after being successfully treated with retinoic acid.

Cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen) has also been reported to resolve hairy leukoplakia but is not a widely used treatment modality.
