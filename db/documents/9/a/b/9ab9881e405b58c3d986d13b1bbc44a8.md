Most primary care clinicians will encounter patients with a food allergy. Food items that account for 90% of hypersensitivity reactions include cow’s milk, egg, soy, wheat, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish. Peanut is one of the most frequent food allergens and can cause fatal reactions when ingested.

While avoidance of peanuts can solve the problem, the ubiquitous presence of trace amounts of peanuts in food can make complete avoidance impossible, especially in children. This activity provides data on vaccination and adaptive immune-based interventions to prevent peanut allergies.
