The diagnosis and management of melanocytic nevi are best made with an interprofessional team that also includes the pharmacist and nurses; the latter two play a role in educating the public about prevention.

If melanocytic nevi are not diagnosed, the prognosis is poor. Thus to improve patient outcomes, a thorough exam of the skin is vital. Patients may present with a changing plantar mole. Acral melanomas typically are discovered only upon focused examination of the soles and toe webs. Simple clinical evaluation looking for asymmetry, irregular borders, color variation, diameter greater than 6 mm, and change over time or lesion elevation is important. If there is ever a doubt about a skin lesion, a biopsy should be performed.
