Other aortic arch conditions causing dilation of the vessel segment, including pseudo-aneurysm, intramural hematoma, and aortic dissection, can manifest with similar symptoms to those of aortic arch aneurysm. Pseudoaneurysms usually develop secondary to deceleration injury or torsional trauma from accidents and falls. The chest pain from aortic dissection is usually very severe and described as tearing and sharp in nature.

These aortic lesions, along with some other conditions including mediastinal mass, torturous aorta, and senile ectasia, mimic the plain radiographic findings of the thoracic aneurysm, including widened mediastinal silhouette and altered aortic profile and hence necessitates the need for confirmatory diagnostic imaging studies like angiography to rule out these disorders.
