Common side effects include peripheral edema, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, somnolence, ataxia, headache, vertigo, dysarthria, and urinary retention. Creatine kinase (CK) levels have also been shown to be elevated in patients treated with ziconotide. These elevations of CK were not associated with muscle weakness. Serum CK levels must be checked monthly. Hypotension is another possible side effect that can be worsened with the coadministration of clonidine or bupivacaine in the intrathecal space. More serious reactions may include hallucinations, delirium, paranoia, psychosis, rhabdomyolysis, meningitis, cognitive or memory impairment, and acute renal failure. Patients that are also on oral antidepressants and anticonvulsants might have an increased risk of these side effects. Patients should frequently be monitored for cognitive impairment and changes in mood or consciousness.
