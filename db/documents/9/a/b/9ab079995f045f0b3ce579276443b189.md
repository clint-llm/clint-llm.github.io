Long-term data regarding prognosis inÂ fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is lacking. The American Heart Association states that progression in FMD is unusual, and moreover, it is challenging to accurately assess progressive stenosis. Currently, it is believed that FMD is a benign disorder that is incidentally discovered. Of all the vessels, however, involvement of the cranial nerves carries a grim prognosis in young people. Finally, the disorder is also involved in the dissection of the arteries, which can turn out to be catastrophic.
