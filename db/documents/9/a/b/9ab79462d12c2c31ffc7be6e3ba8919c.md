Recognizing patients with atrioventricular reentry tachycardia and including the appropriate specialist is vital in better managing this condition. A cardiologist, specifically one who specialized in electrophysiology should evaluate the patient to determine the need for accessory pathway ablation as this can provide a definitive cure and prevent the patient from long term antiarrhythmic medication that can bear a lot of unwanted side effects. Patients managed with antiarrhythmic drugs are usually followed by the primary care provider and nurse practitioner, but they should never make changes to these medications without first consulting with the cardiologist. All patients need regular ECGs to ensure that the arrhythmia has resolved.
