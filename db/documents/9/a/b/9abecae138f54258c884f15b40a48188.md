While on cholecalciferol, it is advised to monitor the levels of alkaline phosphatase, BUN to creatinine ratio, calcium (free and total), magnesium, and phosphate. It is also essential to ensure that patients are not confusing cholecalciferol with other sound-alike or look-alike medications such as alfacalcidol and ergocalciferol.
