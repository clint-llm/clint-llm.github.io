The cause of cystinuria is an inheritable, autosomal recessive genetic defect that affects the proximal renal tubular reabsorption of cystine. This same problem also affects ornithine, lysine, and arginine (COLA), but only cystine is clinically significant as it is the only amino acid in this group that will form stones. Cystine is the least soluble of all the essential amino acids. Interestingly, intestinal transport and absorption of cystine in patients with cystinuria also tend to be impaired, but other factors significantly offset this benefit.

Cystinuria would not be a problem except for its relative insolubility in urine at physiological pH levels and normal body temperatures. Cystine solubility is highly pH-dependent because it substantially increases as the urine becomes more alkaline, especially above a pH of 7.

Cystine solubility is also affected by urinary macromolecules, electrolytes, and ions, all of which increase cystine's solubility.

The specific genetic cause has been identified as mutations in the SLC3A1 gene on chromosome 2, the SLC7A9 gene on chromosome 19, or rarely both.

Various genotypic and phenotypic types have been identified, but they appear to have relatively little effect on the clinical course.  No difference in the number of stones, age at the time of the first stone event, nor the total number of stone episodes has been observed between the different genetic types.
