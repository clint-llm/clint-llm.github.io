Many surgical operations of the hand require a thorough understanding of thenar eminence anatomy. Carpal tunnel syndrome, thumb arthritis, and fractures are common conditions that may require surgery.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is caused by compression of the median nerve at the transverse carpal ligament. The thenar eminence is innervated by a branch of this nerve, so severe forms of CTS can have significant ramifications on the thenar eminence and, ultimately, thumb function.

Carpal tunnel release can be performed to decompress the median nerve by incising the transverse carpal ligament to increase the space within the carpal tunnel. It can be performed in either an open or endoscopic manner. Open techniques use a slightly larger incision, but there are no differences in outcomes. The surgery only takes about 15 minutes, and most patients will have relief from either some or all of their symptoms.

Surgical options for thumb arthritis include arthroscopic debridement, osteotomy of the first metacarpal, trapeziectomy, carpometacarpal (CMC) arthrodesis, CMC denervation, and CMC prosthetic arthroplasty. Each of these procedures is unique in its technique, but all of them involve navigating through or manipulating some anatomical portion of the thenar eminence.

Fractures of the first metacarpal or trapezium affect the thenar eminence. All three muscles of the thenar eminence have part of their origin on the trapezium and travel superficially to the first metacarpal. Fractures here can disrupt the integrity of these muscles and may also damage nearby neurological structures causing sensory or motor deficits. Surgical interventions include open reduction, internal fixation, external fixation, and metacarpophalangeal arthroplasty or fusion.
