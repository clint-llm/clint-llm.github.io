Providers should educate patients about the need for the device and based on the indications and pacing needs, what type of device will benefit most. This must be done before device implantation.

However, if single chamber ventricular lead devices are to be implanted then the patient must be counseled in detail about the possibility, prevalence and signs/symptoms of this condition. Every attempt must be made to maintain electrical synchrony in patients undergoing cardiac rhythm device implantation.
