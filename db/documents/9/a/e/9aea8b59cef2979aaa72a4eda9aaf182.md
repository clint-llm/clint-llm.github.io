While surgical management of a cleft foot is comparatively straightforward, surgical management of a cleft hand is variable and largely dependent on underlying anatomy. A small first web space between the thumb and index finger can be detrimental to the functional use of the hand, as the thumb is unable to have the same range of motion and lever arm present in an anatomically normal first webspace. Therefore, the functional goal of most surgeries is to split the cleft in half with an incision that wraps from the cleft and around the index finger into the first webspace. Often a flap from the ulnar half of the cleft is used to increase the depth of the first webspace, ultimately creating a wider and more functional space between the index finger and the thumb. Details of each surgical procedure are unique and based on each patientâ€™s presenting deformity. Soft tissue releases, transfers, and osteotomies of the metacarpals may be necessary to achieve a more functional alignment.
