The lung is one of the most common sites of cancer metastasis. This activity will provide an overview of the common cancers that metastasize to the lung, the diagnostic work-up, and currently available treatment options. It will also review the molecular basis of metastasis and the critical role of genetics, epigenetics, cytokines, and chemokines involved in the pathophysiology of metastasis. The importance of an interprofessional team to diagnosis and management will be reviewed.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the common tumors metastasizing to the lungs and their radiologic pattern.
- Outline the underlying genetic and molecular biological pathways leading to metastasis of cancers to the lung.
- Review the diagnostic workup for suspected lung metastasis in patients.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and improve outcomes in lung metastasis.
