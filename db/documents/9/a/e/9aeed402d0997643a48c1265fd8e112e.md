Unfortunately, laboratory tests provide little help in the diagnosis; however, they can exclude more common conditions in the differential, including myocardial infarction and pancreatitis. Imaging is of high importance in diagnosing Boerhaave syndrome. While chest X-ray is readily available, it is normal for approximately 15% of cases and can not be used to exclude the diagnosis. Potential chest X-ray findings include subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema, mediastinal widening, pleural effusion, and in 20% of cases, the “V sign” (radiolucent streak of air dissecting the retrocardiac fascial planes).

The diagnostic tool of choice is the contrast esophagogram using a water-soluble contrast agent such as gastrografin. Such a study will show the extravasation of contrast material at the site of the perforation. Even though barium is superior in demonstrating small perforations, its use is not advised since extravasation of this material can lead to mediastinitis with subsequent fibrosis. CT scan is being used by many instead of contrast esophagogram due to its higher sensitivity and more detailed assessment of the involved organs. Endoscopy should be used with caution due to the risk of further esophageal perforation.  If a chest tube is present, one can also use the methylene blue dye test. When sweetened methylene blue is taken orally, it gives a bluish discoloration to the chest tube effluent within 12 to 24 hours.
