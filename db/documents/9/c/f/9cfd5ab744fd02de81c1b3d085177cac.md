Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration is an inflammatory autoimmune process that occurs due to the destruction of cerebellar Purkinje cells by onconeural antibodies; these antibodies are produced by the immune system in response to a protein that is expressed by tumor cells. This protein is known as cerebellar degeneration-related protein 2.

Multiple onconeural antibodies were detected in patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration and are thought to the culprit in the cerebellar Purkinje cells injury. These antibodies include anti-Yo (PCA-1), anti-Hu, anti-Ri, anti-Tr, anti-VGCC, anti-Ma, anti-CRMP5 (anti-CV2), and anti-mGluR.
