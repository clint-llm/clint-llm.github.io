Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, alkaptonuria is an inactive gene mapped on chromosome 3q21-23 coding for the enzyme homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase, also known as HGD. This enzyme is critical as a component of phenylalanine/tyrosine catabolism, a principal degradation pathway for these amino acids.

The result is systemic sequestration of homogentisate – a colorless phenol that - upon the decay to benzoquinone, can irreversibly bind with collagen. Another effect is that polymerization of this molecule takes on an iridescent dark hue, tinting affected tissue and also known for turning urine black. Aside from just discoloration, these processes can cause degradation, degeneration, and developmental problems in all types of collagen.

Exogenous ochronosis is a limited cutaneous version of the same process. In exogenous ochronosis, various phenolic compounds enzymatically inhibit homogentisate dioxygenase. The result is chemically very similar to alkaptonuria, albeit localized to the skin. Common phenols responsible for exogenous ochronosis are quinines/antimalarials,
