Selective serotonin receptor (5-HT3) antagonists block serotonin both peripherally, on gastrointestinal (GI) vagal nerve terminals, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This blockade results in powerful antiemetic effects. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are FDA-approved for preventing nausea and vomiting in children and adults related to chemotherapy use, radiation therapy, and the effects of postoperative anesthesia. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse events, and other key elements of antiemetic 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in the clinical setting as relates to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients who can benefit therapeutically from these agents.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.
- Identify the approved indications for 5-HT3 receptor blockers.
- Review the potential adverse events associated with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance appropriate clinical outcomes with 5-HT3 receptor blocker therapy to treat nausea and vomiting and drive the optimal outcomes.
