With monocular visual deprivation during visual development, there is competition between the neural networks of the two eyes for impact on cortical neurons. Different aspects of neuronal selectivity, such as synaptic plasticity, activity-dependence, and neuronal network learning, have different sensitive periods and are therefore affected differently by the types ofÂ vision deprivation involved.

It is the anatomic relationships of photoreceptors to ganglion cell receptor fields, ganglion cell receptor fields to the layers in the lateral geniculate, and the lateral geniculate to the layers of the visual cortex that determine amblyopia. The age of onset and duration of the disability determines its depth. The earlier the onset and the longer it goes untreated, the harder amblyopia is to correct.
