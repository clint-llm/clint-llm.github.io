HAV is one of the most common causes of acute hepatitis infection worldwide. The WHO estimates that approximately 1.5 million people are infected with HAV each year. Endemic rates are high in developing countries with low socioeconomic conditions and poor sanitation and hygiene practices. Exposure in these developing countries usually occurs in childhood. Infection rates are low in developed countries such as the United States, Canada, and Western Europe. High-risk groups in low endemicity countries have been identified as injection-drug users, men who have sex with men, people traveling to endemic areas, and isolated communities such as nursing homes and even day-care centers. The incidence of HAV in a given population correlates with socioeconomic properties such as income, the density of housing, sanitation, and water quality. With the implementation of vaccination, the incidence of HAV in the United States has significantly decreased. The incidence of acute HAV infection has decreased by 92% from 12 cases per 100,000 in 1995 to 1 case per 100,000 in 2007.

Most cases of transmission are from person to person and limited to close contacts. Blood transfusion is a very rare cause of hepatitis A.
