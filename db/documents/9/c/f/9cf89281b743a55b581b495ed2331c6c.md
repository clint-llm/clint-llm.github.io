The interplay of various dynamic movements can lead to multispectral patterns of associated injuries in conjunction with cervical subluxations. The Allen and Ferguson classification system has categorized the principle loading forces with the resultant spinal injuries as follows:

- Hyperflexion injury - unilateral or bilateral locked facets with associated injury to the interspinous ligaments, and teardrop fracture

- Hyperextension injury - fracture of the facets, lamina, and posterior subluxation following disruption of the anterior longitudinal ligament

- Axial loading - leads to burst fracture and damage to all ligaments.

The principal mechanics behind the bilateral jumped facets include hyperflexion injury, axial loading, and anterior shear.
