There are multiple complications reported due to gastrointestinal tuberculosis:

- Upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding

- Fistula occurring at different sites

- Obstruction of lumen of the gut

- Stricture formation

- Intussusception

- Perforation

- Anemia

- Malnutrition, malabsorption, weight loss, and deficiency of essential vitamins and minerals

- Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy was reported in one case

As noted earlier, intestinal TB has often been mistaken for Crohn disease. Treatment with immune-suppressive therapy in such cases, unfortunately, resulted in adverse outcomes.

Like other forms of TB, there is a concern for the emergence ofÂ MDR TB infections in the abdomen.
