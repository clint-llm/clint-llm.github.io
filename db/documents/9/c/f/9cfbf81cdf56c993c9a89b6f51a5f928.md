Patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are usually placed in a prone position as a treatment strategy to improve ventilation and oxygenation. Similarly, certain surgical procedures involving the posterior anatomical structures also require a prone position for easy access. These patients may suffer cardiac arrest, necessitating immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Given that considerable effort is often needed to return these patients to the supine position, CPR may have to be initiated in the prone position. Unlike CPR in the supine position, basic and advanced CPR in the prone position is not well known. Additionally, there is limited data from available guidelines to standardize performance. This activity reviews the indications, current evidence, technique, and the role of the interprofessional team in providing prone CPR.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications and technique of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the prone position.
- Review the available data in the literature and recommended guidelines on cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the prone position.
- Identify the efficacy, feasibility, limitations, and complications of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the prone position.
- Summarize recommendations for potential areas of future research on cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the prone position.
