The vagal nuclei incorporate a sensory, motor, and special sensory information from the facial nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve, vagus nerve, and cranial portions of the spinal accessory nerve.

The dorsal motor nucleus of CN X sends parasympathetic, visceral efferent fibers to thoracic and abdominal viscera via the vagus nerve.

Nucleus ambiguus innervates pharyngeal, soft palate, and intrinsic laryngeal muscles via the superior and recurrent laryngeal nerves â€“ branches of the vagus. Nucleus ambiguus also innervates the stylopharyngeus muscle via the glossopharyngeal nerve.

Nucleus tractus solitarius receives fibers from the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves that convey taste from the anterior two-thirds and posterior one-third of the tongue, respectively. The vagus nerve transports afferent nerve fibers from the pharynx, larynx, aorta, external ear, dura of the posterior cranial fossa, and taste buds from the root of the tongue and epiglottis that all synapse on the nucleus solitarius.

The spinal trigeminal nucleus receives sensory information from the trigeminal nerve, facial nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve, and vagus nerve.
