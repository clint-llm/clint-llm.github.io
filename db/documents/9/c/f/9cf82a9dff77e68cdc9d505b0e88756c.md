Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) represents myocytes that, on histological analysis, are hypertrophied in the mix of fibrosis due to myocyte cell death secondary to small vessel ischemia. Any of the anatomical variants of HCM can cause a multitude of hemodynamic changes in the heart, which can result in ischemia of the myocardial tissue, mitral regurgitation, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and stiffening of the left ventricle. These hemodynamic changes can, in turn, result in symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or syncope.

Further anatomical and structural changes in the intramural coronary arteries that account for these symptoms are hyperplasia of the vessel walls, which result in decreased flow reserve in the coronaries and impaired vasodilator response. The resulting myocardial substrate in HCM also predisposes patients to ventricular tachyarrhythmias that may contribute to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.
