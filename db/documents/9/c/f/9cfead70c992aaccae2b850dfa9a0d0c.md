A lesion in the ventromedial portion of midbrain leads to Weber syndrome. The midbrain receives its blood supply from the paramedian mesencephalic branches (basilar), peduncular perforating branches (posterior cerebral artery) as well as from the superior cerebellar artery, and the choroidal arteries.

Isolated infarctions of the paramedian mesencephalic and the peduncular perforating branches are the most common cause of Weber syndrome.

Antecedent history of hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia is often associated with Weber syndrome, like other strokes.

In one case series, isolated midbrain infarction was seen in only 7.6% of the cases and most were associated with the concurrent infraction in other vascular territories of the vertebrobasilar system.

- Cardioembolism

- Insitu thrombosis

- Large artery to artery embolism and

- Intrinsic perforator branch disease (lacunar infarct)
