Strain Counterstrain and FPR work on a cellular level to relieve pain, somatic dysfunction, and range of motion limitations by acting on muscle spindles, Golgi tendon organs, and inflammatory pathways.

Proprioceptors are end organs that sense physical changes in musculoskeletal tissues, muscle length, joint position, and tendon tension.

When a muscle stretches, type 1a sensory fibers and type II sensory fibers fire at increased frequencies to denote velocity and length stretched, respectively.

Intrafusal fibers, the thin muscle fibers found in the muscle spindle, can intensify the strength of the afferent signal produced if the muscle stretches and the intrafusal fibers become contracted, rather than at rest.

Golgi tendon organs are proprioceptors/mechanoreceptors found in tendons and joint capsules and inform the CNS of the tension/force created by the muscle contraction, not stretch.

Inflammatory pathway initiation by strain or stress to muscle tissue causes fibroblasts to release IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, and IL-16.

Substance P and calcitonin G relation protein (CGRP) increase the microcirculation by dilating blood vessels and increasing permeability.
