The primary muscles associated with the nasopharynx are the tensor veli palatini, levator veli palatini, and the salpingopharyngeus, which all originate from the eustachian tube opening. The tensor veli palatini tenses the soft palate, and the levator veli palatini elevates the soft palate, which helps seal off the nasopharynx from the oropharynx during swallowing. The salpingopharyngeus also aids with swallowing by elevating the pharynx. Additionally, all three of these muscles open the eustachian tube orifice during swallowing, which helps equilibrate atmospheric pressure between the middle ear cavity and the nasopharynx.
