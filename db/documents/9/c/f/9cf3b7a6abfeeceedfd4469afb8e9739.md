Sickle cell disease patients have broad clinical manifestations due to vaso-occlusive crisis and hemolysis. These patients present with generalized pain. Exacerbation could be due to some form of infection so a patient could also present with anÂ upper-respiratory infection, urinary tract infection, or pneumonia.

Unlike sickle cell disease, sickle cell trait patients do not have crises. They are for the most part asymptomatic. Their presentation is similar to patients with normal hemoglobin.They could have a family history positive for HbSS.

Sickle cell trait patients may have hematuria and rhabdomyolysis.
