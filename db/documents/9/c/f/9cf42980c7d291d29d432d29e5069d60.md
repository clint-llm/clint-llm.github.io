The human iris consists of two main parts, the anterior stromal part and the posterior double-layered pigmented epithelium. The muscular part of the iris is defined by the iris dilator muscle and the sphincter pupillae muscle. The muscles are sandwiched between the anterior and posterior layers.

The stromal layer consists of stromal cells, melanocytes, and fibrocytes. These cells have large intercellular spaces in between them. These gaps consist of collagen fibers, ground matrix, and aqueous humor. Multiple crypts are present in the stroma, which allow smooth passage of aqueous humor in the anterior chamber. The stroma has loose layers of melanocytes, connective tissue matrix, and blood vessels. Hyaluronic acid is the primary component of connective tissue that takes part in stroma formation and provides elasticity during surgical interventions.

The posterior layer is continuous, with the sphincter muscle ring, pigmented epithelium, and myofibrils of dilator pupillae. The dilator pupillae muscle is thickest at the iris root insertion and thins out as it goes out towards the periphery at the pupillary edge. The traumatic and iatrogenic iris wounds don't heal on their own. When an iridotomy is performed, a defect is created, and there is no support for stromal and pigment cells and even fibroblasts to migrate and bridge the defect. As a result, no fibrosis or scarring takes place.

Previous studies have revealed that healing in iris defects occurs adjacent to a suture only. At the suturing site, scarring occurs with infiltration by fibroblasts, plasma cells, and macrophages with minimal collagen. The presence of a suture governs the long-term strength of the iris defect. The iris defect's closure occurs by forming a cyclitic membrane due to a fibrinoid reaction. The vascular supply of the iris is divided into the major arterial arcade and the minor arterial arcade. The major arterial circle supplies the front portion of the ciliary body, and a minor arterial circle supplies the iris stroma. This vascular supply is the main cause of hyphema during traumatic injuries to the iris.
