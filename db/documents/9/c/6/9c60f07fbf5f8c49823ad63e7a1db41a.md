The management of sideroblastic anemia depends on severity. For patients with a mild or asymptomatic presentation, physicians can follow up in the outpatient clinic. For patients diagnosed with the X-linked sideroblastic anemia, oral pyridoxine 50-100mg/day has been proven to partially or completely correct anemia.

For patients with syndromic congenital sideroblastic anemia, diabetes mellitus could develop and in such patients, tight glycemic control should be encouraged. Hypoglycemia should also be considered if blood sugar is not well controlled.

For secondary acquired sideroblastic anemia caused by known drugs or toxins, such drugs should be discontinued and avoided. Since it is acquired, patient anemia will improve after the removal of the drug.

Copper should be replaced in a patient with copper deficiency via nutrition.

For patients with MDS/MPN-RS-T, aspirin therapy is recommended if theÂ patient has additional JAK2V617F mutation.
