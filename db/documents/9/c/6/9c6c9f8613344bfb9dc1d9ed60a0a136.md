The lateral and medial menisci are crescent-shaped fibrocartilaginous structures that collectively cover approximately 70% of the articular surface of the tibial plateau and primarily function in load transmission and shock absorption through the tibiofemoral joint. They are wedge-shaped with thicker portions at the periphery of the joint, thereby deepening the articular surface area of the tibial plateau, which improves joint congruency and acts as a secondary stabilizing mechanism within the joint. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients who present with tearing injuries of the knee menisci and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the various types of injury mechanisms, both chronic and acute, that can lead to meniscal tears.
- Outline the diagnostic procedure for suspected meniscal tears, including any necessary diagnostic imaging.
- Review the various treatment options for knee meniscus tears, depending on the underlying etiology.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients who present with a meniscal tear in the knee.
