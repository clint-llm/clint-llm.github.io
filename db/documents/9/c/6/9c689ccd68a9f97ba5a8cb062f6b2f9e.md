During the evaluation of wrist pain following an acute injury, fractures and dislocations should have an evaluation, and plain radiographs are in order if a fracture is suspected with additional imaging as needed. If imaging studies fail to show bony pathology, one should also evaluate for tendon injuries, occult ganglia, evidence of infection or neoplasia when indicated, or neurovascular problems with appropriate workup.
