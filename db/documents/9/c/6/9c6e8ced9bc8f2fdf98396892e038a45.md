There are currently no biomarkers available for the diagnosis of CTE, and definitive diagnosis is made purely on postmortem neuropathological evaluation. While significant decreases in cerebrospinal fluid ApoE and amyloid beta have been found after TBI, there, unfortunately, have been no such studies to confirm if this is true with CTE. Therefore, fluid biomarkers may be a potential method of diagnosing CTE in the future. There is also hope that neuroimaging with functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging, volumetric MRI, and positron emission tomography can be added to fluid biomarkers for improved diagnosis of CTE.
