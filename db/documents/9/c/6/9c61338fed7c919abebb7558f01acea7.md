# Continuing Education Activity

The indication for the use of an alpha-receptor modifying medication depends on which receptor is the target: the alpha-1 receptor or the alpha-2 receptor. Further, when administering a pharmacologic agent, it can exert either agonistic or antagonistic activity on the alpha receptors. This activity reviews the various alpha receptors and examines the types of agents that can act upon these receptors to alter the physiologic response for therapeutic effect.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the two predominant types of alpha-adrenergic receptors.
- Describe the effects of agonistic and antagonistic activity on the various alpha receptors.
- Summarize the potential adverse effects for each type of alpha agonist or antagonist medication class.
- Explain how knowledge of alpha-receptor physiology can help improve care coordination amongst the interprofessional team.

# Indications

The indication for the use of an alpha-adrenergic receptor modifying medication depends on which receptor is the target: the alpha-1 receptor or the alpha-2 receptor. Alpha-1 receptors bind catecholamines including, both epinephrine and norepinephrine. In instances in which there is hypoperfusion secondary to decreased cardiac output or decreased systemic vasculature resistance, alpha-1 receptors become stimulated.  It is worth noting that these compounds are not purely selective for the alpha receptor, and often engage beta-adrenergic receptors as well. The use of alpha-1 agonists is common in all types of shock, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and heart failure decompensation.

Alpha-blockers have significant use in the setting of pre-operative pheochromocytoma care.

# Mechanism of Action

There are two types of alpha-adrenergic receptors; alpha-1 and alpha-2. Both are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR); however, the downstream effects of the two are different. The alpha-1 receptor is of the Gq type, resulting in activation of phospholipase C, increasing IP3 and DAG, and ultimately increasing the intracellular calcium concentrations leading to smooth muscle contraction and glycogenolysis.

# Administration

Administration of alpha-1 receptor agonists is done intravenously through a central line for shock. In the setting of anaphylaxis, epinephrine administration should be either intramuscular or subcutaneous, not intravenous. Phenylephrine can be administered orally for congestion. Alpha-1 receptor antagonists can be administered orally for refractory hypertension, behavioral modification, and urinary hesitancy.  In the emergent setting, the administration of alpha-1 blockade agents can be via the intravenous route. Alpha-1 antagonists are predominantly administered orally and in the outpatient setting. Alpha-2 agonists can be given orally or intravenously, depending on the setting and requirement.

# Adverse Effects

The adverse effects can be related to autonomic response to the systemic changes induced by the agent or to other receptors being antagonized, often those in the beta-adrenergic receptor family.  When ordering an alpha-1 blocker, it is important to be aware and inform the patient of a first-dose effect. With the initial administration of an alpha-1 blocker, systemic vasodilation can lead to a tachycardic response and orthostatic hypotension.

# Contraindications

As with all drugs, the prescriber should account for any previous history of hypersensitivity before the administration. Alpha-1 receptor agonists are contraindicated in patients with the Reynaud phenomenon or closed-angle glaucoma.

# Monitoring

Monitoring depends on the setting of drug administration. If the clinician is giving the drug to increase systemic vascular resistance, then the patient should be maintained on continuous telemetry with ideally continuous monitoring of central venous pressure and arterial pressure. During a period of acute illness, the patient and will likely be under close monitoring in general; special consideration is necessary for cardiac rhythm and blood pressure.  If being given for anaphylaxis, the patient should be monitored in a hospital setting for at least ten hours, as anaphylaxis can have a biphasic onset related to the metabolism of the epinephrine.

# Toxicity

Alpha-1 receptor agonists taken at toxic doses lead to increased sympathetic tone, which results in tachycardia, early hypertension progressing to hypotension, mydriasis, anxiety, and increased glycogenolysis. Recent ingestion or asymptomatic patients require observation; if very recent, then activated charcoal may be an option to attempt to prevent the drug from absorbing if the drug was ingested orally. If symptomatic, the patient should be admitted, generally to the intensive care unit. Symptomatic treatment is the mainstay, with control of the airway, blood pressure, and heart rate. The alpha blockade may be attempted with caution, as well. Once symptoms abate, the patient is considered to have wholly metabolized the drug. The toxicity of alpha-1 blockers and alpha-2 agonists is an unopposed parasympathetic activity, with bradycardia, hypotension, miosis, and sedation. Observation is sufficient in asymptomatic patients. Supportive care is necessary for symptomatic patients. There is no single antidote for either type of toxicities.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Alpha-1 agonists are used in the critical care setting to increase systemic vascular resistance are considered high alert drugs and can be very dangerous if used or dosed incorrectly. Clear and concise communication is necessary between the nurse, pharmacist, and ordering practitioner (physician, nurse, or physician assistant) in these instances to prevent mistakes that can cause morbidity and mortality. Very close continuous monitoring is also necessary for patients receiving these drugs, and many facilities assign these patients a one-to-one nurse staffing. Many local anesthetics are co-formulated with epinephrine as a hemostatic agent, and when injected subcutaneously, this can cause skin necrosis. Special care between physicians, pharmacists, and nurses is necessary to identify the local agents containing epinephrine clearly to prevent unnecessary complications. Many alpha-1 and alpha-2 drugs are used clinically in the emergency department, so clinical staff must be very thorough in medical and social history before ordering these medications.  In patients that are in skilled nursing facilities that are likely fall risks, if given an alpha-1 blocker or alpha-2 agonist, it should be communicated that they should have close monitoring by nursing staff, as well as fall precautions including a bed alarm, bed rails, and a fall mat, due to the risk of orthostatic hypotension. Drugs that affect alpha-receptors, both antagonists and agonists, require an interprofessional team approach to include clinicians, specialists, nurses, and pharmacists, all working as a collaborative interprofessional team, to direct therapy optimally and derive successful results for patients.
