Identification and management of patients with triphasic EEG activity require an interprofessional team approach involving EEG technicians, nurses, and physicians of different specialties (neurologists, intensivists, emergency physicians, and others). An interprofessional team approach could help improve outcomes for patients with accurate identification and treatment of underlying pathology. The education of the caregivers managing such patients is equally important. Adequate training in the interpretation of EEG and triphasic waves will help the clinical team to provide optimal care for these patients.
