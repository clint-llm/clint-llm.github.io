The clinical significance of the polyol pathway is tied to diabetes in terms of complications as well as specific treatment modalities.

The complications in a diabetic patient that can arise from the polyol pathway include lens swelling, osmotic imbalance, and peripheral neuropathy.

The polyol pathway also sheds light on potential treatment options for a diabetic patient. Aldolase reductase inhibitors have been researched extensively to examine whether they can be an effective treatment. The mechanism behind this treatment is that by inhibiting the first enzyme of the polyol pathway, aldolase reductase, the accumulation of sorbitol will be limited.Â Aldolase reductase inhibitors are compounds that include flavonoids, spirohydantoins, and carboxylic acid derivatives.

Studies have shown that aldolase reductase inhibitors have been effective in the early stages of diabetic complications.

Due to the redox imbalance caused by the polyol pathway, there is efficacy for the use of GLP-1 agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors in reducing renal oxidative stress in addition to their effects in glycemic control.
