Sensorineural hearing loss is managed according to the underlying cause. In acute cases where no cause is found and suspected to be of idiopathic origin, a routine brain MRI with detail to the internal auditory meatus should be requested. Usually, these patients will be commenced on oral corticosteroids with a prednisone dose of 1 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg/day) for seven days tapered over the next week.

As with all medication and due to limited evidence regarding efficacy, a clinician must weigh up the risks and benefits of treatment for an individual patient. This being said, spontaneous improvement in hearing is most likely to occur during the first two weeks. A repeat audiogram should be done within 10 to 4 days to assess improvement, and if no improvement, the patient should be considered for salvage intratympanic steroids. Some clinicians differ in their practice and may use intratympanic steroids earlier in a patient’s treatment course. They are an option, especially in refractory cases or in those patients where systemic steroids may not be suitable. Fully recovered hearing loss is defined if the follow-up PTA has improved to within 10 dB of the pre-hearing loss level.

Hearing aids are the mainstay of treatment in chronic cases, and there are various types. In most patients with presbycusis, hearing aids are of benefit even in mild or moderate cases.

Conventional behind the ear air conduction hearing aids are the most common devices for treating unilateral or bilateral hearing loss. Sound is detected by a microphone where acoustic energy is converted into electrical energy, which is amplified. The receiver then transforms the signal back into an acoustic signal, reproduced by a speaker in the patient's ear canal. They are readily available, inexpensive, and easy to replace. They are not suitable for external ear malformations of the pinna or external auditory canal and in the presence of infection. Generally, if hearing thresholds are worse than 30 dB, a patient can benefit from hearing aids.

Contralateral routing of signal (CROS) hearing aids uses a microphone in the worse ear to detect sound, transmitted wirelessly to the other hearing aid, and played into the better hearing ear by air conduction. Bilateral microphones with the contralateral routing of signal (BiCROS) hearing aids are similar, but a microphone also aids the better hearing ear on the same side.

Bone conduction hearing systems are used in conductive and mixed hearing loss where there is a large air-bone gap. It is also useful in single-sided deafness. These devices most often involve a titanium fixture into the bone. Through osseointegration, vibration from the attached sound processor is transmitted into the skull and through bone conduction to the cochlea. This bypasses the usual air conduction transmission route via the external auditory canal, tympanic membrane, and ossicles.

Other aids that patients may find useful include personal frequency modulation systems or Roger pens, which are wireless microphones used in combination with hearing aids. It allows the person holding it to focus on the speech they want to hear and diminishing background noise in noisy environments.

Cochlear implants and their use vary worldwide. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends considering cochlear implants for people with thresholds >80 dB in both ears at two frequencies who receive inadequate benefit from their hearing aids. In the US, the threshold for adults is >70 dB. The thresholds for implantation will be different depending on the socio-economic environment. A cochlear implant is a surgically fitted device that provides speech perception to patients with whom hearing aids do not benefit.
