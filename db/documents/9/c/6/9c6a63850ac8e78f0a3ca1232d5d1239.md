Surgeries to transfer a phrenic nerve are being considered. A Japanese study outlines the possibility of reconstructive surgery to regain the function of a damaged phrenic nerve. Animal models have shown promising results, and it is assumed the same technique can be used when compared to peripheral nerve reconstruction.

Animal studies in the translational model of unilateral diaphragm paralysis using cervical (C2) hemisection showed that a single dose of adenosine antagonist nano therapy induces long-term recovery and restores the function of the paralyzed diaphragm.

Another area of study is the use of daytime mouthpiece ventilation methods. It is proven that many patients have had an improvement in exercise tolerance with the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. A study in 2017 was the first to show the improvement of exercise tolerance with mouthpiece ventilation devices, which could improve patient comfort and compliance with assisted ventilation.

Myofascial exercises have been shown in patients with obstructive sleep apnea who do not tolerate CPAP therapy to improve the severity of the disease and increase expiratory muscle forces (MEP).
