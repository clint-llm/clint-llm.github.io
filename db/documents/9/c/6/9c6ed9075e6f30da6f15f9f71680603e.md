The diagnosis for most conditions associated with M. furfur is clinical. However, given the variability of clinical features and similar presentations to other diseases, microscopic examination with KOH preparation is preferred for cutaneous disorders. Biopsy of lesions such as Malassezia folliculitis and psoriasis may be necessary if refractory to treatment or certainty of diagnosis is in doubt. In PV, Wood's light may aid in diagnosis by inducing yellow-gold fluorescence of lesions colonized with M. furfur, although positive examination only results in about one-third of cases.
