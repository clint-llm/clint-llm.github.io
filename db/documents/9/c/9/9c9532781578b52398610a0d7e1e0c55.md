Electrical injuries occur when the human body comes in contact with an electrical source, either directly or through material that is a conductor. For example, a utility worker may fall from a bucket truck and instinctively grab a power line to catch himself, causing electrical injury; alternatively, the worker may be holding a pole that comes in contact with a power line, causing him to sustain electrical injury.  More commonly, a person becomes a victim of electrical injury at home, such as when an electrical cord on an appliance becomes exposed and makes contact with the human body or when an electric source contacts water that an individual is in contact with as well, such as a hair dryer falling into a bathtub.
