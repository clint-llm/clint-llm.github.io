Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a well-established percutaneous modality for decreasing portal hypertension. The major clinical indications for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts include refractory variceal hemorrhage and refractory ascites. The shunt itself is created by placing a stent between the portal vein and the hepatic vein. The resultant shunting of portal venous flow to the systemic circulation helps reduce the portosystemic gradient and alleviate bleeding and ascites without changing the extrahepatic anatomy. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and technique involved in performing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the technique involved in performing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement.
- Review the indications for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement.
- Summarize the complications associated with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement.
- Explain a structured interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement.
