Small fiber neuropathy affects the small myelinated Aδ-fibers as well as the unmyelinated C-fibers.

The autonomic small nerve fibers transmit thermoregulatory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, sudomotor, urogenital, and other autonomic signals, while the somatic small nerve fibers transmit information regarding pain, temperature, and itch.

General symptoms of SFN include fatigue, cognitive disturbances, headache, and widespread musculoskeletal pain, and thus may negatively impact their quality of life. SFN is associated with a multitude of diseases; however, it may also present idiopathic. The etiologies of SFN can be broken down into six categories.
