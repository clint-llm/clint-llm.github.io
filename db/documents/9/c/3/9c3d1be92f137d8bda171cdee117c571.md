In general, recurrent laryngeal nerve injuries can be temporary or permanent, and prognosis can vary greatly based on a variety of factors including mechanism of injury and extent of the injury, to name a few. In addition, recovery can be complete or incomplete, highlighting the complexity of nerve injuries and prognosis.

Neuropraxia is the mildest injury. With this injury, the axon remains intact, and nerve function returns in 6-8 weeks. Axonotmesis involves damage to the axon and has varying degrees of severity and prognosis.
