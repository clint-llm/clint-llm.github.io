A lumbar puncture may be indicated for both diagnostic and therapeutic reasons. The lumbar puncture may aid in the diagnosis of certain diseases that range from infectious (encephalitis, meningitis), inflammatory (multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barre syndrome), and oncologic to metabolic processes. It may also aid in the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage. A lumbar puncture may also be indicated for the intrathecal administration of certain medications such as analgesics, chemotherapeutic agents, and antibiotics.
