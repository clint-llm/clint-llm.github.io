Tonsil malignancy is staged as oropharyngeal cancer according to the AJCC TNM classification of malignant tumors. The 2016 eight edition splits oropharyngeal cancer into p16 positive and negative cancers to reflect the current understanding of the influence of HPV and p16 on the prognosis and management.

**T Classification Oropharyngeal Cancers**

- T1: Tumor 2 cm or less

- T2: Tumor more than 2 cm but less than 4 cm

- T3: Tumor greater than 4 cm or extension into the lingual surface of epiglottis

- p16 negative tumors

- T4a: Tumor invades larynx, deep/extrinsic muscle of tongue, medial pterygoid, hard palate, or mandible
- T4b: Tumor invades lateral pterygoid muscle, pterygoid plates, lateral nasopharynx, skull base; or encases carotid artery

- p16 positive tumors 

- T4: Larynx, deep/extrinsic muscle of tongue, medial pterygoid, hard palate, mandible, lateral pterygoid muscle, pterygoid plates, lateral nasopharynx, skull base; or encases carotid artery

**N Classification p16 Negative**

- N0: No regional lymph node metastasis

- N1: Single ipsilateral node less than 3 cm

- N2

- N2a: Single ipsilateral node greater than 3 cm but less than 6cm 
- N2b: Multiple ipsilateral nodes less than 6 cm
- N2c: Bilateral and contralateral nodes less than 6cm

- N3

- N3a: Single node greater than 6 cm
- N3b: Single or multiple nodes with extra-capsular spread

**N Classification p16 Positive**

- N0: No regional lymph node metastasis

- N1: Unilateral nodes all less than 6 cm

- N2: Contralateral or bilateral nodes all less than 6 cm

- N3: Metastasis greater than 6 cm

**M Classification**

- M0: No distant metastasis

- M1: Distant metastasis
