Infection most commonly occurs in children, but any individual is susceptible to E. vermicularis infection. People from tropical climates and school-agedÂ children are the most vulnerable. Infection is caused by the ingestion of the pinworm eggs. Transmission is most commonly through the fecal-oral route.

Risk factors for pinworms include poor hygiene, eating after touching contaminated items and living with an individual who is identified as egg positive.
