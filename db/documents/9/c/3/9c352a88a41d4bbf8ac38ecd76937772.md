The histopathology of the skin tag will reveal an attenuated epidermis, a flattened basal cell layer, and often increased pigmentation. The extra mass is composed of loose fibrous tissue. The mass is connected to the skin by a narrow and thin pedicle. However, there are significant variations in this attachment. Melanocytic proliferation and nevus cells are not present in the majority of cases, and most such lesions probably fall into the seborrheic keratosis spectrum. However, there is an overlap with certain other conditions like melanocytic nevi and neurofibromas. It appears that some skin tags may be the last remnants of a pre-existing melanocytic nevus.
