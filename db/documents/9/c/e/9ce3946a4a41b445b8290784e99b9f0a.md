The evaluation of new-onset neurological symptoms in a patient with suspected or confirmed immunosuppression should include progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy as part of the differential diagnosis.

In AIDS patients, the degree of immunosuppression, as evidenced by the CD4 count, is an indicator of the possible etiology underlying the abnormal neurological presentation. PML enters the differential when the CD4 count is less than 200. However, it may present even at levels above 200.

The neurologic deficits that manifest correlate with the area of white matter demyelination. The presentation of PML includes progressive, multifocal, subacute focal neurological deficits that vary depending on the site of the lesion and include a spectrum of presentations including cognitive impairment, limb ataxia, gait ataxia, hemiparesis, hemianopia, and aphasia. Areas commonly involved include the subcortical white matter, periventricular areas, and cerebellar peduncles.Â In most cases, the optic nerve and the spinal cord are unaffected.
