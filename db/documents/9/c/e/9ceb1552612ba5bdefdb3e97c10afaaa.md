Like the tumor entity, the extent of intra-abdominal tumor invasion is crucial for operability and prognosis. Intra-abdominal tumor burden is determined using the Sugarbaker Peritoneal Carcinosis Index. The abdomen is divided into 12 regions, the last 4 of which describe the small intestine, and individual lesions are classified according to their size.

After administration of cytotoxic drugs in the intra-abdominal cavity, a difference in the concentration of the cytotoxic agent is observed between the peritoneal cavity and the plasma, related to the relatively slow movement of the drug from the peritoneal cavity to the plasma (peritoneal clearance) and explained by the existence of a peritoneal-plasma barrier (Sugarbaker 1996).

Curiously, the pharmacokinetics of intraperitoneal chemotherapy is not affected by surgical removal of the diseased peritoneum.

Blood drainage from the peritoneal surface occurs via the portal vein to the liver, providing increased exposure of potential liver micrometastases to cytotoxic drugs.

Higher drug concentrations in lymph than in plasma are observed because the lymphatics transport some drugs to the systemic circulation, representing a second beneficial effect of intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

Some authors (Van der Speeten K et al. ) refer to a three-compartment model that includes the tumor-bearing peritoneum as the third compartment, where the drug is incorporated by tissue penetration.

The association of hyperthermia is justified by the fact that malignant cells are selectively destroyed by hyperthermia in the range of 41 to 43 degrees C.
