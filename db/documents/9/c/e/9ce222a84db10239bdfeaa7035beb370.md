Tracheoinnominate fistula (TIF) is a life-threatening complication most frequently described after a tracheostomy. It is associated with massive hemorrhage and high mortality. It has also been described after tracheal resection and reconstruction procedures, after penetrating neck trauma and migration of adjacent orthopedic hardware. It can also rarely occur after placement of endovascular stent grafts.
