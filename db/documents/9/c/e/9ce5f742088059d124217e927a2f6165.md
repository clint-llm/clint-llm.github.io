The umbilical artery originates from the anterior division of the internal iliac artery. In fetal life, it traverses within the umbilical cord carrying oxygen-depleted blood from the fetus to the placenta. Usually, there are two umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein within the umbilical cord. In approximately 1% of pregnancies, one of the umbilical arteries may undergo atresia, aplasia, or agenesis resulting in a single umbilical artery. In most cases, a single umbilical artery is an isolated finding, but if it is associated with other fetal anomalies, there is an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities. The umbilical arteries are identified by their caudal location within the cord with thicker walls and smaller lumen.
