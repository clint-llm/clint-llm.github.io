As the name implies, neurocutaneous syndromes are disorders involving the nervous system and the skin. It is essential for clinicians, especially pediatricians, to recognize the skin findings associated with neurocutaneous syndromes because this will guide in the surveillance for and management of possible complications associated with the condition.

Two of the most common neurocutaneous syndromes also referred to as phacomatoses, are neurofibromatosis (NF) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).
