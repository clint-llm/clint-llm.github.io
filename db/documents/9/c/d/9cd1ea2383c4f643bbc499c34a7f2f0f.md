The prognosis of choledocholithiasis depends on the presence of complications and their severity. Approximately 45% of patients with choledocholithiasis remain asymptomatic. Of all patients who refuse surgery or are unfit to undergo surgery, only 55% experience varying degrees of complications. Less than 20% of patients experience recurrence of symptoms even after undergoing therapeutic procedures. If treatment is initiated at the right time, the prognosis is deemed favorable under general circumstances.
