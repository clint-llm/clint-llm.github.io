Differential diagnoses based on clinical presentation include ascending cholangitis or acute cholecystitis. On imaging, saccular dilatations may mimic choledochal cysts, hepatic abscesses, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Type V choledochal cysts are intra-hepatic cystic dilatation of the biliary system but without the genetic abnormality of Caroli disease. However, according to the Todani classification, Caroli disease is grouped with type V choledochal cysts.
