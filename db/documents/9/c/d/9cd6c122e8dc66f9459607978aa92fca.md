Almost all fictional medical television shows feature a scene where a patient suddenlyÂ suffers from a cardiac arrest, and a heroic doctor thumps on their chest and seemingly miraculously saves them. The precordial thump, although frequently featured as successful in show business is less effective, and its use is more limited in real life. Currently, its use is recommended only for witnessed, monitored, unstable ventricular tachycardia when a defibrillator is not immediately available.
