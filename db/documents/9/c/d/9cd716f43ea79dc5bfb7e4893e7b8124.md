Untreated or severe tibial neuropathy can result in persistent pain and weakness. There can be muscle atrophy and weakness of the tibial nerve innervated muscles in the flexor compartment of the foot. If the lesion is more proximal, there can be a weakness in the plantar flexors such as the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles.

Post-surgical complications include but are not limited to infection, bleeding, formation of scar tissue, and poor wound healing. Some cases of tibial neuropathy may have persistent symptoms despite surgical release.
