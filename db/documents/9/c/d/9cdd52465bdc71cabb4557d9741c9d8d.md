A successful nasoseptal flap raise and inlay depends on a well-equipped and practiced surgical team. A standard framework of OR circulating nurse, scrub technician, anesthesia provider, and experienced endoscopic sinus and skull base surgeon is critical. The nasoseptal flap is often performed by an otolaryngologist fellowship-trained in rhinology and anterior skull base surgery; however, many neurosurgeons are competent and trained in both the elevation and inset of the nasoseptal flap. The roles of lead, assisting, or consulting surgeon can vary based on the case, location, and hospital protocol.
