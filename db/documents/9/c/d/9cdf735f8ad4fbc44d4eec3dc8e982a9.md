The typical presentation of coccydynia is pain localized to the coccyx. In traumatic coccydynia, there will be a preceding history of trauma followed by acute onset of pain. The pain will often have an insidious onset in idiopathic coccydynia without any obvious or specific precipitant. In coccydynia, due to other causes, a careful and thorough history will often suggest the possible etiology.

Coccydynia is typically worse while sitting and especially while sitting in a partly reclined (backward leaning) position.

Physical examination includes inspecting the overlying skin for any signs suggestive of infection or other differential diagnoses such as pilonidal sinus and hemorrhoids.

"Foye's finger" for coccydynia: This is comparable to "Fortin's finger," where Dr. Fortin published on the usefulness of having patients with sacroiliac joint pain point to their site of pain, thus helping to distinguish this from lumbar pain generators.

External palpation usually reveals localized tenderness focally over the coccyx.

Per rectal examination may be useful in some patients to evaluate the degree of coccygeal mobility and will typically elicit pain when manipulating the coccyx.

Beyond the evaluation of the coccyx itself, it is often helpful to assess for other sources of musculoskeletal pain by performing a physical examination of the sacroiliac joints, ischial bursae, and piriformis muscles.
