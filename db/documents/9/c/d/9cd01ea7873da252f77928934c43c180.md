Each carpal bone has its own unique features that contribute to a specific function in the wrist. Starting from the proximal row, the scaphoid, named for its boat-like appearance, forms the radial border of the proximal carpal row. Most of the surface of the scaphoid is covered by articular cartilage, which allows it to bridge the joint between the two rows of carpal bones. The lunate, described for its crescent shape, is located between the scaphoid and the triquetrum and lies near the median nerve. The triquetrum is a pyramid-shaped bone that articulates with the pisiform, lunate, and hamate bones. Last, the pisiform is a pea-shaped bone that articulates with the triquetrum on its dorsal surface and serves as an attachment site for various tendons and ligaments.

Moving next to the distal row, the trapezium sits between the scaphoid and the base of the first metacarpal bone. It has a saddle-shaped facet for articulation with the first metacarpal and provides a site for a few tendons and ligaments to either pass through or attach. The trapezoid is the smallest carpal bone and is located between the trapezium and the capitate. Conversely, the capitate is the largest and most central carpal bone with articulations to several bones and attachments to several intercarpal ligaments. Last, the hamate, named for its hook-like hamulus, forms the ulnar border of the distal carpal row that serves to protect the ulnar artery and nerve within Guyon's canal and provide attachments to several ligaments as well.

In general, the bones of the hand find their arrangement in three arches: one longitudinal arch, spanning the hand lengthwise, and two transverse arches, one at the level of the metacarpal head and the second transverse arch at the level of the carpus. This anatomy mechanically contributes to the hand's ability to grasp objects. In particular, the arrangement of the carpal bones in a transverse arch makes up the floor of the carpal tunnel and provides support and protection to the finger flexor tendons and the median nerve. Moreover, the scaphoid and trapezium both have prominent tubercles projecting anteriorly that not only contribute significantly to the bony anatomy of the carpal tunnel but also provide a supporting base for the thumb to allow it to oppose the rest of the hand and, thus, further enhance the hand’s ability to grasp objects.
