Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome is also known as Bean syndrome. It is a rare syndrome of venous malformations that arise in the skin and gastrointestinal tract. Patients present with multiple venous malformations in various organ systems including the liver, spleen, heart, eye, and central nervous system. Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome patients are at increased risk for gastrointestinal hemorrhage and severe iron deficiency anemia. They require an interprofessional teamÂ approach with hematology, dermatology, gastroenterology, surgery, nurse practitioners, and other specialties caring for the patient. There is no cure for the disorder and treatment is supportive. Patients do need to be monitored as they are prone to potential complications such as volvulus, intussusception, infarction, and gastrointestinal bleeding. [Level 5]
