Secondary AA (amyloid A) amyloidosis is a severe complication of FMF. Although it can involve the gastrointestinal tract, spleen, liver, testes, heart, or lungs, renal amyloidosis is more common. M694V mutation is usually associated with amyloidosis. On the other hand, FMF patients with mutation E148Q rarely have amyloidosis. Colchicine prevents the development of amyloidosis, so patients who have never been on colchicine or patients who present late in the disease process have higher chances of developing amyloidosis. However, patients who have persistent proteinuria despite taking colchicine should be evaluated for causes other than amyloidosis for the proteinuria. Patients can present with asymptomatic proteinuria, while sometimes nephrotic syndrome or end-stage kidney disease can be the first manifestation of FMF. Male sex and eastern Mediterranean origin are risk factors for developing amyloidosis.

Glomerulonephritis has also been reported on kidney biopsies of FMF patients with suspected amyloidosis. Henoch Sch√∂nlein purpura and polyarteritis nodosa can occur but rarely in FMF.
