Treating RVF involves treating the underlying disease, the fistula itself, and any related complications.

Treatment of Crohn's disease, diverticular disease, or colorectal or gynecologic cancers should follow the principles of treating these diseases primarily. Treating RVF depends to a great extent on treating the underlying primary disease. There is more than one approach to the treatment of fistula with curative intent. In 2016, the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons reviewed the approaches and developed guidelines to manage RVF.

**Medical Treatment**

The Conservative or non-surgical treatment approach of the symptoms and possible complications like UTI, local irritation, and site infection can be used in selected patients. This approach can be considered in high-risk patients and severe underlying disease. Medical treatment includes treating the infection and the associated symptoms, maximizing medical treatment of the underlying disease like in Crohn disease or diverticulitis, and supporting the general patient's condition. Other conservative treatment includes non-operative measures to close the fistula like fibrin glue or other occlusive measures. The success rate of these measures is not high. They are still an option to consider in high-risk patients who are not fit for surgery or failed a prior surgical approach.

**Surgical Approach**

Multiple operative approaches are used to treat RVF depending on complexity, recurrence, and the underlying disease.

The proximity of the rectal wall to the vaginal wall with minimal tissue makes repairs connecting fistula challenging. The principles of successful repair are to remove the unhealthy fistula tissue, replace with healthy tissue that has a good blood supply to enhance healing, and maintain thick interposing tissue between the rectal and vaginal walls. Following these principles (although not always possible) increase the chance of successful fistula treatment.

Fistula debridement and flaps are common surgical approaches. Advancement local endo-rectal flaps in simple RVF or gracilis regional myocutaneous flap in more complicated RVF are of the common flaps.

In proximal or high RVF, surgical excision of the rectal wall in regimental resection is the other surgical radical approach.
