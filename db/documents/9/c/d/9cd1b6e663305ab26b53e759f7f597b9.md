During the third week of embryogenesis, the neural tube forms from the ectoderm. The neural tube forms the prosencephalon, the mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon. The prosencephalon is the most rostral of these structures and further divides into the telencephalon and diencephalon. The thalamus develops from the embryonic diencephalon.
