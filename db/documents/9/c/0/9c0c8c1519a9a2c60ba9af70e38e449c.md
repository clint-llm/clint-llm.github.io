Benign florid vascular proliferation is a rare entity with an excellent prognosis and no recurrence. The clinical presentation and symptoms are nonspecific. Radiological examination modalities such as barium enema, colonoscopy, and abdominal CT/MRI, are not very sensitive to make this diagnosis. A definitive diagnosis is only possible by tissue biopsy, and in most cases, the entire lesion excision with the microscopic examination is necessary, as the small biopsy material can be misleading. Microscopically, the lesion can mimic other benign or malignant vascular lesions. It is essential to render an accurate diagnosis for the subsequent treatment. Surgical resection is the mainstay of therapy and can monitor the patient as well as administer pain medication if needed.  A surgical nurse is a valuable asset before, during, and in the postoperative setting. The nurse should evaluate for concerning issues, assist with patient and family education, and coordinate follow-up care.  Oncology plays no role in the management of FVP since FVP is entirely a benign reactive process. An interprofessional approach will lead to better patient outcomes. [Level 5]
