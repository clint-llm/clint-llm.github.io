Management and treatment for post-traumatic headaches involve a multifaceted approach that may include oral medications, musculoskeletal manipulation and treatment, interventional procedures, and behavioral therapy. A review of non-pharmacologic therapy modalities and biopsychosocial factors concluded that a multi-disciplinary approach was most effective in PTHA management. The modalities reviewed included cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), biofeedback, progressive muscle relaxation therapy, acupuncture, and physical therapy.

The pharmacologic management should be tailored to the specific PTHA phenotype if known. Several studies have investigated the role of oral and IV medication for acute and preventative treatments. Acute treatment modalities included oral and intravenous (IV) non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), triptans, and IV antiemetic medication. Preventative regimens included tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), anticonvulsants, and gabapentin. Among TCAs, amitriptyline showed benefit in a majority of patients; however, Cushman et al. showed that patients receiving gabapentin or amitriptyline showed similar improvements compared to the non-treatment group.

Several interventional procedures have been trialed for PTHA; however, the research lacks controlled trials. A retrospective review of 717 patients showed a reduction in headache severity and frequency at 6 months.

**Tension-type (TTHA)**

The preferred treatment for acute episodic tension-like PTHA is NSAIDs.

Craniomandibular headaches are considered a subtype of tension-type headaches. Intraoral devices can manage headaches related to craniomandibular dysfunction.

**Migraine-type**

Herbal and vitamin supplements have shown some benefit in managing migraine headaches. There is evidence that magnesium, feverfew, vitamin B2, CoQ10, and Petasites can help prevent migraine headaches.

**Neuralgias and Neuromas**

Patients with neuralgias (occipital and cervical) typically do not respond to oral medication or botulinum toxin injections.

**Cervicogenic-type (CHA)**

Similar to the neuralgia and neuroma phenotype, cervicogenic-type PTHA is typically refractory to oral pharmacological treatment.
