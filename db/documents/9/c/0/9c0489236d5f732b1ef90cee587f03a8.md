Doppler liver ultrasonography constitutes an effective and non-invasive means of evaluating the hepatic vasculature. Understanding the normal and abnormal waveforms for the primary hepatic vessels and their characteristic waveforms can help diagnose specific diseases that have a characteristic effect on these waveform patterns. Understanding how an abnormal hepatic artery, hepatic vein, or portal vein manifests on Doppler sonography can help identify or confirm liver diseases.
