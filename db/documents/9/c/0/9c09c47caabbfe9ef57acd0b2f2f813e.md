Epigenetic mechanisms form a layer of control within a cell that regulates gene expression and silencing. This control varies between tissues and plays an important role in cell differentiation.

Three different epigenetic mechanisms have been identified: DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-associated gene silencing. Catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase enzymes, DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group directly to a cytosine nucleotide within a cytosine-guanine sequence (CpG), which are often surrounded by other CpGâ€™s forming a CpG island. CpG islands are common targets for epigenetic DNA methylation, notably the CpG islands within promoter regions. Indeed, it has been reported that around 70% of gene promotor regions lie within CpG islands.

The second epigenetic mechanism is post-translational modifications to histone proteins. These modifications include enzyme-catalyzed acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation, each of which alters the DNA-histone interactions in nucleosomes.

The most recently elucidated epigenetic mechanism is non-coding RNA-associated gene silencing. A non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is a functional RNA molecule that is transcribed but not translated into proteins. Once regarded as waste of the genome, recent insight suggests the ncRNA molecules harbor a crucial role in epigenetic gene expression and likely account for the great difference in phenotype between species and within human populations despite such similarity in encoded proteins.
