The brain ranks as the most complex organ in the human body. The brain constantly receives numerous visual, auditory, olfactory, vestibular, proprioceptive, tactile, and gustatory sensory inputs. In addition to identifying and processing important information from these various sensory inputs, humans have a unique ability to suppress ruminative and socially unwanted behaviors. Research has attributed this function primarily to the prefrontal association cortex (PFC). Studies show that the PFC, mainly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, functions to downregulate the hippocampal activity to suppress unwanted thoughts.

The prefrontal association cortex is a cortical region in the anterior part of the cerebrum. It is involved in the top-down processing of sensory and motor information.
