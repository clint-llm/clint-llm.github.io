The clinical presentation of pernicious anemia is often insidious, and symptoms may vary during its course. Patients often lack awareness of their symptoms, or they may have become used to them.

A clinician should perform a complete history, including a detailed past medical history and family history.

The clinician should conduct a complete physical exam with an emphasis on hematological, gastrointestinal, and neurological findings that are associated with this disease. Patients with PA can have symptoms due to anemia, atrophic gastritis, and/or nerve damage to the spinal cord.
