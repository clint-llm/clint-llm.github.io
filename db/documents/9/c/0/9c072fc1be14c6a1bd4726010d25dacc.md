- Other idiopathic interstitial pneumonia: The histopathology of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) can be seen in both idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) as well as NSIP.  Given the potential for clinical and histopathological overlap between these two entities, differentiating the two may be challenging. Fibrotic NSIP should be distinguished from IPF as it has a better prognosis and possible response to steroid therapy.

- Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: Typical imaging features in the acute or subacute phase include findings of centrilobular nodules as well as the predominance of upper lung zone involvement. On histopathology, there is the bronchiolocentric distribution of giant cells and poorly formed granulomas. Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis may have more fibrotic features, and thus an attempt should be made to discern this disease state by clinical history and potential further evaluation.

- IgG-related systemic disease: Some patients with IgG4 have interstitial lung disease. Histopathology may demonstrate infiltration of the lung interstitium with IgG4-positive plasma cells, which helps to differentiate this entity.
