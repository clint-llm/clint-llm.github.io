The small intestine is comprised of four layers, from innermost to outermost: mucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria, and serosa.

- **Mucosa**: The mucosa is the innermost layer of the small intestine, lined by simple columnar epithelium, and consists of absorptive cells (enterocytes), goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells. Enterocytes have approximately 3000 microvilli on their surfaces, helping to increase the surface area to facilitate effective absorption.

- **Submucosa**: A layer of connective tissue containing blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics. This layer of the small intestine is primarily unspecialized, except in the duodenum, where it contains mucous-secreting Brunner's glands.

- **Muscularis****propria**: The muscularis propria is made up of two layers of smooth muscle: a thin, outer longitudinal layer and a thick, inner circular layer. The outer longitudinal layer is responsible for shortening and elongating the intestine, while the inner circular layer is responsible for contraction.

- **Serosa:**TheÂ outermost layer of the small intestine consisting of epithelium and mesothelium. The serosa covers the jejunum, ileum, and the anterior surface of the duodenum. The posterior aspect of the duodenum is retroperitoneal and not covered by serosa.
