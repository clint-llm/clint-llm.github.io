Four progressive pathologic stages of CTE have been described. Stage 1 is characterized by normal weight brains with isolated perivascular centers of p-tau, neurofibrillary tangles, neutrophil neurites, and astrocytic tangles located primarily in the sulcal depths, especially in the superior and dorsolateral frontal cortices. Stage 2 is also characterized by normal weight brains but more frequent deposition at the depths of the sulci and neurofibrillary tangles interspersed throughout superficial cortical layers in addition to the locus coeruleus and substantia innominata. Stage 3 indicates a reduction in brain weight with mild cerebral atrophy, ventricular dilation, septal abnormalities, depigmentation of the locus coeruleus and substantia nigra, thinning of the corpus callosum, and atrophy of the mammillary bodies, thalamus, and hypothalamus. Finally, stage 4 is characterized by significant reduction in brain weight due to widespread cerebral cortical atrophy of the medial temporal lobe, thalamus, hypothalamus, and mammillary bodies. Complete depigmentation of the locus coeruleus and substantia nigra is evident along with the marked axonal loss of subcortical white matter.
