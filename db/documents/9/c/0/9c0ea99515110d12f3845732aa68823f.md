**Clinical Manifestations of Insufficient Heat Loss**

Heat Stroke:

- Central nervous system dysfunction

- Lack of sweat

- Core body temperature above 40 C

- Skin: Red, hot, dry

- Nausea/vomiting

- Rapid, strong pulse

- Heat syncope

Heat Exhaustion:

- Dizzy or possibly syncope

- Core body temperature between 37 to 40°C

- Excessive sweating

- Skin: Cool, pale, clammy

- Nausea/vomiting

- Rapid, weak pulse

- Heat-associated muscle cramping

**Clinical Manifestation of Excessive Heat Loss**

Hypothermia:

- Core body temperature below 35°C

- Severe hypothermia: less than 28°C

- Altered mental status

- Loss of consciousness

- Malignant cardiac arrhythmias

- Inability to shiver

**Other Causes of Impaired Heat Loss:**

Hypohydrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia

- Congenital absence or malfunctioning of sweat glands

- Reduced tolerance of high temperatures that require evaporative cooling

- Rely on environmental modifications to control heat exposure
