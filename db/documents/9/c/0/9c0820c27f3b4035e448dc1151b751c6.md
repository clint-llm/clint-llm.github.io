Phenobarbital is a class C-IV control substance, and it is used for its sedative and anti-seizure properties in patients with status epileptics and alcohol withdrawal management. It is known for being highly addictive and, in prior years, found to be a common agent of choice for suicide attempts.

Although restrictions on access to barbiturates have caused the number of overdoses to decline, it is still crucial to assess and treat patients with a phenobarbital overdose expeditiously.

While in recovery, the patient requires proper counsel about barbiturates and proper/improper use.

In summary, the management of therapy with phenobarbital is the responsibility of the entire interprofessional team, including clinicians, specialists, PAs and NPs, nurses, pharmacists, and mental health practitioners, operating as a cohesive unit to optimize treatment outcomes and prevent mortality and morbidity from misuse of the drug.
