Immunoglobulins are heterotetramers comprised of two heavy and two light chains, each composed of both variable and constant domains. The variable regions of immunoglobulins determine antigen-binding specificity, whereas the constant region of the heavy chain determines cellular function. The heavy chain locus on chromosome 14 contains approximately 45 variable (V) encoding regions, 23 diversity (D) regions, and six joining (J) regions. Please note that the J encoding regions of DNA in the heavy chain locus are distinct and not related to the J chain peptide associated with pentameric IgM secretion. Maturing B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes both arise from CD34-positive hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Expression of the RAG1 (recombination-activating gene) and RAG2 genes is unique to developing B and T lymphocytes, and the proteins produced by these genes form the RAG complex (alternatively referred to as the VDJ recombinase), which catalyzes somatic recombination between V, D, and J segments in a somewhat random manner. CD19-positive pro-B cells in the bone marrow express the RAG complex to initiate recombination between segments on the heavy chain locus, initially between D and J segments, and subsequently between V and D segments. Combinatorial diversity refers to the tremendous diversity of immunoglobulins generated from the same genetic locus through random recombination events between V, D, and J coding segments. Junctional diversity is an additional process utilized to increase the diverse repertoire of immunoglobulins made from the same relatively small genetic locus. It is associated with the random incorporation of nucleotides at the junctions between the V, D, and J segments. For example, expression of the enzyme TdT (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) results in the random addition of nucleotides (N nucleotides) between the exon-encoding V, D, and J segments. Many of these nucleotide additions will not produce a functional heavy chain due to shifts in the reading frame introduced by incorporating N nucleotides, such as developing B lymphocytes unable to make a functional heavy chain die through apoptosis. The BCR receptor checkpoint refers to the requirement for developing B cells to successfully produce a heavy chain that can make it to the cell surface while associated with a germline-encoded surrogate light chain, forming the pre-BCR receptor. Cells that successfully form a pre-B cell receptor are referred to as large pre-B cells, and the pre-B cell receptor transmits pro-survival and proliferative signals to promote the continued development of the large pre-B cell. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a kinase required in this signal transduction pathway, and patients lacking a functional BTK protein suffer from X-linked agammaglobulinemia, as developing B cells do not pass this checkpoint. Pre-B cells inhibit further attempts to recombine the heavy chain locus, ensuring that one heavy chain is made per individual B cell, and RAG-mediated recombination of the light chain loci commences. Both light chain loci, the kappa and lambda loci, have approximately 30 V segments and 5 J segments that can be differentially recombined. Unlike the heavy chain loci, the light chain loci do not contain D segments. Light chain recombination in pre-B cells predominantly occurs initially on the kappa loci, and if a pre-B cell is unable to form an IgM immunoglobulin that is non-reactive to self-antigens in the bone marrow using the two kappa loci, recombination of the lambda loci initiates. If a functional light chain is produced, resulting in a non-self reacting IgM molecule at the surface, the recombination of other light chain loci becomes inhibited. This process, referred to as allelic exclusion, ensures that circulating B-2 lymphocytes produce immunoglobulins with a distinct antigen recognition site. Since the kappa light chains are attempted first in the recombination process, this explains why the majority of antibodies, including IgM, contain kappa light chains. Circulating mature, yet naive, follicular B cells express both IgM and IgD as transmembrane antigen receptors. The mu and delta genes for the heavy chains of IgM and IgD, respectively, are located proximal to the VDJ encoding regions of the heavy chain locus, and alternate RNA processing of the primary RNA transcript produces both transmembrane IgM and IgD on naive B cells. A transmembrane immunoglobulin is not capable of transmitting intracellular signals to the B cell in response to antigen binding, and therefore transmembrane immunoglobulins associate with Ig alpha and Ig beta proteins to form the BCR. The Ig alpha and Ig beta proteins contain the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation (ITAM) motifs required to stimulate naive B cell activation in response to transmembrane IgM or IgD recognition of antigen. Initial naive B cell activation in response to antigen recognition results in IgM antibody secretion. Alternative polyadenylation site selection of the primary transcript results in substitution of a short hydrophilic sequence for a transmembrane domain at the carboxy terminus, resulting in IgM secretion. Due to cysteine residues in this hydrophilic sequence at the carboxy terminus, IgM oligomerizes during the secretory pathway to form pentameric IgM connected by a J chain, or alternatively, as a hexamer without the J chain.
