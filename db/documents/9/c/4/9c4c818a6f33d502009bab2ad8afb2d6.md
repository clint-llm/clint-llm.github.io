- The patency rate of the venous graft used during CABG is 80% at one year and 60% at five years. A saphenous venous graft (SVG) is more prone to intimal hyperplasia and stenosis than an internal mammary artery graft. However, late-onset occlusion of SVG after five years of grafting is almost always due to neo-atherosclerosis.

- Arteriovenous (AV) fistula or graft is used as a vascular access site for hemodialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. Arteriovenous (AV) fistula or graft failure rate varies between 30% to 60% at one year. Recent studies have indicated that neointimal hyperplasia is the most common underlying pathology in 30% to 60% of AV grafts or fistula failures followed by vascular thrombosis.
