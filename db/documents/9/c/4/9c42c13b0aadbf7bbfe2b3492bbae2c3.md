Therapeutic effects of bethanechol develop within thirty minutes following oral administration. The maximum effectiveness often ensues between 60 to 90 minutes. Therapeutic effects usually last for one hour. Subcutaneous injection administration delivers a more powerful effect on the detrusor urinae muscle when compared to the oral administration of the agent. Its effects on muscarinic receptors customarily occur within 5 to 15 minutes post subcutaneous administration and arrive at a maximum therapeutic efficacy in 15 to 30 minutes, persisting for approximately two hours.
