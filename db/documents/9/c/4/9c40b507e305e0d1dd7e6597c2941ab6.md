Treatment of this condition is primarily supportive as it resolves withoutÂ any intervention. The evaluating clinician must recognize the diagnosis to prevent unnecessary procedures. Orotracheal intubation is only required in those patients who can not protect their airway.

In those patients who had low therapeutic levels, loading and optimization should be done to prevent recurrent episodes of seizures.
