Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction results from the alteration of normal lung physiology occurring with evaporative water loss, thermal changes, and irritant exposure induced by a large increase in minute ventilation and demand on the respiratory system to heat and humidify air with exercise-related hyperpnea.

Also, nasal breathing becomes insufficient, leading to mouth breathing and increased exposure of lung surfaces to pollutants, irritants, and allergens, which result in the generation of reactive oxygen species and a neutrophilic inflammatory response.

Changes in mucus composition and decrease function of mucociliary clearance can lead to mucus plugging and bacterial growth.

Long term exposure can lead to epithelial damage and shedding, with remodeling and inflammation resembling asthma.

The osmotic theory is supported by evidence that EIB severity is directly related to the rate of water loss in the airways, EIB can be prevented by inhaling fully humidified air at body temperature, and bronchoconstriction can also be induced by inhalation of hyperosmolar saline.

Interestingly, EIB has not been proven to affect exercise or athletic performance negatively.
