The diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia is mainly clinical. Determining the presence of trigeminal sensory deficits or bilateral involvement of trigeminal nerves should be considered useful to distinguish symptomatic TN from classical TN.

TN can occur secondary to another disease process, such as multiple sclerosis or a cerebellopontine-angle tumor. This is referred to as “symptomatic TN.”

An MRI detects changes in the trigeminal root, identifies NVC, and may rule out secondary pathology.

In patients with refractory TN undergoing microvascular decompression (MVD), preoperative high-resolution three-dimensional MRI is a reliable tool in diagnosing NVC.

Lastly, extracranial causes like head and neck malignancies should be considered and evaluated.
