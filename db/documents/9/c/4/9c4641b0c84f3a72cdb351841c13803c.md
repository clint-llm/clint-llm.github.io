The rectum has autonomic innervation from sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers. The sympathetic innervation is from the lumbar splanchnic nerves originating from L1 to L2. Preganglionic sympathetic fibers follow the pathway of the IMA to innervate the left colon and rectum. They join to form the preaortic and superior hypogastric plexuses. The nerve fibers from these plexuses enter the rectum laterally to provide sympathetic innervation to the lower rectum.

Parasympathetic supply originates from the sacral region and courses anteriorly to join the sympathetic fibers forming the pelvic plexus. Postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers then distribute to the rectum through the inferior mesenteric plexus.

The sensation of rectal distensionÂ is carried by the parasympathetic system to S2, S3, and S4.
