The ideal treatment of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia involves the complete destruction of the lesion, improving symptoms, and preserving vulvar function.

**uVIN**

Cold knife surgery and loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) are the treatments of choice of uVIN. However, margin status does not predict the risk of invasive or recurrent disease.

**dVIN**

Differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia is associated with lichen sclerosis and invasive disease, such as squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.

There are no currently approved medications for the treatment of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. However, many drugs have been attempted to avoid surgery. Cidofovir is an acyclic nucleoside analog with antiviral properties that promotes apoptosis of HPV-infected cells.

Spontaneous regression is reported in uVIN but is adversely influenced by the increasing age of the patient, clinical presentation with chronic immunosuppression and multifocal disease, and longer duration of the lesion.

HPV vaccination has reduced the incidence of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia in young women.
