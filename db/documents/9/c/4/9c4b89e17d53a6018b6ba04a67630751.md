Necrotizing infections are more commonly present with excruciating pain out of proportion to presenting symptoms and systemic septic signs than non-necrotizing infections.

Physical findings of necrotizing soft tissue infections may include tenderness to palpation beyond the erythematous border, crepitus, and cellulitis. The presence of bullae, ecchymotic changes to the skin, and dysesthesia or paresthesia should also be treated as a necrotizing infection. Subcutaneous emphysema and crepitus are almost always present. Anesthesia may also be present in some areas due to injury to the nerve fibers.Â  The infection can spread rapidly within hours; hence suspicion should be high for necrotizing fasciitis in the presence of intense pain.
