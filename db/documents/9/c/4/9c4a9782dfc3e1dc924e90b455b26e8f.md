Freiberg disease is osteochondrosis affecting the metatarsal heads.Â Osteochondroses are a family of disorders that result from an injury to the epiphysis that alters enchondral ossification and produces irregularity at the joint surface. There are several potential explanations for Freiberg disease, the two which are most popular include a traumatic cause and vascular compromise, but many believe the true cause is multifactorial. Other systemic disorders have been implicated in the development of Freiberg disease, including diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hypercoagulability.
