The skin offers a variety of functions, and an exhaustive list would deserve an article of its own. The functions of the epidermis include but are not limited to physical barrier protection from the environment,Â regulating circulation, immunologic protection from infectious etiologies, and protection of DNA.

The scaffolding of dead keratinocytes in the stratum corneum holds in place a hydrophobic lipid matrix from the granules in the keratinocytes. This serves both as a physical protective barrier that is constantly regenerating as well as a means of regulating electrolyte homeostasis and preventing transepidermal water loss.

As foreign microbes attempt to invade, they will be first blocked by the barrier of the stratum corneum. As bacteria and fungi are able to penetrate further, they will be picked up by Langerhans cells for antigen presentation.

The protection of DNA is a byproduct of skin pigmentation. Pigmentation of the skin is derived from melanocytic activity.
