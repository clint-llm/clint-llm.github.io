Fibular neuropathy is the most common lower extremity neuropathy. Physiatrists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, and orthopedists must recognize that further evaluation with electrodiagnostic testing is warranted when patients present with foot drop/slaps, steppage gait, weakness, or sensory deficits in areas of the lower extremity innervated by the fibular nerve. Doing so will help expedite a patientâ€™s recovery process and improve their quality of life in the long term.

Electrodiagnostic studies can prove to be an integral component for determining etiology and guiding management.
