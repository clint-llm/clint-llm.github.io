Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is clinically asymptomatic in most patients as peripheral vasodilation reduces afterload and compensates for abnormal cardiac function. In times of stress, rapid hemodynamic changes with impaired cardiac response will produce acute heart failure symptoms. CCM should be suspected in patients with moderate-to-advanced cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class B or C) presenting with exercise intolerance, worsening fatigue, and/or peripheral edema who have no known history of cardiac disease. As these symptoms are non-specific and can be attributed to advancing cirrhosis, CCM is frequently under-recognized and misdiagnosed.

Physical exam findings will often be unremarkable for cardiopulmonary disease. In the setting of physiologic, pharmacologic, or pathologic stress, signs of congestive heart failure may become apparent. Classic physical exam findings, including peripheral edema, jugular venous distention, and third and/or fourth heart sounds, will likely be present. During a physical examination, classic signs of liver disease, such as jaundice, scleral icterus, ascites, and hepatomegaly, should be noted.
