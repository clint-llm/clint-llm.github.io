- Porphyria cutanea tarda is the most common porphyria caused by decreased activity in the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme, leading to the accumulation of porphyrins.

- Alcohol, estrogen use, viral infections, smoking, and iron overload are susceptibility factors that are commonly associated with the development of porphyria cutanea tarda.

- Excessive circulating porphyrins react with light causing a delayed skin reaction manifesting as blisters, hypertrichosis, hyperpigmentation, and scleroderma-like changes on sun-exposed surfaces.

- Porphyria cutanea tarda may be treated by simply avoiding the precipitating factors. However, phlebotomy and hydroxychloroquine are both effective in achieving biochemical and clinical remission.
