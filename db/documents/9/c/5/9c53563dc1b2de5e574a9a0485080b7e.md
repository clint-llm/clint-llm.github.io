Salivary gland tumors are a rare group of complex, heterogenous histologies that are located in the parotid glands, submandibular glands, sublingual glands, and minor salivary glands of the upper aerodigestive tract.Â  The wide variety of tumor etiology, microscopic histology, growth patterns, and tumor characteristics can make diagnosis and treatment challenging for clinicians. The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2005 recognized 24 different malignant salivary gland cancers; the most common histologies include mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), acinic cell carcinoma (ACC), adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC), carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma (CExPA), and adenocarcinoma.
