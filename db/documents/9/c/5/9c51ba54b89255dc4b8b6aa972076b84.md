A dilated pore of Winer and a typical nevus comedonicus can be easily differentiated clinically as the latter is a group of multiple keratin-filled openings. Â A solitary lesion of a nevus comedonicus and a DP may only be differentiated histologically. The age of onset differs between the two lesions in that a dilated pore of Winer presents in the middle-aged to elderly while an NC presents at birth or during childhood.
