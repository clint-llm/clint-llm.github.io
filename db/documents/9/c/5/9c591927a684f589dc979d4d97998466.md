In acute illness, complications include stillbirths in infected pregnant women and vertical infection to the fetus. After successful treatment, patients have complained of menstrual irregularities, hearing disorders, weight loss, hair and nail loss, skin desquamation, aphonia, muscle stiffness, and hoarseness. Heart failure or CNS failure in the 3-5 weeks of infection can lead to death. Other causes of death have been pneumonitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, hypokalemia, obstruction of blood vessel circulation, and adrenal gland insufficiency. Long-term complications include generalized myalgia, ocular symptoms such as conjunctivitis, and various neuropathies. These may persist up to 10 years post-recovery.
