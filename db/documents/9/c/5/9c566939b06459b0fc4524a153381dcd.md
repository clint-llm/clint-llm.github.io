**Dose**

The FDA-approved uses of omega-3 fatty acids for adults (≥18 years of age) with hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dl) as an adjunct to diet and exercise are as follows

- Icosapent ethyl is administered as capsules with a daily dose of 4 g/day taken as two, 2-gram capsules twice a day with meals.

- Omega-3-acid ethyl esters are administered as capsules with a daily dose of 4 g/day taken as 4 capsules once a day with meals or two capsules twice a day with meals.

- Omega-3-carboxylic acids are administered as capsules with a daily dose of 2 g/day taken as 2 capsules once per day or 4 g/day taken as 4 capsules once a day. Clinical trial administration was without regard to meals.

- Omega-3-acid ethyl esters A are administered as capsules with a daily dose of 4 g/day taken as 4 capsules once a day with meals or two capsules twice a day with meals.

All OM3FA supplements should be taken whole without being crushed, chewed, or dissolved in the mouth. If a dose is missed, the patient should take it as soon as they remember and should not take a double dose if it is time for their next capsule. Various dietary supplements in different chemical forms are currently available over the counter but have not been FDA approved; hence they are not required to show safety and efficacy before marketing the product.

**Metabolism**

Humans do not possess the enzymes required to synthesize OM3FAs; therefore, they are considered essential fatty acids because they must be obtained from the diet. OM3FAs are mainly consumed in our diets as fish and plant sources but can also be consumed via prescription OM3FA products.

Digestion of OM3FAs begins in the stomach with gastric lipases that break down triacylglycerols into diacylglycerol and fatty acids.

While most metabolism of DHA and EPA takes place via beta-oxidation in the liver (as discussed above), cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway in the breakdown of DHA and EPA.

**Bioavailability**

In the digestion process, the ethyl esters are principally broken down by pancreatic carboxylic acid ester lipase, an enzyme with activity enhanced by high-fat content meals.

Since OM3FAs may be present in several forms, such as triacylglycerols, free fatty acids, phospholipids, and ethyl esters, the form in which the OM3FA acid is in will affect bioavailability.

In addition to the form of the OM3FA, the chemical positioning may also affect bioavailability. Some research suggests OM3FA is greater in fish oil due to the OM3FA typically being in the sn-2 position versus marine mammal oils with the OM3FAs in the sn-1 and sn-3 positions.

Bioavailability of EPA only and both EPA/DHA formulations did not differ based on age or ethnicity; however, the combination formulation bioavailability differed based on gender. Women seem to have higher EPA serum levels than males in the mixed EPA/DHA formulations. However, research on the availability of EPA and DHA of over-the-counter supplements has indicated that age can play a factor in their levels within the plasma.

**Half-Life**

Not all of the half-lives of the prescription OM3FA products have been established. The maximum amount of plasma EPA and DHA can be determined within five to nine hours post-administration.
