Coronary stents (CS) are expandable tubular metallic devices which are introduced into coronary arteries that are clogged due to an underlying atherosclerosis disease. This revascularization procedure is termed as a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary angioplasty with stent placement. With the introduction of coronary stents, coronary dissection and vascular recoil were eliminated due to the expandable, metallic meshwork of the stent, which prevents negative remodeling. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of coronary artery stenosis and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology and pathophysiology of coronary artery stenosis leading to ischemic heart disease.
- Describe the patient population that may benefit from coronary stents.
- Summarize the different types of stents used to manage coronary artery stenosis.
- Explain methods to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by coronary artery stenosis through stent deployment.
