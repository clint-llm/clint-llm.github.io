**Dosing Regimen for Pain Management**

- The lowest dose necessary for adequate analgesia is recommended and should be titrated individually for each patient taking into account the severity of pain, response, and prior analgesic experience.

- For initial oral tablets therapy, the usual adult dose of hydrocodone and acetaminophen ( 5 mg / 300 mg) is one or two tablets every four to six hours as needed for pain. The total daily dosage should not be more than eight tablets.

- For initial oral solution therapy, the usual adult dose of solution ( 7.5mg / 325mg per 15 mL) is one tablespoonful (15 mL) every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. The total daily dosage for adults should not be more than six tablespoonfuls.

- For the conversion from other opioids to hydrocodone and acetaminophen therapy, it is recommended to underestimate the dose of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen on 24 hours basis for managing an adverse reaction due to the risk of overdose. The relative bioavailability information is unknown for conversion from extended-release hydrocodone to hydrocodone and acetaminophen therapy. So close monitoring for signs of excessive sedation and respiratory depression is recommended. The dose should be titrated on an individual basis. Continuous reevaluation of the dose of hydrocodone and acetaminophen is needed to maintain adequate pain control, minimize adverse effects, and monitor the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse.

- For patients who may have a physical dependence on opioids, abrupt discontinuation of hydrocodone and acetaminophen therapy may result in severe withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicidal tendency.

**Specific Patients Population**

- **Patient with Hepatic Impairment:**There is no dose adjustment guidance in the manufacturer label for patients with hepatic impairment. However, initiating therapy with the lowest dose with continuous monitoring is recommended in these patients.

- **Patient with Renal Impairment:**There is no dose adjustment guidance in the manufacturer label for patients with renal impairment. However, 26% of hydrocodone and 85% of acetaminophen are eliminated in the urine, so the drug should be used with caution.

- **Pregnant Women:**It is considered as pregnancy category C medicine. There is a US box warning related to pregnancy. During pregnancy, prolonged use of hydrocodone and acetaminophen can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized early and treated accordingly.

- **Breastfeeding Women:**Hydrocodone and Acetaminophen are present in breast milk. The decision to continue or discontinue breastfeeding during therapy should be based on the risk of infant exposure versus the benefits of breastfeeding and treatment to the mother.

- **Pediatric Patients:**The dose of hydrocodone for pediatric patients is titrated based on desired analgesic effect. While considering acetaminophen dose, it is recommended to consider the maximum daily dose of acetaminophen from all other sources like OTC, other prescription, or combination products. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 2000 mg for acetaminophen to minimize hepatotoxicity maximum. Based on the information provided in the hydrocodone and acetaminophen oral solution label, dosing should be calculated as 0.27 mL/kg child weight (equivalent to 0.135 mg/kg hydrocodone and 5.85 mg/kg dose of acetaminophen) whenever possible.

- **Geriatric Patients:**For safety and efficacy, it is recommended to start the initial dose at the lower end of the dosing range in geriatric patients and monitor patients closely.
