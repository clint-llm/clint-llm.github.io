The classification of paronychia is according to the clinical presentation:

- Acute paronychia - Lasting less than six weeks, painful and purulent condition; most frequently caused by a bacterial infection, especially staphylococci.

- Chronic paronychia - Usually caused by mechanical or chemical factors and sometimes infectious etiologyÂ like a fungal infection, especially Candida species. Risk factors include occupation (dishwasher, bartender, housekeeper), certain medications, and immunosuppression (diabetes, HIV, malignancy).

Classification can also be by etiology:

- Bacterial, commonly staphylococci

- Viral, commonly Herpes simplex virus

- Fungal, commonly Candida species

Noninfectious causes of paronychia can include contact irritants, excessive moisture, and medication reaction.
