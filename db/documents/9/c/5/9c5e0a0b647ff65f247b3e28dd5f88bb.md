When considering the diagnosis, it is important to consider other etiologies that may cause similar overlapping symptoms. These include meningitis, basilar migraine, cerebellar hemorrhage with brainstem compression, cerebellar infarct or hemorrhage with edema, space-occupying lesions in the posterior fossa including metastatic disease, and supratentorial mass lesions with mass effect, herniation, and brainstem compression. Consider hypoglycemia, Todd paralysis, and conversion disorder as possibleÂ mimics.
