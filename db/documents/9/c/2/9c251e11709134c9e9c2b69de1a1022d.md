Initial evaluation of a patient with intestinal trauma should follow the standard procedure for evaluating all trauma patients with a primary and secondary survey.

CT scanning is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for the diagnosis of intestinal injury in trauma; however, if the patient is hemodynamically unstable, imaging should be skipped, and the patient should be taken directly to the operating room.

Intestinal trauma classically has been managed with immediate exploratory laparotomy; however, there has been a recent effort at conservative management of stable patients with a possible intestinal injury.

In the case of intestinal perforation, primary bowel anastomosis is generally safe. Contraindications to primary anastomosis include hemodynamic instability requiring pressor support, in which case a damage control approach may be undertaken. In these situations, it is reasonable to leave the patient in discontinuity and perform a “second-look” operation in the immediate future for anastomosis and abdominal wall closure.
