Extrinsic stains are widespread in dental practice because they can be caused by tobacco smoking or simply drinking too much coffee or tea.

The tooth polishing devices are selected according to each case, and treatment plans are selectively designed, taking into account the patients' needs and with concern about minimal damage to the teeth and periodontal structures.

Extrinsic stains are one of the factors that influence tooth color assessment. Performing professional dental prophylaxis before composite or ceramic color selection in anterior teeth restorations could increase treatment predictability.
