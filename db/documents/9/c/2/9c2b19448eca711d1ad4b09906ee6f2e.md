The following tests can be used to screen for prediabetes:

- 12 hour Fasting blood glucose levels: Blood glucose levels fall between 100 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL, it is diagnostic of prediabetes.

- Two-hour glucose tolerance test: this test will measure blood glucose levels before and after ingestion of 75 g of glucose solution; if the test shows blood glucose levels that fall between 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL, it is diagnostic of prediabetes.

- A glycated hemoglobin test (also known as hemoglobin A1C) measures the average blood glucose level over the last 2 to 3 months. If it falls between 5.7% and 6.4%, it is diagnostic of prediabetes.

- A random plasma glucose test measures blood glucose levels at any time; if the blood glucose levels fall between 140 mg/dL to -199 mg/dL, it may be indicative of prediabetes. This test will require a follow-up test to be accurate.

Screening should start between ages 30 to 45 and repeated at least every 3 years. In high-risk patients, you can initiate screening earlier and follow-up more frequently.
