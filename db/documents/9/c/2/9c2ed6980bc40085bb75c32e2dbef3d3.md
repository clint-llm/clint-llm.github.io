Gynecomastia is not life-threatening but it can cause significant emotional distress. Most cases take months or years to resolve. Further, men with Klinefelter syndrome also have a risk of developing male breast cancer. Young people with gynecomastia become depressed, isolated, refuse to participate in any activity that involves removing the shirt and have low self-esteem.
