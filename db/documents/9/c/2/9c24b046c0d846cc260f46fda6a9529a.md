Ventricular tachycardia accounts for approximately 8% of cases of wide-complex tachycardia.

The other causes of ventricular tachycardia include ischemic or non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, adultÂ and congenital structural heart disease, inherited cardiac channelopathies, infiltrative cardiomyopathy, electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia), illicit drugs such as cocaine or methamphetamine, and digitalis toxicity.

Inherited cardiac channelopathies are more common in young individuals. The long-QT syndrome is the most common inherited cardiac channelopathy, and Torsades de Pointes is the characteristic feature of the long-QT syndrome.

Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia is an uncommon class of ventricular tachycardia. It is usually found in younger people, with no evidence of structural heart disease. The most common idiopathic ventricular tachycardia arises from outflow tracts, mitral/tricuspid annulus, and fascicles of the left bundle branch.
