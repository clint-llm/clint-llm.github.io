Historically, patients with splenic injuries presenting to community hospitals have undergone splenectomy with general surgeons. Some have suggested a pattern of splenectomy rather than salvage being more likely at smaller hospitals than at large trauma centers. It has further been suggested that this may be related to the capacity in the larger centers to provide more intensive around-the-clock scrutiny of the patient, checking for any sign of deterioration as an indication that operative management had at that point become indicated. There is some anecdotal evidence that patients with low-grade splenic injuries are now transferred more frequently to tertiary/trauma centers, given a prediction of enhanced chances of spleen salvage at the larger facility. High-grade spleen injuries causing acute destabilizing blood loss are still thought best served by laparotomy by general surgery at the facility to which they initially present.
