More than 50% of children under the age of 2 with disseminated Langerhans cell histiocytosis will die of the disease, but those with localized disease may have a prolonged life-span. For those who have been treated and do not have more lesions at 12 to 24 months, a full recovery can be expected. When there is lung involvement, the prognosis is not good. However, patients with isolated skin involvement and a solitary lymph node involvement tend to have a good prognosis.

Unfortunately, nearly 50% of patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis are prone to a variety of complications which include the following:

- Musculoskeletal disability

- Skin scarring

- Diabetes insipidus

- Hearing impairment

- Neuropsychiatric problems like depression, anxiety, and intellectual impairment

- Pulmonary impairment

- Secondary malignancies like lymphoblastic leukemia and sodi tumors

- Growth retardation

- Liver cirrhosis
