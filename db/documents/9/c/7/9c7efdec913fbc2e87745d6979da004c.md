Although azilsartan is normally well-tolerated, it is always imperative to make sure the interprofessional team understands the danger of prescribing ACE inhibitors, aliskiren-containing products, and ARBs together. Physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners must be vigilant in ensuring that these drugs are not prescribed together if more than one member of the team is responsible for the patient. Pharmacists are responsible for checking the medication profile for drug interactions, alerting the team to potential adverse effects, and verifying dosing, as well as offering patient counseling when needed. Nurses must make sure that the patient accounts for each doctor and medication prescribed to him or her, and pharmacists must make sure that no drug interactions or duplicate therapies occur, as well as verifying appropriate dosing. It is of the utmost importance for each member of the interprofessional medical team to confirm that a female patient of child-bearing age is not pregnant before prescribing azilsartan or any other ARB. Only with this type of interprofessional team approach can azilsartan therapy be optimally implemented, leading to better patient outcomes. [Level 5]
