"BEFAST" is a good and handy acronym to recognize common signs of a stroke, regardless of the etiology. Stroke is an emergency. Time is brain.

- **B**alance- Is there a sudden onset loss of balance or coordination?

- **E**ye- Is there a sudden onset blurred or double vision or any sudden onset, persistent vision problems?

- **F**ace- When the person smiles, does one or both sides of the face hang limply?

- **A**rms- Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one side slope downward? Is there a sudden onset weakness/numbness on one side?

- **S**peech- Does the person have slurred or garbled speech? Can the patient repeat simple phrases?

- **T**ime- Call 911 for immediate medical attention upon noticing one or more or these signs. Also, one should take note of when the symptoms began.

To help prevent strokes, one should:

- Monitor blood pressure

- Control cholesterol and blood sugar

- Get active and lose weight

- Eat healthily

- Stop smoking cigarettes

- Control obstructive sleep apnea

- Establish primary care to get medical attention.
