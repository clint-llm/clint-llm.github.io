The prognosis for both linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) and the pediatric variant, "chronic bullous disease of childhood" are both generally promising. Spontaneous remission may occur in 30% to 60% of adult patients, usually only occurring after years of active disease. In children, the disease tends to spontaneously remit within 2 to 4 years after onset, which is exceptionally reassuring for parents. Since systemic therapies may be masking a patient's spontaneous remission, the general recommendation is to periodically attempt to withdraw these medications to evaluate for the unknown remission of the disease.

Drug-induced LABD also has a good prognosis with most cases remitting within 2 to 6 weeks after the inciting medication is discontinued.
