Aortic valve repair procedures are being increasingly performed in patients with tricuspid aortic valves but also with bicuspid aortic valves with a slight difference in surgical techniques. In addition to providing the opportunity to repair the subvalvular and supravalvular apparatus including aortic root repair, they also provide the unique opportunity of repairing/remodeling the native valve. If performed with careful selection criteria and at a center with the proper expertise, outcomes comparable to that of valve replacement have been reported.
