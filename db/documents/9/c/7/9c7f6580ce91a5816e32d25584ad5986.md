According to the NCCN guidelines for NSGCT, evaluation and treatment at a high-volume tertiary center are suggested for high-risk patients such as those with persistently elevated tumor markers. For most refractory cases, high-dose chemotherapy combined with autologous bone marrow transplants has been used successfully, and adjuvant RPLND, though technically difficult, may also be done for persistent residual masses.
