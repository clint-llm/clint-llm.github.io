Ovarian cancer is staged according to the 8th edition American Joint Committee of Cancer (AJCC), International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system and corresponding Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) classification.

**Stage I - Tumor limited to ovaries (one or both) or fallopian tube(s)**

- IA - Tumor limited to one ovary (capsule intact) or fallopian tube, no tumor on ovarian or fallopian tube surface; no malignant cells in ascites or peritoneal washings

- IB - Tumor limited to both ovaries (capsules intact) or fallopian tubes; no tumor on ovarian or fallopian tube surface; no malignant cells in ascites or peritoneal washings

- IC - Tumor limited to one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes, with any of the following:

- IC1    Surgical spill

- IC2    Capsule rupture before surgery or tumor on the ovarian or fallopian tube surface

- IC3    Malignant cells in ascites or peritoneal washings

**Stage II - Tumor involves one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes with a pelvic extension below pelvic brim or primary peritoneal cancer**

- IIA - Extension and/or implants on the uterus and/or fallopian tube(s) and/or ovaries

- IIB - Extension to and/or implants on other pelvic tissues

**Stage III - Tumor involves one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes, or primary peritoneal cancer, with microscopically confirmed peritoneal metastasis outside the pelvis and/or metastasis to the retroperitoneal (pelvic and/or para-aortic) lymph nodes**

- IIIA1 - Positive retroperitoneal lymph nodes only (histologically confirmed)

- IIIA1i  Metastasis up to and including 10 mm in greatest dimension

- IIIA1ii  Metastasis more than 10 mm in greatest dimension

- IIIA2   Microscopic extrapelvic (above the pelvic brim) peritoneal involvement with or without positive retroperitoneal lymph nodes

- IIIB - Macroscopic peritoneal metastasis beyond pelvis 2 cm or less in greatest dimension with or without metastasis to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes

- IIIC - Macroscopic peritoneal metastasis beyond the pelvis more than 2 cm in greatest dimension with or without metastasis to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes (includes an extension of tumor to the capsule  of liver and spleen without parenchymal involvement of either organ)

**Stage IV - Distant metastasis, including pleural effusion with positive cytology; liver or splenic parenchymal metastasis; metastasis to extra-abdominal organs (including inguinal lymph nodes and lymph nodes outside the abdominal cavity), and transmural involvement of intestine**

- IVA - Pleural effusion with positive cytology

- IVB - Liver or splenic parenchymal metastases; metastases to extra-abdominal organs (including inguinal lymph nodes and lymph nodes outside the abdominal cavity); transmural involvement of intestine
