Fractures of the fifth metatarsal are common injuries that must be recognized and treated appropriately to avoid poor clinical outcomes for the patient. The clinician must recognize all injury patterns of the fifth metatarsal and initiate the appropriate treatment plan or referral process to avoid potential complications. Classification of these fractures is crucial to making management decisions. Metaphyseal arteries and diaphyseal nutrient arteries provide the blood supply to the fifth metatarsal base. A vascular watershed area exists in zone 2, contributing to the high nonunion rates seen with these fractures. This activity describes the evaluation and management of fractures of the fifth metatarsal, illustrates the zones of proximal base fractures and more distal fractures, and examines the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with these fractures.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of fifth metatarsal fractures.
- Describe the zones of a proximal base of the fifth metatarsal fracture.
- Explain the treatment strategies for the different types of fifth metatarsal fractures.
- Review the importance of interprofessional collaboration in the management of fifth metatarsal fractures.
