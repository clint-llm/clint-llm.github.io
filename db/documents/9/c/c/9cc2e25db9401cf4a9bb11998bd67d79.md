Hypothalamic hamartomas consist of clusters of small neurons intermixed with glia and large neurons.Â Neuronal clusters have been traditionally described histopathologically as a configuration of grapes. The clusters can be the functional unit of the epileptogenesis of these lesions. They have very low Ki-67 levels indicating a low proliferative capacity.
