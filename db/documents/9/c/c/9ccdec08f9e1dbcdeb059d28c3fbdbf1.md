Monitoring the airway of an intubated patient is dependent on numerous variables. The ventilator can provide a visual representation of a patientâ€™s ventilatory mechanics and is sensitive to acute changes. Radiographic imaging may provide information on developing lung pathology or diaphragmatic abnormalities. Weaning from a ventilator also requires proper airway monitoring to ensure the patient is capable of maintaining and protecting their airway. Specific criteria must be followed to perform extubation safely and prevent the need for re-intubation.
