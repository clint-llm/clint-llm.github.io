Kant divided his deontological beliefs between hypothetical and categorical
imperatives

Another example of a categorical imperative, or moral law, according to Kant, is the requirement never to treat people solely as a means to an end

Utilitarianism directly focuses on the consequences of actions while considering the risks and benefits of taking appropriate steps. The basic premise of utilitarianism is that efforts should provide the most benefit for the most people; however, utilitarianism does not consider the overall distribution of burdens and benefits to others. Some unethical research conducted in the past drew on utilitarian principles to suggest that unethical research served the greater good of society by advancing scientific knowledge for generations to come. According to Kantian deontology, these beliefs of the “greatest good” do not place value on individual dignity and worth, which results in a violation of Kant’s categorical imperative
