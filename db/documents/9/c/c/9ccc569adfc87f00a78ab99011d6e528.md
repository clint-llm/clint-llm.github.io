Apart from the peripheral visual field loss due to presumed compression of the retinal ganglion cell axons by the ODD, several other ocular conditions have associations with ODD. Non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) occurs at a higher rate in individuals with ODD, and they have an increased risk (Hazard ratio 2.78) of developing a sequential NAION in their other eye.
