The differential diagnosis includes Crohn ileitis, mesenteric adenitis, the inflammatory process in the cecal diverticulum, mittelschmerz, salpingitis, ruptured ovarian cyst, ectopic pregnancy, tubo-ovarian abscess, musculoskeletal disorders, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, gastroenteritis, right-sided colitis, renal colic, kidney stones, irritable bowel disease, testicular torsion, ovarian torsion, round ligament syndrome, epididymitis, and other nondescript gastroenterological issues. Obtaining a detailed past medical history and performing a problem-oriented physical examination is necessary to exclude the differential diagnoses. Accordingly, recent viral infection mainly suggests acute mesenteric adenitis and rising severe cervical motion tenderness during trans-vaginal physical examinations typically present in the pelvic inflammatory disease. One of the challenging differential diagnoses is an acute presentation of Crohn disease. While a positive past medical history of Crohn disease can prevent unnecessary surgical procedures, Crohn disease might acutely present for the first time, mimicking acute appendicitis. Intra-operatively, the presence of inflamed ileum should raise the suspicion of Crohn disease along with other bacterial causes of acute ileitis, including Yersinia or Campylobacter ileitis. The preferred approach is to proceed with an appendectomy, even if there is no evidence of acute appendicitis. However, in patients with features of ileitis along with inflamed cecum, the appendectomy is contraindicated as it would be later complicated.
