It is important for women at age 40 and over to talk to a doctor, discuss the benefits and drawbacks of breast cancer screening and decide when to get screening. Women 40 to 74 years or some older healthy women may be offered a screening test with the mammogram. Some women who are at high risk (BRCA gene or first-degree relatives with breast cancer) may need to begin screening at a younger age.

9 out of 10 women with an abnormal mammogram turn out not to have breast cancer.

Many experts suggest a screening mammogram every 2 years.
