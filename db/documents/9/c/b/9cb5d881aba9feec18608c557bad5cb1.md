- Pancreatic ascites occurs when pancreatic secretions collect in the peritoneum as a result of a pancreatic duct injury. It most often follows necrotizing pancreatitis with major pancreatic duct injury or via fistula formation which communicates with the peritoneum.

- Chronic pancreatitis is the most significant risk factor for the development of pancreatic ascites.

- Diagnostic workup includes paracentesis which characteristically shows amylase levels greater than 1000 U/L and a SAAG greater than 1.1, consistent with an exudative process. Gold-standard of diagnosis is ERCP with cholangiography showing pancreatic duct disruption.

- Management of mild disease without visible pancreatic duct disruption on pancreaticogram often can be treated with a trial of medical management consisting of nil-per-os, total parenteral or nasojejunal feeding, and octreotide or somatostatin. More severe disease with visible pancreatic duct disruption often requires ERCP with transpapillary stent placement which should bridge the ductal disruption. Salvage therapy with surgical pancreatectomy is rarely needed.

- While high-quality evidence is lacking, endoscopic intervention seems to decrease hospital length of stay and improve mortality and morbidity when compared to medical or surgical management.
