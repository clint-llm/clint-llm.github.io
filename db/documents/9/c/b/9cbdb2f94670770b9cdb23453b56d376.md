Always check for other electrolyte abnormalities when suspecting or treating hypomagnesemia. Low magnesium levels can, in turn, cause low levels of potassium and/or calcium. Furthermore, many other electrolyte and hormonal abnormalities can present with similar symptoms. Hypomagnesemia may need to be distinguished from the following:

- Hypoparathyroidism (genetic and idiopathic)

- Acrodysostosis

- Pseudohypoparathyroidism

- Blomstrand chondrodysplasia
