The etiology of salivary stones formation remains elusive, and research into etiologic factorsÂ is still limited due to the relatively rare incidence of the disease, which makes extensive studies difficult. Factors that are believed to affect salivary stones formation are divided into two major groups: anatomical, affecting saliva formation or flow (i.e., duct stenosis or inflammation), and compositional (i.e., increased calcium content or altered enzyme function).

Research examining the geographic distribution of hard water and salivary calculi formation demonstrated no correlation with an increased incidence of salivary stones in areas of increased water hardness.
