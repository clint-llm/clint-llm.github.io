This procedure outlines thoracic strain-counterstrain and functional positional release. These two indirect techniques are used for somatic dysfunctions of the thoracic spine. The primary indications for using these techniques are back/neck pain and patient intolerance to direct osteopathic techniques or techniques that require the patient to activate musculature. This activity highlights the role of the osteopathic clinician in evaluating and managing patients with musculoskeletal issues and somatic dysfunctions of the thoracic spine.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the correct procedure for treating somatic dysfunctions of the thoracic spine with strain-counterstrain and functional position release. 
- Review the indications/contraindications for treating somatic dysfunctions of the thoracic spine with strain-counterstrain and functional position release. 
- Identify potential complications of strain-counterstrain and functional positional release on the thoracic spine.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by thoracic segment somatic dysfunctions.
