The cerebral aqueduct is a narrow 15 mm conduit that allows for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to flow between the third ventricle and the fourth ventricle.

The pars anterior is a dorsally based triangle under the posterior commissure that connects to the third ventricle and runs ventrally to the tectum of the midbrain. It is followed by the antrum that is flanked on either side by constrictions formed by the superior and inferior colliculus. Finally, the pars posterior has the narrowest lumen and connects to the rhomboid fossa of the fourth ventricle.

**HISTOLOGY**

The brain's ventricular system is lined by a ciliated cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells, known as ependymal cells, which lack tight junctions. Subependymal glial cells lie below the ependymal cells and together with astrocyte processes and blood vessels form the blood-brain barrier. At both the rostral and caudal boundaries of the cerebral aqueduct are the third and fourth ventricles which are both associated with a choroid plexus. The choroid plexus is a collection of specialized ependymal cells and a collection of blood vessels that produce the CSF that flows through the ventricular system.
