Traditionally, ventricular septal defects (VSDs) have been closed with an open approach, but since then, a percutaneous transcatheter closure has been developed, though it is currently reserved for nonsurgical candidates. This activity reviews the use of catheters to close VSDs and the indications, contraindications of this procedure. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with heart defects.

**Objectives:**
- Discuss the indications for catheter management of ventricular septal defects (VSDs).
- Review the technique of catheter management of ventricular septal defects (VSDs).
- Summarize the complications of catheter management of ventricular septal defects (VSDs).
- Outline how the interprofessional team can improve outcomes in patients undergoing catheter management of ventricular septal defects (VSDs).
