Opioids characteristically exert their effects by interacting with various types of opioid receptors in the body. These interactions may result in a range of receptor responses from inducing the most significant receptor activity to no activity at all.

Although numerous subgroups exist, there are only three main opioid receptors. These receptors are the mu-opioid receptor, delta-opioid receptor, and gamma-opioid receptor.

While these receptors are present in both neural and non-neural tissue, they tend to cluster in the periaqueductal grey, rostral ventral medulla, locus coeruleus, and substantia gelatinosa. Activation of opioid receptors at these structures appears to lead to the descending inhibitory signaling that interferes with the transmission of nociceptive signals from the peripheral nervous system to the cortex.
