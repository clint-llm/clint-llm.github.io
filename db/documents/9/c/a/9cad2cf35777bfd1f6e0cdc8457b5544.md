Trachoma is a very common infection that is often first seen by the primary care provider or the emergency department provider. These clinicians should always consult with the ophthalmologist before starting any treatment. The disease needs to be dealt with in time to avoid morbidity. Coordination among healthcare professionals is vital for better patient outcomes. Ophthalmologists, opticians, dermatologists, nurses, and pharmacists all need to work in coherence to tackle the disease and all the possible complications. Even after treatment, the patient should be closely followed until the symptoms have subsided, and the visual acuity is normal. Surgeons also need to be involved since surgical interventions may be required to avoid complications. Interprofessional communication is the key to manage the problem at its core appropriately.

An interprofessional team approach is necessary. The clinicians will decide the course of treatment and prescribe appropriate therapy. Nursing can assist in patient education about the disease, as well as assess therapeutic effectiveness and patient compliance. Pharmacists should verify dosing and perform medication reconciliation to ensure the absence of drug-drug interactions. Any concerns from nursing or pharmacy should be reported to the treating clinicians promptly. Trachoma management will be optimized by this type of interprofessional, collaborative approach, leading to better patient outcomes.
