Perianal streptococcal dermatitis classifies as cellulitis most commonly caused by GABHS. There are multiple hypotheses about the mode of infection of the perineum by GABHS. One hypothesis proposes the autoinoculation of the perineal tissues by digital contact with the oral cavity, nasal cavity, and perineum. Patients transfer the bacteria to the perineum either by direct digital contact or by swallowing the bacteria. This hypothesis garners support from the fact that 92% of PSD diagnoses had concomitant pharyngeal GABHS. There is also a belief that fomites could play a role in the transmission of GABHS to cause PSD. Previous studies have found there is a higher occurrence within families and daycare centers. Some attribute the higher occurrence rates to shared surfaces such as toilet seats or bathtubs.
