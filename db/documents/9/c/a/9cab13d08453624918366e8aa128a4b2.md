The optic chiasm may be compressed in a number of intracranial pathologies, causing visual deterioration. Principally pituitary tumors, craniopharyngioma, Rathke's cleft cyst, and meningioma can be responsible for visual deterioration. Rapid visual deterioration indicates emergency surgery, whereas known tumors in this region without acute visual loss may be managed on an elective basis.

Traditional approaches to pathology in this region were via a transcranial fronto-basal interhemispheric approach and a transsphenoidal microsurgical approach.

The location of the chiasm relative to the sella turcica is an important consideration when performing neurosurgery in this area. In most patients, the chiasm is situated directly above the diaphragm sella ("normo-fixed"); however, it may be horizontally displaced in some patients. The chiasm is "pre-fixed" when anteriorly displaced and situated superiorly to tuberculum sellae. The chiasm is "post-fixed" when posteriorly displaced and situated superiorly to the dorsum sellae.
