Stillbirth has many causes: intrapartum complications, hypertension, diabetes, infection, congenital and genetic abnormalities, placental dysfunction, and pregnancy continuing beyond forty weeks. It is a catastrophic event with lasting consequences on all of society. We need to learn more about why stillbirths occur to help those impacted deal with grief and, more importantly, prepare to reduce stillbirth risk in subsequent pregnancies. This activity reviews the interprofessional team's role in evaluating, managing, and improving care for patients with this diagnosis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of stillbirth.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of stillbirth.
- Outline the management options available for stillbirth.
- Explain some team strategies to optimize care coordination and communication to advance the care provided for stillbirth and improve outcomes.
