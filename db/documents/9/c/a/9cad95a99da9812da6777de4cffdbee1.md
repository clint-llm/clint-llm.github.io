B lymphocytes can be studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Yet, each method shows b cells from a different perspective. TEM allows us to look to the inside of cells. However, SEC shows the outer surface of B lymphocytes.

**Transmission Electron Microscopy**

Blood lymphocyte nucleus under TEM has electron-dense heterochromatin, which considered as a feature of Nonproliferating cells. Lymphocytes nucleoli are round in section. Lymphocytes are arranged concentrically into three zones or structural units. (1) the central region (the Agranular zone); (2) the middle (fibrillar region); (3) the outer (granular zone) that is composed of intranuclear chromatin. Furthermore, The lymphocytes cytoplasmic organelles are typical of eukaryotic cells.

**Scanning Electron Microscopy**

This modality provides three-dimensional information. However, it creates images with less resolution compared to transmission electron microscopy. Normal blood lymphocytes washed and collected on silver membranes and fixed in glutaraldehyde. B lymphocytes under SEM range from 5.1 to 6.4 μm in dimeter. B cells were identified by their complex surface architecture with multiple finger-like microvilli covering the entire surface of B cells.
