Clostridium myonecrosis is a disorder that is best managed by an interprofessional team including a wound care nurse. Clostridial myonecrosis is a life-threatening infection, which in a matter of hours can lead to a fatality. Clinicians should be aware that the diagnosis of clostridial myonecrosis is clinical. A patient with excruciating pain at the site of traumatic injury, systemic symptoms such as fever and tachycardia, and gas within the soft tissue is supportive. Definitive diagnosis requires microscopy which can take time and should not be relied upon for initiation of treatment.

These patients need immediate surgical treatment; hyperbaric oxygenation is a complementary therapy and is not a substitute for surgery. The outcomes depend on the location of the infection, patient age, comorbidity, and time to treatment.
