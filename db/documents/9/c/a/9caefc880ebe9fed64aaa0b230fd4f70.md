Sagittal MRI is the gold standard imaging modality for assessing IFP pathology. On T1-weighted MRI of the normal IFP, the appearance is similar to surrounding subcutaneous fat except for the foci of lower signal intensity representing the interposed fibrous septae.

Hypointense vertical clefts are present in the proximal aspect of the fat pad, and horizontal clefts are present in its posterior aspect. The hypointense signal on T1 adjacent to the anterior horns of the medial and lateral menisci represents the transverse meniscal ligament.

A positive Hoffa's test and loss of extension and flexion are the usual symptoms of anterior interval scarring, which is scar tissue that binds the Infrapatellar fat pad to the anterior tibia. Other symptoms include discomfort during extension and anterior knee pain.

In a comparative study, Arthur et al. demonstrated that individuals with clinical fat pad impingement had edema on MRI in the superolateral area of the Hoffa fat pad. However, similar edema may also be present in people without signs of fat pad impingement. Therefore clinical assessment is very important for diagnosis rather than sole reliance on MRI findings.
