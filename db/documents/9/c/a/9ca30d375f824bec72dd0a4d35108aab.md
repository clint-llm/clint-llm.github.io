Current Guidelines by the American Urological Association:

- The diagnosis comes from a detailed sexual history.

- If a patient has concomitant premature ejaculation with erectile dysfunction, the latter should receive treatment first.

- Before initiating any therapy, the patient should receive objective information regarding all the options, risks, and success rates.

- Physicians should provide patients with a realistic review of the disorder and their options.

- SSRIs remain the initial drugs of choice.

- All SSRIs have roughly equal efficacy for premature ejaculation.

- In some men, local topical anesthetics and antidepressants may be effective.

- The antidepressant dose must be the lowest possible to avoid side effects and have the highest chance of success.

- The patient should be supported and offered sexual counseling.
