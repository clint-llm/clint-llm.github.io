Low back pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints encountered in clinical practice. It is the leading cause of disability in the developed world and accounts for billions of dollars in healthcare costs annually. Although epidemiological studies vary, the incidence of low back pain is estimated to be 5% to 10%, with a lifetime prevalence of 60% to 90%. Most occurrences of low back pain are self-limited and will resolve without intervention beyond brief periods of rest, activity modification, and physical therapy. Approximately 50% of cases will resolve within 1 to 2 weeks. Ninety percent of cases will resolve in 6 to 12 weeks.

Lumbosacral facet syndrome refers to a clinical condition consisting of various patient-reported symptoms, including unilateral or bilateral back pain radiating to either one or both buttocks, sides of the groin, and thighs, stopping above the knee.

The lumbar facet joint constitutes approximately 15 to 45% of low back pain, with degenerative osteoarthritis as the most common form of facet joint pain.
