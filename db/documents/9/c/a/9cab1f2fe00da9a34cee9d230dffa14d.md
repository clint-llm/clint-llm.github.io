The TNM staging system is used to classify differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The T describes the size of the tumor. Tx indicates that the primary tumor cannot be assessed, T0 means the tumor is not palpable, T1 means less than 1cm, T2 means the tumor is 1 to 4 cm, T3 indicates it is greater than 4 cm, and T4 means any tumor size with extrapyramidal invasion. The N signifies lymph node involvement. Nx signifies regional adenopathy is not assessable, N0 means no palpable cervical adenopathy, N1 means ipsilateral cervical adenopathy, N2 means contralateral or bilateral cervical adenopathy, and finally, N3 means fixed cervical nodes. M means metastasis, with M0 indicative of no distant metastasis, and M1 indicates distant metastasis. Follicular thyroid carcinoma is classified into stages from I through IV. Stage I under 45 years old is any T, N, and M0, and over 45 years old is T1, N0, M0; for stage II under 45 years old is any T, N, and M1, and over 45 years old is T2, N0, M0; stage III is described for over 45 years of age with T4, N0, M0, and stage IV is described with any T, N, M1.
