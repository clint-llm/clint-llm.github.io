T. cruzi, in its leishmanial form, enters macrophages through phagocytosis and initially lack flagella. Then it multiplies in the cytoplasm. As it transverses the gastrointestinal tract, it becomes flagellated in the midgut. Finally, it becomes the infective form in the hindgut. Leishmanial forms can be seen on fixed macrophages with aspiration from spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, or liver. Leishmanial forms can also be seen in rows or cyst-like dilation within the myocardial fiber.

Acute phase: can last from 8 to 12 weeks due to the circulation of the trypomastigotes. Histologically the primary lesion has numerous histiocytes, inflammatory cells, and areas of fat necrosis. Multiplication occurs in nearby macrophages and will cause invasion of smooth and cardiac muscles, glial cells, neurons, and fat cells.

Chronic phase: usually start with an indeterminate form for the first 10 to 30 years of the phase, where the patient will have positive serology but will be asymptomatic. Eventually, progresses to determinant form which may involve the heart and gastrointestinal tract.

Heart disease: generalized hypertrophy and dilation, mural thrombus commonly seen in the right auricle and apex of the left ventricle. Microscopically will show chronic fibrosis, focal area of necrosis and granular degeneration, and interfibrillar edema.

Gastrointestinal (GI) disease: megacolon and megaesophagus due to fibrosis and degeneration of autonomic ganglia in the myenteric plexus.
