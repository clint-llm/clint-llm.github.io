Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta typically at the location of the ductus arteriosus distal to the left subclavian artery accounting for 5%-8% of all congenital heart defects. Intervention is paramount as this condition carries a 35-year mean survival and a 75% mortality by the median age of 46 if no intervention is undertaken. This activity outlines the evaluation and endovascular management of coarctation of the aorta and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for catheter management of coarctation.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to catheter management of coarctation.
- Summarize the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and their clinical significance with catheter management of coarctation.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance catheter management of coarctation and improve outcomes.
