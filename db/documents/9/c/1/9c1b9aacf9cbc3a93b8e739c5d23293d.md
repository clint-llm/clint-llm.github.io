Nocardia are ubiquitous saprophytes found in water, decaying organic matter and soil. Out of the 100 known subtypes, only a dozen have been identified to cause disease in humans. Nocardia has a typical filamentous, beading and branching morphology easily seen on microscopy.

The cutaneous disease is usually acquired after a local injury to the skin. In the healthy population, the cutaneous disease is not serious but in immunocompromised hosts, there is the potential to spread to other organs. The localized infection may present with abscess formation and ulcers. Pleuropulmonary nocardiosis is acquired after inhalation of contaminated aerosolized droplets. The majority of patients who develop lung disease are immunocompromised.
