Ursodeoxycholic acid is a mostly well-tolerated drug. In most clinical trials, diarrhea was the most frequent adverse event observed during UDCA treatment in patients with gallstone disease, with a reported incidence of 2 to 9%. The mechanism behind this side effect is unclear. However, researchers have proposed that bacterial conversion of UDCA toÂ chenodeoxycholic acid, which serves as a potent secretory substance, could significantly contribute to this side effect. In patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, right upper quadrant abdominal pain was the most commonly reported side effect. Reports also exist of skin reactions in those with primary biliary cirrhosis. The most common dermatological manifestation was an exacerbation of pruritus, even though UDCA has demonstrated effectiveness in relieving pruritus in patients with PBC in other trials.
