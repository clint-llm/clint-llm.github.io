Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) serve a purpose both the investigation and monitoring of patients with pulmonary disease. They provide information relating to both large and small airways, lung parenchyma, and pulmonary capillary bed. PFTs are a safe and effective way to help the clinician diagnose and monitor pathology. There are many indications for PFTs, including:

- Cough

- Wheeze

- Chest Xx-ray abnormalities

- Shortness of breath

- Crackles

- Monitoring of patients with known respiratory disease (i.e., COPD, asthma, interstitial fibrosis)

- Monitoring of diseases that may have associated respiratory complications (i.e., Guillain-Barre)

- Perioperative evaluation

- Lung transplant surveillance

The major measurements included in pulmonary function testing include FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC. Some of the more common findings on PFTs are as follows

Interstitial fibrosis: dec. FVC, dec. FEV1, normal/ inc. FEV1/FVC

Asthma: dec. FVC, dec. FEV1, dec. FEV1/FVC

COPD: dec. FVC, dec. FEV1, dec. FEV1/FVC
