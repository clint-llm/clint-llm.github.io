Patients with fecal impaction often give a history of inability to evacuate stools spontaneously and complain of total constipation. In most instances, an associated history of progressive abdominal distension with increasing abdominal discomfort or pain is present. Physical examination findings often reveal a distended abdomen. In thinly built or emaciated individuals, hard fecal mass masses may be palpable along the colon. Occasionally, patients may also present with a spurious or overflow diarrhea. The diagnosis of fecal impaction is primarily based on clinical signs. A  detailed history of bowel habits and a full physical examination which includes a digital rectal exam is mandatory.
