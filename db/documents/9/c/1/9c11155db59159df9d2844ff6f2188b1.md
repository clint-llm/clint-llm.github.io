TA results if proper embryological processes fail to create a truncoconal septal wall, and the single truncal root does not divide into the separate aortic and pulmonic outflow tracts. This also inhibits the proper creation of separate aortic and pulmonary valves resulting in a single truncal valve.

While no direct cause is known, TA is frequently associated with 22q11 genetic mutations.
