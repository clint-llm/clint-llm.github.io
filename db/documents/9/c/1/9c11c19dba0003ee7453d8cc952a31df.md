Trombiculiasis isÂ easy to diagnose in the right clinical scenario. It has an excellent prognosis, and symptomatic management is all that is required. However, given the potential for transmission of serious infections through chigger bites, it is essential to prevent future exposures, and this requires an interprofessional team approach to care. Patients and caregivers should be educated regarding appropriate clothing and the use of insect repellents to prevent these bites. The clinical nurse plays an essential role in providing this education as a primary or secondary preventive measure. Occupational nurses play a pivotal role in ensuring workers exposed to chigger-infested environments are properly protected. The clinical provider should ensure there are no signs of chigger-borne infections when a patient presents for the evaluation of a chigger bite. Pharmacists can counsel patients on medical options and consult with the clinician if needed. All care team members should maintain accurate, updated medical records and communicate with other caregivers if necessary. A well-integrated interprofessional team of clinicians and nurses can decrease the incidence of chigger bites and their associated infections. [Level 5]
