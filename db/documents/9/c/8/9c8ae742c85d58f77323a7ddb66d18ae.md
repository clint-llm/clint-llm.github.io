Patients usually tend to underestimate the consequences of low blood sugar. Many individuals may self-inject insulin or take other blood sugar lowering drugs toÂ produce hypoglycemia symptoms and get individual attention and sympathy. If you feel that a close friend or family member is at risk of such behavior, especially if they have access to insulin or other diabetes medications, it is highly relevant to educate them and help them address their concerns with their primary care provider before they develop significant complications of hypoglycemia.
