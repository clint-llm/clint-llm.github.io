An interprofessional heart team evaluates patients and puts them through extensive evaluation and pre-procedural testing to determine candidacy before undergoing a TAVR. The heart team consists of cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons and anesthesiologists. In addition to transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography is often utilized for better visualization of aortic valve anatomy. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are also performed for accurate measurement of the aortic annulus for determination of valve size. CTA is also essential for visualization of the vascular anatomy and determination of the approach to be taken. Left heart catheterization is commonly done prior to TAVR to provide invasive hemodynamic measurements as well as rule out any coexisting cornary artery disease (CAD) that may be contributing to symptoms or may need revascularization before determination of either surgical or transcatheter approach. Factors that may influence the decision to pursue surgical aortic valve replacement include the need for concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting. Revascularization of stable CAD prior/during TAVR was previously a subject of debate, however data published in 2019 showed revascularization in conjunction with TAVR failed to offer additional clinical advantage and did not improve important clinical outcomes (risk of MI, stroke or death at 30 days).
