- MCP joint dislocations have a high likely hood of requiring operative intervention, and recovery to preinjury motion takes approximately 4Â to 6 weeks.

- Most PIP joint dislocations are stable after reduction except lateral PIP joint dislocation, as they often require surgical intervention.

- Isolated DIP joint dislocation is rare, and like PIP joint dislocation, lateral DIP joint dislocation more often requires surgical intervention.
