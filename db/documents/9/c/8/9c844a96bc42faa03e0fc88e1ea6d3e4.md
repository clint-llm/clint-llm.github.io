The challenge in diagnosing EoE is the differential of GERD as there is much overlap between the two diseases. GERD also can have eosinophils in the esophagus on pathology. The major difference between the diseases is the response to a PPI. Due to this difference, endoscopy with biopsy should be done at least two months after a trial of PPI therapy.

Other disease conditions that can have esophageal eosinophilia should be excluded before diagnosing a patient with EoE. Some of the diseases that have esophageal eosinophilia are gastroesophageal (GI) reflux disease, eosinophilic GI disease, PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia, Celiac disease, Crohn disease, infection, Achalasia, drug hypersensitivity, vasculitis, connective tissues disorders, and the use of a PPI.
