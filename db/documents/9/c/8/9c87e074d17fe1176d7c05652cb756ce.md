Few papers comment on histopathologic findings in Muehrckeâ€™s nails. James and Odom observed this finding in a patient of theirs undergoing treatment with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and vincristine sulfate. They hypothesized that the chemotherapeutic agents would affect the nail matrix, causing parakeratosis, and dyskeratosis would be retained into the nail plate. However, they did not observe these findings. Their repeat biopsies of the white bands showed no consistent findings.

Somewhat similarly, Nabai personally observed his own nail changes during his heart transplantation and after. He noted that the histological section of his nail plates demonstrated orthokeratotic keratinous material and areas suggestive of delayed keratinization. There was no definite appearance of parakeratosis, distortion, or thinning of the nail plates.
