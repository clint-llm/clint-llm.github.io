In lactose intolerance, microscopic findings of the small intestine vary depending on the cause of lactase deficiency. In primary lactase deficiency, the mucosa appears normal. Lactase activity can be measured to assess the severity of the disease. The mucosa may be abnormal in secondary lactase deficiency, depending upon the underlying cause. It helps determine the secondary causes of the disease, such as celiac disease. Biopsy results may be normal if the mucosal abnormality is focal or patchy.
