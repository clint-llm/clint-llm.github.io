Contemporary hair transplantation requires a well-trained and efficient surgical team, including:

- Surgeon: in addition to marking the hairline and harvesting the grafts from the donor site, the physician closely supervises the quality of graft creation and placement by the technicians

- Hair technicians (typically 1 to 4 are needed depending on the technique used, surgeon involvement, and number of grafts required)

- Operative nurse

- Surgical scrub technician
