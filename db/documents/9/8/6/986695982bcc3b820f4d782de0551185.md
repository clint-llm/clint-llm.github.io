Each year, approximately 0.1% of the United States population experiences a medical services-assessed, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. European studies have a similar incidence ranging from 0.04% to 0.1% of the population. The median age in the US is between age 66 and 68. Males are more likely to suffer from sudden cardiac arrest.

While rare, sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of nontraumatic cause of death among young athletes. In the general population, sports-related, sudden death from any cause is 0.5 to 2.1 per 100,000 yearly. Sports-related, sudden deaths are higher in elite athletes with an incidence of 1:8,253 per year per the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). NCAA Division I male basketball players have a 1:5200 incidence of sudden death.

A circadian peak of sudden cardiac death occurs between 6 am and noon, and a smaller peak occurs in the late afternoon. The overall incidence of sudden cardiac death is higher on Mondays.
