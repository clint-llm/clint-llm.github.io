Patients need to be well hydrated before neuroimaging PET scans. When FDG is used, patients need to be fasting for 4-6 hours before the study. They also need to avoid sedatives before the uptake phase. Administration of sedatives or anxiolytics can occur after at least 30 minutes post-injection of the radiotracer. Patients usually need to be in a quiet, dimly lit room for the uptake phase. No special preparation is required before tau and amyloid PET imaging. Some reports have suggested avoiding a diet rich in proteins immediately before FDOPA scans, although this is not standard. Adequate hydration following the scans to help excrete the radiotracer is recommended.
