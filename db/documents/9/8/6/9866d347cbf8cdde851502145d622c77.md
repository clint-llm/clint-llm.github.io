Hammertoe deformity is a chronic progressive deformity. However, the overall prognosis of a hammertoe deformity is good. Once the patients have been evaluated, conservative management should be initiated. If functionality and pain do not improve, surgical intervention should be considered. Depending on the type of procedure, the technique used, and the surgeon’s preference, the postoperative recovery period differs. The standard post-op protocol usually includes partial weight-bearing with heel touch in a postoperative shoe for 2-6 weeks with the transition into a rigid athletic shoe. If the patient is a smoker or diabetic, the healing may take longer. Postoperative complications may arise depending on the surgical technique being used. Some of the more common post-surgical complications include infection, non-union, hematoma, numbness, and recurrence.

Rates of recurrence and revision surgery of digital deformities are relatively high and has been showing with rates ranging up to 10%. It has been found that the 2nd digit is more likely to fail relative to the third and the fourth. Patients that showed a greater transverse deformity pre-operatively is shown to experience a greater failure rate than if the deformity is mainly in the sagittal plane. Furthermore, performing concomitant surgery to address a deviated 1st MTPJ at the first ray has shown a decrease in hammertoe recurrence with nearly 50%.
