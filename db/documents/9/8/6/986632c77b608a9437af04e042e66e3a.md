If the patient’s history and physical examination raise a concern about a possible diagnosis of CVID, the evaluation must begin with the laboratory measurement of immunoglobulin levels, demonstration of impaired vaccination response, and exclusion of other abnormalities. The following summarizes some diagnostic procedures according to systems

**Laboratory Tests**

- Blood counts (every 3 to 6 months; especially along with autoimmune cytopenia)

- Coombs test in case of new anemia (on-demand)

- Bone marrow biopsy + beta-2-microglobulin  in case of suspicion of lymphoma or myelodysplasia (on-demand at diagnosis or during follow-up)

- Plasma IgG, IgA, IgM (at diagnosis and every 6 months in patients with IVIG replacement; every 1 to 3 months in patients with SCIG replacement)

- Flow cytometry for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD56 lymphocyte subsets (initially and in case of suspicion of a combined immunodeficiency) and T/B cell evaluation

- Vaccination responses: tetanus, diphtheria, hepatitis, pneumococcal (at diagnosis)

- Sputum: determine pathogens and resistance to antibiotics (on-demand and every 6 to 12 months in case of bronchiectasis)

- Sinus simple computed tomography (on-demand)

**Lungs**

Evaluation of pulmonary disease is essential. There are no international consensus guidelines about pulmonary disease screening. However, there are some recommendations based on clinical experience cited in some publications (European Respiratory Review, Archives of Disease in Childhood, Clinical and Experimental Immunology)

- Patients should have a regular evaluation for pulmonary symptoms and characteristics of sputum (color and volume)

- Lung function with spirometry, CO diffusion test, and blood gases must be monitored every 6 or 12 months because of its proven decline over time, even in asymptomatic patients; and repeated after every flare or bronchiectasis

- Lung volume to assess restrictive disease is for patients who have an intolerance to exercise or who show diffuse parenchymal lung disease on imaging

- A chest radiograph is mandatory in all patients that complain about new symptoms

- High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is recommended in all patients as the initial diagnostic workup to assess existing lung damage (only 6% of patients have entirely normal HRCT images) and repeated every five years

- Thoracic computed tomography is the recommendation in patients with lung volume and pulmonary function abnormalities, or when the chest radiography demands further identification

- Lung magnetic resonance Imaging is viable as a radiation-sparing alternative

- Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage are recommended  procedures in the case of suspected pulmonary granulomas

**Lymphoproliferation**

- Sonography, CT, or magnetic resonance (MR) of the abdomen (on-demand and in case of suspected lymphoma)

- Lymph node biopsy (on-demand and in case of suspected lymphoma)

**Gastrointestinal Tract**

- Upper endoscopy with biopsy to search for Helicobacter pylori infection (in case of clinical symptoms and every 24 months in case of increased risk for developing intestinal malignancy, as the general population)

- Lower endoscopy (on-demand)

**Central Nervous System**

- Magnetic resonance, cerebrospinal fluid analysis in case of neurological symptoms, especially infectious ones (on-demand).

Generally, there are no uncommon findings in routine laboratories. Serum IgG should be below the normal limits and normally under 400mg/dL. Also, IgM and/or IgA should be below the normal limits.

The patient’s response to vaccines based on protein (IgG antibodies to tetanus and diphtheria) and polysaccharide (IgG antibodies to serotypes of the polysaccharides in the pneumococcal vaccine) requires assessment unless the antibody levels are deficient.

Flow cytometry can be used to determine levels of circulating memory B cells, and levels of isotype switched memory B cells (as mentioned before).

Biopsies are frequently done to discard malignancy or autoimmunity in the case of gastrointestinal disorders, pulmonary nodules, and dermatologic findings.
