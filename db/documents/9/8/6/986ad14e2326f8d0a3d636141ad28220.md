Anyone who has been properly trained to complete the Gordon reflex can perform the test. Clinicians (including PA and NPs), medical students, physician assistants, medical assistants, and nurses are a few medical staff capable of performing the test. An inexperienced medical staff member should first observe an experienced practitioner complete the reflex or view an online video of the proper technique of the Gordon reflex before attempting to perform it solo. Practice and experience increase the likelihood of accurately eliciting and recognizing the response. However,Â  when one suspects an upper motor neuron lesion, reliance on just the Gordon reflex is not recommended. There are no randomized studies that have determined its clinical validity. Like most other reflexes, the Gordon reflex has appeared in textbooks, but its true value in neurology remains debatable.
