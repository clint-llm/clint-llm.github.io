As with any procedure, informed consent with a discussion of routine risks and benefits that are present any time the skin and a joint are violated should be obtained.

The patient should be supine or in a reclined position to allow easy access to the anterior region of the ankle in addition to reducing any weight-bearing on the ankle. This positioning will allow for maximum joint space to be present during the procedure.

The cutaneous region over the desired joint to be accessed should be adequately cleaned by the use of optional alcohol wipe/swab or option of preps listed above. Cutaneous analgesia can then be obtained with the use of the 1% lidocaine and the 1 ml syringe.
