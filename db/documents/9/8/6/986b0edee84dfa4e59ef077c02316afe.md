Social, emotional, financial, and legal factors compound the complexity of chronic pain. To clarify these challenging clinical situations, diagnostic blocks are used to determine the site of nociception and the pathway of afferent neural signals. As a general scheme, neurolysis procedures can be divided into three phases:

- Under aseptic precaution and cardiovascular monitoring, the desired target nerve is first identified via ultrasound, nerve stimulation, or fluoroscopy, and a local anesthetic is infiltrated at the skin.

- Subsequently, the needle for a radiofrequency probe or cryoprobe is advanced toward the target nerve, and a diagnostic block with a local anesthetic may be performed.

- After confirmation of block efficacy, the neurolysis procedure is performed. In the case of RFA, a microelectrode is inserted through the needle to begin the neurolysis. If the procedure provides the use of chemical agents, the prepared chemical solution like phenol may then be injected. Because phenol has immediate local anesthetic effects, injection is typically painless. Cardiovascular monitoring during and after the procedure with resuscitative backup is important in preventing and treating adverse outcomes.
