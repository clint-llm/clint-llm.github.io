**FDA-approved Use**

Pimecrolimus cream is an FDA-approved topical calcineurin inhibitor (TCI) to treat mild-moderate atopic dermatitis in patients at least 2 years of age. It is considered a second-line treatment for immunocompetent patients who have failed first-line options such as topical corticosteroids and emollients.

**Off-label Use**

Off-label use of pimecrolimus cream applies to several inflammatory or otherwise “steroid-responsive” dermatoses, especially for sensitive or thin skin where there may be a higher risk of local side effects related to topical steroids. Such conditions include but are not limited to:

- Mild to severe atopic dermatitis in patients under 2 years of age

- Eczematous dermatitis of the eyelids,

- Facial and inverse psoriasis

- Oral and genital lichen planus

- Lichen sclerosis

- Seborrheic dermatitis

- Perioral dermatitis

- Vitiligo

- Pyoderma gangrenosum

- Rosacea

- Cutaneous dermatomyositis

- Cutaneous lupus erythematosus

- Cutaneous chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
