**Newborn Screening**

Many states in the U.S. include screening for Krabbe disease in a standard newborn screening protocol. The initial screening test involves measuring the GALC enzyme activity in the peripheral leukocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts.

**Imaging Studies**

Computed tomographic scan: Initially shows symmetrical hyperdense areas (due to demyelination) in the cerebellum, cerebrum, thalamus, brainstem, internal capsule, and corona radiata. Later in the course, hypodense areas (due to atrophy) develop in the corona radiata, and cerebral/cerebellar atrophy develops.

Magnetic resonance imaging: It is particularly useful in identifying brain lesions in Krabbe disease. In the infantile forms, there is increased T2 signal intensity in deep cerebral white matter, dentate nucleus, and cerebellar white matter. In juvenile and adult disease, there is increased T2 signal intensity in the parieto-occipital regions and the corticospinal tracts; the dentate nuclei and the cerebellar white matter are usually spared.

**Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy**

The centrum semiovale may show raised choline levels in the adult subtype.

Electroencephalography

May show epileptiform activity. Generalized slowing or disorganized rhythms are expected.

**Ophthalmologic and Otolaryngologist Evaluation**

The child needs an otolaryngologist assessment and an eye examination to determine the degree of hearing and vision loss and to provide hearing and vision aids to the patient.

**Genetic Testing**

Molecular genetic analysis is crucial, as it identifies carriers within a family. It also identifies at-risk pregnancies, and, in some cases, predicts the phenotype based on detected genotype.

**Lumbar Puncture**

A lumbar puncture may reveal elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels and an abnormal protein electrophoretic pattern. The protein analysis demonstrates an increase in albumin and alpha-1 globulin levels and decreased beta-1 globulin and gamma globulin levels. CSF protein levels greater than 61.5mg/dl are associated with low/shorter survival.

**Electromyography and Nerve Conduction Studies**

Electromyography changes are usually consistent with peripheral neuropathy. There is a significant slowing of conduction velocity in both motor and sensory nerves in most patients with the infantile type of disease and about 20% of patients with the late-onset Krabbe disease.

**Brain Biopsy**

The pathology findings show demyelination of white matter, loss of oligodendroglial cells, and areas of atrophy. The classical multinucleated globoid cells can be demonstrated on the periodic acid-Schiff stain.
