The economic impact on the United States by the cost of care for symptomatic leiomyomas is excessive

The patient’s age and reproductive goals direct the modality and goals of treatment. Treatment options include both medical and surgical intervention

- Relieve bothersome signs and symptoms

- Reduce the leiomyoma size

- Maintain or improve a woman’s fertility if desired

Medical management is often the initial intervention for symptomatic fibroids and includes hormonal therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The major drawback of medical management is the limited duration of use. Many of the medical management options are only able to be used for a short duration, and after the cessation of treatment, symptoms reoccur, and the fibroids often continue to grow

Hormonal options for treatment include combination oral contraceptives, single agent progesterone suppression or GnRH agonists. Systemic hormonal therapy is primarily used to control menorrhagia caused by fibroids, rarely impacts the size of fibroids and does not improve fertility.  Additionally, increased complications are associated with long-term treatment using exogenous hormones; therefore, they are generally only used for short durations

Intrauterine devices that release levonorgestrel act locally to achieve results similar to systemic progesterone suppression, resulting in decreased menstrual bleeding and improved quality of life

Non-hormonal options involve NSAIDs and tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid is a derivative of the amino acid, lysine.  This medication is a reversible inhibitor of lysine receptor sites on plasminogen that, when bound, prevent fibrin degradation and functionally stabilize clot formation

NSAIDs have been useful for reducing menstrual blood loss

Surgical intervention remains the most successful treatment for leiomyomas. Endometrial ablation is hysteroscopic destruction of the full-thickness endometrium, but this treatment precludes future endometrial assessment and requires permanent contraception.  Uterine artery embolization reduces blood flow to individual fibroids to reduce growth and mitigate symptoms.  Successful myomectomy (surgical removal of fibroids only) enables future fertility while reducing size and symptoms from fibroids; however, many women will require additional subsequent procedures for recurrent symptomatic fibroids.  Hysterectomy is the only treatment that provides definitive therapy
