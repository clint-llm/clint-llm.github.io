The SIA forms as a direct result of the embryologic development of the intersegmental arteries. The latter arteries are paired structures of the upper thorax and normally feed into the first and second intercostal arteries. The posterior intercostal arteries which branch from the SIA travel with the intercostal nerves and veins as a neurovascular bundle in the intercostal space inferior to the first and second ribs. The organization of the neurovascular bundle is as follows: the intercostal vein lies superior to the intercostal artery, which lies superior to the intercostal nerve.
