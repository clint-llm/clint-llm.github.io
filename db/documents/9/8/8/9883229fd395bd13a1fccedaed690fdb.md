Emergency Department and primary care clinics are frequently called on to evaluate orthopedic complaints. It is essential for most providers to feel confident in the management of fundamental orthopedic problems. Fractures involving the distal radius (DR) of the forearm are common. The incidence of radial fractures is increasing as life expectancy grows, leading to a larger population of patients who are at risk for these injuries. Distal radial fractures are seen predominantly in children/adolescents and the elderly. Fracture patterns, management, and complications differ between these age groups. It is crucial for providers to review these distinctions, to know which fracture patterns are emergent, and to refer for further management in an appropriate time frame. This activity will review the epidemiology, management, and complications of distal radial fractures and highlight the role of the interprofessional team in their management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of distal radius fracture
- Describe the presentation of a patient with distal radius fracture.
- Summarize the treatment options for distal radius fracture.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by distal radius fracture.
