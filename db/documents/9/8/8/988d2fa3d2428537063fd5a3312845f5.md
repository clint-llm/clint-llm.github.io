Survival in aplastic anemia depends largelyÂ on age, disease severity, and response to initial therapy. Those who recover following drug cessation or treatment of underlying condition have stable clinical courses, as well as those with self-limited processes. Five-year survival is >75% for patients who undergo bone marrow transplant from a suitable donor. The majority of untreated patients die within one year from disease-related complications (ex. bleeding, infections, or transformation to lymphoproliferative disorders).
