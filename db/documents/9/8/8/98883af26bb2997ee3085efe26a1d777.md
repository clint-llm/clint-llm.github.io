The pronator teres has two heads, each named after its site of origin. The humeral head is the larger and more superficial head and originates on the medial supracondylar ridge of the humerus, just superior to the medial epicondyle. The ulnar head lies deep to the humeral head and originates from the coronoid process of the ulna. The two heads join and travel distally, deep to the brachioradialis in the superficial layer of the anterior compartment of the forearm, to insert on the pronator tuberosity of the radius.

The insertion site is a rough area found on the lateral surface of the midshaft of the radius located inferior to the supinator muscle. Occasionally, the pronator teres must be elevated off the radius at its insertion to allow for plate fixation of radial shaft fractures. The median nerve enters the forearm between the two heads of the pronator teres, and the ulnar head separates the median nerve from the ulnar artery.

The pronator teres is part of an important landmark for the cubital fossa, which is the triangular area located on the anterior upper limb between the arm and forearm. The lateral end of the pronator teres forms the medial border of the cubital fossa.

As its name suggests, the primary function of the pronator teres is to pronate the forearm. Acting synergistically with the pronator quadratus, the pronator teres pulls the radius medially, which causes the radial head to rotate around the proximal ulna. This pronation movement brings the hand from an upward palm position (supination) to a downward-facing palm (pronation). The pronator teres also plays a small role in flexion of the elbow.
