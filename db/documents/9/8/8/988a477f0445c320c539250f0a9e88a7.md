The differential diagnosis when a patient presents with TGA should include intoxication on substance, Wernicke encephalopathy, ischemic stroke, epileptic disorder, transient ischemic attack, toxic encephalopathy, hypoxia, or head injury. However, the confusion is more global in many of these cases and it is not limited to memory loss or there are other presenting symptoms. In seizure-related memory loss, there is usually seizure-like activity prior to the onset, and the memory loss is almost purely retrograde; this differs from TGA which involves anterograde amnesia presenting with minimal retrograde amnesia confined to events surrounding the onset.
