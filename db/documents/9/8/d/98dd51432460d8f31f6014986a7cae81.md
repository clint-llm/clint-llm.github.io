Dermoid cysts usually tend to grow slowly, further having the potential to cause bony deformities, intracranial extension, or intraspinal extension.

Early resection may also avoid extensive surgery and a shorter skin incision, further resulting in an improved cosmetic outcome.

If the cyst wall has adhered to vital structures, a partial excision may be performed.
