Mature megakaryocytes form platelets. Megakaryocytes are large blood cells whose principal function is the production of platelets. When a megakaryocyte becomes mature, pseudomembrane blebs are extended and eventually break off of the membrane, forming platelets. Platelets, once formed, have an average lifespan of 7Â to 10 days, at which point they are removed from the bloodstream.
