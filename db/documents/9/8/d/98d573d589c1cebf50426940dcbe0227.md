A macular hole is a clinical condition of the central retina, which leads to the gross impairment of central vision. Many ocular conditions may predispose the eye to the development of a macular hole. Evaluation of macular hole includes the diagnosis of macular hole, along with associated pathologies using modern diagnostic tools and prognosticating individual cases. Proper surgical techniques with advanced technologies, intraoperative maneuvers, and proper postoperative rehabilitation give better anatomical and functional outcomes. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of macular hoe and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of macular holes.
- Describe the clinical findings associated with macular holes.
- Outline the appropriate treatment plan for macular holes with proper rehabilitation for better visual outcomes.
- Identify the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with macular holes.
