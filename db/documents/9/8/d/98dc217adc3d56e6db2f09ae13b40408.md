While paraesophageal hernias do confer increases in morbidity and mortality, new evidence shows that asymptomatic patients should not be rushed into surgery. Current evidence indicates that the surgery itself is associated with additional life-threatening complications. Interprofessional teams need to know which patients are more likely to benefit from surgery versus which patients are likely to suffer additional consequences. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of paraesophageal hernias and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of the paraesophageal hernia.
- Summarize the typical physical exam findings in a patient with a paraesophageal hernia.
- Review the treatment and management options available for patients with paraesophageal hernias.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and communication within the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients affected by paraesophageal hernias.
