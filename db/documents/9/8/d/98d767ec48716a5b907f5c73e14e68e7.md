Although considered to be a self-limited condition, the long-term effects warrant treatment.  A cervical collar to decrease cervical movement and prevent neck flexion is the first line of treatment.

Surgical options may be recommended for more advanced, severe, or refractory presentations. Such patients will present with atypical muscular involvement and severe spinal cord atrophy seen on MRI. Surgical intervention (duroplasty with tenting) has been associated with an improved success rate and prognosis.

The **Huashan classification system**has been shown to be useful for the diagnosis and treatment of HD and is classified as

- **Type 1**- atrophy of hand and forearm muscles or asymmetric bilateral atrophy in upper limbs with type 1a(stable) and type 1b(progressive)

- **Type 2**- atrophy alongside pyramidal tract damage

- **Type 3**- atypical with atrophy of proximal upper limb muscle or symmetric upper limbs or presence of sensory dysfunction.

A conservative approach is initially recommended for type 1 and 3 diseases, whereas surgery is recommended for type 2 entities.

The guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment based on the modified Delphi technique have also been formatted.
