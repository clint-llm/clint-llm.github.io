The incidence of analgesic nephropathy is significantly greater in women compared to males, with around 50% to 80% in females. The most commonly affected age group is 30 to 70 years, with a peak frequency around the early fifties.

In some studies, there were reportedly fewer than 200 cases per year for the period of 2002-2015 in the U.S. There is almost a similar prevalence in Europe and Australia. However, increased risk has been observed in patients with advanced age who have impaired kidney function and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
