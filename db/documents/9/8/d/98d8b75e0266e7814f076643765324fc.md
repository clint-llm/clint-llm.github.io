The management of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) should be implemented by an interprofessional team that consists of a urologist, emergency department provider, radiologist, primary care provider, and nephrologist. Moreover, the gynecologist plays a major role in diagnosing the condition antenatally. Urologic nurses should be a part of the team as well, taking care of patients and responding to their needs. Pharmacists are asked to review the patients' medications to avoid any insult to the kidney or drug-drug interactions that might worsen the situation.
