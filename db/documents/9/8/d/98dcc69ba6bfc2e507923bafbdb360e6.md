In the experimental dives, several monitoring tests were applied during compression to subjects to evaluate their neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and performance responses. Vaernes et al. used a static steadiness test for postural tremors in hands, a finger oscillation test, a dynamometer for handgrip strength, trails test for visuomotor, and coordination.

EEG recordings were also evaluated in several studies. An increase in theta activity and a decrease in alpha waves were demonstrated in the EEG records of divers who suffered from high-pressure neurological syndrome (HPNS).
