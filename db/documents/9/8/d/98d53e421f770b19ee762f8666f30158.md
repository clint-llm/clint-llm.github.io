Primary prevention of CMV colitis in immunocompromised patients receiving a solid organ transplant is crucial to improve clinical outcomes. Multiple strategies for the prevention of CMV infection in this population have been developed, and newer therapies are under investigation. However, despite ongoing work, no clear universal thresholds have been defined. Most authors recommend strategies based on local and individual factors.

- Strong recommendation for either universal prophylaxis or preemptive therapy for prevention of CMV disease in all solid organ transplant recipients

- Recommended duration of prophylaxis for kidney, liver, heart, and pancreas recipients is 3 to 6 months (strong recommendation).

- Strong recommendation for use of leukoreduced or CMV-seronegative blood products in highest risk group with seronegative status

- Recommend against routine use of secondary prophylaxis after treatment of CMV infection (weak recommendation)

- Recommend use of mTOR inhibitors in CMV seropositive kidney, liver, heart, and lung transplant recipients (moderate-strong recommendation)
