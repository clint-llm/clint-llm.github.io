# Continuing Education Activity

Obesity is an emerging epidemic in the modern world, and lifestyle modification remains the first line of therapy for weight management. Dietary intervention is an essential part of lifestyle modification. More than a dozen diets propagated for weight loss, and no single diet can be universally applied to every patient. Diet has to be tailored according to affordability, comorbidities, food preferences, and cultural factors. This activity reviews different diets for weight loss management by the interprofessional team and their potential overall health-promoting benefits.

**Objectives:**
- Identify factors for why diet is the main focus of obesity treatment.
- Outline different diets for weight loss.
- Summarize differences in weight loss achieved with different types of diet.
- Explain additional benefits of each diet apart from weight loss.

# Introduction

Obesity is a global epidemic associated with excessive fat accumulation and is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of more than 30 kg/m2. Obesity poses a significant risk to physical and mental health. In addition, obesity increases the risk of several comorbidities, including metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus,  hypertension, coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and several cancers.

The global burden of obesity has been rising with increasing prevalence, with severe health implications, increased medical costs, and lost productivity.

# Function

The latest knowledge about the pathophysiology of obesity stems from the discovery of hormones and pathways important in appetite and weight regulation. Lifestyle modification is the first step in weight management. Lifestyle modification consists of a healthy diet, exercise, ensuring sleep quality, and stress mitigation. Up to now, dietary guidelines have been updated multiple times based on available scientific evidence. In popular culture, there are dozens of different diets targeted towards weight loss. Unfortunately, the general population leans towards a quick fix and rapid results, which is not necessarily sustainable in the long term. In addition, some of these diets may focus on weight loss and ignore overall health promotion.

One kilogram of fat contains 9000 kilocalories. To lose half a kilogram of fat per week, a person should achieve a 4500 kcal net deficit for a week, 642 kcal in one day. Net energy deficit is achieved by decreasing food intake (dieting) and increasing physical activity. For example, a 55-year old moderately active 136 kg woman needs 2600 kcal for her daily needs. For a person who consumes a 2600 kcal diet, creating a 642 kcal deficit will require a 25 percent reduction in daily energy intake if the individual does not increase physical activity. The patient needs to spend effort, time, and usually some extra money to reach the goal of losing 26 kg of fat in a year. The effort can be too much, and the time to achieve the target weight is too long for some individuals. Reaching ideal body weight might seem too slow for some individuals triggering giving up on lifestyle treatment. It is advisable to set realistic goals that can be achievable.

There is no single diet that can universally fit everyone for weight loss benefit. The initial dietary approach was based on achieving energy deficit by varying macronutrient composition. Unfortunately, the "calorie in calorie out "concept of weight regulation oversimplifies the physiologic process of appetite and weight regulation.

# Issues of Concern

Mortality from cardiovascular causes has gone down with advances in science and technology in modern medical science. The rate of decline in cardiovascular mortality has unfortunately stagnated, but recently, rates are going up in 35 - 46-year-old males and females in the United States. This stagnation is primarily linked to rising obesity rates and unhealthy lifestyles, including unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, chronic psychosocial stress, and poor sleep quality.

Western diet is typically rich in refined carbohydrates (mainly from refined grains), sugar, salt, animal fats, processed meats, food additives, and preservatives. It is also characterized by a lack of fibers, vitamins, antioxidants, and micronutrients, likely because of inadequate intake of fruits and vegetables. This dietary pattern accounts for high-caloric intake resulting in insulin resistance and weight gain. Western diet has been associated with elevated serum markers of inflammation.

Unfortunately, the wide availability of calorie-dense nutritionally poor processed foods, high prevalence of sedentary lifestyle, chronic psychosocial stress, and sleep deprivation create an obesogenic environment with the modern lifestyle. Genetic influences might also be responsible for food preferences. Chronic overnutrition on top of a sedentary lifestyle is the perfect recipe for weight gain, chronic inflammation, and metabolic disorders. The combination of chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders is known as metaflamation.

# Clinical Significance

**Dietary Approach by Restriction of Macronutrients**

There are three primary macronutrients, namely carbohydrates, fat, and protein. Carbohydrate yields 4 kilocalories (kcal) per gram, protein yields 4 kcal per gram, and fat provides 9 kcal per gram. Manipulation of macronutrient composition to aim for energy restriction as a dietary intervention has been studied extensively, and this kind of dietary intervention has been used for a long time. The varying composition of macronutrients, even in energy-matched diets, have different weight loss outcomes and overall health benefits. These different outcomes are likely secondary to differences in endocrine effects and changes in the gut microbiome that ultimately impact fat storage and body weight.

**Low-fat Diet**

A low-fat diet has been traditionally advocated for the prevention of heart disease. Energy from fat amounts to 9 kcal per gram, which was the basis for considering fat as the energy-rich macronutrient. A low-fat diet was supposed to have energy restriction beneficial for weight loss. A low-fat diet consists of 20 to 25% of energy from fat, whereas a very low-fat diet contains 10 to 20 percent of energy from fat.

A recent meta-analysis of trials comparing the efficacy of a low-fat diet to a low carbohydrate diet showed that a low-fat diet was less effective than a low carbohydrate diet in achieving sustainable long-term weight loss. When the low-fat diet was compared to the usual diet in non-weight-loss trials, a low-fat diet versus a high-fat diet led to similar weight loss. Evidence from randomized control trials shows that a low-fat diet is not superior to other dietary interventions for obesity. A very low-fat diet is challenging to sustain over the long term.

**Low Carbohydrate Diet**

The modern diet is very calorie-dense. It is also very high in refined carbohydrates, partly owing to the historical guidelines recommending a low-fat diet. Carbohydrate has earned an unpopular reputation of being unhealthy macronutrient. Historical data shows that during paleolithic times, our ancestors procured food by hunting and gathering; their primary energy source relied mainly on carbohydrates paradoxically. It is essential to know that it is high in fiber, low glycemic, and plant-based. The source of fat in the diet came from meat and fish.

A typical American diet has 45 to 65% of energy intake from carbohydrates. Therefore, a low carbohydrate diet can be defined as less than 45% dietary energy source from carbohydrates. There are varying definitions of low carbohydrate diets, which alludes to the fact that it is challenging to study outcomes of a low carbohydrate diet without a precise definition of a low carbohydrate diet.

The presumed weight loss mechanism with a low carbohydrate diet relies on reduced secretion of insulin secondary to a low carbohydrate intake which stimulates lipolysis. Ketones are formed with a very low carbohydrate diet with carbohydrate restriction between 20 and 50 grams. When the body is faced with a low glucose supply, the first adaptive mechanism is gluconeogenesis. When gluconeogenesis reserve is exhausted, fat is broken down to fatty acid for oxidation. This rationale also forms the basis of a low-carb, high-fat diet. Nowadays, a low carbohydrate, healthy fat diet is trendy.

A low carbohydrate diet improves insulin sensitivity and benefits patients with diabetes, prediabetes, metabolic syndrome, overweight, and obesity. Long-term weight loss and health-promoting benefits of a low carbohydrate, high-fat diet have not been demonstrated. Long term sustainability of a low carbohydrate, high-fat diet is also questionable. There is an abundance of data showing health-promoting and weight loss benefits of a relatively higher carbohydrate, plant-based, low glycemic-high fiber diet, which would be sustainable on a long-term basis.

A recent meta-analysis of randomized control trials demonstrated a more significant decrease in body weight, fat, and triglycerides with a low carbohydrate diet than a low-fat diet.

**Mediterranean Diet**

The Mediterranean diet is based on a popular diet in the Mediterranean region, such as Italy and Greece. The Mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, seafood, fish, and olive oil. The primary source of nutrients is plant-based, rich in fibers, lower in glycemic load, and high in antioxidants and micronutrients. In addition, it is lower in saturated fat and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-6 PUFA) and higher in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA).

The Mediterranean diet has been advocated for cardioprotective and health-promoting benefits, but numerous studies have also shown weight loss benefits.

**The Ornish Diet**

The Ornish diet is named after Dr. Dean Ornish. Dr. Ornish created the diet in 1977. The Ornish diet is rich in complex carbohydrates, fiber, low-fat content, and extremely low in saturated fat. This diet emphasizes whole foods, plant-based whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and minimally processed foods. Based on the limited clinical trials available for the Ornish diet in obese subjects, the Ornish diet produced an average weight loss of 3.5% after six months and 3.2% after 12 months.

**The Atkins Diet**

Dr. Robert Atkins originally promoted the Atkins diet. The Atkins diet is low in carbohydrates without any restriction on fat or protein content in the diet. Because of low carbohydrate and high protein and fat content, the Atkins diet leads to more satiety, improvement in glycemic control, improvement in triglycerides and HDL. A low carbohydrate diet is also associated with a rise in LDL.

The high protein content of the diet can lead to the browning of white adipose tissue. Vegetarian protein source leads to a more efficient thermogenic effect than protein from an animal source.

**The Paleolithic Diet**

The paleolithic diet refers to mimicking the dietary pattern of our ancestors before agriculture. It relates to diet during hunting and gathering lifestyle. There was no single paleolithic diet as it varied according to geographical region based on climate and food availability.

The paleolithic diet is rich in whole foods, fruits, fibers. The plant source provides phytochemicals, micronutrients, antioxidants, and fibers. The diet is high in protein (25 to 35% of energy), moderate in fat and carbohydrates, low glycemic, and minimally processed. Paleolithic diet improves insulin sensitivity, reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, and helps achieve weight loss on a short- and long-term basis. The long-term sustainability of the paleolithic diet is questionable because of the high cost.

**The Vegetarian Diet**

The vegetarian diet is gaining popularity as a diet for overall health promotion. There are different versions of the vegetarian diet. A vegan diet includes only plant-based nutrients, excluding meat, fish, dairy, and eggs. Lacto – Ovo- Vegetarian provides for the provision of eggs and dairy along with a plant-based diet. Pescatarian diet allows the use of fish along with plant-based nutrients. A recent meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials shows that individuals assigned to a vegetarian diet lost more weight than those assigned to a nonvegetarian diet. Subgroup analysis of vegetarian subjects showed that subjects assigned to the vegan diet lost more weight than those assigned to the lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet. Significantly more weight loss was detected in subjects on an energy-restricted vegetarian diet versus those without any energy restriction in the diet.

**Intermittent Fasting - Time-based Energy Restriction**

Intermittent fasting is a dietary approach where there are timed periods of fasting without any restriction of a particular macronutrient. The overall rationale for weight loss based on intermittent fasting relies on broad caloric restriction. There are not many randomized controlled trials showing evidence of weight loss from intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting could be alternate day fasting or time-restricted eating, where nutritional intake happens only during a fixed time window.

The beneficial effect of intermittent fasting relies on a similar premise of caloric restriction. Intermittent fasting leads to better glucose control.

Caloric restriction leads to decreased energy intake, decreased mitochondrial free radical production, and reduced oxidative stress.

In a study of overweight men with type 2 diabetes, when subjected to caloric restriction and intermittent fasting, subjects lost 1% of body fat with a mean 6.5% weight loss after 12 weeks.

Caloric restriction may change the pace of aging by modulating Sirtuin1 (SIRT1). Sirtuins are recently discovered molecules that may be important in aging.  Sirtuins are a family of signaling proteins involved in metabolic regulation. SIRT1 is an enzyme located primarily in the cell nucleus that deacetylates transcription factors that contribute to cellular regulation (reaction to stressors, longevity).SIRT1 increases in response to caloric restriction. Upregulation of SIRT1 by caloric restriction contributes to increased insulin sensitivity and reduced inflammation, potentially through modulation of NF-k/TNF Alpha pathway(NK-Nuclear factor, TNF-Tumor necrosis factor.

PPAR-gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated transcription factor receptor gamma) acts as a nuclear transcription factor that controls multiple genes connected to cell survival and response to metabolic alterations. One PPAR- gamma gene targets the aP2 gene and codes a protein that assists fat storage. SIRT1 can act as a repressor of PPAR gamma. Caloric restriction leads to activation of SIRT1 in adipose tissue, which reduces fat storage and probably resets hormonal levels to change the pace of aging.

**Diets Based on a Calorie Deficit**

**Low-calorie Diet and Very Low-calorie Diet**

These diets are based on the concept of the "calories in-calories out model." Physiological adaptive mechanisms resist weight loss through decreasing energy expenditure when the dietary approach is purely based on negative energy deficit. A low-calorie diet consists of 1000 to 1500 kcal/day. A very low-calorie diet consists of less than 800 kcal/day. Low-calorie diets restrict carbohydrates or fat to create a negative energy deficit. A low-calorie diet may not be sustainable over the long term. A very low-calorie diet should not be recommended without medical supervision. A recent study demonstrated a more significant weight loss benefit from a very low-calorie diet when combined with behavioral programs over behavioral programs alone.

**Meal Replacements**

Meal replacements are used to create a negative energy deficit. People tend to overestimate or underestimate the calorie content of the food. Meal replacements can replace one or more meals. They are convenient. Multiple commercial products are available; additionally, their costs vary by product. A systemic review studying meal replacements demonstrated a mean weight loss of -2.2 to -6.13 kg compared with other diets involving support alone.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Optimal dietary therapy for obesity should be tailored considering efficacy, long-term sustainability, presence of comorbidities (for example, diabetes mellitus), safety, affordability, nutritional value, cultural food preferences, and long-term adherence. It has to be practical with realistic long-term goals without ignoring overall health promotion.

A healthy lifestyle and nutritional education need to be imparted from an early age. There needs to be a more proactive approach from parents in providing dietary education. Lack of affordability of healthy foods and ready availability of processed foods are also contributory factors in obesity. These factors can only be addressed by policy change and food guidelines. The patient should be provided with necessary resources about healthy food choices and referred to a dietitian when necessary. There is an abundance of nutritional information on the internet that can sometimes be overwhelming and confusing to the patient. Patients need to be guided on navigating the data, how to read food labels and nutritional information. It is vital to empower patients with nutritional information and give control of their health in their hands.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

Weight management has to be approached from a holistic point of view, and it can not be addressed by physicians alone. It requires an interdisciplinary approach, including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, dieticians, health educators, health coaches, and patients' families. It is an integrated model. In inpatient and outpatient settings, nurses can act as educators, provide patient education, monitor their diet, physical activity, and compliance, and alert them to watch for any complications. This approach can improve patient insight, understanding, and adherence to dietary intervention.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring

Obesity treatment is delivered in various settings. It usually starts from self-management based on information available on print and digital media. This information may not be 100% validated scientifically and may not be accurate. Clinical settings for delivery of obesity treatment start from primary care to specialized settings, including weight loss clinics and endocrinology practices. Digital health care delivery and monitoring treatment outcomes for obesity treatment should be integrated into the conventional healthcare delivery model. After the COVID-19 epidemic, digital healthcare delivery is becoming more common. An integrated model for obesity treatment in general and dietary intervention, in particular, should include self-monitoring based on mobile apps with the availability of feedback from a dietitian, nurse educator, clinician, or health coach. Digital health care delivery can also be used to provide counseling for behavioral modification in obesity treatment.

A recent randomized control trial involving application-based (app-based, cellular phone application) self-monitoring and provider counseling for obesity treatment in primary care settings demonstrated that participants were more likely to lose more than 5% of their baseline weight with app-based self-monitoring along with counseling from providers.
