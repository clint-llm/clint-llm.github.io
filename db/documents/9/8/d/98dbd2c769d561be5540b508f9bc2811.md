A patient-centered teamwork approach is of vital importance when managing patients with lymphocyte-depleted classic Hodgkin lymphoma. An interprofessional team comprising of primary care physicians, oncologists, nursing staff, radiologists, palliative services, social workers, and case managers should work together in every step of treatment to provide comprehensive care for patients and their families, in prevention and management of complications, regular follow-up, survivorship care, psychosocial support, and in end-of-life care.
