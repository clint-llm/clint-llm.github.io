Infections caused by Aspergillus are commonly located in the lower respiratory tract, lungs, sinuses, and skin. The central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular system may be affected by direct or hematogenous spread.

Human-host defense against the inhaled spores begins with the mucous layer and the ciliary action (compromised in diseases such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, Kartagener) located in the respiratory tract. Macrophages normally react upon recognizing fungi key cell wall components such as beta-D-glucan, secreting inflammatory mediators that ultimately attract neutrophils to initiate cellular immunity.

Many species of Aspergillus are known to produce toxic metabolites (aflatoxins, mycotoxins 3-nitropropionic acid, and ochratoxin A) which inhibit the action of macrophage and neutrophil phagocytosis.

Underlying immunosuppression is directly proportional to neutrophil dysfunction and reduced number of neutrophils. Patients on chronic steroid treatment also have associated macrophage and neutrophil function. In these cases, the risk of disease along with the type of disease is secondary to impaired phagocytosis, suppressed T cell function and oxidative cascade.

Vascular invasion can also occur if fungal cell surface components bind to the vessel wall components ultimately resulting in necrosis, infarction, or hemorrhage.

Chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis is characterized by granuloma formation and alveolar consolidation.
