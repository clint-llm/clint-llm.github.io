The first documented and published use of ultrasound began in 1958 when a team led by Ian Donald in Glasgow first utilized sonography as a diagnostic tool in the practice of obstetrics and gynecology.

Therapeutic ultrasound relies on a variety of power settings and comes from numerous manufacturers, but the principles remain the same; the ultrasound machine conducts an electrical signal through crystals found in the head of the ultrasound probe. The crystals vibrate and create mechanical waves at frequencies outside the range of human hearing (20 hertz to 20000 hertz). This phenomenon is known as the ‘piezoelectric effect.’ The waves produced transfer energy to the surface of the human body or may be focused to target soft tissue deep to the epidermis. Tissues containing a higher content of proteins (muscle and bone) absorb the energy from the mechanical waves at a higher rate than tissues with higher water content (fat).
