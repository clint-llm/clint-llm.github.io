Marasmus requires the interplay and coordination between an interprofessional team of providers, nurses, pharmacists, nutritionists, and other associated healthcare professionals in order to enhance patient-centered care and improve outcomes following treatment. The recognition that marasmus is not just a state of calorie deficiency but rather a dysregulation and loss of function of many bodily systems as a result of calorie deficiency allows the recognition of potential complications from early on. Furthermore, it is important to understand the mechanism by which refeeding syndrome occurs and how to properly treat marasmus in order to prevent this from occurring. The application of standardized protocols such as the WHO-HILA protocol has been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in children suffering from marasmus.
