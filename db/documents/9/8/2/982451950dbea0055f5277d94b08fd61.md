Postpartum psychosis has a complex multifactorial origin. Risk factors include a history of bipolar disorder,  history of postpartum psychosis in a previous pregnancy, family history of psychosis or bipolar disorder, history of schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia, and discontinuation of psychiatric medications during pregnancy. The overall prevalence is higher in patients suffering from affective disorders like bipolar one, two, and first-time pregnancy with a previous family or personal history of bipolar one disorder is considered the single most important risk factor.****Lack of sleep and hormonal fluctuations after birth, especially the rapidly falling levels of estrogen, may also pose a risk; previous postulations proposed that treatment with estradiol may be beneficial as an adjunctive treatment for women with psychosis in schizophrenia.
