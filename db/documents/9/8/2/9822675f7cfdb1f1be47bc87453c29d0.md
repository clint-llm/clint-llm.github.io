Since the discovery of HPV subtypes causing most cervical cancer cases, two vaccines have been created to decrease the number of new cervical cancer cases in the future. There is a bivalent vaccine that offers protection from HPV subtypes 16 and 18. The quadrivalent vaccine also protects users not only from HPV 16 and 18 but also subtypes 6 and 11, which cause 90% of genital warts. There is continuing research on vaccines for cervical cancer prevention.
