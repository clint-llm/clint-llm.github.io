The infratemporal fossa is an irregularly shaped cavity in the face that is touted as being one of the most anatomically complex regions in the head and neck. The location of the infratemporal fossa makes it an area of interest for pathology treated by many surgical subspecialties including otolaryngology, neurosurgery, and maxillofacial surgery. The anatomic space defined as the infratemporal fossa contains a variety of nerves, arteries, veins, and muscles. A clinically significant feature of the infratemporal fossa involves potentially life-threatening spread of infection from the infratemporal fossa through the pterygoid plexus to the cavernous sinus. This review article will highlight the important anatomic landmarks and structures containedÂ in and around the infratemporal fossa.
