The diagnosis and management of pars planitis is best done with an interprofessional team that include ophthalmology nurses and pharmacists. Clinicians should note that the diagnosis of pars planitis is based on clinical findings. The presence of more vitreous cells than anterior chamber cells, vitreous snowballs, and the presence of pars plana exudates suggest pars planitis. There may be peripheral vascular sheathing and/or cystoid macular edema/ epiretinal membrane. Clinical evaluation includes the measurement of visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and slit lamp examination. All patient with pars planitis should be evaluated with a thorough peripheral retinal examination with scleral depression. Chest x-ray or CECT (contrast-enhanced computed tomography) scan of the chest may be done to evaluate for the presence of sarcoidosis and tuberculosis. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level may be checked.

The treatment depends on the cause but in most cases, high dose corticosteroids and/or biological agents are used. The outcomes depend on the cause and response to treatment.
