The number of dorsal bundles most commonly reported are two and three, but there have been periodic reports of up to 8 variants. Most of the dorsal nerves run parallel to each other in the dorsal aspect of the penis, traveling distally. Communicating branches are commonly viewed in no specific orientation or frequency. These branches usually communicate amongst each other, but ventral nerve communications are noted in cadaver studies infrequently. Most dissection studies comment on the absence of nerves that cross the dorsal midline.
