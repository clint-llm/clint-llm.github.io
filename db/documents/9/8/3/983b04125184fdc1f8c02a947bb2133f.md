Necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) is a rare, chronic, and idiopathic granulomatous disease of collagen degeneration. It has an associated risk of ulceration and is classically associated with diabetes mellitus, usually type 1. There is a thickening of the walls of the blood vessels and deposition of fat. The major complication of the disease is the formation of an ulcer, mainly occurring after trauma. Uncommonly, infections can also occur. Moreover, if necrobiosis lipoidica becomes chronic, it may rarely turn into squamous cell carcinoma. The cause of necrobiosis lipoidica remains unknown. However, vascular disturbance involving immune complex deposition or microangiopathic changes leading to collagen degeneration has been the most common theory. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of necrobiosis lipoidica and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in ensuring the best patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of necrobiosis lipoidica.
- Review the presentation of necrobiosis lipoidica.
- Summarize the treatment of necrobiosis lipoidica.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by necrobiosis lipoidica.
