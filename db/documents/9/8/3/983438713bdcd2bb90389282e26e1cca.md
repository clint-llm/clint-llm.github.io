Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is often unresponsive to treatment and can lead to significant morbidity. Severe exacerbations may heal with rapid scarring and can result in joint contractures, syndactyly, and loss of nails. EBA can affect ocular, gastrointestinal, and respiratory mucosa, which may lead to significant functional impairment. Many complications from mucosal involvement have been reported, including ankyloglossia, periodontal disease, symblepharon formation, nasal synechiae, esophageal strictures, and supraglottic stenosis. Mucosal disease is often subclinical, resulting in delayed diagnosis and subsequent increased risk of serious complications.

Adverse effects of immunosuppressive medications used to treat EBA, such as systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporine, can also cause significant morbidity, especially when prolonged use is required for disease control.
