Patients must understand what they need to do depending on the type of injury sustained. In some cases, rest is the only treatment needed to promote the healing of a stress or traumatic fracture of a metatarsal bone. Patients must also avoid any offending or exacerbating activities. Casting, immobilization, or a rigid shoe may be required in certain instances. For both surgical and non-surgical cases, physical therapy, exercises, and rehabilitation may be scheduled to enable a return to normal activities. Patient compliance with therapy, exercise, and device use is crucial to success.
