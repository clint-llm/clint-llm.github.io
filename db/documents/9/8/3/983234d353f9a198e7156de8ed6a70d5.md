Sacroiliac joint pain can be a difficult diagnosis to make. Identification of inciting events or the history of single-sided pain below the posterior superior iliac spine should alert the physician of pain originating from the SI joint. Lifestyle modification with weight reduction and exercise is key. Injections with steroids and radiofrequency denervation have a good track record. Surgery is the last resort and is not always associated with good outcomes.
