Akathisia is defined as an inability to remain still. It is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that is associated with psychomotor restlessness. The individual with akathisia will generally experience an intense sensation of unease or an inner restlessness that usually involves the lower extremities. This results in a compulsion to move. In most cases the movement is repetitive. The individual may cross, uncross, swing, or shift from one foot to the other. To the observer, this may appear as a persistent fidget.

Akathisia is a movement disorder that may be associated with the use of antipsychotic medications.  The primary movement disorders from antipsychotic agents are akathisia, acute dystonia, pseudoparkinsonism, and tardive dyskinesia. Akathisia may also rarely occur with antidepressant agents.

Akathisia may appear soon after the antipsychotic has been started or may appear when the dosage is increased.

In recent years, akathisia has also been known to be associated with calcium channel blockers, antiemetics, antivertigo drugs, and sedatives used in anesthesia. Akathisia has also been noted to occur following abuse of cocaine. The condition may be acute or chronic, with symptoms often lasting many months or even years.
