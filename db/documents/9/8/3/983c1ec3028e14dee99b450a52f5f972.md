Tolterodine is an antimuscarinic medication that selectively and competitively binds to muscarinic M3 receptors in the bladder, thereby decreasing bladder contraction by decreasing detrusor muscle tone and increasing internal urethral sphincter tone. Upon administration, it undergoes first-pass metabolism, where CYP2D6 metabolizes the drug to its active form, 5-hydroxymethyl.
