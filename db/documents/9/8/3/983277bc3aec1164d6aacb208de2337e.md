Cystic teratoma is the most common ovarian neoplasm. It consists of well-differentiated derivatives of germ cell layers (i.e., ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) developing as hair, muscle, teeth, or bone. These tumors are generally benign but may undergo a malignant transformation in 1% to 2% of the cases. Due to their higher incidence in females between ages 20 and 40, and the risk of complications particularly torsion, it is important to treat them by surgical removal. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of cystic teratomas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of cystic teratoma.

- Review the evaluation of cystic teratoma.
- Outline the management options available for cystic teratoma.
