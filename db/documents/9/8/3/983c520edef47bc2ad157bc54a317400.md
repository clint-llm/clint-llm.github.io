Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta, most commonly occurring just beyond the left subclavian artery. However, it can occur in various other locations of the aortic arch or even in the thoracic or abdominal aorta. The narrowing of the aorta raises the upper body blood pressure, causing upper extremity hypertension. Unrepaired coarctation leads to premature coronary artery disease, ventricular dysfunction, aortic aneurysm/dissection, and cerebral vascular disease by the third or fourth decade of life. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of coarctation of the aorta and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of coarctation of the aorta.
- Describe the evaluation of coarctation of the aorta.
- Outline the treatment options available for coarctation of the aorta.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of coarctation of the aorta and optimize patient outcomes.
