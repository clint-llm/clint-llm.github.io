The exact pathophysiology of XGP is unclear. The mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of XGP is nephrolithiasis leading to chronic obstruction and infection. It is an inflammatory disorder that may occur due to a defect in the degradation of bacteria by a macrophage. The disease is characterized by the destruction and replacement of renal or peri-renal tissue with granulomatous tissue containing lipid-laden macrophages. However, the accumulation of lipids and cholesterol in the lesion is not well understood. It starts from the renal pelvis and calyces spreading to the renal parenchyma and finally to the adjacent organs if left untreated. Adjacent organs such as the liver, spleen, duodenum, pancreas, and great vessels can be involved in a severe form of XGP.
