All the pulmonary-renal syndromes that affect the lung and kidney are to be considered in the differentials. These include:

- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis)

- Systemic lupus erythematosus

- Microscopic polyangiitis

Some patients with Goodpasture syndrome also have ANCAs positive, which makes it difficult to distinguish it from granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

Some IgA-mediated disorders also present with pulmonary-renal syndromes, such as:

- IgA nephropathy

- Henoch-Schonlein purpura

Other differential diagnoses include:

- Acute glomerulonephritis

- Community-acquired pneumonia

- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis

- Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia

- Churg-Strauss syndrome
