Athetoid cerebral palsy, also known as dyskinetic cerebral palsy, is a subtype of cerebral palsy (CP). Cerebral palsy is a group of non-progressive, permanent disorders that causes limitation of activity by affecting the developing motor control circuit. These non-progressive disturbances result from insults duringÂ fetal development or in the infant's brain. Cerebral palsy as a group is the most common cause of childhood disability.

Dyskinetic cerebral palsy is the second most common subtype of cerebral palsy, comprising of around 12 to 14% of patients who are affected, the most common being the spastic subtype.
