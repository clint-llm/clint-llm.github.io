Aortic injury is one of the most time-sensitive, life-threatening conditions. It is second only to head injury as a global leading cause of death. Most commonly, it is caused by blunt trauma, though it also can be caused by penetrating injury. The mortality associated with traumatic aortic injury is about 30 percent within the first 24 hours. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of aortic trauma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the most common sites of injury in patients with aortic trauma.
- Outline the evaluation of aortic trauma. 
- Explain the treatment approaches for patients with aortic trauma.
- Explain the importance of a cohesive interprofessional team to optimize aortic trauma diagnosis and management and improve outcomes for affected patients.
