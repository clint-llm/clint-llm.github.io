There is no absolute contraindication to the use of tafamidis except hypersensitivity to the active substance (tafamidis or tafamidis meglumine) or any inactive ingredients present in the capsule. Tafamidis is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and for women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients.

Due to sorbitol in the capsules, it should not be given to patients with hereditary fructose intolerance. As mentioned in pharmacokinetics, tafamidis can be initiated in patients with mild to moderate renal and hepatic impairment; caution is recommended in severe hepatic impairment. Tafamidis should not be given in patients with liver transplants and should be discontinued after liver transplants. Tafamidis should not be given in patients with NYHA class IV symptoms, 6-minute walk distance <100 m, and severe renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 25 ml per minute per 1.73 m^2) as these patients were not studied in the ATTR-ACT trial.

**Drug Interactions:**Dose adjustment may be required when used with substrates of breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) transporter (e.g., methotrexate, rosuvastatin, imatinib). Avoid the combination of tafamidis with alpelisib, berotralstat, cladribine, ubrogepant, pazopanib, rimegepant, or topotecan.
