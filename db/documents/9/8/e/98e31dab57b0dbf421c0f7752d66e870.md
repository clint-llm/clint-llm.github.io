Response to drugs varies considerably from person to person, and their clinical outcomes, ranging from treatment failure to adverse drug reactions, can be largely attributed to drug metabolism. The role of cytochrome P450 (CYP) has been vastly studied for years regarding its influence in drug therapy. Predominantly operating within hepatocytes, their principal function is to metabolize hosts of xenobiotics and clearance of potentially toxic compounds. While paramount in many aspects of human biology and essential life processes, its most significant feature rests in the field of pharmacokinetic research and drug metabolism; this is the primary area with which drug developers and researchers concern themselves as different drugs can potentially affect the activity of CYP enzymes, or conversely, be affected by CYP activity,  leading to unforeseen clinical outcomes. Understanding mechanisms underlying a drug’s action on these enzymes is essential for patients to receive adequate therapy, especially in conjunction with other CYP metabolized drugs. Other features of CYP enzymes rest in their ability to synthesize and break down hormones, fat-soluble vitamin metabolism, fatty acid regulation, and clearance of various toxic endogenous and exogenous compounds.
