One aspect of medical management of disaster that is often overlooked by Disaster Medicine specialists is the dignified management of the dead in disasters. This process includes the triaging and proper documentation of the deceased to ensure their identification, and subsequent repatriation to the family members and is an integral aspect of disaster medicine. These measures are crucial to ensure the dignified management of the dead and adherence to Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) protocols and international standards, which require incorporation into Disaster Medicine training and curricula.

The assessment of skills can be ensured through formative evaluation using Global Rating Scales and well as Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills. The summative evaluation could include OSATS as well as Questionnaires to provide feedback on the needs of the participants to help plan future training. Both formative and summative assessments, using quantitative methods as well as qualitative methods, should be used in conjunction to address the shortcomings in the skills and knowledge of participants as per their requirements. This methodology requires a flexible approach and should not implement “one size fits all” models that would result in the squandering of resources.
