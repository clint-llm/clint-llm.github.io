Healthcare workers including nurse practitioners and pharmacists should educate patients on theÂ proper use of laxatives. Prolonged use of certain laxatives can result in melanosis coli. While the condition is benign, it often leads to unnecessary workup to rule out a malignancy, leading to higher healthcare costs. Patients who are constipated should be referred to a gastroenterologist to determine the cause. The dietitian should educate the patient on foods with a lower risk of constipation. Participating in regular exercise should also be encouraged.
