Chordomas typically affect those in the 40-60-year-old age group but have been reported in children and the very elderly. Most believe males are more commonly affected than females in an approximately 2:1 ratio with an annual incidence of 1:1,000,000 for new diagnoses.  Chordomas account for approximately 20% of primary spinal tumors and only 3% of all bone tumors.  The most common location is in the sacrum/coccygeal region (50%), followed by 35% located in the spheno-occipital region, and the remaining chordomas (about 10% to 15%) located in the mobile spine.
