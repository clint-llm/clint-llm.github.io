Duplex ultrasound is the first line of modality can be used in a hemodynamically unstable patient. It is a rapid, accurate, and non-invasive modality to investigate the etiology of IVC obstruction. However, interference, i.e. obesity, limits the use of ultrasound in identifying the cause of obstruction. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy can also be used to reveal esophageal, gastric, or duodenal pathologies, especially tumor which compresses the IVC.

CT abdomen and pelvis can then be used as an alternate non-invasive modality. Contrast venography, the standard for diagnosis, is used to assess the thrombotic obstructions of the abdomen in hemodynamically stable patients. Although it is an invasive procedure, it gives the most accurate finding of IVC obstruction and compression. Magnetic resonance (MR), a non-invasive but expensive instrument, can also be used to access obstruction of the IVC in hemodynamically stable patients and is replacing CT scans. Etiologies should be urgently obtained in hypotensive patients in order to prevent complications.
