Cyclodiode laser has traditionally been used to treat high intraocular pressures and refractory cases of glaucoma not amenable to medical or other surgical options. The cyclodiode laser ablates the ciliary processes reducing aqueous humor formation and lowering the intraocular pressure. The development and advancement in cyclodiode laser delivery devices have led to an expansion in treatment options for varying subtypes of glaucoma. This activity reviews the background of cyclodiode laser as a treatment for glaucoma, its mechanism of action, indications, contraindications, surgical techniques available, potential complications, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients undergoing this treatment.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize cyclodiode laser devices available and their mechanism of action in glaucoma.
- Outline the indications for cyclodiode laser therapy.
- Describe the various surgical techniques available for cyclodiode treatment.
- Review the complications and risk factors for poor ocular outcomes.
