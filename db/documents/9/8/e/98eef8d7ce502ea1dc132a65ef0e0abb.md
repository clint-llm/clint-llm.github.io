A hypertensive crisis must be treated expeditiously and with the appropriate medications. Managing a hypertensive emergency requires an interprofessional team-based approach starting in the emergency department or the intensive care unit, which includes the active participation of nurses and physicians from many specialties. During a hypertensive crisis, the healthcare team must coordinate patient care, which includes:

- Serial blood pressure measurements

- Monitoring the patient for end-organ damage (cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, among others)

- Vital signs

- Ensure intravenous access

- Appropriate labs (renal function tests, liver function tests, serum potassium)

- Necessary tests (serial ECGs)

- Administration of appropriate medication

- Possible consultation with a cardiologist

Besides the physicians, the nurse and pharmacist must be fully aware of the drug's adverse reactions and monitor the patient. The pharmacist should be fully aware that the drug is not administered to patients with glaucoma and asthma or used in combination with a beta-blocker for fear of inducing severe hypotension. Nurses must administer the drug according to appropriate dosing and protocol and report any adverse reactions to the healthcare team. All of the above represent examples of collaborative interprofessional communication necessary for successful fenoldopam therapy to optimize patient outcomes. [Level 5]

Following the stabilization of the patient, other healthcare personnel outside the emergency department will have involvement in the patient's care. The type of providers involved in outpatient care differs based on etiology. However, a family practitioner or internist will always be responsible for initiating the continuation of the patient's care.

**Evidence-Based Outcomes**

Fenoldopam has been demonstrated to have a renal protective effect in hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease. However, a meta-analysis of many studies reveals that the drug can lower blood pressure effectively and decrease acute kidney injury, but in the long run, fenoldopam has no impact on renal replacement or the 30-day, in-patient mortality.
