One of the most distinct symptoms of sensory neuropathy is early-onset ataxia. This manifestation is mainly due to the disruption of the afferent neurons, which transmit impulses from the extremities of the body.

When performing a subjective patient interview, variability in disease progression will be significant. Subacute sensory neuropathies are commonly seen in immune-mediate and post-infectious cases, whereas idiopathic variants have proven to be more stagnant.
