Harlequin syndrome is a rare dysautonomic syndrome associated with a sudden dramatic, colorful presentation. There may be diverse underlying pathologies manifesting as harlequin facies that need to be ruled out before considering the definitive diagnosis of primary Harlequin syndrome. This requires collaboration between multiple specialties, including but not limited to surgeons, neurologists, anesthesiologists, neonatologists, dermatologists, radiologists, ophthalmologists, and nursing staff.

Despite the benign nature of Harlequin syndrome, it can bring significant anxiety and apprehension among the patient, caretakers, and healthcare personnel. Familiarity with this syndrome among physicians and nurses is essential for identifying, diagnosing, and managing the syndrome, improving patient satisfaction, and avoiding potentially harmful therapeutic interventions.
