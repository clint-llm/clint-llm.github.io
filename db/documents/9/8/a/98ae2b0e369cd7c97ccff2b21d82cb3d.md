Surgical repair is contradicted in patients with subclinical varicoceles, those with normal semen quality, and in patients with isolated teratozoospermia.

If a varicocele is discovered during vasectomy or vasectomy reversal, the varicocele repair should be delayed 6 months to allow for the development of collateral vessels that will minimize the risk of delayed vascular compromise.

Varicocele repair has not been shown to be of any benefit in patients who are pursuing intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment.

Varicocelectomy surgery improves testosterone production and might be a viable option in selected hypogonadal men as an alternative to permanent testosterone supplementation.

Reminder: Isolated right-sided varicoceles could be an indication of vena cava obstruction such as from a right renal cancer venous tumor thrombus. In such cases, appropriate imaging is recommended.
