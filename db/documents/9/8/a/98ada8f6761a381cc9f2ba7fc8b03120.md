Due to the broad distribution of muscarinic receptors throughout the body, as well as the various side effects that stimulation can cause systemically, extra care must be taken by a medical team to monitor and manage proper dosing in patients using cholinomimetic medications. The healthcare team must work together to monitor levels of acetylcholine in patients taking pilocarpine. Side effects to look out for should mostly include hypersalivation, lacrimation, and miosis, diarrhea, and diaphoresis, which may happen due to the M3 receptor distribution. However, more severe side effects may occur due to antagonism of M1 and M2 receptors located in the cardiac and respiratory systems. Some studies say that pilocarpine is strictly confined to treating narrow-angle glaucoma only, as its adverse side effects are generally poorly tolerated.
