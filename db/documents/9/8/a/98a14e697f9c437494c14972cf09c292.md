V-Series nerve agents are organophosphate esters that are used as chemical weapons. They are extremely potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Biological effects include seizures, salivation, lacrimation, urination, diaphoresis, diarrhea, vomiting, miosis, and muscles spasms. As little as a few milligrams of some V-series agents can be lethal to humans. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of patients affected by V-series agents and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiology of V-series nerve agents. 
- Describe the pathophysiology of V-series nerve agents. 
- Summarize the treatment of patients affected by V-series nerve agents. 
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members in order to deliver care to patients affected by V-series nerve agents as well as the importance of communicating with health officials, law enforcement agencies, members of the media, and elected officials in the management of incidents involving V-series nerve agents.
