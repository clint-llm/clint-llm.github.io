Bancroftian filariasis is a chronic neglected tropical disease endemic in over 72 countries. These endemic regions include South East Asia, Sub Saharan Africa, islands of Pacific, and selected areas in Latin America. An estimated 70 million people in the world suffer from lymphatic filariasis with Wuchereria bancrofti accounting for more than 90% of the cases.

The disease holds paramount epidemiological significance as World Health Organization (WHO) plans to eliminate it by 2020.
