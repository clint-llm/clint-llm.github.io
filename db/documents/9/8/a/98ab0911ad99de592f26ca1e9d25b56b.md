Other infections that can cause eosinophilic meningitis include gnathostomiasis and baylisascariasis.

- Gnathostomiasis is associated with consuming undercooked fish, poultry, or snake meat.

- Baylisascariasis is caused by the consumption of parasite (Baylisascaris procyonis) eggs (usually in children by ingesting soil) usually transmitted in raccoon feces.

- Cysticercosis caused by Tinea solium or other diseases caused by lung flukes such as schistosomiasis, and paragonimiasis are other important differentials.

- Coccidioidomycosis is also associated with eosinophilic meningitis.

- Non-infectious causes of eosinophilic leptomeningeal enhancement include non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloproliferative disorders, disseminated glioblastoma, and paraneoplastic manifestation from bronchogenic carcinoma.

- Drugs associated with eosinophilic meningitis include trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, ibuprofen, and intraventricular vancomycin and gentamicin.

- Encephalopathy and neurological deficits have been reported to be associated with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome.

The most important point in the diagnosis is a high index of suspicion in patients who have likely been exposed to the nematode during the previous few weeks, which can extend up to 6 weeks prior.
