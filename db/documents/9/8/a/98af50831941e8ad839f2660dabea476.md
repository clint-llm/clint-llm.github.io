Losing weight is challenging, and sustaining lost weight is even more difficult. Weight homeostatic mechanisms, as explained by the set-point theory, resist any weight changes, making obesity hard to treat. Understanding that obesity is a chronic disease is essential to reduce the stigma of obesity. Clinicians and society should avoid blaming patients for their obesity. The set-point theory helps healthcare workers provide educated guidance, emotional support, and motivation to patients during weight loss trials.

Understanding set-point theory may aid in uncovering the underlying causes of the obesity epidemic. Identifying and targeting the mechanisms involved in the weight set point could serve as a potential target for preventing and treating obesity in the short term and for sustained weight loss. Finding safe and less invasive treatments that permanently lower the weight set point could significantly reduce the economic and healthcare burdens caused by obesity and its comorbidities.
