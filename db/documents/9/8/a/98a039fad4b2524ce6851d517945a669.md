**Technology**

The introduction of the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and other technological advances can also affect nurses staying in the profession. While some specialties such as nursing informaticsÂ are booming, that adds to the shortage problem by removing nurses from direct patient care areas. Some seasoned nurses struggle with the technology and remove themselves from the profession at an earlier rate.

**Empowerment**

Organizations must be creative in meeting the needs of nurses while providing the best and safest care to the patients. An environment that empowers and motivates nurses is necessary to rejuvenate and sustain the nursing workforce. Empowerment in autonomy in staffing ratio decisions considering high volume and acuity levels will lead to less burnout and a strong desire to leave the workforce. Many organizations have endorsed and sought after the Magnet Certification to provide superior nursing processes and a high level of safety, quality, and patient satisfaction.
