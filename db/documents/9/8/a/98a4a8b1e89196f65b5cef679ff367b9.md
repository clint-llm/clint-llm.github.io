Psittacosis is a systemic disease that can cause an atypical pneumonia when it infects the lungs.  Psittacosis is also known as avian chlamydiosis, ornithosis, and parrot fever. This disease is caused by the zoonotic bacterium Chlamydia psittaci, which is transmitted to humans primarily from birds. Although all birds are susceptible, pet birds and poultry are most frequently involved in transmission to humans. C. psittaci can be transmitted to humans by direct contact with the animals, avian nasal discharges, infectious avian fecal material, or even inhalation of feather dust. Person-to-person transmission has not been demonstrated.

Historically, C. psittaci was used in the 1960s and 1970s as the model organism that laid the foundation for modern chlamydia research. Multiple severe outbreaks have been documented as early as 1879, including an outbreak in the United States that helped lead to the creation of the National Institute of Health (NIH) in 1930.
