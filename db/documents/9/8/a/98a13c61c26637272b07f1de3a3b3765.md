As with any trauma, evaluation should begin with an efficient primary and secondary survey, concentrating on the airway, breathing, and circulation. The definitive diagnosis of duodenal trauma will require a particularly high level of suspicion. Given the retroperitoneal location, the physical exam is further limited in detecting these injuries.

After abdominal trauma, any patient with peritonitis or evisceration should be immediately taken for an exploratory laparotomy.

Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) is an option but has been replaced mainly by the advent of FAST.Â A stable patient can be evaluated by computerized tomography (CT).
