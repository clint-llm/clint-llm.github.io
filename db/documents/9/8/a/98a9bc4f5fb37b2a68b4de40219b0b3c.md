Aniridic fibrosis syndrome was first described by Tsai et al. in 2005.

Aniridic fibrosis syndrome occurs in the setting of congenital aniridia or the absence of the iris. Aniridia is an intricate congenital syndrome that can arise in an inherited or sporadic manner.PAX6 gene mutations, and the specific mutation can have considerable effects on the observed phenotype and resultant pathologies.PAX6 mutations may also be part of various clinical syndromes (e.g., WAGR, or WAGRO syndromes), but other genetic mutations (e.g., FOXC1, PITX2, PITX3) and sporadic cases have been reported to cause aniridia.
