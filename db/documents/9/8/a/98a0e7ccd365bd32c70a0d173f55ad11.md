Biopsy of the involved site (usually skin) is required to confirm the diagnosis. Lesions will stain positive for S-100 and CD-1a. Cytoplasmic Birbeck granules will be present on electron microscopy. When the diagnosis is confirmed, workup for systemic involvement should include a skeletal survey, abdominal ultrasound, complete blood count (with bone marrow biopsy if indication of bone marrow involvement), and evaluation for diabetes insipidus.

**CT scanning or MRI**

Both CT scan and MRI are invaluable for assessing the hypothalamic-pituitary area. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scanning also is being used to assess patients with LCH. The technique is far more sensitive than bone scan for early detection of disease in the spleen, lymph nodes, and lung. In fact, FDG PET scan is now also being routinely used to monitor disease during treatment.

**Other Tests**

- Pulmonary function testing may help identify asymptomatic patients with lung involvement

- Small bowel series is recommended in patients with failure to thrive, diarrhea, and malabsorption

- Neurological and visual testing

- Auditory testing

- Recent studies suggest that CSF fluid can be used to detect biomarkers like glial fibrillary acidic protein to evaluate the onset of disease and response to therapy.

- Skin biopsy can establish the diagnosis
