The goals of optimal management of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome include decreasing incidence and severity using antenatal corticosteroids, followed by optimal management using respiratory support, surfactant therapy, and overall care of the premature infant.

- Antenatal corticosteroids (discussed later in the topic)

- Monitoring oxygenation and ventilation

- Assisted ventilation of the neonate

- Exogenous surfactant therapy

- Supportive care, including thermoregulation, nutritional support, fluid and electrolyte management, antibiotic therapy, etc.

**Monitoring Oxygenation and Ventilation**

Serial blood gas monitoring may be necessary to optimize oxygenation and ventilation. Ideally, the neonates undergo blood gas monitoring using an umbilical or peripheral arterial catheter placed using a sterile technique. The partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) on an arterial blood gas is maintained between 50 to 80 mmHg, and partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) is maintained between 40 to 55 mmHg, with the pH >7.25.

Non-invasive pulse oximetry is now the standard of care to monitor oxygen saturation (SaO2). Unclear higher limits often limit the utility of pulse oximetry, since PaO2 could be significantly higher at the SaO2 levels >95%. Non-invasive capnography and transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring are used as adjuncts for monitoring ventilation.

**Assisted Ventilation of the Neonate**

The goals of assisted ventilation are to reduce atelectasis by providing a constant distending positive airway pressure. The current preferred strategy is the early initiation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with selective surfactant administration.

**Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP):**Nasal CPAP is an initial intervention in preterm infants with RDS or risk of RDS without respiratory failure. Multiple modalities are available for CPAP delivery, including ventilator derived CPAP as well as a less expensive bubble CPAP device. Infants who received CPAP fared as well as infants who received prophylactic surfactant therapy along with mechanical ventilation in the SUPPORT trial (Surfactant Positive Airway Pressure and Pulse Oximetry Randomized Trial),

**Non-invasive Respiratory Support:**Nasal Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV) appears superior to CPAP alone for decreasing extubation failure, the need for intubation in preterm infants, but the same in cost and safety.

**High Flow Nasal Canula:**Heated humidified high-flow nasal cannulas (HFNC) are also used in some centers as an alternative to CPAP to provide positive distending pressure ventilation to neonates with RDS. As seen in a clinical trial by Roberts et al., HFNC was found to be inferior to CPAP.

**Mechanical Ventilation:**Patients who do not respond to CPAP, develop respiratory acidosis (PH < 7.2 and PaCo2 > 60-65 mm of Hg), hypoxemia (PaO2 < 50 mm of Hg or Fio2 > 0.40 on CPAP), or severe apnea are managed with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The goals of mechanical ventilation include providing adequate respiratory support while balancing the risks of barotrauma, volutrauma, and oxygen toxicity. Time-cycled pressure limited ventilation is the preferred initial mode of ventilation in preterm infants with RDS. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) and high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) are often used as rescue modalities when requiring high conventional ventilator support or concerns for pulmonary air leaks. Other strategies include the use of high-frequency ventilation empirically in extremely preterm infants to minimize lung injury.

**Exogenous Surfactant Therapy**

The targeted treatment for surfactant deficiency is intratracheal surfactant replacement therapy via an endotracheal tube. Surfactant administered within 30 to 60 minutes of the birth of a premature neonate is found to be beneficial. Surfactant hastens recovery and decreases the risk of pneumothorax, interstitial emphysema, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), BPD, and neonatal mortality in the hospital and at one year. However, neonates who receive surfactant for established RDS, have an increased risk of apnea of prematurity. According to European census guidelines, the surfactant is administered to immature babies with FiO2 > 0.3, and mature babies with FiO2 > 0.4. Currently, there are no clinically significant advantages of using one type over another when used in similar doses:

- Beractant: This is a modified natural surfactant prepared from minced bovine lungs with the additives

- Poractant alfa: This is a modified natural surfactant derived from minced porcine lung extract

- Calfactant: This is a natural surfactant obtained from lavaging calf lung alveoli and contains 80% phosphatidylcholine with only 1% protein

- Synthetic surfactant: Clinical trials are ongoing

Surfactant is administered either by standard endotracheal intubation, which needs experienced practitioner or through less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) technique like aerosolized nebulized surfactant preparations, laryngeal mask, pharyngeal instillation, and thin intratracheal catheters.

**Supportive Care**

Preterm infants with apnea of prematurity may require caffeine therapy. Caffeine can also be administered to preterm infants < 28 weeks with extremely low birth weight (BW <1000 g) to increase respiratory drive and enhance the use of CPAP. There was a low incidence of BPD and earlier extubation in preterm infants who received caffeine compared to placebo.

Optimal fluid and electrolyte management is critical in the initial course of RDS. Some neonates may require volume resuscitation using crystalloids as well as vasopressors for hypotension. Furthermore, the overall care of a preterm infant also includes optimizing thermoregulation, nutritional support, blood transfusions for anemia, treatment for hemodynamically significant PDA, and antibiotic therapy as necessary.
