There are a variety of potential complications from epidural catheter placement. Intrathecal injection or overdose in the epidural space, potentially resulting in a high or total spinal are among the most detrimental.

- Intravascular injection

- Local anesthetic systemic toxicity

- Post dural puncture headache

- Infection

- Abscess

- Hematoma

- Incomplete block
