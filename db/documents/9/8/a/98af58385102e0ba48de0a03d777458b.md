The experienced clinician will most often make the diagnosis with a history and physical exam alone. It is very important when making the diagnosis, to consider the risk of septic bursitis. Due to both overlapping and variably present signs and symptoms, the average clinician cannot reliably discern between non-infectious bursitis and a mild infectious bursitis without objective diagnostic testing. As such, one must consider the risks and benefits of the mildly invasive aspiration of the bursa required for definitive testing.

Bursal aspiration and analysis are considered to be the gold standard in diagnosis. This is particularly important when underlying infection is being considered. When evaluating to rule out infection, fluid should be sent for cell count, Gram stain, culture and sensitivity tests, and crystal examination. There has also been some belief that serum/bursal fluid glucose concentration differences are markedly more significant in septic cases. However, this has not been validated. When evaluating for septic bursitis, the clinician must also evaluate for the presence of systemic sepsis via careful inspection of vital signs and consider evaluating serum lab tests as necessary.
