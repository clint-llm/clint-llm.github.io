A gastroenterologist should be consulted for esophagogastroduodenoscopy within 12 to 24 hours of ingestion to assess the extent of the damage. A regional poison control center should render consultation to guide clinicians on treatment options and the duration of observation.Â  If the ingested substance has several known ingredients, then poison control can also advise in the management of the additional ingredients.
