Ischemic/dry gangrene occurs as tissue loss most commonly seen with progressive peripheral artery disease (PAD). Critical limb ischemia/chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLI/CLTI) is the most advanced stage of peripheral artery disease, with an incidence of 1% of the United States population over 50 years old and up to twice that over 70 years old.

Gas gangrene typically occurs after trauma, with anaerobic bacteria's introduction into a previously protected tissue space. Gas gangrene has been identified after traffic accidents, crush injuries, gunshot wounds, and postoperative complications related to infection. Non-traumatic gas gangrene has also been documented from hematogenous spread, and multiple case studies have demonstrated an association with a metastatic gut malignancy.
