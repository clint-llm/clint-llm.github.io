Prasugrel is a thienopyridine, an irreversible antagonist of the ADP P2Y12 receptor.

**Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics**

Prasugrel is a prodrug that is converted to an active thiol metabolite and inactive metabolite by the hepatic CYP system, specifically CYP2BH6, 2C9/19 (minor), and it is a CYO3A4 substrate. The active component (R- 138727) of the metabolites irreversibly binds to and blocks P2Y12Â adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptors, preventing GPIIb/IIIa receptor complex activation, thus reducing platelet aggregation and activation. It is rapidly absorbed and metabolized, with its active metabolite peaking approximately after 30 minutes of dosing. The mean elimination half-life of the active metabolite of prasugrel is approximately 7 hours.
