Thorough preoperative planning with clinical history looking for a history of previous injuries, pain, swelling, effusion, or previous procedures must be noticed. Up to 50% of patients do not have any history of notorious injuries.

Thorough physical exam looking for a range of motion restriction, ligament instability signs, meniscal tear signs, or limb malalignment.

Complete radiographic assessment with a bilateral weight-bearing anteroposterior view, posteroanterior flexion view, true lateral, and axial knee views. Mechanical axis assessment with long leg standing anteroposterior views.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) helps determining an estimated chondral defectâ€™s size and location as well as subchondral bone edema, ligament tears, and meniscal tears. MRI underestimates chondral defects in up to 60% of patients.

The surgical procedure is carried out under general anesthesia, and the following are the requirements:

- Intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis

- Patient positioned supine on the operating table

- High thigh tourniquet is set

- Typically arthroscopically-assisted

- Allograft donors and recipients are matched preoperatively by radiographic dimensions. An acceptable match size is within +/-2mm.
