Burns are a frequent reason for emergency room visits and will continue to be commonly presenting injuries. Understanding the basics of burn management is vital for the continued advancement of medical literature when it comes to burn care. Focus is essential on the process of burn treatment with an emphasis on early excision and grafting, followed by reconstruction if necessary. The care of burn patients is interprofessional, with decisions being multi-factorial. With appropriate education, healthcare providers can work together to advance the field of burn surgery over time.
