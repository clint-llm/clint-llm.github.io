Most patients with endometrial hyperplasia present with abnormal uterine bleeding. Often times, they may come to nurse-practitioners or general physicians, and therefore an understanding of the potential causes and the interprofessional coordination with the gynecologist becomes important.  The radiologist and histopathologist are key diagnosticians along with the gynecologist in this setting. They should be provided with the relevant clinical history to aid a correct diagnosis.  Most international bodies of gynecology have their recommendations on the diagnosis and management of endometrial hyperplasia based on the evidence from large studies.
