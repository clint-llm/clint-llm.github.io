**Redislocation Following Surgical Fixation**

- The main complication of anterior shoulder stabilization is recurrent instability

- Historically, open shoulder stabilization procedures correlated with a lower rate of recurrence compared to arthroscopic procedures:

- Recurrence rates: 2% to 9% reported in the literature

- Arthroscopic Bankart procedures have demonstrated recurrence rates of 4% up to 67% depending on the complexity range of shoulder instability pathology in each case 

- Burkhart and De Beer (2000) reported the results following arthroscopic Bankart repair:

- Without significant bony defects: 4%
- With significant bony defects: 67%
- “Significant” is defined as either an engaging Hill-Sachs lesion or an “inverted pear” glenoid lesion (i.e., inferior glenoid margins are narrower than the superior and central glenoid margins)


- A 2017 multicenter database study (2008-2012) reported no difference in rates of revision surgery following open versus arthroscopic Bankart repair procedures

- Utilizing the previously described ISIS scoring scale for the preoperative, clinical exam, and radiographic shoulder instability parameters, a 2019 study reported the 5-year recurrence-free instability rates following arthroscopic Bankart repair: 

- 94% with 1 to 2 risk factors (ISIS score less than or equal to 3)
- 85% with an ISIS score of 4 to 6 points
- 55% with an ISIS score of greater than 6 points

**Nerve Injuries**

- In general, nerve injuries typically manifest as transient sensory neurapraxia.

- Recent studies have demonstrated a lower postoperative rate of nerve injury following arthroscopic (0.3%) versus open (2.2%) Bankart repairs.

- The axillary nerve (most common nerve injury) is adjacent to the inferior capsule and closest to the inferior glenoid rim at the 6 o’clock position.
- The axillary nerve can be injured when placing sutures at the anteroinferior and inferior positions (the 4:30- and 6-o’clock positions, respectively, in the right shoulder) or when repairing capsular lesions, such as a capsular tear or humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament.

**Infection**

- No significant difference appreciated between open versus arthroscopic Bankart repairs

- 22% rate following arthroscopic Bankart repair

**Implant-related Problems**:

- Earlier studies (1993 to 2010) reported up to 30% rate of implant-related complications (loosening or breakage)
- Studies included older implant devices and instrumentation (e.g., metallic staples, bioabsorbable tacks)

- A 2011 study reported implant-related complication rates much lower compared to these earlier studies: 

- Suture-anchor only devices
- 0.3% implant-related complication rate
