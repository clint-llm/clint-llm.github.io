In all patients with HUS symptoms, Shiga toxin/STEC should be tested along with ADAMTS13 activity as clinical presentation, and the organ involvement in hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura can overlap. In patients of unusual age or in whom diarrhea is absent anomalous or atypical E. coli, HUS is a possible diagnosis.
