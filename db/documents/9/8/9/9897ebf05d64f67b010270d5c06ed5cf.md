RTT is one of the most frequent causes of mental disability in females, with an incidence of 1 in 10,000 to 15, 000. A population-based registry in Texas reported a prevalence of classic RTT as 1 per 22,800 females (0.44 per 10,000) from ages 2 to 18. RTT was originally thought to only occur in females and males with RTT were not considered to be viable.  Further investigations on the incidence and prevalence of RTT in males are needed. A systematic review conducted in Texas in 2015 reported a total of 57 cases of RTT in males and a population study showed the incidence of RTT in males was not more predominant in any particular race.
