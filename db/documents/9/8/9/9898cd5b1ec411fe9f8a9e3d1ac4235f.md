In 1972, the United States Congress passed the Drug Listing Act to allow for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to have an up-to-date list of all drugs that are commercially distributed. The law stated that all commercially available drugs were to have a unique National Drug Code (NDC). Every drug establishment, foreign or local, involved in the manufacturing, production, or compounding of commercially available drugs for use within the United States must be listed with the FDA.

Starting in 1979, the United States Food and Drug Administration stated that all prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications would need an expiration date. After September 27, 1979, any drug product packaged is required by law to contain an expiration date. This expiration date would guarantee a medication's stability and efficacy up to that date in the original container. All expiration dates must be clearly printed on the label of medications. Drug manufactures are required by law to perform stability testing on all medications to ensure proper expiration dating. [Title 21, Chapter I, Subchapter C, Part 211, Subpart C, Section 211.137]
