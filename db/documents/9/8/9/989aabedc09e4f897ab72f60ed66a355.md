When inspecting the patient's neck, a variety of pulsation phenomena might be seen. The important differentials of elevated JVP are fluid overload due to variety of causes, superior vena cava obstruction, or an increase in intrathoracic pressure.  The first step is to differentiate between arterial and venous pulsations by location and strength on palpation. There are higher pressures existent in the arterial than in the venous circulation. Right Internal jugular vein is usually preferred over the left as it is in direct line with superior vena cava.

The venous pressure curve can be altered in different ways and Cannon A waves may be mistaken. For example, giant C and V waves can occur in tricuspid regurgitation. This is called Lancisi's sign.  Jugular vein distension can result from a pulmonary embolism as part of Beck's Triad. Elevated JVP without venous pulsations should raise the suspicion of superior vena cava obstruction. This illustrates the importance of venous pressure as a window to the right heart.
