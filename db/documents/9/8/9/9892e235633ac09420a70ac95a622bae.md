The differential diagnosis for chest wall tumors is exponential. The differential includes benign and malignant lesions, which can be the local extension of an adjacent disease. It can also include local manifestations of inflammatory or infectious etiologies. The following criteria can limit the differential of chest wall tumors: overall prevalence and characteristic clinical features, mineralization patterns, the location at the chest wall, and intrinsic magnetic resonance imaging characteristics that correspond with histopathologic findings.

Most Common Benign Tumors

- Osteochondromas

- Chondromas

- Fibrous dysplasia

- Desmoid tumors

Most Common Malignant Tumors

- Soft tissue sarcomas

- Chondrosarcomas

- Ewing sarcoma
