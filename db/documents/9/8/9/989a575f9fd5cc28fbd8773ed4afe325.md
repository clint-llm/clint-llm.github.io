Parvovirus B19 is a non-enveloped virus that binds to host cell receptors in the respiratory tract and enters the cell. It then translocates its genome to the host nucleus, whereby DNA replication, RNA transcription, and assembly of the virus occurs. Lastly, the cells lyse and release the mature virions.Â Viremia occurs and creates the prodrome of symptoms that patients experience. The IgM antibody appears when viremia resolves, which is approximately eight to 10 days post-inoculation. During the viremic period, reticulocytopenia occurs for seven to 10 days. One week after the appearance of the IgM antibody, the IgG antibody appears and coincides with the appearance of the rash and arthralgia. Parvovirus is tropic to bone marrow and replicates in erythroid precursors. The P antigen is the cellular receptor for parvovirus B19 that causes erythema infectiosum in children.
