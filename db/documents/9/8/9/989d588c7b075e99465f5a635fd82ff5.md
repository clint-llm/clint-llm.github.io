Acute ICH can be a catastrophic event with the mortality largely predicted by the hematoma size, location, and the patients' GCS on admission.  At 30 days, the mortality rate can be as high as 50%, with most of these deaths occurring within 24 hours of the initial insult, with intraventricular blood and hydrocephalus often playing a large part in the patient's deterioration.

Although there are no definitive ways of predicting outcomes, early withdrawal of care can, in itself, lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy. Therefore full medical care and treatment should be offered to all patients with acute ICH who do not have an advance directive or known wishes for the first 24 to 48 hours post ictus.
