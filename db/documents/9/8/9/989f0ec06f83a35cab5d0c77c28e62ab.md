Spiradenomas appear to be caused by a defective tumor suppressor gene. A mutation in the CYLD gene on chromosome 16 is found in Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, which features multiple spiradenomas.

The cause of malignant spiradenomas is also unknown. Increased expression of p53 is seen, though the significance of this finding in the malignant transformation of spiradenomas has not been determined.
