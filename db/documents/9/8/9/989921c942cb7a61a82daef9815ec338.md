The abdominal aorta predominantly provides blood supply to the upper abdominal cavity and its contents. Its major branches include the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery. The first major branch, which comes off anteriorly at the T12 level, is the celiac trunk. It supplies oxygen-rich blood to the spleen, and structures derived from the embryonic foregut. The celiac trunk is a critical artery whose anatomy can vary, and therefore, intricate knowledge of its branches and variations is important in facilitating radiographic interpretations and in limiting surgical complications.
