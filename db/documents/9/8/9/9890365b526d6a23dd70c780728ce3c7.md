Peripheral arthritis is a common manifestation of numerous diseases. Exclusion of infections is paramount for any acutely inflamed joint. Lyme arthritis can mimic the onset of peripheral spondyloarthritis and may present similarly with inflammatory knee pain. Viral infections may frequently cause self-limited arthritis and should be an option in patients with less than six weeks of symptoms. Crystalline arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis may present similarly to peripheral spondyloarthritis but may often get excluded by synovial fluid analysis and serologic evaluation.

Non-inflammatory axial arthralgia, particularly osteoarthritis in the lower back or shoulder, hips, and knees, frequently cause pain and stiffness. However, degenerative arthritis presentations typically involve patients over age 40, are not usually associated with nocturnal pain in the second half of the night, and often worsen with exertion. Other differentials include malignancies, particularly multiple myeloma, central pain syndromes, hypothyroidism, and hypercalcemia.

Uveitis has many causes; common infectious causes include herpes simplex, herpes zoster, CMV, and toxoplasmosis, as well as less common infections, including tuberculosis and syphilis. Behcet disease, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, relapsing polychondritis, Sjogren syndrome, sarcoidosis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis cause uveitis as well.
