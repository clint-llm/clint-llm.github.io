The umbilical cord is the vital connection between the fetus and the placenta. Without this connection, the fetus would be unable to receive oxygen and nutrients from the mother or remove carbon dioxide and other waste products.

Possible adverse outcomes of umbilical cord abnormalities include intrauterine growth restriction, preterm labor, fetal distress and asphyxia, and even intrauterine fetal demise.
