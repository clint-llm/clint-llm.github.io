Strain-counterstrain (SCS) of the cervical vertebrae is an indirect technique utilized primarily by osteopathic physicians for the treatment of neck pain and other somatic dysfunctions within the cervical region. Considering at least half of all individuals experience neck pain at some point in their life, SCS is regarded as a gentle and conservative treatment alternative for these patients. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of neck pain and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo strain-counterstrain (SCS) of the cervical vertebrae.
