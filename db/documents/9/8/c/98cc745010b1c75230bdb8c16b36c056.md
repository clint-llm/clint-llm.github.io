Aerobic glycolysis is a series of reactions wherein oxygen is required to reoxidize NADH to NAD+, hence the name. This ten-step process begins with a molecule of glucose and ends up with two molecules of pyruvate

Step 1: When a molecule of glucose enters the cell, it is immediately phosphorylated by the enzyme hexokinase to glucose-6-phosphate using the phosphate from the hydrolysis of ATP. This irreversible step serves to trap the glucose molecule within the cell. Hexokinase has broad specificity and can phosphorylate all six-carbon sugars, including glucose. In the liver and beta cells of the pancreas, an isozyme form glucokinase exists and solely phosphorylates glucose.

Step 2: Glucose-6-phosphate (aldose) is isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate (ketose) catalyzed by phosphoglucose isomerase. This reaction is readily reversible.

Step 3: Fructose-6-phosphate is phosphorylated to fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate by the enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1). This is an irreversible, rate-limiting regulatory step. This committed step is the second ATP consuming step in glycolysis.

Step 4: Cleavage of fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate results in the formation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) by the enzyme aldolase in this unregulated, reversible reaction. Aldolase B, an isomer form in the liver, cleaves fructose-1-phosphate (in fructose metabolism) in addition to fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate.

Step 5: Interconversion of DHAP and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is carried out by triose phosphate isomerase. This isomerization results in producing of two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.

Step 6: Oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is catalyzed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and leads to the synthesis of 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate. This is the first oxidation-reduction step in glycolysis where NAD+ is reduced to NADH, while the aldehyde group of glyceraldehyde -3-phosphate is oxidized to a carboxyl group coupled to the attachment of a phosphate group. Limited quantities of NAD+ in cells require the reoxidation of NADH back to NAD+. During aerobic conditions, NADH is reoxidized to NAD+ in the mitochondria, and during anaerobic conditions, it is regenerated by lactate dehydrogenase.

Step 7: Formation of 3-phosphoglycerate from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) is the first ATP generating step in glycolysis. The phosphate group attached during the formation of 1,3-BPG in the previous step is used to phosphorylate ADP with the help of phosphoglycerate kinase, thereby generating ATP. This substrate-level phosphorylation generates 2 ATPs. Some of the 1,3-BPG is also converted to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) by bisphosphoglycerate mutase, an important product that helps oxygen delivery to cells. Normally 2,3-BPG is present in trace quantities, but its production will increase during hypoxic conditions.

Step 8: Next, a reversible isomerization reaction of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate is carried out by phosphoglycerate mutase, where the phosphate group is shifted from the third carbon to the second carbon of phosphoglycerate.

Step 9: 2-phosphoglycerate is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate, which contains the high-energy enol phosphate.

Step 10: The final step in glycolysis is the enzymatic conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase. Substrate level phosphorylation occurs in this irreversible step to generate 2 molecules of ATP.

From here, the pyruvate can go through an aerobic route to the mitochondria or anaerobic route to form lactic acid. Irrespective of the path (aerobic or anaerobic) taken, glycolysis results in a net gain of two molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose.
