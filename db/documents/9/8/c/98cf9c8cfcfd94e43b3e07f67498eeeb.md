The cesarean section is a complicated procedure. Appropriate tissue handling, adequate hemostasis, avoiding tissue ischemia, and preventing infection are essential for wound healing and reducing subsequent adhesion formation. During the surgery itself, several techniques are utilizable at each step or tissue layer. Many factors contribute to a surgeon’s decisions on technique. As with any aspect of medical practice, basing those decisions on evidence is recommended.

**Cesarean Delivery Techniques**

- Pfannenstiel-Kerr method

- Joel-Cohen method

- Misgav-Ladach method

- Modified Misgav-Ladach method

Before cesarean, the pubic hair may be removed or not. Those advocating for hair removal claim a decrease in surgical site contamination and infection. However, a Cochrane review did not show lower infection rates with hair removal. Therefore, hair removal should only occur if it provides improved visualization. If opting for hair removal, it should be with clippers rather than razors. Patients should also be discouraged from shaving their pubic area as they approach their due dates or schedule cesarean dates. Shaving with a razor may cause microscopic skin breaks that are associated with more surgical site infections compared to clipping.

The initial skin incision can be made either in a suprapubic transverse or midline vertical fashion. A vertical midline incision is considered to provide faster access to the abdominal cavity, and it disrupts fewer tissue layers and vessels, leading to many citations as the preferred method to perform an emergency cesarean.

A Pfannenstiel skin incision is slightly curved and is located 2 to 3 centimeters or 2 fingerbreadths above the symphysis pubis. The midportion of the incision is within the hair-bearing area of the mons. The hair should be removed in this case. A Joel-Cohen incision, in contrast, is straight rather than curved. It is 3 cm below the line connecting the anterior superior iliac spines, making it more cephalad than a Pfannenstiel skin incision.

The subcutaneous layer is next, and it can be dissected bluntly or sharply. Blood vessels course through this layer, so care should be taken to minimize blood loss by limiting sharp dissection to the midline until the fascia is reached, then bluntly dissecting laterally. Alternatively, judicious use of cautery can maintain hemostasis if blood vessels are transected.

The fascia is then incised in the midline with the scalpel, and this incision is extended laterally either sharply or bluntly. The fascia may then be dissected off the underlying rectus muscles. To accomplish this dissection, both the superior and inferior aspects of the fascia are sequentially grasped with a clamp (such as a Kocher), and dissection can be accomplished with a combination of blunt technique as well as sharply using scissors or cautery. Care is necessary not to damage the underlying rectus muscles. Although, in some clinical scenarios, the rectus muscles may be deliberately cut to provide better surgical access.

One small randomized control trial investigated dissection compared to non-dissection of the fascia from the rectus muscles. Nondissection was associated with a slower decline in hemoglobin levels postoperatively and less pain on a visual analog scale. However, surgical time and difficulty of delivery of the fetus were not evaluated. Therefore, this study may not be sufficient impetus to change surgical technique.

After separating the rectus muscles in the midline, entry into the abdominal cavity is achieved by opening the peritoneum. The surgeon can do this either sharply or bluntly. If utilizing sharp entry, care should be taken to avoid injury to underlying structures such as the bowel. Once the entry is achieved, the peritoneal incision is usually extended bluntly. Care is necessary to prevent injury to the bladder during the extension of the peritoneal incision.

A bladder blade is often placed at this point to provide visualization of the lower uterine segment. Alternatively, a self-retaining retractor is an option. The bladder flap can be created at this point if so desired; the peritoneum overlying the bladder and lower uterine segment is grasped and incised, and the bladder is dissected off the lower uterus sharply or bluntly. Surgeons choosing to create a bladder flap do so out of a desire to decrease surgical injury to the bladder, especially during repair of the uterine incision.

With adequate visualization, whether or not a bladder flap has been created, the uterine incision can now be made. The uterus incision can be either transverse or vertical. For most cesareans, a low transverse incision is preferable. Compared to a classical incision, and low transverse incision causes less bleeding, is easier to repair, and causes less adhesion formation.

A low vertical hysterotomy may be an option if a problematic extraction of a fetus is anticipated, especially in the case of breech presentation. A low transverse incision can also be extended vertically to create a “T,” “U,” or “J” incision to provide additional room. A patient who has had a transverse or low vertical uterine incision may be a candidate for a trial of labor in subsequent pregnancies, whereas a prior classical or “T” incision are indications for repeat cesarean delivery.

Before making the hysterotomy, the uterus can be palpated to identify any lateral rotation. Making the hysterotomy in the midline rather than laterally can help the surgeon to avoid damaging the uterine vessels, especially if making a transverse incision. The incision is made carefully with a scalpel in shallow strokes, sometimes in combination with blunt dissection, taking care not to injure the fetus. If the patient has been pushing, making the incision high in the surgical field nevertheless creates a low transverse incision and decreases the risk of extension into lateral vessels, the lower uterus, or the cervix.

Upon achieving uterine entry, the uterine incision can be extended laterally either bluntly with fingers or sharply with bandage scissors. Blunt extension of the uterine incision is preferred if possible, as a sharp extension is associated with increased maternal morbidity and blood loss. A blunt cephalad-caudad extension of the hysterotomy, compared to a blunt transversal extension, decreases unintended extension and significant blood loss.

If the uterine myometrium is thick, as in earlier gestations or a classical hysterotomy, the bandage scissors may be necessary. An inadequate hysterotomy may increase the risk of difficult fetal extraction, which, in turn, may lead to an increase in neonatal morbidity or mortality. Safe delivery of the fetus is the ultimate goal of cesarean delivery, regardless of the details of the technique.

Delivery of the fetus in the vertex presentation is achieved by inserting a hand into the uterine cavity and elevating the fetal head into the hysterotomy. If the head cannot be elevated, an assistant may provide additional elevation from below via a hand in the patient’s vagina. Alternatively, a vacuum cup or a single forceps blade may be utilized to elevate the fetal head. After elevating the fetal head into the incision, the bladder blade is removed, and fundal pressure is applied to expel the fetus out of the uterus. The surgeon continues to guide the head gently during the process, and the surgical assistant may be instrumental in providing most of the fundal pressure. If fundal pressure is inadequate, or if it cannot be adequately achieved (such as significant maternal obesity), a vacuum cup can be applied to the fetal head for an assisted delivery. Forceps can also be placed at the time of cesarean delivery. The usual rules apply when utilizing vacuum or forceps, even in cesarean delivery.

If the fetus is in the breech presentation, the surgeon identifies the fetal lie by palpation inside the uterine cavity. There are several techniques for delivering a breech fetus, either by grasping the feet or the hips to bring the fetus into the hysterotomy. The fetus can be delivered to the level of the shoulders with gentle traction, sometimes with the assistance of a surgical towel around the fetus. The bilateral arms are sequentially swept down and delivered. Fundal pressure is then utilized to help flex and deliver the fetal head. The Mauriceau Smellie Veit maneuver may also be used to flex the fetal head; this involves placing the first and third fingers of one hand on fetal cheekbones, placing the second finger in the fetal mouth, and pulling the jaw down. The application of Piper forceps is rarely needed to deliver the fetal head.

After delivery of the fetus, the umbilical cord is doubly clamped and cut. Cord clamping may delay if the maternal and fetal status allow, and if the surgeon desires. A systematic review of delayed umbilical cord clamping in preterm infants showed a reduction of in-hospital mortality, a reduced incidence of low Apgar scores at 1 minute but not 5 minutes, no change in other outcome measures (intubation, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, etc.), and a potential risk for induced polycythemia and hyperbilirubinemia.

After cutting the umbilical cord, cord blood can be collected if necessary or desired. The placenta is then delivered; this can be accomplished via manual removal or spontaneously via cord traction and fundal massage. Due to data showing a reduction in operative blood loss and a decrease in infections if spontaneous placental delivery is the chosen option, this technique is preferable if the clinical scenario allows.

For the repair of the hysterotomy, the uterus can be exteriorized or left in situ. Research has demonstrated similar rates of febrile complications and similar surgical time with the two techniques so that the decision can depend on surgeon preference.

The closure of the hysterotomy in one or two layers has been investigated. Short-term outcomes such as infectious morbidity, pain, blood transfusion, and hospital readmission were not different between the two techniques.

Once the uterus is closed, and hemostasis assured, the posterior cul-de-sac is cleared of blood and clot using laparotomy sponges and/or suction. This step may be omitted if the uterus has not been exteriorized. With the uterus returned to the abdomen, the abdomen again gets cleared of blood and clot. The assistance of various retractors may provide exposure of the paracolic gutters. Intrabdominal irrigation before closure has been shown to increase nausea during the surgery and did not improve the return of gastrointestinal function or incidence of infectious morbidity. With the bladder blade reinserted, the hysterotomy repair is again visualized and made hemostatic if necessary. The bladder blade is again removed.

The peritoneum can be reapproximated at this time. Closure of the peritoneum adds operative time, and it may increase postoperative fever and length of hospital stay. The decision to close this layer often hinges on the surgeon’s interpretation of the literature regarding whether closure decreases adhesion formation. Unfortunately, this data is mixed, and therefore, it is the surgeon’s prerogative to balance the risks and benefits to the patient.

Before the closure of the fascia, the rectus muscles and the subfascial tissues are inspected to ensure hemostasis. The rectus muscles can be reapproximated in advance of fascial closure. Some surgeons believe that suturing the muscles reduces the risk of subsequent diastasis recti and decreases the incidence of intra-abdominal adhesion formation.

The fascia is then closed using a delayed-absorbable suture in a running nonlocking fashion. Historically, the fascia has been closed by some in an interrupted fashion, but this technique is no longer widely used. Using a monofilament rather than a braided suture may decrease the risk of infection and should be considered in patients at higher risk of developing this complication.

The subcutaneous tissues are then irrigated, and hemostasis is assured. Interestingly, wound irrigation has not been shown to decrease infection rates. However, it may help to visualize better any areas requiring cautery. Closure of the subcutaneous space is recommended if the thickness is 2 cm or more, as this decreases the risk of hematoma, seroma, wound infection, and wound separation.

Skin closure may be accomplished using a variety of methods, the most common being surgical staples or subcuticular suture. There are also subcuticular absorbable staples and adhesive glues on the market. Research has shown both suture and staples to be similar with regards to cosmesis. Though the data is conflicting, studies show subcuticular suture closure to be superior to staples regarding wound separation and wound infection.
