In the United States, there are currently two FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies that inhibit the action of PCSK9: alirocumab and evolocumab.

FDA has approved alirocumab for adults with an established or high risk of cardiovascular disease and adults with familial hypercholesterolemia.

- To reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and unstable angina requiring hospitalization in adults with established cardiovascular disease.

- As an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with other LDL-C lowering therapies, for treating adults with primary hyperlipidemia, including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, to reduce LDL C.

- As an adjunct to diet and other LDL-C lowering therapies in adults with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia to reduce LDL-C.

FDA has approved evolocumab for adults with an established or high risk of cardiovascular disease and adults and pediatric patients older than 10 years of age with familial hypercholesterolemia.

- To reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization in adults with established cardiovascular disease.

- As an adjunct to diet, alone or combined with other LDL-C lowering therapies for treating adults with primary hyperlipidemia including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia to reduce LDL-C.

- As an adjunct to diet and other LDL-C-lowering therapies in pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, to reduce LDL-C

- As an adjunct to other LDL-C-lowering therapies in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, to reduce LDL-C

FDA has approved inclisiran for adults

- As an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who require additional lowering of LDL-C

- As an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who require additional lowering of LDL-C.
