The differential diagnosis of infantile Krabbe disease is broad and includes several neurodegenerative conditions that can present with neurodevelopmental delay and white matter abnormalities on neuroimaging studies:

- Alexander disease

- Canavan disease

- GM2 gangliosidoses

- Metachromatic leukodystrophy

- Sphingomyelinase deficiency

Although distinguishing Krabbe disease from the disorders mentioned above can be challenging, a definitive diagnosis can be made based on targeted metabolic and molecular genetic testing.
