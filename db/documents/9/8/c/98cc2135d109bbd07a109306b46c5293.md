Since the approval of the nasal balloon device, much debate has taken place regarding the appropriate indications for the use of balloon sinuplasty. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation Board of Directors (AAO-HNSF) presented its most current guidelines in 2017. The main indication for balloon sinuplasty is CRSsNP refractory to medical treatment with a positive computed tomography (CT) scan of the sinuses showing mucosal thickening and obstruction. BSP may also be used as an adjunct procedure to functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) in patients with CRSsNP. Other proposed indications include recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) with CT evidence of sinus disease and barosinusitis.

There are currently no specific indications for the option of BSP in an office setting per the AAO-HNSF.
