The most commonly believed etiology of conjoined twinning is either partial fission or secondary fusion. Both of these processes can be used to explain the embryological and anatomical findings observed in conjoined twins. However, the fission and fusion theories do not unequivocally account for every possible conjunction and cannot be applied to the full spectrum of findings in conjoined twins. Conjoined twins can be broadly categorized into non-dorsally conjoined twins (which includes ventral, lateral, and caudal conjunction) and dorsally conjoined twins.

Non-dorsal conjunction may have a varied presentation but typically demonstrates a single shared umbilical cord along with the sharing of organs. The dorsal conjunction presents with two umbilical cords and mostly separate internal organs. It is proposed that non-dorsal conjunction may be initiated by duplication of the axial primordia, which leads to a change in the axial orientation and/or interaction aplasia. Dorsal conjunction may occur because of secondary fusion of initially separate monozygotic twins.
