Primary hyperaldosteronism is the most common cause of secondary hypertension and occurs in about 6% to 20% of adult hypertensive patients, higher in patients with resistant hypertension. The prevalence of 10% was noted when consecutive patients with hypertension were evaluated. However, the prevalence increased to 30% when aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) was used as a screening method in general practice.

Aldosterone-producing adenomaÂ is present in 50% to 60%, and the remaining is idiopathic or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. It is about two times more common in women than in men.
