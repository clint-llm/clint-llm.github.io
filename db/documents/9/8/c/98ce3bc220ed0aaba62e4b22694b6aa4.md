Myocardial infarction (MI) remains the leading cause of death worldwide.

Classification of anterior myocardial infarction is based on EKG findings as follows:

- Anteroseptal – ST-segment elevation in leads V1 to V4

- Anteroapical (or mid-anterior) – ST-segment elevation in leads V3-V4

- Anterolateral – ST-segment elevation in leads V3 to V6

- Extensive anterior – ST-segment elevation in leads V1 to V6
