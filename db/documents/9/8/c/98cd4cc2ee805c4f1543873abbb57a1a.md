The melanoacanthoma is a benign epithelial lesion. To date, there has not been any observation of malignant transformation. Similarly, in contrast to seborrheic keratoses, which can occur adjacent to or above a skin cancer, there has been no report of a cutaneous collision tumor consisting of a melanoacanthoma and a malignant skin neoplasm.

Although most melanoacanthomas grow slowly, they can become giant, measuring over 10 cm in greatest diameter. Also, albeit less common, some melanoacanthoma has been noted to grow rapidly. In either of these settings, the lesion can become irritated and tender from rubbing against the adjacent skin or the overlying clothing.

Rarely, a larger melanoacanthoma may spontaneously ulcerate. In one woman, the melanoacanthoma on her back ulcerated and thick yellow-colored pus drained from the lesion. She had difficulty lying down, and the situation did not resolve after multiple courses of antibiotics. Subsequently, excision and skin grafting was planned; however, she declined the surgery.
