The orthoptists, optometrists, and ophthalmologists are all actively involved and expected to understand the basics of prisms, the effects of prism in glasses, and the prismatic effect created by glass displacement in spectacles. After a detailed evaluation, it is essential to give the correct prescription and dispense the prisms with or without refractive correction.

One way to order prisms is by specifying the amount of prism required along with the direction of the prism's base. Example:

- Right - prism 3 UP 2out

- Left – prism 2 DN 2 out

An alternative method is to mention the direction of the prism using a 360-degree notation, where 0 is positioned towards the left of the lens, 90 superiorly, 180 right, and 270 inferiorly. So, the same prescription can be mentioned as:

- Right - prism 3 base 90 2 base 180

- Left – prism 2 base 270 2 base 0

Any refractive add for near or distance needs to be mentioned separately in the usual way of dispensing the spectacles.
