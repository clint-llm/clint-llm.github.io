All interprofessional healthcare team members should be familiar with Ringer's lactate and its indications. Ringer’s lactate is a versatile IV-fluid choice for resuscitation. Ringer’s lactate is superior to normal saline in many ways; however, at times avoided by clinicians due to the stigma of containing lactate. Again, the lactate in Ringer’s lactate is only a problem in patients who have liver dysfunction. In many clinical scenarios, lactate is a beneficial molecule, given its metabolism. Ringer’s lactate is surprisingly cost-effective, better understood, and much more studied than the newer buffered solution and has a role in many illnesses as a strong choice for physiologic fluid replacement. The solution is safe; the only drawback results not from electrolyte changes but the fluid overload that may occur. Hence attention should be paid to the amount of volume infused.
