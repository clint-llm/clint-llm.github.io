The jugular foramen syndrome (JFS) (Vernet syndrome) refers to paralysis of the IX, X, and XI cranial nerves traversing the jugular foramen. Safe resection is the treatment of choice in benign tumors. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of jugular foramen syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing and improving care for patients with this condition. An interprofessional approach is vital in the radical excision of large paragangliomas with intracranial extension.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with jugular foramen syndrome.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with jugular foramen syndrome.
- Identify the treatment and management options available for jugular foramen syndrome.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by jugular foramen syndrome.
