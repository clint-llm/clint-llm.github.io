It is estimated that anywhere from 25% to 45% of the adult population suffers from long-term pain, which results in a poor quality of life, loss of productive time, and the constant need to take some pain medication (AAPM, 2017). The indirect costs of managing this patient population are enormous due to repeated visits to the emergency room, recurrent admissions and undergoing a variety of costly pain relieving treatments/procedures. One of the most common types of drugs used to treat moderate to severe pain due to non-cancer and cancer causes are the opioids. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of narcotic bowel syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of narcotic bowel syndrome.
- Recall the presentation of narcotic bowel syndrome.
- List the treatment and management options available for narcotic bowel syndrome.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with narcotic bowel syndrome.
