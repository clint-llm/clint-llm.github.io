**Types:**

There are different devices in operation for stereotactic radiosurgery, which differ in both the type of radiation delivered and the method of focusing the beams to the target.

Ionizing radiation is electromagnetic or particulate radiation, which can produce ions when passing through matter. A photon is a discrete packet of electromagnetic energy and includes radio waves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, and X-rays depending on the energy level. X-rays are the only type of photon capable of producing ions, and therefore can be used for SRS. Photon beams can be generated from radioisotope sources (at present, cobalt-60) or from x-ray generating machines (the linear accelerator). Radioactive isotopes are atoms with unstable nuclei that emit ionizing radiation through radioactive decay to stabilize themselves.

Focused gamma beams are the simplest and older stereotactic radiosurgery device, first used on in 1967.

The cobalt sources are arranged in a spherical array via collimator helmets to focus the beams to converge at a single target, which can generate ‘hot spots’ within the treatment volume.

Linear accelerator radiosurgery was introduced clinically in the early 1980s.

Another system is intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), a linear accelerator-based application which can vary the shape and intensity of the beam; this allows non-uniform dose distribution with steep dose gradients between target volumes and normal brain tissue.

Protons, which are positively charged particles found in the nucleus of an atom, are used for particulate radiosurgery. A synchrotron or cyclotron-based device can generate proton beams by ionizing hydrogen. The proton beam can have energy between 20 and 190MeV depending on the device.

To date, no randomized controlled trial exists to compare devices, so physician expertise and machine availability guide practice. Comparative studies are inconclusive, although commonly demonstrate equivalence.

**Dosimetry**:

Dosimetry is a vital but difficult component of SRS. With SRS, small fields are used, typically 0.3 x 0.3 cm up to 4 x 4 cm. By definition, a small field is when at least one of three conditions are satisfied: (1) loss of lateral charged particle equilibrium on the beam axis; (2) partial occlusion of the photon source by the collimator; (3) the size of the detector is similar or larger than the beam dimensions.

The use of the IAEA/AAPM (International Atomic Energy Agency/American Association of Physicists in Medicine) protocol for reference and relative dosimetry based on Alfonso et al. (2008) is recommended.

The dose is in gray (Gy), which is the absorption of one joule of radiation energy per kilogram of matter. The SRS dose is biologically equivalent to five to six weeks of daily conventional radiation therapy.

FSR is usable for eloquent areas, for larger lesions and for lesions close to critical structures (e.g., the optic chiasm, ventral cochlear nucleus, and the brain stem which have lower tolerance).

Deciding on SRS or FSR for brain metastases is multifactorial. Physical factors (tumor size, margins, optimal dose, etc), biological factors (histology of the metastases, use of systemic agents) and clinical factors (life expectancy, co-morbidities, concurrent treatments required) all play a role in decision making.
