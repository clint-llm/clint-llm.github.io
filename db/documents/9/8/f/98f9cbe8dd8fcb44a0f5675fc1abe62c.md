Chloramphenicol is a synthetically manufactured broad-spectrum antibiotic. It was initially isolated from the bacteria Streptomyces venezuelae in 1948Â and was the first bulk produced synthetic antibiotic.

Indications for its use include superficial eye infections (bacterial conjunctivitis), and otitis externa. It is also reserved for severe infections, such as rickettsial diseases, meningitis caused by Haemophilus Influenza, Neisseria meningitidis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae, or in typhoid fever caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi.

Chloramphenicol ointments are also used perioperatively as prophylaxis for surgical wound infections. This therapy is often necessary for plastic surgery and eye surgery.

However, despite these indications, chloramphenicol should only be initiated if there is known susceptibility to the drug, and when other less dangerous antimicrobials are ineffective, not tolerated or contraindicated. Moreover, in vitro sensitivity tests have to be done to discontinue the medication as soon as other less dangerous antimicrobials demonstrate therapeutic effectiveness.
