Ascaris lumbricoides, a soil-transmitted large nematode, causes Ascariasis. The female adult can reach up to 20 cm to 30 cm in length, and adult males up to 15 cm to 20 cm. The nematodes are pink/yellow/white roundworms. The female worms are thicker and have a straight rear end. The male worm is more slender with a ventrally incurvated rear end with two retractile copulating spicules. The average life of the adult parasite is one year, after which it dies, and it is spontaneously eliminated as it evacuates through the digestive tract. This is the reason why a spontaneous cure of disease can happen if there is no reinfection. Adult worms do not multiply in the human host.
