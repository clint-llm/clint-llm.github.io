There are many causes of chylothorax, and its management is complex. Thus, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that consists of a pulmonologist, thoracic surgeon, dietitian, internist, and an intensivist. Initially, the treatment is conservative, but if the leak does not stop, surgery is required. New surgical techniques like pleurovenous or pleuroperitoneal shunting and thoracic duct embolization have been used with success. Most patients benefit from a staged care plan, from least invasive options to more invasive techniques. Overall, the outcome for chylothorax from benign causes is good, but in cases of malignancy, the outcomes are poor.
