The colloid cyst is a benign growth usually located in the third ventricle and at or near the foramen of Monroe, which is at the anterior aspect of the third ventricle of the brain.

Colloid cysts can cause various symptoms, including headaches, diplopia, memory issues, and vertigo. Rarely colloid cysts have been cited as a cause of sudden death. When colloid cysts are symptomatic, they most commonly cause headaches, nausea, and vomiting secondary to obstructive hydrocephalus. The obstructive hydrocephalus is precipitated by blocking the egress of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the lateral ventricles at the foramen of Monro, which connects the lateral and third ventricles.
