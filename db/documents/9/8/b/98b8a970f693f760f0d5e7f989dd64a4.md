Primary Sjogren syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disorder commonly presenting with dryness involving the eyes and mouth due to inflammation and resultant pathology of the lacrimal and salivary glands. Up to one-half of affected individuals also develop extra-glandular involvement in organs such as the joints, skin, lungs, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, nervous system, and kidneys. This condition is frequently associated with other autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Sjogren syndrome is managed by replacing moisture at affected glandular sites and diminishing the autoimmune response locally as well as systemically. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Sjogren syndrome and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe how patients with Sjogren syndrome will most likely present.
- Identify the pathophysiology of Sjogren's disease and the most common presentation.
- Outline the treatment of Sjogren syndrome.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team in enhancing the delivery of care in those with Sjogren syndrome.
