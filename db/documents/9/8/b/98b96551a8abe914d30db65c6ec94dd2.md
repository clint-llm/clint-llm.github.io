An array of equipment and tools is required to perform tympanocentesis successfully; they include:

- A Jobson Horne probe

- Otologic microscope

- Topical anesthesia (4% lidocaine can be instilled into the EAC; alternatively micro-cotton balls can be created and soaked in phenol or 4% cocaine solutions to anesthetize the precise tympanocentesis site)

- A 1cc to 3cc aspirating syringe

- Sterile culture swabs and culture media

- A 3 inch 20 or 21 Gauge spinal needle with a tympanocentesis aspirator

- Appropriate procedural chair and procedural restraint board as needed

- Examination speculum with varying sizes

- A functional vacuum pump or wall suction

- A wax spoon or curette

- Other types of equipment such as tissue wicks, cotton balls, 3% hydrogen peroxide, iontophoresis devices, and electrodes may also be needed
