The virus is an RNA virus of the genus Flavivirus, closely related to the viruses that cause West Nile, St. Louis, and Japanese encephalitis. Tree-hole breeding mosquitoes, such as Aedes aegypti and Haemagogous species, transmit yellow fever during the rainy season. The yellow fever virus has three distinct transmission cycles: jungle, intermediate, and urban. The jungle cycle involves transmission between non-human primates (monkeys) and mosquitoes. Humans are infected through infected mosquitoÂ bites while visiting or working in the jungle. The intermediate cycle occurs in the African savannah and involves humans who live or work in jungle border areas. Transmission may be between monkeys and humans or humans via mosquito vectors. The urban cycle involves a viremic human who contracted the virus in either the jungle or intermediate cycle who then returns to an urban area. Humans develop significant viremia to infect mosquitoes, which can then transmit the virus to other humans in urban areas. Person to person or primate to human transmission has not been reported without the involvement of a mosquito vector.
