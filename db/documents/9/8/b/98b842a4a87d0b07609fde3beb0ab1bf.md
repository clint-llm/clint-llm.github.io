Fitzpatrick skin types have long been the favored method of classifying an individual’s skin color based on their specific reactions to sun exposure. Clinically, these designations have been employed to estimate dosages, assess cancer risk, or guide counseling (Figures 1 & 2). However, this system has been recognized as ineffectual in certain populations, especially those with darker, non-Caucasian ethnic skin. These individuals are at greater risk of post-procedural pigmentary and scarring-related adverse effects. Thus the accurate determination of Fitzpatrick skin types has important therapeutic consequences. Numerous attempts to create an objective determination of an individual’s skin type have been made; while none are yet considered a gold standard, reflectance spectrophotometers constitute an efficient and noninvasive alternative with a proven record of success.
