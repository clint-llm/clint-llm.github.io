BCG vaccination policy is determined by the regional prevalence of tuberculosis infection. Routine neonatal vaccination is recommended by the WHO in countries with moderate to the severe incidence of tuberculosis. Conversion of tuberculin skin test should not be used to determine the efficacy of the BCG vaccine among recipients.

Routine BCG vaccination is not generally recommended in the United States due to a low incidence of tuberculosis infection and also due to interference of immunization with the PPD test. BCG vaccination is not recommended for health care workers in low-risk areas. Vaccination is also contraindicated in immunosuppressed patients.

BCG vaccination may be considered in situations where a high percentage of patients are infected with TB strains that are resistant to isoniazid and rifampin. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is likely.
