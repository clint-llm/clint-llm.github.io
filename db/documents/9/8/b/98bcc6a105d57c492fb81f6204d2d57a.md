The corticospinal tract originates primarily from the frontoparietal cortices, including the primary motor cortex, secondary motor area, and somatosensory cortex.

After leaving the brainstem and entering the spinal cord, the fibers run down through the anterior and lateral corticospinal tract. When they get to their target level, the fibers of the anterior corticospinal tract decussate through the anterior white commissure before synapsing to a neuron in the anterior horn of the gray matter. The lateral corticospinal tract fibers have previously decussated at the level of the pyramid and synapse at a neuron on the anterior horn when they get to the appropriateÂ level. These neurons, known as anterior horn cells, then project to the limbs and axial muscles to provide voluntary motor function.
