Bile acid sequestrants are administered orally as a prepared suspension or tablets, preferably at mealtime. It is recommended to be taken at various times during the day, depending on the resin and dosage form.

**Cholestyramine**

- It is available as a powder for oral suspension packets ( each containing 4 gm cholestyramine ) and a multidose powder for suspension container with scoop measurements for accurate dosing. The powder should be mixed with water or juice to avoid difficulty swallowing and avoid esophageal distress.

- The usual dose is 4 gm taken 1 to 2 times per day to lower LDL-C. Twice daily dosing is the recommendation, but it can be used up to 6 times daily. The dose can be increased slowly every one to two months. The usual maintenance dose is 8 to 16 gm daily. Maximum doses are 24 gm daily for treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia.

- In children, it can be administered as 240 mg/kg daily of anhydrous cholestyramine resin in two to three divided doses, usually not to exceed 8 gm per day.

**Colestipol**

- Colestipol is available as powder packet ( 5 gm ), granules packet ( 5 gm ), and oral tablets ( 1 gm ) of colestipol hydrochloride.

- It is administered as 2 g tablets once, or twice daily, and the dose can be increased by one tablet once or twice daily at 1 to 2-month intervals. The maximum dose is 20 gm daily.

- The recommended daily adult dose for colestipol is one to six packets or scoopfuls administered preferably in divided doses. Starting dose is one packet once or twice daily and should be increased by one dose per day every one to two months. Colestipol powders are mixed with water or juice to avoid esophageal distress and accidental inhalation.

- Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established.

**Colesevelam**

- It is available as 625 mg tablets or granules for oral suspension packets containing 3.75 gm colesevelam.

- The usual adult dosing is 3.75 g/day in 1 or 2 divided doses for diarrhea associated with bile acid malabsorption, hyperlipidemia, and/or T2DM.

- The FDA recently approved a form of colesevelam as a chewable bar intended for administration with meals. Maximum doses are 3.75 gm daily.

- Colesevelam use is safe and effective as monotherapy or with a statin were studied in children, 10 to 17 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). Due to the tablet size, colesevelam for oral suspension is preferred in this population. Dose adjustments are not needed when colesevelam is given to children 10 to 17 years old. Colesevelam use is not studied in children younger than ten years of age or premenarchal girls.

**Notes:**To minimize side effects, all bile acid-binding sequestering agents should be started at the lowest dose and titrated up gradually. Also, increasing fiber in the diet, such as bran and psyllium husk, can help with adherence. However, there tends to be poor adherence with large doses of bile acid sequestrants making bile acid sequestrants greater than 15 g two times daily ineffective.

**Specific Patient Population**

**Pregnant Women:**Bile acid sequestrants are pregnancy category C.  Limited data is available on its use in pregnant women and is insufficient to determine its safety in pregnant patients with hypercholesterolemia. Use if only potential benefits outweigh potential risks. Also, regular prenatal vitamins might not be sufficient while on bile acid-binding sequestering agents as their use interferes with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.

**Breastfeeding Patients:**As bile acid sequestrants are not absorbed systemically following oral administration, breastfed babies are not exposed to them with maternal use of these agents.

**Hepatic Impairment:**There is no information on their use in patients with hepatic impairment.

**Renal Impairment:**Since bile acid sequestrants are chloride forms of anions exchange resin, they may produce hyperchloremic acidosis when used for prolonged periods. It is especially true when relative doses are higher, i.e., in younger and smaller patients. Caution when used in patients with volume depletion, renal insufficiency, or in patients receiving concomitant spironolactone.
