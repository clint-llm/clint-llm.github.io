The most common presentation of megaloblastic anemia is an asymptomatic incidental finding on routine laboratory testing. Usually, anemia develops gradually, and symptoms are present only in severely anemic patients. Common symptoms include weakness, shortness of breath (primarily with exertion), palpitation, and lightheadedness. Physical examination may reveal pallor, tachycardia, functional heart murmur, Hunter glossitis, and splenomegaly. Jaundice can occur from intramedullary hemolysis.

There are someÂ minor differences between the clinical manifestations caused by cobalamin deficiency and folic acid deficiency. In vitamin B12 deficiency, neurological manifestations are observable. The main symptoms are paresthesia and balance disorders. Patients with vitamin B12 deficiency may present lancinating pains caused by peripheral neuropathy, mainly affecting the lower extremities. Less frequently, there may be a development of visual disturbances caused by optic atrophy. The clinical exam usually shows a loss of vibratory sense and proprioception with a positive Romberg test. Babinski reflex, hyporeflexia, and clonus are less frequent. Moreover, there are psychological disturbances that include a form of dementia. These neurological disorders may not be completely reversible after replacement therapy.

Pernicious anemia frequently has associations with other autoimmune conditions such as autoimmune thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, and vitiligo.
