Many patients may choose natural family planning. For some patients, religion may play a part in the decision to utilize natural family planning.

Lack of awareness and education may impact the utilization of natural family planning. In one survey of physicians in the United States, a third did not even mention natural family planning to patients and 40% only discussed natural family planning with select women.
