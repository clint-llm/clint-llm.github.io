Trihexyphenidyl works as an anticholinergic and is used for the treatment of tremors, spasms, stiffness, and weak muscle control seen in patients with Parkinson disease. It can also be used to prevent or treat similar muscular conditions which are caused by certain central nervous system (CNS) drugs such as fluphenazine, haloperidol, and chlorpromazine. The FDA approved it for managing all types of parkinsonism (idiopathic, postencephalitic, and arteriosclerotic) in June 2003. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring, of trihexyphenidyl so providers can direct patient therapy as indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of trihexyphenidyl.
- Summarize the adverse event profile of trihexyphenidyl.
- Review the toxicity and misuse potential for trihexyphenidyl.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team and how it can enhance patient care with trihexyphenidyl therapy to improve patient outcomes for patients with Parkinsonism.
