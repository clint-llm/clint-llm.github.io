Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) inhibit the action of the enzyme aromatase. Aromatase (estrogen synthetase) is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of monooxygenases and catalyzes the demethylation of androgens' carbon 19, producing phenolic 18-carbon estrogens.

In premenopausal women, AIs induce an increase in gonadotropin secretion secondary to the reduced negative feedback of estrogen to the pituitary, resulting in ovarian stimulation. Clinicians can use AIs to induce ovulation in the treatment of infertility.

In men, estrogen excess shows an association with premature closure of the epiphyses. Aromatase inhibitors decrease estrogen by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to estrogen and have therefore been used in patients with short stature and/or constitutional delay of puberty. Lowering estrogen levels is associated with an increase in LH, FSH, and testosterone. Therefore aromatase inhibitors have also been used in late-onset hypogonadism or partial androgen deficiency. In obese men, there is an increased conversion of androgens to estrogen in the adipose tissue, leading to increased estrogen levels. Aromatase inhibitors also decrease this conversion causing decreased estrogen and increased testosterone and FSH in men with obesity-related hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and male subfertility.
