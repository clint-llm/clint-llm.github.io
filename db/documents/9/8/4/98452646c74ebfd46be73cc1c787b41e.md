Trismus refers to the restriction of the range of motion of the jaw. Initially described in the setting of tetanus, it currently refers to restricted mouth opening due to any etiology. It is usually temporary and typically resolves in less than two weeks, but permanent trismus may also occur, interfering with everyday activities such as speaking, eating, and swallowing and complicating oral hygiene and the delivery of dental procedures.
