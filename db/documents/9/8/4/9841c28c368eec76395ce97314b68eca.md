Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed antidepressants. Other clinical indications for SSRI use include anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorders, and eating disorders. Compared to their predecessors, the monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs are associated with fewer toxic effects. This activity describes the uses, mode of action and adverse effects of SSRIs and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mode of action of the SSRIs.
- Review the toxic effects of SSRIs.
- Summarize the treatment options of SSRI toxicity.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with SSRI toxicity.
