The equipment required for an abdominoperineal resection depends on whether the procedure is being performed via open or minimal access (laparoscopic or robotic). Regardless of approach, an operating table capable of adjusting for lithotomy and prone jack-knife positions is essential. For an open procedure, the extent of instruments can vary but will typically include a scalpel (usually size 10 blade), monopolar and bipolar cautery, retractor, toothed forceps, Fraser-Kelly clips, McIndoe scissors, and suction. In laparoscopic surgery, other equipment required includes monitor screens, gas insufflator, camera scope (10 mm, 30-degree angled scope), laparoscopic instruments, endoscopic linear stapler, and advanced sealing devices (Harmonic, Ligasure).
