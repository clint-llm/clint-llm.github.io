Insulinoma is a type of functional neuroendocrine tumor characterized by hypersecretion of insulin, causing hypoglycemia. It typically presents as a solitary benign tumor but can be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). Patients with insulinoma have hypoglycemic episodes, more characteristically as fasting hypoglycemia. Insulinoma is usually diagnosed by biochemical testing. Surgical resection is the preferred treatment choice. This activity reviews the manifestations, evaluation, and treatment of insulinoma and highlights the importance of an interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical presenting symptoms of insulinoma. 
- Review the evaluation of insulinoma, including appropriate biochemical tests and localization modalities.
- Summarize the management of insulinoma. 
- Outline the importance of collaboration of an interprofessional team in managing insulinoma to improve the patient quality of care.
