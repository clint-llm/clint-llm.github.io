Prader Willi syndrome is a complex genetic disorder that is caused by a defect in chromosome 15. Pediatricians need to suspect this diagnosis when a neonate demonstrates hypotonia because it can lead to several complications, including difficulty feeding and failure to thrive.

Following the diagnosis, it is crucial to incorporate an interprofessional team such as geneticist, endocrinologist, developmental specialist, a nutritionist that can provide an integrated approach, and they will monitor disease progression, complications. They will evaluate the need for early initiation of therapy to achieve better outcomes. A board-certified clinical pharmacist should be on board for the dosing of hormonal replacement and augmentation. Nursing staff can monitor and record the patient's response to therapy at each visit, charting results so the clinical team can make modifications to the regimen as needed. A mental health nurse may also be a crucial component of an overall interprofessional care plan. This interprofessional team approach is necessary to optimize outcomes, patient quality of life, and longevity in patients with Prader Willi syndrome. [Level 5]
