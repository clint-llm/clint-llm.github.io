Pauci-immune necrotizing granulomas are seen in small and medium-sized blood vessels.

- Lung: Granulomas surrounded by palisading histiocytes and giant cells with central necrosis. This leads to liquefaction/coagulative necrosis in the lungs with profuse eosinophils and multinucleated giant cells. Angiitis of arteries and veins by neutrophils, plasma cells and eosinophils, scanty lymphocytes, and plasma cells is noted.

- Kidney: Focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis is seen often with cellular crescents and glomerular thrombosis. Interstitial inflammation is common, and renal papillary necrosis occurs in 20%. Rarely granulomatous glomerulonephritis and necrotizing granulomas are seen in biopsies.
