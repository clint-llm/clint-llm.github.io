Symptoms are variable; typically, patients present with a persistent dry cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms include painful red lumps on the skin, uveitis with the blurring of vision, hoarseness of voice, palpable lymph nodes at multiple sites including armpit, neck, painful swollen joints, hearing loss, seizures, or psychiatric disorders could be observed as part of neurological manifestations. Cardiomyopathy, conduction defects, renal calculi, and enlarged liver are observed in a few cases.

A wide range of cutaneous manifestations can be classified as papular, maculopapular, nodular, subcutaneous, hypopigmented, and plaque sarcoidosis. The most common lesions in cutaneous sarcoidosis are papular sarcoidosis involving the upper half of the face, back of the neck, and previous trauma, scar sites, and tattoos. A variant of cutaneous sarcoidosis that presents with violaceous or erythematous papules, plaques, or nodules mainly involving the central facial skin is called lupus pernio. Other well-described skin manifestations of sarcoidosis include nodular sarcoidosis. Plaque-like lesions and subcutaneous non-tender nodules are also commonly seen.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is seen in a variety of other conditions, including sarcoidosis, and usually presents with painful nodules on shins. It is characterized as panniculitis and is a part of Löfgren syndrome. Skin lesions can appear up to 10 or more years after the initial injury or tattoo.

Ocular manifestations are seen in close to 50% of patients, of which the most common clinical feature is uveitis. The CD4/CD8 ratio of vitreous lymphocytes has prognostic value.

Heart block and sudden death have also been reported in sarcoidosis. Prophylactic insertion of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is recommended in patients who develop cardiac sarcoidosis.

CNS manifestations include diabetes insipidus followed by hyperprolactinemia.

The quality of life of symptomatic patients is poor. Many develop psychiatric symptoms, including depression and anxiety.
