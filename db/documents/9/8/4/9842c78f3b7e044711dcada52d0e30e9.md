The exact pathophysiology of acute adrenal hemorrhage remains uncertain. It has been hypothesized that certain specific anatomic and physiological characteristics predispose to bleeding into the adrenals.

The adrenals derive rich arterial supply from three main arteries, the superior, middle, and inferior suprarenal arteries, which are usually branches of the inferior phrenic, the abdominal aorta, and the renal artery respectively. In contrast, the outflow of blood is limited to a single adrenal vein draining directly into the inferior vena cava on the right and into the left renal vein on the left**.**

The adrenal gland functionally and embryologically comprises two distinct parts, the cortex, and the medulla. In times of stress, excess trophic stimulation by adrenocorticotropicÂ hormone (ACTH) causes hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the glands with increased vascularity, contributing to hemorrhage predisposition.
