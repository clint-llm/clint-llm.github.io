Methotrexate is a commonly used disease-modifying agent due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects. Extensive studies have demonstrated methotrexate inhibits DHFR and AICAR transformylase, which are the major mechanisms of action. It is important to screen patients for hepatitis B and C before initiating methotrexate.

Patients who take methotrexate need a complete blood count and the comprehensive metabolic panel every three months to monitor for methotrexate toxicity, which can cause cytopenias and elevate liver function tests. Patients on methotrexate are prescribed folic acid supplements to prevent side effects like nausea, mucositis, and hair thinning due to folate depletion.

Patients who are on long term corticosteroids should be screened for side effects like osteoporosis with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan.
