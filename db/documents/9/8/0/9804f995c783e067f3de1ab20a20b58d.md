Immunoglobulin E(IgE), named in 1968, is the last of the five human immunoglobulins to be discovered and is typically associated with the diverse manifestations of allergic diseases.

As a complex cell-surface receptor with a molecular weight of 49 kDa, Fc epsilon RI binds the Fc domain of IgE with an affinity of 10 M instead of Fc epsilon RII with a notably lower affinity. Fc epsilon RI’s structure is expressed differently based on the effector cell type on which it is presented. For example, an alpha-beta gamma tetramer is seen on mast cells and basophils. In contrast, a trimeric alpha-beta isoform is found on other cell types, such as Langerhans and dendritic cells.

Fc epsilon RI activation facilitates immediate hypersensitivity reactions that can manifest as sneezing, urticaria, acute bronchospasm, and secretory diarrhea and can even lead to cardiovascular collapse and fatal systemic anaphylactic reactions. These immediate hypersensitivity reactions utilize alpha beta gamma receptors to activate mast cells and basophils. The mechanism behind this reaction starts with the binding of antigens to the Fc epsilon RI-bound IgE. This triggers the immediate release of histamine and synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes and stimulates the delayed secretion of cytokine and chemokine.
