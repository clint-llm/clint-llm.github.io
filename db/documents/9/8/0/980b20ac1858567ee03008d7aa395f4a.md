Whereas the infections produced by gram-negative are practically indistinguishable from other etiologies, laboratory characterization can define the organism and its antimicrobial susceptibility profile. Thus, the gold-standard examination of these infections is the cultures; however, they have the problem of a delay in the result. Another essential exam for bacterial isolates is the Gram stain; although simple, it can quickly distinguish the course of a drug intervention. Because of their heterogeneity, Enterobacteria depend on various biochemical tests (Indol, Voges-Proskauer, catalase, cytochrome oxidase, urease, motility, citrate, ONPG, Dnase, decarboxylation of lysine, gas production, among others), grown in primary isolation agar. Species such asÂ E. coli, because they are fermenters of strong acids, they produce large quantities of mixed acids, which make the pH of the media present pink colonies. Others, such as non-fermenters, grow in primary isolation media (blood agar and MacConkey) in the OF-oxidation/fermentation medium - grow only in the aerobic environment.

However, it is essential to mention that identifying bacterial strains resistant to multiple drugs may require molecular methods, but they are not available in all laboratories. Phenotypic methods such as Modified Hodge (MHT) and Combined Diffusion Disc (CDT) using EDTA are good alternatives.
