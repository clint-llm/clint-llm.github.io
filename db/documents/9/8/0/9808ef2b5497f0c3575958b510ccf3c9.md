Wrist arthrodesis, also known as wrist fusion, is a procedure in which the wrist joint is immobilized by fusing the radius to the carpal bones. It may involve the entire wrist joint or partial wrist joint in techniques such as scapholunate fusion, four-corner fusion with scaphoid excision, scapho-trapezoid fusion, scaphocapitate fusion, and radiolunate fusion. This activity highlights the role of the interdisciplinary team in this procedure.
