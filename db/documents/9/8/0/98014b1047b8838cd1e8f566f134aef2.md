Researchers found it to cause no carcinogenesis or mutagenesis and not affect fertility in animal studies. However, latanoprost was noted to cause a chromosomal aberration in treated human lymphocytes. Intravenous infusion of 3 mcg/kg of latanoprost in healthy volunteers produced plasma concentrations 200 times higher than during clinical treatment with latanoprost ophthalmic solution, and researchers identified no ADR. Presently, there are no evidences to establish a corelation between latanoprost administartion with ocular or cutaneous melanoma.
