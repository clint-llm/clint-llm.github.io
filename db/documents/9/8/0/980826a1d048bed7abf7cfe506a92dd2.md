Congenital iris ectropion is a disorder caused by the arrested development of the neural crest. Conditions that have pigmented epithelium on the anterior surface of the iris are often confused with congenital iris ectropion. Axenfeld Rieger syndrome also may have iris ectropion which may be congenital or acquired. There is a smooth cryptless iris surface and secondary glaucoma. Unlike congenital iris ectropion syndrome, corectopia and iris holes are seen. It is a bilateral condition and has similar poor results with goniotomy.

The iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome is also unilateral but presents later in life. The proliferation of pigmented epithelium is seen. The endothelial cells behave as epithelial cells that multiply and migrate. ThisÂ differs from the retained primordial endothelium in congenital iris ectropion and Axenfeld Rieger syndrome.
