The prognosis for adductor strains is generallyÂ favorable. Most athletes will return to play with minimal pain and normal function if provided appropriate relative rest and rehabilitation. If they return to play too soon or are inadequately rehabilitated, their pain may lead to chronic injury.

Renstrom et al. found that 42% of athletes with muscle-tendon groin injuries were not able to return to physical activity more than 20 weeks after the initial injury. However, an active training program directed at strengthening and conditioning of muscles of the pelvis and especially the adductor muscles is very effective at treating patients with long-standing, adductor-related groin pain.
