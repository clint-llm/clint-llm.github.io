The dorsolateral somite cells migrate to the upper limb around the fourth week to form the muscles of the upper limb. Many transcription factors are activated at various stages, allowing the limb buds to develop. Connective tissue derived from the lateral plate of the mesoderm divides the forearm into extensor (dorsal) and flexor (volar) compartments.
