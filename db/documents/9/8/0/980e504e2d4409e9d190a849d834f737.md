An abnormal elevation of serum activities of muscle enzymes is the most common biological finding in JDM. Â Elevation of creatine kinase is expected in 75% to 85% of cases with average values around 2000 U/L plus or minus 1000. A normal rate can be observed at the beginning of the disease and in amyopathic forms. Regular creatine phosphokinase (CPK) monitoring is recommended during the evolution under treatment to evaluate its effectiveness.

Other laboratory workup includes ESR, lupus profile, and myositis-specific antibodies.

The electromyogram shows a myogenic pattern. Muscle biopsy confirms the diagnosis. Some histological abnormalities are common to other myositides: myofiber degeneration and an inflammatory mononuclear infiltrate. Other findings are more specific, for example, a highly characteristic perifascicular atrophy, perivascular inflammatory infiltrate, and sometimes intravascular microthrombi. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive tool used to guide the muscle biopsy site to optimize its sensitivity. Muscle edema is the major abnormality observed on MRI, particularly in the T2 sequence with fat suppression or STIR sequence. This edema is usually proximal and symmetrical but might be focal and distal. The signal intensity seems to be correlated with an aggressive, chronic disease course.
