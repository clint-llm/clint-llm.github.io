The incidence of surgical complications varies depending on the causes of the contracture and its complexity, from 10% to 30%. Hematoma, infections, ulnar nerve neuritis, ossification, hypertrophic scars, and pain are the most frequent complications of the procedures. Late ulnar neuropathy has recently been observed due to elongation after recovering degrees of extension in flexion contractures. Iatrogenic neurological injuries have been reported in both, open techniques and arthroscopic procedure. However, its frequency depends on experience and complexity. The following suggestions have been proposed to diminish the risk of complications: use of retractors, avoid the aspiration near the nerves (disconnect the shaver), careful use of the shaver close to the nerves to avoid traction and recognizing surgeons limitations regarding the surgical experience.
