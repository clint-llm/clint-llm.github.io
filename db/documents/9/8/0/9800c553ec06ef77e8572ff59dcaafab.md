Osteoradionecrosis occurs in patients who have been previously exposed to ionizing radiation to treat head and neck cancers. The radiation leaves the bony and soft tissues with poor vascularity, resulting in a picture of avascular necrosis in the mandible. Patients may develop areas of exposed bone in the mouth and resultant loss of teeth and supporting structures. The resulting chronic infections can lead to osteomyelitis and soft tissue orocutaneous fistulae.
