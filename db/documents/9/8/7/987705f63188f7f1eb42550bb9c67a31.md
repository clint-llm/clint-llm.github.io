A Bartholin gland cyst is a benign blockage of the Bartholin gland that is usually unilateral, asymptomatic, and may be incidentally found during a pelvic exam or imaging studies. Bartholin gland obstruction may occur after trauma to the area, episiotomy, or childbirth; however, it may also occur without an identifiable cause.
