Radiation-induced coronary artery disease (RICAD) is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in patients treated with chest radiation therapy (RT) for cancer. With increased rates of oncologic treatment, the rates of RICAD are increasing in parallel. This activity will discuss in detail the etiology of RICAD, epidemiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, screening recommendations, treatment options, differential diagnosis, and complications, as well as the role of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of radiation-induced coronary artery disease.
- Review the presentation of a patient with radiation-induced coronary artery disease.
- Summarize the surveillance and treatment options for radiation-induced coronary artery disease.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by radiation-induced coronary artery disease.
