The precise mechanism by which paracusias occur remains elusive. However, several postulations have been suggested.

fMRI findings have demonstrated spontaneous activation of the auditory network, consisting of the left superior temporal gyrus, transverse temporal gyri (Heschl's gyri), and the left temporal lobe.

A neurocognitive model called the VOICE model has been offered, which attributes the paracusias to an unbalanced bottom-up limbic hyperexcitation mismatched against a hypoactive prefrontal inhibitory system.

Some data suggest that the thalamus-amygdala pathways are activated, thereby processing an emotional response to the auditory hallucinations,Â further proved by another study detecting choline and N-acetyl aspirate ratio abnormalities in the thalamus.

At a neurochemical level, of particular importance are dopamine (D2) and serotonin (5HT2a) receptors. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated increased D2 receptor occupancy in the striatal system and 5HT2a receptor occupancy in the caudate nucleus.
