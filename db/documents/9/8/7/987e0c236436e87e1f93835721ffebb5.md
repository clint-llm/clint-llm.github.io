The nucleus ambiguus is the location of cell bodies of motor nerves that innervate the ipsilateral muscles of the soft palate, pharynx, larynx and upper esophagus and are mainly responsible for swallowing and speaking. Its location is in the reticular formation of the medulla oblongata, the lowest part of the brainstem. The nuclei are in the lateral regions of the rostral medulla posterior to the inferior olive.

The nucleus ambiguus is involved in the motor functions of swallowing and speech. It gives rise to the efferent motor fibers of the vagus nerve (CN X) that innervate the muscles of the soft palate, larynx, pharynx, as well as the stylopharyngeus muscles and pharyngeal constrictor muscles of the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX).

Additionally, the nucleus contributes to parasympathetic cardiac regulation. The vagus nerve, which has various motor, sensory, and autonomic functions involving multiple organ systems, is associated with three main nuclei in the brainstem: the dorsal motor nucleus, nucleus ambiguus, and nucleus solitarius.

Modulation of this parasympathetic reflex is via peptides such as bradykinin. Bradykinin, an endogenous peptide that has cardioprotective and vasodilatory properties, acts on receptors on the nucleus ambiguus to induce bradycardia.
