Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKAD) is located within the inner mitochondrial membrane of various tissues such as skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, and the brain. It is composed of three catalytic subunits (E1, E2, and E3). Together with branched-chain amino acid transaminase, it helps mediate catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). In the presence of thiamin pyrophosphate, E1 decarboxylates the alpha ketoacids. The lipoic acid residue in E2 transfers the acyl group from E1 to CoA. The E3 subunit helps reoxidize the lipoic acid residue in E2. The activity of branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase is further regulated by BCKAD phosphatase and BCKAD kinase. Therefore, within the mitochondria, branched-chain amino acids are first converted into their respective alpha-ketoacids by the enzyme branched-chain amino acid transaminase. Their respective yielded alpha-ketoacids include alpha-ketoisocaproic acid, alpha-keto-beta-methyl valeric acid, and alpha-ketoisovaleric acid. Alpha-ketoacids are then oxidatively decarboxylated by the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. Consequently, alpha-ketoacids are further metabolized into intermediates such as isovaleryl-coenzyme A, alpha-methylbutyryl-CoA, and isobutyrl-CoA. These intermediates are then converted into succinyl-CoA, acetoacetate, and acetyl-CoA.

In the brain, BCKAD helps metabolize BCAA to facilitate cerebral GABA and glutamate synthesis. The liver and kidney are responsible for the catabolism of 10% to 15% of BCAA.
