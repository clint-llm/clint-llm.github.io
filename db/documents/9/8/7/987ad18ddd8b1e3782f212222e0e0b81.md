An interprofessional team intervention is essential to achieve the best outcomes. The team should be formed by orthopedic nurses, radiologists, primary care physicians, pain specialists, neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, hand surgeons, and physiotherapists. Nurses and physical therapists play an important role in ensuring therapy adherence. Adequate postoperative rehabilitation is associated with better outcomes. Immobilization after tendon transfers has been the usual postoperative management. However, immediate active motion protocols have proved to be safe with similar outcomes compared to immobilization protocols, with the advantage of earlier restoration of hand function and pain relief.
