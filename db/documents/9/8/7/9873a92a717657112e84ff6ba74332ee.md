Proteinuria is associated with significant complications, including increased risks of:

- Coronary heart disease

- Cerebrovascular disease

- Gastrointestinal hemorrhage

- Progression of kidney disease

- Hypercoagulability, Venous thromboembolism

- Pulmonary edema due to fluid overload

- Bacterial infections

- Renal replacement therapy, including dialysis and transplant

- Death

Studies have shown that microalbuminuria increases the risk of coronary artery disease by 50%, whereas the risk of cerebrovascular disease is increased by 70%. Macro-albuminuria is associated with doubling the risk for both.
