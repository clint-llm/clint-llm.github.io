A thorough medical history involving assessment of any condition that may be related to hepatobiliary diseases such as fatty liver disease, pregnancy, viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, celiac disease, thyroid disease, and right-sided heart failure should be obtained. All prescribed and over the counter medications, including dietary supplements and vitamins, should be recorded since they might alter liver function. Bilirubinuria has been seen in patients taking the drug phenazopyridine or the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory etodolac.

It is also helpful to categorize the differential as hepatocellular injury versus cholestatic causes. Weight loss and constitutional symptoms are consistent with obstructive malignancy, or a history of immune deficiency, which can cause biliary obstruction from opportunistic infections. Patients with biliary obstruction might also complain of dark brown urine, light-colored stool, or pruritis.

On physical examination, a thorough skin and ocular exam are important to denote the presence of jaundice and scleral icterus. Red flags for chronic liver disease such as stigmata of liver disease (caput-medusae, palmar erythema, spider nevi, gynecomastia) as well as signs of hepatic congestion (palpable hepatomegaly, increased jugular venous pressure, abdominal ascites) may be present.
