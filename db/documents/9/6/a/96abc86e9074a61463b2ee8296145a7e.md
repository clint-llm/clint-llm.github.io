Blepharoplastic restores the correct functioning to the affected eyelid(s) and the aesthetics of the eye-region of the face. This is achieved by eliminating excess skin from the eyelid(s), smoothing the underlying eye muscles, tightening the supporting structures, and resecting excess fat of the retroseptal area of the eye to produce a smooth anatomic transition from the lower eyelid to the cheek.
