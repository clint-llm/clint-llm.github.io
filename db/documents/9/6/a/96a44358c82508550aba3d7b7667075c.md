Patients presenting with concerns over a potential SLAP tear should receive education regarding the contemporary clinical knowledge we now have regarding these injuries. Moreover, patients will often present with an MRI final report stating a SLAP tear was present on imaging. In these clinical scenarios, the recommendation is to reassure the patient and educate them regarding the high incidence rate of “incidental” or “clinically irrelevant” SLAP injuries. Detailed and focused attention should be given to appropriately delineating the extent of all potential underlying shoulder girdle pathologies.
