Medical therapies for neonatal myasthenia gravis are different from juvenile MG, which include chronic pharmacotherapy to increase the availability of the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, as well as immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive drugs.

In the neonatal age group, particular importance should be given to the use of aminoglycoside that may potentiate symptoms of MG. However, for neonatal MG, the treatment duration lasts, if necessary at all, only for a few days to a few months. If mildly symptomatic, small and frequent feeding is necessary with proper surveillance for aspiration and dysphagia. In more severe cases, oral or IM neostigmine may be necessary, as well as gavage feeding. Administration of neostigmine 30 mins prior to feeding can help with dysphagia. Pyridostigmine (slightly longer-acting agent) can be used alternatively. Fortunately, plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulins, and corticosteroids are all efficacious in the treatment of myasthenia gravis in the older children and adults but rarely are needed and only necessary for the management of severely affected neonates for rapid removal of circulating antibodies.

Infants born to mothers who have taken corticosteroids during pregnancy should be monitored for adrenal inefficiencies during the newborn period.

This article focusses on the neonatal MG, and thymectomy is not necessary for these patients. Please refer to numerous retrospective pediatric studies that indicate that thymectomy is potentially beneficial for juvenile myasthenia gravis.
