Bacteroides fragilis is resistant to penicillin due to the production of beta-lactamase. Cefoxitin, moxifloxacin, and clindamycin have low levels of susceptibility for Bacteroides fragilis, whereas Piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, and metronidazole have high susceptibility rates.B. fragilis ranges from 0.5% to 7.8% across many surveys.nim genes, possibly located on mobile genetic elements, encode nitro-imidazole-reductases responsible for the drug inactivation.fragilis Bacteroides group (including B. intestinalis, B. nordii, B. pyogenes, B. stercoris, B. salyersiae, and B. cellulosilyticus) were found to be resistant to meropenem (14%) and cefotetan (71%).Bacteroides fragilis strain was found in Croatia.Bacteroides fragilis infection is usually a part of polymicrobial infection that happens due to a breach of natural barriers either by surgery, inflammation, or trauma and result commonly in intrabdominal infections. Antimicrobial therapy of intraabdominal infections should include coverage for anaerobic infections along with Enterobacteriaceae. Coverage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis is also a recommendation for hospital-associated intra-abdominal infections.

Newer drugs: eravacycline, a novel fluorocycline antibiotic, has been evaluated against complicated mixed aerobic/anaerobic intra-abdominal infections. eravacycline had good anaerobic in vitro activity with MICs of 4μg/ml or less against all Bacteroides and Parabacteroides strains tested, except for two B. ovatus strains that had MICs of 8 mcg/ml and one strain that had a MIC of 16 mcg/ml. Eravacycline was four-to-eight fold more active than tigecycline.Bacteroides fragilis 95.2% (20/21) in Japanese patients with complicated intraabdominal infections.
