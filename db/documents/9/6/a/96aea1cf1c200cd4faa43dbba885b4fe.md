People with obesity experience discrimination from an early age that often stems from the stigma associated with the disease. The belief held that people with obesity are lazy, overindulgent, and lack self-control is incorrect and has the potential to negatively impact many aspects of a patient’s life. Therefore, the healthcare team and the larger medical community need to acknowledge the stigma associated with obesity and its implicit bias. Acknowledging this bias and applying methods to decrease the stigma will improve the care of patients with obesity.

People who are overweight and obese experience discrimination in several areas of life, including in the workplace, education, and healthcare.

A study out of France showed that most general practitioners know that being overweight and obese are life-threatening, and 79% agree that it falls under their scope of practice; however, 30% of providers had negative attitudes towards the obese patients in their care.

In a British qualitative study, primary care physicians expressed beliefs that the condition is caused by unhealthy eating and lack of exercise, leaving the responsibility solely on the patient.
