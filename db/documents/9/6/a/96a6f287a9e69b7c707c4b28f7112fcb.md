Polydactyly can be detected on anatomic ultrasounds done prenatally. However, it is typically diagnosed at birth. To properly treat polydactyly, the provider must fully understand the exact type of polydactyly involved. This must include a thorough understanding of the musculoskeletal components involved. Part of the evaluation must include radiographs and physical examination to assess stability, motor function, and cosmesis.****

Practitioners must also consider and evaluate if polydactyly is presenting as part of a syndrome. Syndromes that are reported with a higher incidence include Holt-Oram syndrome and Fanconi anemia.
