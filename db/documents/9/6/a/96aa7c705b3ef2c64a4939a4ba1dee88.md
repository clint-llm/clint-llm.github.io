The pelvic ring is made of the sacrum and two innominate bones, each containing an ilium, ischium, and pubis. There is no inherent stability to the bony anatomy of the ring. Therefore the strong ligamentous attachments are required for maintenance of the ring structure. Pelvic ring injuries cover a broad spectrum. Simple minimally displaced fractures of the sacrum or pubis may be treated conservatively, while high energy disruptions of the bony or ligamentous ring represent life-threatening injuries requiring intervention. The following activity focuses on the critical aspects of diagnosing and treating pelvic ring fractures and should serve as a high yield review for practitioners of all education levels.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the various etiologies of pelvic ring injuries.
- Review the evaluation of pelvic ring injuries.
- Outline the management options available for pelvic ring injuries.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve the treatment of pelvic ring injuries and optimize outcomes.
