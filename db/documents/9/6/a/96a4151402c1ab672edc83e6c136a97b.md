Paraneoplastic syndromes constitute a group of uncommon manifestations that are noted in patients with different types of malignancies.

Clinicians need to be familiar with the presentations of paraneoplastic syndromes as they can be the first presenting symptoms of an underlying malignancy.

Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are a unique subset of paraneoplastic syndromes. Caused by cross-reactive antibodies called onconeural antibodies, these are antibodies produced by the immune system in response to malignant tumors. These onconeural antibodies can attack different parts of the nervous system resulting in various neurological manifestations.

Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) is one of the more commonly seen paraneoplastic neurological syndromes.
