In an experimental study, B. fragilis exerted protective effects on a Clostridoides difficile infection mouse model through the modulation of gut microbiota and alleviating barrier destruction.

Another study identified that Bacteroides fragilis species have a protective effect against antibiotic-associated diarrhea in rats by altering intestinal defenses and identified the vital role of B. fragilis strain ZY-312 in changing the colonic bacterial community.

Diet could influence the determination of gut microbiota composition and the immune response.B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron.
