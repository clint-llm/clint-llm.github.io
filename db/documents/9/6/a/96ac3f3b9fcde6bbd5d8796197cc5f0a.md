Procainamide is a class 1A anti-arrhythmic that binds to fast sodium channels inhibiting recovery after repolarization. It also prolongs the action potential and reduces the speed of impulse conduction. This action results in decreased myocardial excitability, slowed conduction velocity, and reduced myocardial contractility. It is possible that it acts as a negative inotrope and may cause peripheral vasodilation and hypotension, which may require cardioversion.
