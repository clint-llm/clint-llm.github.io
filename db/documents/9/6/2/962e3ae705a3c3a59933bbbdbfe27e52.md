Ranibizumab is a humanized, recombinant monoclonal antibody fragment against vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and thus prevents choroidal neovascularization.

Bevacizumab is another anti-VEGF agent that preceded ranibizumab. Bevacizumab is a full-length humanized monoclonal antibody that was first FDA approved in 2004 to treat colon cancer. Due to its ability to inhibit neovascularization, bevacizumab was then used intravenously to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NVAMD) as an off-label treatment.

FDA-approved indications

- Neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (NVAMD)

- Macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO)

- Myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV)

- Diabetic macular edema (DME)

- Diabetic retinopathy (DR) with or without DME

- Retinal ischemia

In terms of a global health perspective, there is controversy regarding administering bevacizumab or ranibizumab since bevacizumab is significantly less costly. However, its use in treating NVAMD is off-label. Although both drugs have very similar effects on visual acuity in treating NVAMD, ranibizumab is more expensive than bevacizumab.

Ranibizumab, combined with photodynamic therapy, to control abnormal growth of blood vessels in NVAMD is the gold standard in many countries; however, other treatment options with various VEGF inhibitors are also widely used.
