- Apraxia of eyelid opening is defined as a non-motor abnormality characterized by the patient's difficulty in eyelid elevation bilaterally.

- Commonly occurs after the patient voluntarily close the eyes.

- The definition is a misnomer, given that it is very rarely pure and true apraxia.

- It is associated with dysfunction in the corticothalamic, basal ganglia, and focal cranial nerve circuitry.

- Structures involved include sensorimotor cortical regions, substantia nigra pars reticulata, and brainstem motor nuclei.

- The most common etiology of apraxia of eyelid opening is idiopathic focal dystonia.

- Other causes include blepharospasm or focal dystonia of the eyelids, infectious, toxic exposure, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, face or eyebrow ptosis, neuromuscular, trauma, iatrogenic, dermatochalasis, ptosis, psychogenic, and fatigue.

- Patients show compensatory behaviors, which may include thrusting the head backward, manually opening the eyes with their fingers, and rubbing the eyebrows.

- Botulinum toxin A is considered the first-line treatment.

- Several disorders will present like apraxia of eyelid opening and must be excluded to treat them appropriately.

- The prognosis is dependent on the chronicity, etiology, and responsiveness to the first-line treatment.

- Chronicity and refraction to treatment can lead to more disruption in functional independence and disability.
