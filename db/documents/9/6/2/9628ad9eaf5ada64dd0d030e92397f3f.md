One of the case series byÂ Vargas et al. found that on cytogenetic analysis, polysomy of chromosome 8 is a constant feature of pleuropulmonary blastoma. In addition, the clonal proliferation in pleuropulmonary blastoma is mainly due to the multiplication of malignant mesenchymal elements, while epithelial components are mostly non-neoplastic.

PPB occurs not only in the lung, but it can also arise from mediastinum, diaphragm and/or pleura. This has led to the possibility that PPB may arise from the splanchnopleural or somatopleural mesoderm. Common metastatic sites include the brain, liver, bone, lymph nodes, kidney, pancreas and adrenal glands.
