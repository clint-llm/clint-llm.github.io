Gross appearance: The gross appearance is unique to each type of stone. An oxalate stone reveals a nodular surface of the stone on gross examination. Calcium oxalate monohydrate is usually dark brown and extremely hard.Â  Calcium oxalate dihydrate is lighter in color, much more fragile, and may show facets. On dissection, most calcium oxalate stones reveal concentric laminations and radial striations.

Microscopy: Examining the individual crystals reveals thin and plate-like structures that generally acquire a "pyramidal" or "dumb-bell" shape through twinning, as seen in urinary sediments.
