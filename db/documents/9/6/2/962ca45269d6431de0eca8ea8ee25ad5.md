The most common etiology of coarctation of the aorta is constriction of the aorta in the region of the patent ductus arteriosus or ductal ligamentum. The ductal tissue is thought to cause constriction in the adjacent region of the aorta. This narrows the lumen of the aorta. Coarctation also can be more complex and present as aortic arch hypoplasia and as a component of other left-sided heart lesions (mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, hypoplastic left heart syndrome). Mid-thoracic coarctation can occur with mid-aortic syndromes. Over time, the body compensates by developing collaterals around the coarctation segment.
