Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) were discovered in 1952 and were the first class of antidepressants to be used clinically. Tranylcypromine was the second MAOI discovered. Originally, it was intended as a nasal decongestant. However, after it had failed as a nasal decongestant, it was found to be an effective antidepressant. Monoamine oxidase is the enzyme that degrades neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. There are two types of monoamine oxidase, MAOA, and MAOB. MAOA breaks down serotonin and norepinephrine and is found mainly in the gut. MAOB metabolizes phenylethylamine and is present in high concentrations in the basal ganglia and platelets. Both MAOA and MAOB break down dopamine. This drug is mostly a nonhydrazine irreversible inhibitor of MAOA and is also an irreversible inhibitor of MAOB but to a lesser degree. Tranylcypromine also blocks the reuptake of catecholamines and serotonin. As a result, the levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine increase. Tranylcypromine is also structurally similar to amphetamine, which may contribute to why this drug has some stimulant-like effects. The onset of action for this drug is typically 2 to 4 weeks, and the duration is approximately 10 to 21 days.
