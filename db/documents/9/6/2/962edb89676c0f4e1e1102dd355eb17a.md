**History**

A careful history is paramount to the diagnosis of breast fat necrosis. Although malignancy should always be in the differential, efforts should be made to spare the patient from the unnecessary emotional and financial burden of unnecessary procedures. Additionally, invasive work-up such as core biopsy can be detrimental to some patient populations such as those with irradiated breast, where a non-healing wound may develop.

- History of trauma (i.e., MVC in a person restrained by a seatbelt)

- History of breast surgery/reconstruction

- History of breast implant removal

- History of breast radiation

- Obesity with very large breasts

- Pendulous breasts

**Physical Exam**

Features associated with breast fat necrosis include an irregular breast mass, usually fixed to the dermis, with possible skin tethering and/or nipple retraction as a result of fibrotic bands between necrotic tissue and skin. These same characteristics can also be hallmark findings of malignancy, thus making it essential to consider all patient factors.
