Neurological resuscitation is a true team sport requiring close communication between disciplines.  Nurses are the ultimate patient monitors and recognition of subtle changes may make the difference in outcomes.  Respiratory therapists, like nurses, should be keenly attuned to subtle changes in the patient's respiratory status as changes in pulmonary compliance may affect ICP by increasing venous pressure and increasing PCO2.  Care will require a team of physicians and their ability to communicate freely will be essential to improving outcomes.  All members of the team should be empowered to contribute freely and encouraged to report subtle changes that can affect the patient's outcome.  The most effective teams will find a method of discussing the patient's care at least twice and developing a plan that addresses the patient's needs.
