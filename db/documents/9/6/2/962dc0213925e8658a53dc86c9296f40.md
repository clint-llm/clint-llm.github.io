Neuropathic and or vascular symptoms can come from a wide number of etiologies, especially in the upper extremity. Some of these include central nervous system diseases, neuromuscular diseases, thoracic outlet syndrome, neuropathies caused by infection, cervical radiculopathy, brachial plexus injuries, cubital tunnel syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, ulnar canal compression, tumor, and trauma (either acute or from repetitive forces).

Compression of the ulnar nerve in Guyon canal can often be confused with compression of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel. A major distinguishing factor between the 2 compression sites is the sensation over the dorsal ulnar aspect of the hand.

Hypothenar hand syndrome (HHS) is a rare situation when the ulnar nerve becomes compressed due to an ulnar artery thrombosis or aneurysm in Guyon canal.
