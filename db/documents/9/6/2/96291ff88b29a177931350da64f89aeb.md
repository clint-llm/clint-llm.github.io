The patient is positioned per surgeon preference. The patient is then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Either a Hill-Ferguson retractor or an anoscope is inserted, and the anal canal is inspected for any other gross pathology. The fissure is usually located in the posterior position and may be associated with a right posterior hemorrhoidal complex. The fissure and hemorrhoid may be excised, and the anal mucosa is then reapproximated using an absorbable suture. At this point, at the surgeons' discretion, the procedure can either be continued in a closed or open fashion.

Open

A radial oriented incision over the intersphincteric groove is made in the left lateral position through the anoderm exposing the internal anal sphincter muscle fibers. Using a hemostat or similar instrument, the internal anal sphincter is elevated off the external anal sphincter, and the muscle is divided to the level of the dentate line either using electrocautery or sharply. If divided sharply once must ensure adequate hemostasis to prevent any postoperative bleeding complications. The anoderm is then left open to allow healing by second intention or can be closed using an absorbable suture.

Closed

With this technique, the intersphincteric groove is palpated at the left lateral position. With a finger in the anal canal, an 11-blade scalpel is inserted into the intersphincteric plane, ensuring to stay below the dentate line. The blade is then moved medially dividing the internal sphincter. The incision is left open to allow for healing by secondary intention.
