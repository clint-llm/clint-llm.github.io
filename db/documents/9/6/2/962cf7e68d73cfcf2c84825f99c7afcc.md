The emotional effects of HIV exposure can be substantial, and proper follow-up and counseling can be beneficial to all patients. Prompt follow-up provides an opportunity for patients to ask questions, ensures education, can increase compliance, and can help the patient with managing side effects. Once antiretroviral therapy has started, the pharmacist should always monitor for adverse effects, which often lead to a drop in compliance.

It has been well established that an interprofessional approach to HIV-positive patients will increase adherence and allow for better outcomes. Expanding this interprofessional approach to encompass HIV prevention will help decrease HIV transmission rates and end the AIDS epidemic.
