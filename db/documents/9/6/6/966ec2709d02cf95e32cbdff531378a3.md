Transfusion reactions are adverse events that occur after transfusing blood products such as whole blood, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets, cryoprecipitate, granulocytes, intravenous immune globulin, allogenic and autologous stem cells, and packed red blood cells.

TRALI was first reported in the 1950s but recognized as a distinctive clinical syndrome in 1983.

In the US, TRALI has to be reported to the Blood Banking services.
