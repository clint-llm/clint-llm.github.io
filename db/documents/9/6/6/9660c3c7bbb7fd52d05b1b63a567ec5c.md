Oral leukoplakia is a common presentation in clinics, and the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an otolaryngologist, dentist, primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and a pathologist. The key is to educate the patient and eliminate all contributing factors. The patient must be urged to quit smoking. The pharmacist should educate the patient on aids that may help the discontinuation of tobacco. In addition, the patient should stop the use of any irritants like betel nuts. The otolaryngology nurse should emphasize to the patient that the lesions can recur, and malignant transformation is a possibility.

In the case of lesions with moderate to severe dysplasia, surgical excision or laser surgery should be the treatment of choice, especially when the lesion is on the ventral and lateral borders of the tongue, soft palate, floor of the mouth, and oropharynx. Close surveillance and follow-up should be mandatory for lesions on other anatomic locations. Surgical removal is the treatment of choice for erythroleukoplakia and proliferative verrucous leukoplakia.

For people who continue to smoke, recurrences are common. The only way to lower morbidity and improve outcomes in patients with oral leukoplakia is with open communication between team members who continue to educate the patient.
