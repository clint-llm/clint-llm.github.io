The diagnosis and management of acrodynia involve a high suspicion based on exposure and a multidisciplinary approach. Although various jurisdictions have imposed policies to curtain the exposure of mercury, the practitioners can encounter cases of acrodynia. There is a growing trend of intake of herbal and ayurvedic medicines, which may contain an abnormally high amount of mercury and its variants. The diagnosis of acrodynia can be challenging, given various conditions mimicking the clinical presentation. The health care professional should emphasize an environmental survey, regular follow-up, and proper choice of the chelating agents for better treatment outputs.
