**Vaccine Coverage**

As per the 2020 CDC report, the USA's vaccination rate in 2019 was approximately 95% for MMR, Varicella, and DTaP.

**Vaccine Noncompliance**

The immunization rate among children entering kindergarten exceeds 90 percent for all the vaccines among kids entering kindergarten. Still, we can see the emergence of vaccine-preventable diseases due to increases in vaccination delay and refusal. Measles and pertussis outbreaks happened in areas with low vaccination rates. Families refuse vaccines due to medical, religious, philosophical, or socioeconomic reasons. Clinicians have a crucial role in parental decision making for vaccination.

**Vaccination Recommendations During the COVID-19 Pandemic**

As per CDC, the COVID pandemic has reduced the immunization rate in the 2020-2021 school year among children entering kindergarten due to decreased slots for well-visit appointments and schools not enforcing the vaccination policies because of remote learning. Separate the well-visits from sick visits at different times of the day, identifying children who have missed well-child visits, and vaccination and reminders in EMR for missed immunization can improve vaccination rate during the COVID-19 pandemic.
