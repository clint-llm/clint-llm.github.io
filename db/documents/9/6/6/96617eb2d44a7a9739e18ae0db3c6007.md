ATP7A gene encodes ATP7A, which is an active copper (Cu) transporter. ATP7A is a transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in enterocytes, placenta, and central nervous system, where at a steady-state, it directs Cu to Cu-dependent enzymes. In low to normal copper states, the ATPase is localized in the trans Golgi network (TGN), where it is retained by Acetyl-CoA transporter 1. In the TGN, ATP7A transfers copper from the cytoplasm into the Golgi complex for the metalation of multiple cuproenzymes. Whereas if the copper levels are high, it effluxes out of the cell by relocating to the plasma membrane.

The clinical features of Menkes kinky hair disease are either a direct consequence of enzyme dysfunction or secondary to an inability to load these enzymes with Cu.

Profound neurological features are due to low Cu in the brain. Likely explanations include:

- Cu gets trapped in the blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinalÂ fluid barrier while glial cells and neurons are deprived of Cu.

- Generally, Cu is the noncompetitive antagonist of NMDA receptors. Normally ATP7A mediates the availability of NMDA receptors and a releasable pool of copper in hippocampal neurons. The absence of ATP7A markedly accentuates the NMDA receptor excitability in the neurons causing seizures.

- The deficiency of cytochrome C-oxidase causes accumulations of superoxide radicals and neuronal damage.

- Impaired blood vessel integrity with secondary ischemia leading to infarction due to deficiency of lysyl oxidase.
