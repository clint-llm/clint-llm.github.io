The management of patients receiving SIMV requires interprofessional teamwork amongst clinicians, pulmonologists, nurses, respiratory therapists, and other allied health professions. Respiratory therapists generally are trained to closely monitor the ventilator and be able to troubleshoot when problems occur. The nursing staff has direct bedside monitoring of the ventilated patient, usually in an intensive care unit or similar facility. In neonatal patients, SIMV has been associated with a higher risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and increased with duration of ventilation when compared to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. With all types of ventilation, only one individual should be assigned to change the parameters. Anytime a parameter is changed, they should chart the change and notify the nurse. Daily morning rounds should be undertaken with the team members to ensure that everyone is aware of the treatment plan. Nurses who play a crucial role in managing patients on ventilators should always monitor the patient for adverse events and complications associated with ventilation. [Level I] Communication between members of the interprofessional healthcare team should be immediate to ensure that outcomes are not compromised.
