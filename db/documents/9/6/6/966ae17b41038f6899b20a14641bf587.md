Pseudotumor cerebri/idiopathic intracranial hypertension more commonly affects women of child-bearing age and the obese. The symptoms involve headaches, vision loss (transient or persistent), pulsatile tinnitus (a whooshing sound in the ears), and/or diplopia (blurry or double vision). Treatment involves weight loss paired with medications that can reduce production of cerebrospinal fluid such as acetazolamide or reduce overall body fluids such as loop diuretics (furosemide, chlorthalidone). In severe cases steroids and/or surgery are an option.

Deterrence can involve:

- Weight loss

- Avoidance of certain medications including retinoic acids (vitamin A), tetracyclines, growth hormone, corticosteroids, and lithium.
