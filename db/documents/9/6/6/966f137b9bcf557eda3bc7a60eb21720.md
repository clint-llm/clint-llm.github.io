Certain sample types are more prone to inter-sample variability and may need two or more replicates. Volatile samples, for instance, may need to be performed in duplicate and agree within a certain range of mOsm. In these cases, the osmometer's specific protocol and user manual should be followed. The measurement range of osmometers varies depending on the instrument and sample being used; however, a common reportable range for freezing point depression osmometers is 0 to 2000 mOsm/kg. The normal reference range for serum is 275 to 295 mOsm/kg, and urine is 300 to 750 mOsm/kg, though these ranges may vary.
