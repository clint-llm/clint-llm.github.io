There are three stages of the disease:

- Acute infection

- Indeterminate phase

- Chronic infection

The indeterminate phase occurs after an acute infection resolves, but there remains serologic evidence of an infection. This phase can last for years or even decades. During this time, a person will remain asymptomatic with normal organ function. Approximately 70% of these patients will stay in the indeterminate phase for the remainder of their life, while the remaining 30% will develop chronic disease.
