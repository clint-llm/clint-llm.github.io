The most serious complication of autonomic dysreflexia is a hemorrhagic stroke which can be serious and even deadly. If not adequately treated, autonomic dysreflexia causes a sustained, severe hypertension which can result in a variety of problems such as a myocardial ischemia or infarction, renal failure, pulmonary edema, retinal hemorrhage or a cerebral bleed resulting in a potentially disabling or lethal stroke.Â A literature review of patients with autonomic dysreflexia who developed serious complications from the disorder found 32 reported cases. Of these, 22% died as an immediate result of problems directly related to an episode of autonomic dysreflexia. Most (72%) of the serious complications involved the central nervous system, 22% were cardiovascular and 6% were pulmonary.

Other potential complications are related to their underlying spinal injury such as pressure sores, decubiti, constipation, and urinary tract infections. But in patients prone to significant autonomic dysreflexia episodes, such problems can potentially lead to a dysreflexic episode.
