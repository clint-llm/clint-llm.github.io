Crocodile tears syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion. Slit lamp examination of the eye and appendages is usually done to rule out other causes of epiphora. The basal tear secretion of an individual can be assessed by using Schirmer's test. In the case of crocodile tears syndrome, it can be performed before and after gustatory stimulation to document increased tearing after salivation. It is also important to rule out other differentials.

- Orbicularis oculi weakness due to facial palsy: The orbicularis oculi muscle is tested by asking the patient to shut his or her eyes tightly while the examiner tries to open them. The force required to open the eyelid can be graded, and accordingly, the degree of muscle weakness can be ascertained.

- Paralytic ectropion: The examiner performs the snap-back test to check for lower lid laxity. A positive test is obtained when the eyelids spring back immediately into their original position after being pulled down by the examiner.

- Nasolacrimal duct obstruction: ROPLAS (regurgitation on pressure over lacrimal sac) test is used to ascertain nasolacrimal duct obstruction.
