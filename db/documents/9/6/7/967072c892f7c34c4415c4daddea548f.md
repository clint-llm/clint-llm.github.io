The etiology of congenital nephrotic syndrome is heterogeneous. The etiology can be divided into genetic, non-genetic, and infectious.

Genetic

Genetic defects including genes  NPHS1, NPHS2, WT1, PLCE1, and LAMB2



Infectious

Congenital syphilis and toxoplasmosis, congenital cytomegalovirus infection, HIV infection, Hepatitis B virus, and congenital rubella infection

Non Genetic

Maternal systemic lupus erythematosus, mercury poisoning, renal vein thrombosis, and neonatal alloimmunization.



Most congenital nephrotic syndrome cases are genetic due to monogenic defects of structural proteins that form the kidney filtration barrier.NPHS1 is expressed exclusively in the kidney podocyte, congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type does not have extrarenal findings.
