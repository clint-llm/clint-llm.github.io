The most common intrinsic cause of acute kidney injury is acute tubular necrosis. Acute tubular necrosis is most common in hospitalized patients and can occur following ischemia, exposure to toxins, or sepsis. Acute tubular necrosis is associated with high morbidity and mortality. This activity reviews the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of acute tubular necrosis, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the four clinical phases of acute tubular necrosis.
- Explain how to evaluate a patient for acute tubular necrosis.
- Explain how to manage a patient with acute tubular necrosis.
- Explain the importance of well-coordinated interprofessional teamwork in managing patients with acute tubular necrosis.
