The following are pathologies relating to the retina:

- Retinal detachment

- Retinal artery occlusion

- Age-related macular degeneration

- Glaucoma

- Diabetic retinopathy

- Cytomegalovirus retinitis

- Retinopathy of prematurity

- Retinitis pigmentosa

- Retinoblastoma

- Central serous chorioretinopathy

- Color vision deficiency

**Retinal Detachment**– the disconnection of the retinal layers occurring between the retinal pigment epithelium and the inner neural layers of the retina resulting in ischemia and subsequent photoreceptor degeneration. Permanent vision loss can be prevented with early detection and treatment, as retinal detachment is usually an ocular emergency.  Prominent risk factors for retinal detachment include myopia, trauma, cataract surgery, diabetic retinopathy, and old age.

**Retinal Artery Occlusion**– the blockage of either the central retinal artery or the branch retinal arteries resulting in retinal ischemia and severe vision loss. Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an ophthalmic emergency that is often caused by atherosclerosis or an embolism originating in the carotid arteries.

**Age-Related Macular Degeneration**– a neurodegenerative disease that compromises the junction between the neural retinal layers and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and results in severe central vision loss. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) categorizes into two types that include the non-neovascular atrophic type known as “dry” macular degeneration and the neovascular type that is known as “wet” macular degeneration. Dry AMD demonstrates characteristic lesions of the RPE as a result of the build-up of cellular debris called lipofuscin, which, in turn, causes the formation of the pathognomonic yellowish, amorphic deposits called drusen between the RPE and the underlying the Bruch membrane.

**Glaucoma**– the gradual degeneration of ganglion cells and their axons resulting in the loss of peripheral and, eventually, central vision.

**Diabetic Retinopathy**– retinal microvascular pathology that results from elevated blood sugar and presents with both type I diabetes and type II diabetes. It is the most common complication within diabetic eye disease which is the leading cause of blindness in adults under 75 years of age in developed countries.

**Cytomegalovirus Retinitis**– an opportunistic viral infection of the retina caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) which is a member of the herpes virus family. CMV retinitis is characterized by progressive retinal necrosis and scarring that can lead to retinal detachment, macular edema, and vision loss.

**Retinopathy of Prematurity**– the abnormal proliferation of blood vessels and subsequent incomplete vascularization of the retina in the developing newborn as a result of premature birth. The pathological growth of the retinal blood vessels is due to hypoxia and in extensive cases can lead to a retinal detachment which may result in blindness if left untreated.

**Retinitis Pigmentosa**– a group of inherited rod-cone dystrophies characterized by the gradual loss of rods from the periphery followed by the loss of cones that are more centrally located in the retina. This progressive degeneration often results in tunnel vision and, in extensive cases, complete vision loss. Retinitis pigmentosa is also known as hereditary retinal dystrophy and is the most common inherited retinal disease.

**Retinoblastoma**– a malignant tumor of the developing neural retina of young children due to a loss-of-function mutation in the Rb1 tumor suppressor gene.

**Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**– a macular disease where the retinal pigment epithelium is compromised, resulting in fluid leakage from the capillary lamina of the choroid into the subretinal area. The resulting macular edema causes central vision loss where 30 to 40% of cases have shown disease recurrence while most other cases are self-limiting.

**Color Vision Deficiency**– abnormal color perception and reduced color contrast sensitivity as a result of photopigment defects within the cone cells of the retina. The most common variation is red-green color blindness, which results from a deficit or abnormality in either the red (protans) or the green (deutrans) cone cells. All color vision disorders that contribute to red-green colorblindness are passed between generations in an X-linked recessive mode of inheritance, affecting males more than females.
