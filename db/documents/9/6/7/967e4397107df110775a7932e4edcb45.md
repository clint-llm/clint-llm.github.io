The saphenous nerve block is widely used in both emergency and perioperative settings for procedural anesthesia and post-procedural pain management. This regional anesthesia procedure is often used to block pain in the medial leg and ankle and can be performed under ultrasound guidance. This activity describes the contraindications, complications, indications, and techniques involved in performing a saphenous nerve block and highlights the role of a well-informed interprofessional team in caring for patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures involved in a saphenous nerve block.
- Outline the indications for a saphenous nerve block.
- Review the complications of a saphenous nerve block.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the safe performance of the saphenous nerve block and improve patient outcomes.
