Histology of lymph nodes can vary when there are endogenous insults. Histology can provide further information regarding the cause of lymphadenopathy when etiology is not clear during initial history taking, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation.

Below is a list of common causes of lymphadenopathy with associated histological findings:

- **Bacterial lymphadenitis:**Predominately neutrophilic infiltrate can be found within the sinus and medullary cords. Follicular hyperplasia can be seen as well.

- **Viral lymphadenopathy:**Infiltration by macrophages and lymphoid hyperplasia. Necrosis can be seen in those who are immunocompromised.

- **Sarcoidosis:**Non-caseating granulomas that replace the normal architecture of the lymph node

- **Non-Hodgkin lymphoma:**There is partial or widespread loss of the lymph node by a single cell lineage. Lymphoid cells can either proliferate in a disorderly manner or as those that mimic follicular center structures.

- **Hodgkin lymphoma:**Can be classified by the histological appearance noted below. These histological types are listed in order of most common to least.
