One defining feature of most atypical mycobacteria is that they are acid-fast bacilli. This staining property detected via the Kinyoun method is due to its hydrophobic mycolic acid outer layer. This mycolic acid layer allows them to form thick biofilms, enabling their survival in harsh environments that are not as well tolerated by other bacteria. These biofilms stunt the ability of antibiotics to penetrate bacteria effectively. They allow for survival in varying temperatures and protect the bacteria from being killed by water purifying chemicals such as chlorine, disinfectants, and cleaning products. Biofilms also allow the bacteria to survive in oxygen-rich and anaerobic environments. Another defining characteristic of mycobacteria is their slow rate of growth. Atypical mycobacteria are divided into rapid and slow-growing categories. The rapid-growing organisms take 7 to 30 days to grow on culture. The slow-growing organisms will take several weeks to months to demonstrate growth. The type of disease caused by these organisms is dependent on the mode of inoculation and the susceptibility of the host to infection. Pulmonary infection occurs via inhalation of aerosolized material containing the bacteria, whereas lymphadenitis is often caused by ingestion or penetration through the soft tissues, and skin and soft tissue infection by access through skin breakdown or by indwelling medical equipment.
