Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) encompasses several imaging techniques based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) developed for studying the arterial and venous systems. The benefits of an MRA in comparison to traditional angiography is that it is noninvasive, it lacks ionizing radiation exposure, it has the potential for a non-contrast examination and it has the ability of high-resolution volumetric images. The MRA gadolinium contrast material is less likely to cause an allergic reaction than the iodine-based contrast materials used for computed tomography scanning. This activity illustrates the technical aspects of MR angiography, its use, and its role in specific diagnostic scenarios.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications and contraindications of MR angiography.
- Describe the physics of the different MR angiography techniques.
- Outline the potential complications and clinical significance of MR angiography.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and the use of MR angiography to improve diagnostic outcomes.
