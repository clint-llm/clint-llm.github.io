Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is an X-linked genetic disorder that prevents the breakdown and excretion of ammonia; this allows ammonia to rise to toxic levels and affect the central nervous system. The organ most involved in the processing of ammonia is the liver. Liver mitochondria are the primary site of the urea cycle.
