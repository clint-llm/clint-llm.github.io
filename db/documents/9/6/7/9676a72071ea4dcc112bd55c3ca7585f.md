Several laboratory tests could be obtained to evaluate the degree of metabolic or cellular derangements.

- Serum PCP, acetaminophen, salicylate levels, to rule out common co-ingestions

- ECG, to rule out conduction abnormalities and arrhythmias

- Urine myoglobin and serum creatine kinase, to rule out the complication of rhabdomyolysis

- Imaging, to rule out other causes of altered mental status such as hemorrhage or secondary trauma

- CSF, to rule out central nervous system infection such as meningitis as a cause of neuropsychiatric symptoms

- CBC, to evaluate for leukocytosis

- CMP, to evaluate for blood urea nitrogen and creatinine elevation (renal compromise) or elevation in the liver function tests (hepatotoxicity)

- Fingerstick blood glucose, which can suggest hypoglycemia as a primary cause of mental status changes, or hypoglycemia secondary to ketamine toxicity
