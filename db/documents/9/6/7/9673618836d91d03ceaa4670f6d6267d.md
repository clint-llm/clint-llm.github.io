Benign occipital seizures are classified as an occipital onset epilepsy syndrome, which occurs in children with normal developmental milestones, normal general and neurological examination, and without any structural abnormalities in the brain. These seizures are limited to childhood-onset only. Under the International league against epilepsy (ILAE) classification, this is classified under childhood epilepsy syndromes.Â These are rare conditions with a very low incidence; however, their exact incidence is unclear.
