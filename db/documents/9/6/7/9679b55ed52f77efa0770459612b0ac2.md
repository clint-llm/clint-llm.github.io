Cryptococcal species are fungal pathogens which are encapsulated yeasts morphologically. Immune suppression is the major underlying mechanism that is involved in the causation of cryptococcal disease. Diseases like AIDS, diabetes, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, prolonged use of steroids and patients who undergo organ transplantation are commonly associated with the development of cryptococcal disease.
