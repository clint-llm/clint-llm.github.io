POCT occurs in a wide range of clinical settings, including inpatient, outpatient, and non-clinical settings, such as homes, airports, and cruise ships. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased the use of POCT, with billions of tests rapidly developed and distributed worldwide to help control the spread of the virus and facilitate the timely identification of infected individuals.

Various healthcare professionals, including physicians, nurses, medical technologists, and trained personnel, perform point-of-care testing to obtain immediate results that inform and guide clinical patient management decisions. Due to the diverse range of healthcare professionals and workflows involved in POCT, providing adequate training, facilitating interprofessional communication, and establishing clear guidance to ensure accurate testing and effective relay of test results to the treatment team is crucial.

Interprofessional committees dedicated to the implementation, execution, and continuous quality management of POCT have been recommended as they play a crucial role in enhancing the quality of healthcare delivery within entire health systems. These committees promote collaboration, standardization, and effective oversight of POCT practices, ultimately benefiting patient care.

One of the advantages of point-of-care testing (POCT) is the ability to update the patient's electronic medical record (EMR) with real-time test results. This enables the interprofessional team to access the most accurate and updated data, leading to a more comprehensive and functional clinical picture. As a result, healthcare professionals, such as pharmacists, can make more efficient and informed decisions regarding medication dosing, such as adjusting warfarin or aminoglycoside dosages, based on the patient's current status.

Using POCT facilitates closer monitoring of a patient's condition by nurses. With real-time access to test results through the EMR, nurses can promptly detect any significant changes and alert the attending physician or appropriate healthcare professionals for clinical intervention. Interprofessional coordination and collaboration among physicians, advanced practice practitioners, specialists, pharmacists, lab technicians, and nurses are crucial in utilizing POCT effectively and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. By working together, the healthcare team can make well-informed decisions and provide timely and targeted care based on the POCT results [Level 5]
