Often, EHEC associated with bloody diarrhea can resolve without any long-term consequences. The prognosis is severe mainly in patients developing HUS. After being treated for HUS, some children can never recover renal functions and thus require long-term replacement therapies for renal functions whereas those who recover renal functions are at risk of late development of renal disease. Some children may have residual extrarenal problems including neurological defects, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, pancreatic insufficiency, or gastrointestinal complications. HUS is thus a disease with substantial mortality and multisystem morbidity.Â This shows that importance should be given to extra-renal manifestations in the acute phase and renal functions should be monitored in long-term follow-up of HUS patients.
