TS should be suspected in patients presenting with signs and symptoms of systemic congestion such as leg swelling, abdominal swelling, shortness of breath, or unexplained blackout and dizziness. Although rare in isolation, the disease frequently accompanies other valvular heart diseases, such as rheumatic mitral stenosis. Left untreated, it can lead to complications such as heart failure, lethal rhythm disturbances, consequent stroke, and irreversible heart dysfunction, necessitating advanced therapies.Â Early detection is the key to successful treatment and outcomes.
