The diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome is typically a clinical one. Further investigation with a plain radiographÂ is usually not performed until symptoms fail to improve after one to two months of conservative management. Radiographs usually do not correlate well with the complaint, and the affected side vs. the unaffected side is usually difficult to differentiate.
