Before surgical correction of the ear, a fundamental understanding of the embryology and anatomy is necessary.  Development of the ear begins with the otic placode which presents during the 3rd week of gestation. Cartilage formation is present in week 7.  The hillocks of His fuse by week 12 and the antihelix then furls between weeks 12 to 16. Finally, the helix furls at 6 months. The hillocks of His are numbered one to six, and they include tragus, helical crus, helix, antihelix, antitragus, and lobule.
