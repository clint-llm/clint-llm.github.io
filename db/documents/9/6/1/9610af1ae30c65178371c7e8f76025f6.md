The most common adverse effects are headache, oral irritation, abdominal pain, lymphadenopathy, nasal congestion, and neck pain.

Notably, a beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection has been seen with the use of pancrelipase.

Rare (less than 1%) but severe side effects include cancer recurrence, anaphylaxis, duodenitis, and distal intestinal obstruction syndrome.

Warnings include fibrosing colonopathy (especially when doses exceed 2500 lipase units/kg of body weight per meal or greater than 10,000 lipase units/kg of body weight per day) and hyperuricemia as porcine-derived pancreatic enzyme products contain purines that may increase blood uric acid levels.

Pancrelipase has a pregnancy risk factor C; it can be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding. There is inadequate human data, but fetal/infant harm is not expected due to minimal maternal systemic absorption.

Since these are porcine-derived products, there is a theoretical risk of viral transmission with their use; this risk is minimized by adhering to proper dosing instructions. Long-term pancreatic enzyme replacement products (PERPs), some of which had been available for over 100 years, fell under a 2006  US FDA directive that porcine-derived PERP products required the pharmaceutical manufacturer to submit a new drug application s(NDA) for each of these products, the first of the commercial PERP products approved following the FDA requirement received approval in 2009.
