Infection with C. perfringens is often a benign self-limiting disease treated with fluid resuscitation. However, patients can present with or develop septic shock with myonecrosis, which will require antibiotics, blood pressure support, and surgical intervention. It is essential to educate the healthcare team to be vigilant so that rapid diagnosis and treatment can be initiated. An interprofessional team of clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), surgeons, radiologists, nurses, pharmacists, and physical therapists is needed to care for the patient. Also, the healthcare team can model effective communication to provide early detection of possible C. perfringens-mediated outbreaks and ensure that the necessary public health departments are aware to minimize spread. [Level 4]

Open communication between various medical disciplines in such cases, along with interprofessional input from nurses and pharmacists, is crucial to success in managing C. perfringens cases. In particular, an infectious disease specialized pharmacist may prove crucial to the team, as they can provide input to eh clinicians regarding antibiograms, antimicrobial regimens, and performing medication reconciliation. Nurses will administer antibiotics, particularly IV antibiotics, and are responsible for reporting to the rest of the team on patient progress or regression. The interprofessional approach to case management will yield the best patient results with care from multiple disciples. [Level 5]
