Prognosis:

The prognosis of cor pulmonale is variable-dependant upon the underlying pathology. The development of cor pulmonale as a result of a primary pulmonary disease usually heralds a poorer prognosis.

Highlights:

- Cor pulmonale is right ventricular dysfunction from long-standing pulmonary HTN.

- All primary lung diseases can cause PHTN and thus cor pulmonale.

- Dyspnea on exertion is the most common symptom.

- Primarily, treatment aims to treat the underlying condition.
