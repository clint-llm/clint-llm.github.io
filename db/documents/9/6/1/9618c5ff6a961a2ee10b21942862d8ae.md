Pituitary apoplexyÂ frequently poses a diagnostic dilemma. These patients may exhibit non-specific signs and symptoms such as headache, vomiting, and nausea. Sometimes, visual problems alert the patient of a more serious problem. The diagnosis is difficult to recognize without proper imaging studies.

While the neurosurgeon is almost always involved in the care of patients with pituitary apoplexy, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include an endocrinologist and ophthalmologist. The nurses are also vital members of the interprofessional team as they will monitor the patient's vital signs and assist with the education of the patient and family. Those patients with adrenal crisis have to be monitored in an intensive care unit until hemodynamically stable. In the postoperative period for pain, wound infection prophylaxis, and hormonal replacement, the pharmacist will ensure that the patient is on the right analgesics, hormonal replacements, and appropriate antibiotics. The neuroradiologist also plays a vital role in determining if pituitary apoplexy is secondary to hemorrhage or ischemia. Without providing a proper history, the neuroradiologist may not be sure what to look for or what additional radiologic exams may be needed.
