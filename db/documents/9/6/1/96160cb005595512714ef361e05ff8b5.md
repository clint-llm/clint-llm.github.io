Intracranial hypertension is a spectrum of neurological disorders where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure within the skull is elevated. Normal CSF pressure varies by age. In general, CSF pressure above 250 mm H20 in adults and above 200 mm H2O in children signifies increased intracranial pressure (ICP). It may be idiopathic or arise as a result of neurologic insult or injury. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of intracranial hypertension and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the most common causes of intracranial hypertension.
- Summarize the most common clinical features of intracranial hypertension.
- Outline the management strategies in patients with intracranial hypertension.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with intracranial hypertension.
