Fungal infections are commonly encountered in the oral and maxillofacial regions. They may present clinically in the oral cavity as a primary infection or as a manifestation of the infection dissemination. Most oral fungal infections are opportunistic in nature. Physical examination is vital for diagnosis, especially in immunocompromised patients. Clinical assessment of oral lesions, recognition, correction of the underlying predisposing factors, and administration of appropriate antifungal agents by the dental professional is the cornerstone of managing oral mycoses. This activity describes the evaluation of fungal infections of the oral cavity and highlights the potential role of the dentist in frontline teams for early diagnosis and treatment of the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiopathogenesis of oral mycoses, including candidiasis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and geotrichosis.
- Describe the epidemiology of oral mycoses: candidiasis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and geotrichosis.
- Outline the typical oral manifestation of fungal infections: candidiasis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and geotrichosis.

- Summarize the diagnosis and management of oral fungal infections: candidiasis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and geotrichosis.
