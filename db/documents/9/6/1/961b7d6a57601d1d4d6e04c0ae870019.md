Volkmann contracture, also known as Volkmann ischemic contracture, is a claw-like deformity of the hand named after the 19-century German doctor Richard von Volkmann. The name Volkmann ischemic contracture is self-explanatory. Ischemic refers to the possible etiology, and contracture indicates shortening. This condition is a permanent flexion deformity at the wrist and fingers that results in a claw-like presentation of the hand. This presentation is due to the permanent shortening of theÂ flexor group of muscles in the forearm and thus may result in pain on passive flexion of the wrist and fingers.

The upper limb can be divided into three sections: arm, forearm, and hand.

The flexor group of muscles in the anterior forearm may be divided into a superficial group and a deep group. The superficial group consists of:

- Pronator teres

- Flexor carpi radialis

- Flexor digitorum superficialis

- Palmaris longus

- Flexor carpi ulnaris

The deep group consists of:

- Flexor pollicis longus

- Pronator quadratus

- Flexor digitorum profundus

All these muscles are innervated by the median nerve. The exceptions are flexor carpi ulnaris (innervated by the ulnar nerve) and flexor digitorum profundus sharing a dual nerve supply from both ulnar and median nerves. Both these groups are involved in the development of Volkmann ischemic contracture.
