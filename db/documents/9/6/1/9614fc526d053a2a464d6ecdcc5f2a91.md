Patients with pulmonary hypertension are universally at higher risk during surgery; this is dependent on the severity and co-morbid conditions and differs from patient to patient. Specific risks during the peri-operative period include hemodynamic instability and right heart failure. The mechanism of right heart failure is increased pulmonary vascular resistance resulting in decreased cardiac output. Minimizing pulmonary vascular resistance peri-operatively is of central importance in preventing right ventricular failure. To date, there has not been data to support the treatment of right ventricular failure due to increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Pressor support has its limitations, as increasing peripheral vascular resistance may also increase pulmonary vascular resistance. A combination of inhaled iloprost or intravenous milrinone with oral sildenafil may reduce pulmonary vascular resistance without decreasing systemic blood pressure. Another option is using low-dose vasopressin to augment systemic vascular resistance and lower pulmonary vascular resistance through the release of nitric oxide from the pulmonary vessel endothelium.
