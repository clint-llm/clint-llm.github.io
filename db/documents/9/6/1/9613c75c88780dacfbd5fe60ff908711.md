Patients with flare-ups of Crohn disease typically present with abdominal pain (right lower quadrant), flatulence/bloating, diarrhea (can include mucus and blood), fever, weight loss, anemia. In severe cases, perianal abscess, perianal Crohn disease, and cutaneous fistulas can be seen.

When the small bowel is involved, it may present with diarrhea, malabsorption, weight loss, abdominal pain, and anorexia. Enterovesical fistulae may present with pneumaturia, recurrent urinary tract infections, and feculent vaginal discharge.

Crohn disease is associated with extraintestinal manifestations including episcleritis, uveitis, stomatitis, aphthous ulcers, liver steatosis, gallstones, cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis, urinary tract infections, arthritis (spine - sacral, knee, ankles, hips, wrist, elbows), ankylosing spondylitis, erythema nodosum, and pyoderma gangrenosum.

Thromboembolic disease is now recognized to be a common complication of Crohn disease. It may present with deep vein thrombosis, stroke, or pulmonary embolism.

The perineum must be examined in all patients. The inspection may reveal skin tags, ulcers, fistulas, scarring, and abscess. Frank perforation is rare but can be a presentation of Crohn disease. Finally, colon cancer is another complication of Crohn disease.
