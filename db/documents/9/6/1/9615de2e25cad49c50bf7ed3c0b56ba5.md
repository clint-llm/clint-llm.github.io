The exact prevalence of the cauliflower ear is not easily described in the literature. In general, the higher-level the athlete in an at-risk sport (wrestling, boxing, martial arts, rugby, etc.), the higher the prevalence of the cauliflower ear. One study of national-champion-level Finnish martial artists described a prevalence of auricular hematoma of 96%, with cauliflower ear seen in 84% of men.
