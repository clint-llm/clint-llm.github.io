Chlorpromazine is a low-potency antipsychotic drug that is usually started by a psychiatrist. However, the patient's follow-up on the drug can involve many healthcare professionals on the interprofessional team, including primary care providers, mid-level practitioners (NPs and PAs), psychologists, pharmacists, nurses, or emergency department personnel. Psychiatric nurses monitor patients and provide education, informing the prescriber of any concerns such as adverse events or therapeutic ineffectiveness. Pharmacists review the dosage, perform drug interaction checks, and also educate patients about the importance of compliance and side effects. Adequate communication is necessary among the providers for effective patient care and to limit any medical errors. Patients should be assessed for any movement disorder and blood work; ECGs should be obtainedÂ at regular visits.

If the side effects are present at any level, effective communications should take place, and referrals should be made to help the patients maintain an adequate quality of life. Patients should understand to limit the consumption of alcohol and consume a healthy meal while on the drug. Interprofessional teamwork is a necessary component of successful therapy with chlorpromazine. [Level 5]
