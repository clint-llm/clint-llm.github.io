Simulation provides a means for improving healthcare readiness, particularly concerning the care of pediatric patients.  The National Pediatric Readiness Project (NPRP) collaborative created a survey to measure pediatric readiness in U.S. EDs.

On an individual level, simulation can improve confidence and competence, making providers more personally ready for the task at hand. In one study, 12 low-fidelity simulations for nursing staff over three months helped improve Mean Clinical Performance scores by 74%.

Simulation can also serve as a marker for discrepancies in quality between institutions. A multi-centered prospective simulation study at 30 hospitals compared deviations from best practices of management of hypoglycemic seizure in 8 pediatric EDs and 22 general EDs. They found that pharmacologic errors were more frequent in general EDs, particularly related to dextrose concentration, dosing, and maintenance dextrose.
