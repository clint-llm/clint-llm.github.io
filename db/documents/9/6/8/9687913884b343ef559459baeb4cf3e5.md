The accessory flexor carpi ulnaris is a physiologic variant located in an anteromedial plane to flexor digitorium superficialis and between flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum superficialis extending to the radial aspect of flexor carpi ulnaris. In one case report, this variant originates at the medial epicondyle 1-cm posterolateral to the flexor carpi ulnaris origin and forms a separate tendon 5 cm above the proximal border of the flexor retinaculum.

There are various insertions and origins described for the accessory flexor carpi ulnaris. The brevis variant of the accessory flexor carpi ulnaris may insert into the pisiform, the hook of the hamate, abductor digiti minimi, or fifth metacarpal. Other variants of the accessory flexor carpi ulnaris described in the literature have been found to insert on the flexor pollicus longus tendon, flexor digitorum profundus tendon for the index finger, and triquetral bone.

These physiologic variants are important because abnormal anatomical structures may compress the ulnar nerve within the Guyon canal.
