An ultrasound technician conducts a transabdominal ultrasound and then follows with a transvaginal sonographic exam. Images are uploaded to a PACS system which is made available to the radiologist for review and interpretation. The image quality and thoroughness of evaluation are largely dependent on the technician's proficiency and perspective to identify pathology and relay the images in a way that sufficiently allows the radiologist to interpret the ultrasound. A chaperone may be offered to the patient as this decreases misinterpretation or miscommunication during the exam.
