The structures involved in the physiological act of swallowing develop early in fetal life, around the beginning of week four of embryological development. Around this time, the branchial or pharyngeal arches begin to form and will later give rise to the mature adult structures pertinent to swallowing. These adult structures form via involvements from all three primary germ cell layers and derive from one or more of the six pharyngeal arches, with arch five involuting early in development. The mucosal surfaces lining the pharynx derive from endoderm, the muscles, and bones pertinent to swallowing derive from mesoderm with coordination from the neural crest, and ectoderm gives rise to glands of the mouth, tooth enamel, and the nerves involved in the neural regulation of the sequence.
