The prognosis of a patient with a cystic hygroma will largely depend on the anatomical site and whether or not the patient develops any secondary complications. Cystic hygromas that are diagnosed prenatally generally have a poorer prognosis than those diagnosed after birth.

Cystic hygromas that are left without any intervention are likely to continue to enlarge and cause further complications.
