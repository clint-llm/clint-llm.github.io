The importance of addressing the issue of pediatric obesity is substantial, for it is often associated with various health complications, including type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia.

Thirty-two percent of US children and adolescents aged 2Â to 19 are overweight, and 17 percent of them are obese.

**Causes of Pediatric Obesity**

Genetics play a role in the development of childhood obesity but only accounts for less than 5 percent of its cases. It often has to be combined with environmental or behavior factors to influence weight. Thus it is not considered the major cause that is responsible for the dramatic increase in pediatric obesity.

Multiple environmental factors significantly contribute to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Decreased activity level among children and adolescents is significantly associated with obesity. In 2007, only 36 percent of US children and adolescents met the recommended levels of physical activity.
