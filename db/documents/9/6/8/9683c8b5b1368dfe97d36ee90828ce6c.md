Stretching of cardiac tissue can lead to conduction issues between cardiac myositis. In this, the left bundle is no exception. The chief cause of LBBB is dilated cardiomyopathy. Specifically, enlargement of the left ventricle causing stretching and separation of the Purkinje fibers. The cause of dilated cardiomyopathy itself is quite varied including ischemic, infective, valvular, infiltrative, and inflammatory causes. Ischemic is, however, the most common cause.
