Surgeons should assess each wound individually and utilize the reconstructive ladder to find a wound closure solution that is ideally the simplest, the fastest, and with the best aesthetic outcome.

Split-thickness skin grafts play an integral part of the reconstructive ladder. They are indicated when simpler methods of wound closure will not suffice, such as healing by secondary intention, primary closure, or negative pressure wound therapy.

Split-thickness skin grafts are otherwise indicated in acute skin loss (burn wounds, traumatic wounds, infection), chronic skin loss (leg ulcers), and as adjuncts to other procedures (to cover a muscle flap).
