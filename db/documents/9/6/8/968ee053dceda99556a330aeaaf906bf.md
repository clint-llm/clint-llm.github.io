Hairy leukoplakia is commonly found in HIV-positive homosexual men, particularly those who smoke. Studies have shown that HL can occur in up to 50% of patients who are not under any treatment for HIV, especially in those patients in whom CD4 count has reached less than 0.3 Ã— 10/L. No racial or age predilection has been observed for hairy leukoplakia.
