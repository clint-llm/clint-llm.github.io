Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy is a rare but severe cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy, caused by the accumulation of transthyretin fibrils in the myocardium. It can present with new or worsening heart failure or new conduction system disease. Due to the lack of knowledge and efficient diagnostic modalities, this disease was often missed in clinical settings. However, with the advent of contemporary cardiac imaging techniques and effective therapeutic options, early diagnosis and treatment are possible. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.
. 

- Explain the common cardiac and non-cardiac findings associated with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.
- Describe the typical imaging findings associated with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.
- Outline the available treatment options for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.
