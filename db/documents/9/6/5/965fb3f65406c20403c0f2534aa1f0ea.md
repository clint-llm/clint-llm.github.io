The first dorsal interosseous muscle receives vascular supply by the first dorsal metacarpal artery, which arises directly from the radial artery. The second, third, and fourth dorsal interossei receive blood supply from the second, third, and fourth dorsal metacarpal arteries, arising from the dorsal carpal arch. All dorsal metacarpal arteries bifurcate into their respective dorsal digital arteries and anastomose with the common palmar digital arteries.

The drainage of venous blood from the fingers of the hand is the digital palm veins, the dorsal digital veins, and the intercapitular veins, constituting a complex vascular network. These venous vessels carry blood in the superficial palmar venous arc and in the dorsal venous arc, which arches communicate with ulnar, cephalic and basilic veins.

Lymphatic drainage of the upper limbs divides into superficial and deep lymphatic drainage. Lymphatic plexuses of the skin of the palm and dorsum of the hand ascend with the cephalic and basilic veins towards the axillary and cubital lymph nodes,Â respectively. Deep lymphatic vessels follow the primary deep veins and eventually terminate in the humeral lymph nodes.
