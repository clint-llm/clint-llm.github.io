In the United States, the training standards and scope of practice of Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) are set by the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). New EMTs are taught the basics from the approved curriculum and are subject to both cumulative knowledge and skills assessments. Throughout their instruction, EMTs learn a variety of skills, but scene safety is a topic that permeates every lesson taught. During the beginning of their practical skills assessments, one of the first questions an EMT must learn to ask their instructor is, "Is the scene safe?"
