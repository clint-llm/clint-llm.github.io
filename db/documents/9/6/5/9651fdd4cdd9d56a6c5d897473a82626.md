History and physical in HIV-positive pregnant women should focus on identifying health issues in the mother who may directly or indirectly affect the health of the fetus. Special consideration should be given to any history of opportunistic infections, sexually transmitted infections, substance abuse, and vaccination status. New symptoms like fever should immediately alert the physician to the possibility of an undiagnosed opportunistic infection.

Physical examination should aim to pick up signs like thrush, which may be an indicator of an advanced HIV infection. Special attention should also be paid to signs of other STIs which may be present along with HIV. A thorough examination should be performed to look for any stigmata of liver disease.
