The etiology of chronic anemia is based on mean corpuscular volume (MCV). MCV is the average size of RBC.

******Microcytic anemia (MCV less than 80 femtoliters [fL])**

- Iron deficiency anemia: Most common cause of anemia

- Thalassemia

- Anemia of chronic disease

- Sideroblastic anemia

**Macrocytic Anemia (MCV greater than 100 fL)**

- Vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency

- Alcoholism and liver disease

- Myelodysplastic syndromes

- Drug-induced

- Hypothyroidism

**Normocytic anemia (MCV 80 to 100 fL)**

- Bone marrow suppression (aplastic anemia and myelophthisic anemia)

- Anemia of chronic disease

**Hemolytic anemia**

Hemolytic anemia may be due to hemolytic uremic syndrome, sickle cell, mechanical heart valves, disseminated intravascular coagulation, cold hemoglobinuria, and cold agglutinin disease.

Some conditions can present in more than one classification. For example, early iron deficiency can be normocytic. Anemia of chronic disease is mostly normocytic but can be microcytic too. Hemolytic anemia can cause either macrocytic or normocytic anemia.[2]
