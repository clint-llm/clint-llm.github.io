Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS or Pickwickian syndrome) is defined as the presence of awake alveolar hypoventilation characterized by daytime hypercapnia (arterial PaCO2 greater than 45 mmHg [5.9 kPa]) that is thought to be a consequence of diminished ventilatory drive and capacity related to obesity (BMI over 30 kg/m^2) in the absence of an alternate respiratory, neuromuscular, or metabolic explanation for hypoventilation. The management of Pickwickian syndrome is challenging and complex, and the clinical presentation of the disease should be suspected early to achieve good outcomes. This activity reviews the epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, clinical features, management, and prognosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of Pickwickian syndrome. 
- Outline the evaluation process for Pickwickian syndrome.
- Review the management options for Pickwickian syndrome.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to detect Pickwickian syndrome early and improve outcomes.
