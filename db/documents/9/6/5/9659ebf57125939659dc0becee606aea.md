Since no modality is perfect at identifying foreign bodies, a combination of high clinical suspicion, a thorough physical exam, and appropriate selection of the correct imaging modality will provide the best outcomes. A suggested algorithm begins with correctly identifying high-risk patients with a complete history and physical. Most foreign bodies are secondary to trauma or accidental injury, although special consideration is necessary for psychiatric patients who may purposefully insert foreign bodies into soft tissue. All wounds harbor the potential for foreign bodies, and if the clinician or the patient has a reasonable level of suspicion, the next step should be to obtain plain film radiographs with views in at least two anatomical planes. If the exam is negative and only radiopaque objects (gravel, glass, or metal) are suspected, a provider may stop here. However, if radiolucent objects such as thorns, wood, or plastic are suspected, an ultrasound examination of the area should be performed. If the foreign body is still not located, the clinician may choose to move on to CT or MRI, depending on the level of suspicion as well as the type of foreign body.
