In early chronic infection, proper administration of praziquantel can alleviate symptoms and minimize long term inflammation and granuloma formation. However, urogenital lesions are often only partially reversible depending on the degree and type of tissue damage. Sequalae of these lesions can also be chronic.

After treatment with praziquantel, a study of 527 women found no significant reduction in the “sandy patches” seen on colposcopy following treatment. Symptoms to include contact bleeding and vessel abnormalities also remained.

Prognosis also depends on the likelihood of reexposure and the need for subsequent treatment.
