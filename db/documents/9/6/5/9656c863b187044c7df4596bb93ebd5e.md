Patients need to understand the following points:

- Take all prescribed medications as directed.

- Consult with your clinician before taking any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal remedies.

- Be sure to keep all follow-up appointments, even if there are no symptoms.

- Maintain a healthy weight, but consult with your clinical team if exercise is permitted because some patients with aortic stenosis must exercise caution with exercise.

- If applicable, quit smoking.
