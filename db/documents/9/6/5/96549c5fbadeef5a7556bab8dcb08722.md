Necrotizing enterocolitis is caused by bacterial invasion into the intestinal wall. This leads to inflammation and cellular destruction of the wall of the intestine. If unrecognized and untreated, an intestinal perforation may occur, causing spillage of intestinal contents into the peritoneum and resulting in peritonitis. The specific mechanism and cause of this bacterial invasion are not yet understood. In premature neonates, gastrointestinal tract immaturity is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis.
