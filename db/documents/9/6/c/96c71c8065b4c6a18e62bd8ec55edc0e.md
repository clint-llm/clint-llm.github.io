Management of patients with ARDS requires the collaboration of the medical team with the goal of preventing further complications. Besides the focus on mechanical ventilation, management of these patients requires attention to treatment and recognition of the underlying cause, minimization of unnecessary procedures, prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism, stress ulcers, and aspiration. Additionally, one should ensure adequate nutrition via the enteral route when possible, and minimize the risk of acquired nosocomial infections.

Safe mechanical ventilation with avoiding further lung injury is the cornerstone of treatment in ARDS. Current guidelines recommend lung protective ventilation consists of low tidal volumes (4 to 8 ml/kg of ideal body weight) with a target of plateau airway pressure less than 30 cm of water.  Usually, tidal volume starts at 6ml/kg of ideal body weight and lowers further for 4 ml/kg if plateau airway pressure is less than 30 and could increase to 8 ml/kg if inspiratory plateau pressure below PEEP or patient is double triggering or in cases of severe hypercapnia and metabolic acidosis. This approach is associated with decreased mortality and improved clinical outcomes at 30 days as shown in different trials.

Several other measures are used in patients with severe ARDS. Early use of neuromuscular blockade and deep sedation in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS correlates with 90-day survival without increasing the risk for muscle weakness.

Several measures may have promising results in the management of ARDS and are under investigation by many ongoing randomized controlled trials. These measures include extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is reserved for very severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than or equal to 60). As well, PEEP titration guided by transpulmonary plateau pressure which involves estimating pleural pressures using esophageal manometer results in lower mortality in a small trial and is being investigated by two ongoing studies. Furthermore, other trials are studying ultra-low tidal volume (less than 4ml/kg IBW) with CO2 removal by extracorporeal methods which will allow for low pressure and avoiding hypercapnia and acidosis.
