The personnel typically involved in outpatient OAPS include the operator surgeon, anesthesiologist or credentialed anesthetist, a nurse, and nurse technician or other support staff. In addition, there should be, at minimum, two personnel who are certified in Basic Life Support (BLS), Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS), and, depending on the patient population, Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) as warranted. Local regulatory agencies may have varying requirements, and thus the regulations set forth by these organizations should be reviewed in detail.
