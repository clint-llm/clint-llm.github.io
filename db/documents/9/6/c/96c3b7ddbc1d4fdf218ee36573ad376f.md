EDTA is poorly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore is administered through intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion.

Due to side effects, chelation therapy is generally not used in adults with lead levels less than 45mcg/dl. However, in cases where patients are symptomatic, chelation is recommended.

**Adult Dosing**

Lead poisoning (20mcg/dl - 70mcg/dl): 1000 mg/m^2 daily given IV or IM

Lead poisoning (>70mcg/dl): EDTA is combined with dimercaprol; EDTA is administered before dimercaprol

Adults with lead nephropathy: 500 mg/m^2 every 24 hours for 5 days for creatinine levels of 2 to 3 mg/dl; 500 mg/m^2 every 48 hours for 3 doses for creatinine levels of 3 to 4 mg/dl; 500 mg/m^2 weekly for creatinine levels above 4 mg/dl

**Pediatric Dosing**

In children, patients are commonly given the combination of EDTA and dimercaprol. Chelation therapy is essential in patients with blood lead levels over 45 mcg/dl

Lead poisoning (45 mcg/dl to 70 mcg/dl): 25 mg/kg/day for 5 days

Lead poisoning (>70mcg/dl): IV administration of EDTA at 50 mg/kg/day in six doses

In children with cerebral edema, intravenous administration is avoided due to an increase in intracranial pressure. To avoid this, intramuscular administration is used in these patients
