Patients with selective IgA deficiency should be educated. They are recommended to wear a medical alert bracelet. Patients should be aware of potential anaphylactic reactions following transfusion of blood products. The suitable products for patients with selective IgA deficiency are those specially prepared from other IgA-deficient donors or saline-washed red blood cells. However, all special blood products should still be given with great caution, and the healthcare providers should be prepared for potential anaphylaxis. Furthermore, it is recommended that both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients be monitored periodically for anti-IgA antibodies.
