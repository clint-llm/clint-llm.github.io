Recent systematic reviews have shown conclusive evidence that endoscopic pituitary surgeries are safer compared with established complication rates of microsurgical approaches (transcranial or sublabial), though there is no difference in the efficacy between these approaches.

**Non-endocrine Complications**

**Intraoperative Complications**

Complications can occur at every stage of operation, though they are infrequent. Complications that may occur during the nasal stage of the approach are orbital injury, saddle nose deformity, anosmia, cribriform plate injury with CSF leak, and bleeding from injury to the sphenopalatine artery and its branches. Complications arising in the sphenoid sinus are sinusitis, injury to the carotid artery or optic nerve, and mucoceles. Complications encountered during tumor removal include CSF leak, diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism, meningitis, postoperative hematoma, injury to the carotid artery or optic nerve, vasospasm, ophthalmoplegia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and tension pneumocephalus.

**Immediate Postoperative Complications**

The most common complications are CSF leak, sinusitis, and meningitis.

**Long Term Complications**

Nasal congestion and mild nasal bleeding are anticipated in the immediate first 1 to 2 weeks after surgery. Other anticipated complications include pain over the nasomaxillary region, nasal crusting, mucosal scarring, periorbital edema, and numbness of the upper incisors. Though transient, these complications are more common in the sublabial approach compared to transnasal approaches. They arise due to the extensive dissection involved and injury to the infraorbital nerve and its branches. The presence of nasal splints or packs often compounds postoperative morbidity.  Mucosal damage can impair ciliary function and lead to sinusitis. Some patients also report hyposmia. Long-term complications include nasal synechiae (treated with radiofrequency ablation, nasal isolation, corticosteroids, and nasal irrigation) and septal perforation, which may warrant endoscopic repair operation using mucoperiosteal pedicle flap of the floor of the nasal cavity if the patient is symptomatic. Atrophic rhinitis may need regular nasal endoscopic cavity cleaning, soothing nasal drops, and nasal irrigation.

**Endocrine Complications**

The most common endocrine complication in the early postoperative period is abnormalities of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, which includes diabetes insipidus (DI) and inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). DI is the most common endocrine complication after sellar surgery, with the postoperative incidence of DI ranging between 5% and 35%.

SIADH is the most common cause of hyponatremia after pituitary surgery and occurs in 9% to 30 % of patients undergoing a transsphenoidal approach.

Acute management of postoperative hypopituitarism involves adequate glucocorticoid replenishment with fluid and electrolyte replacement. The glucocorticoid doses are tailored in the perioperative period according to the preoperative hormone levels and stress levels and subsequently tapered to preoperative doses. The key principle is to provide adequate glucocorticoid coverage before and 24 hours after surgery.

**Postoperative Management**

Patients are monitored in an intensive care unit in the immediate postoperative period with monitoring for neurological deterioration, epistaxis, visual dysfunction, diabetes insipidus (DI), and hypotension secondary to acute hypocortisolism. Desmopressin and/or steroid replacement need to be continued postoperatively if the patient was already on it, along with strict electrolyte surveillance. If the preoperative pituitary function was normal, serum cortisol and prolactin levels are measured on the morning after the procedure. In the case of a secretory tumor, non-stimulatory hormone levels (cortisol, prolactin, or GH) are obtained on postoperative days 1 and 2. Serum sodium and urine output are serially monitored for the next 48 hours. If the cortisol levels are low, then steroid replacement is initiated. If new onset DI is suspected, oral fluid management with water may suffice if the patient is awake and stable. If desmopressin is started, then it requires close monitoring by an endocrinologist. Usually, patients are discharged by postoperative day 2 or 3.

The need for nasal packs is dependent on the type of reconstructive technique and the surgeon's choice (used only in a minority of cases). The nasal pack is removed on postoperative day 1. Septal splints are warranted in traditional sublabial-transeptal-transsphenoidal approaches and removed on postoperative days 5 to 7. The first follow-up visit is 1 week after the procedure, where postoperative day 7 serum sodium levels are reviewed to rule out occult hyponatremia. Serial nasal endoscopies are done for debridement and to assess healing. The frequency of follow-up visits is determined by nasal crusting and maintenance of nasal hygiene with irrigation. Routine early postoperative imaging is not done in most patients. The majority of patients undergo MRI after three months of the procedure.
