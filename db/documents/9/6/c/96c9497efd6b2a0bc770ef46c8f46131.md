Pyocytis will typically present with suprapubic pain, malodorous discharge from the urethra, and fevers for several days prior to admission.

Patients presenting with signs of systemic infection and accompanying risk factors should be investigated and treated for pyocystis. These risk factors include surgical defunctioning of the bladder or end-stage renal failure. Alternatively, patients with pyocystis mayÂ present with a low-grade fever and some abdominal or pelvic discomfort and may be systemically well. There is a spectrum of presentations for this condition depending on the severity and duration of infection.

On examination of the abdomen, there may be a palpable, tender suprapubic mass and inguinal lymphadenopathy.
