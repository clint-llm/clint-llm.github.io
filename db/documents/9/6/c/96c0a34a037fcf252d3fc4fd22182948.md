Histopathology does not routinely help in diagnosing a patient with diabetic gastroparesis. However, the findings seen on animal models and studies involving human pathology specimens have helped us understand the disease process better. Full-thickness biopsies, which are needed to diagnose changes in the deeper layers of the stomach wall, are not practical to be used as a diagnostic tool. In special studies done using full-thickness gastric biopsies, the findings included an inflammatory infiltrate, a reduction in the number of nerve cell bodies and ICCs in the myenteric plexus, and fibrosis.
