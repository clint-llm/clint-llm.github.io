Hypoxia is a state in which oxygen is not available in sufficient amounts at the tissue level to maintain adequate homeostasis; this can result from inadequate oxygen delivery to the tissues either due to low blood supply or low oxygen content in the blood (hypoxemia). Hypoxia can vary in intensity from mild to severe and can present in acute, chronic, or acute and chronic forms. This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, and presentation of hypoxia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the various etiologies of hypoxia.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with hypoxia.
- Outline the management options available for hypoxia.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with hypoxia.
