Personnel necessary for LVRS include functional operating room staff to perform thoracic surgery. This includes a thoracic surgeon, surgical assistant, operating room nurses, and anesthesiologist. Post-operative care should be performed by those experienced in taking care of post-surgical thoracic surgery patients, which usually includes pain control, chest tube management, and aggressive bowel regimen. Patients with severe emphysema are usually followed by a pulmonologist and should maintain pre-operative and post-operative follow-up.
