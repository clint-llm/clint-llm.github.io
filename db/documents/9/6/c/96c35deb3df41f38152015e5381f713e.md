Venlafaxine works by increasing serotonin levels, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the brain by blocking transport proteins and stopping their reuptake at the presynaptic terminal. This action leads to more transmitters available at the synapse and ultimately increasesÂ the stimulation of postsynaptic receptors. SNRIs act primarily upon serotonergic and noradrenergic neurons but have little or no effect upon cholinergic or histaminergic receptors. Venlafaxine is a bicyclic phenylethylamine compound.
