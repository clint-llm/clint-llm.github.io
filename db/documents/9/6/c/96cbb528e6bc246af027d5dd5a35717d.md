Coronary artery disease is very common in both developed and developing worlds. In one study, it was estimated that CAD represented 2.2% of the overall global burden of disease and 32.7% of cardiovascular diseases. It costs over 200 billion dollars annually to the health care system in the United States. It is estimated that 7.6% of men and 5.0% of women in the US lived with coronary artery disease from 2009 to 2012 based on the national health survey done by the American Heart Association (AHA). This amount to 15.5 million Americans afflicted with the disease during this time.

The incidence of CAD is observed to rise with age, regardless of gender. In the ONACI registry in France, the incidence of CAD was about 1% in the 45 to 65 age group, which increased to about 4% as the age group reached 75 to 84 years.
