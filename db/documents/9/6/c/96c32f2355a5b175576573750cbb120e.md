Untreated otosclerosis can gradually progress towards considerable hearing loss, but complete deafness is unusual.

Surgical correction of otosclerosis can result in a total sensorineural loss in the operated ear, but it is an infrequent occurrence. Complications of the surgery that may arise are injury of the facial nerve and tinnitus. Although short-lived, an unpleasant taste can also occur, owing to the proximity of the chorda tympani when performing surgery. Moreover, about the effect of the introduced prosthesis, specific adverse outcomes that may arise are the erosion and necrosis of the incus and granuloma formation.
