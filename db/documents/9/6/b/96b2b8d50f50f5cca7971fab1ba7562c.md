VSR is more likely to occur in patients who are older, female, hypertensive, have chronic kidney disease, and have no prior history of smoking. It commonly occurs in the setting of aÂ first myocardial infarction (MI) in the background of delayed or absent reperfusion therapy. Angiography usually reveals an absence of collateral circulation to the infarct zone. Because previous ischemia induces myocardial preconditioning, decreasing the likelihood of transmural myocardial necrosis and septal rupture, patients with evidence of diabetes mellitus, chronic angina, or previous MI are less likely to experience a rupture. VSR may develop within 1 to 14 days post-STEMI; however, its incidence usually shows a bimodal peak, which is within the first 24 hours or 3 to 5 days post-MI.
