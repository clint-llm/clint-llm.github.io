As previously mentioned, fexofenadine is a metabolite of terfenadine, which proved to have cardiotoxic effects. Terfenadine blocked cardiac potassium channels, which, when taken in large doses or with other medications such as ketoconazole, caused prolonged QT intervals. Prolonged QT interval can lead to fatal arrhythmias. According to FDA guidelines, fexofenadine has replaced terfenadine in the United States because it does not block potassium channels. In multiple studies, it did not cause any arrhythmias or significantly prolonged QT intervals.

Despite the findings of these studies, other case reports have found a relationship between fexofenadine and QT-interval elongation and ventricular arrhythmia though it is very rare. It is worth mentioning that using fexofenadine with hepatic CYP3A4 blockers (such as erythromycin and ketoconazole) can increase its concentration in the blood, and combined use with drugs such as rifampin and troglitazone will decrease the concentration. These effects are likely due to the interaction between these compounds and the P-glycoprotein transporter, removing fexofenadine from the blood.

There is no antidote for fexofenadine.Â In case of overdose, treatment is mainly supportive. Contact the poison control center or medical toxicologist if multiple substance exposure is suspected.
