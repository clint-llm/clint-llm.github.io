Rickettsia akari is the etiologic agent of rickettsialpox. R. akari is transmitted by the house mouse mite, Liponyssoides sanguineus. One week after a mite bite, a vesicle appears, which dries up, leaving an eschar. The rash is often papular but can also be vesicular, hence the name rickettsialpox. Like other rickettsiae in the genus, R. akari is an intracellular gram-negative pathogen with features intermediate between viruses and bacteria. R. akari was initially classified as a member of the spotted fever group (SFG) of rickettsia, but it is now placed in the transitional group, which has features of both the spotted fever group and the typhus group (TG) of rickettsiae. R. akari has a DNA plasmid-like Rickettsia felis of the transitional group.
