The underlying premise behind hospice care is to focus on the quality of care to patients who present with a life-limiting illness who are not expected to live more than six months instead of seeking treatment the prolong the condition or seek a medical cure. Hospice focuses on the entire person and supports the family by combining all elements of physical, psychological, and spiritual needs. The provision of hospice care can occur in an acute care setting; however, generally, the patients are cared for in a private residence or another residential living facility.
