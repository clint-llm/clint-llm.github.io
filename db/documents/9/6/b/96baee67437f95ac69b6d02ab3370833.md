Mechanisms of signaling molecule's interactions are a subject of an ongoing investigation. This section will serve as a summary of mediators, which are discussed above, as well as describe other signaling molecules identified in esophageal embryogenesis.

**Ventral-Dorsal Axis**

The notochord is a major structure that participates in the formation of the ventral-dorsal axis. Of the mediators produced by the notochord, Noggin expression plays a well-described role in setting up the ventral-dorsal axis within the embryo. The ventral portion of the foregut begins to express NKx2-1 with BMP signaling, BMP's action gets antagonized by Noggin activity and mediates continued specification and differentiation of the respiratory system from the foregut.

**Wnt5a-Ror2 Signaling**

Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling within subepithelial intercalated smooth muscle cells is thought to be involved in tubulogenesis of the esophagus as well as the trachea. This signal-receptor pair plays key roles in elongation for the trachea and esophagus.

**Hedgehog Signaling**

Hedgehog is another potent mediator that plays critical roles in the development of the esophagus and other structures. Aberrant activation of hedgehog correlates with numerous developmental disorders and cancers of the brain and GI tracts. Of the major components of hedgehog signaling, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) seems to play the most prominent role in the esophagus and tracheal organogenesis.

**BMP Signaling**

Broadly, BMP signaling has been studied in two distinct areas of esophageal embryogenesis. The Noggin inhibits the activity of BMP, and thus in the early foregut, is preferentially active on ventral cells. BMP4 appears to play a role in maintaining the specification of foregut cells, which have already expressed NKx2-1. Studies in mice have shown that knockout of BMP4 results in loss of expression of NKx2-1 after specification, indicating BMP4 signalings' role is predominantly in the outgrowth of the respiratory tract from the ventral foregut rather than setting up the initial specification for respiratory differentiation. BMP signaling also plays a role in epithelialization of the esophagus. Recall the foregut has a columnar epithelium and must make the transition into a stratified nonkeratinized squamous epithelium, the epithelium of the esophagus. BMP7 plays a major role in this transition.

**Factors of Epithelial and Mesenchymal Development**

Studies of knockout mice have revealed numerous other signaling factors for the esophagus. The most prominent of these signaling molecules include Keap1, P63, Foxp1, Foxp2, and HoxC4. These factors seem to play dramatic roles in the differentiation of esophageal epithelium as well as esophageal muscular development. Studies of Foxp1 and Foxp2 indicate that these molecules are critical players in the development of smooth and striated muscle of the esophagus and stomach.
