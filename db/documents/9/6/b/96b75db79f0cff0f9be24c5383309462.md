No further diagnostic tests or treatment are considered necessary as a clinical exam alone is sufficient for diagnosis. However, it is important to maintain suspicion for these lesions and to have the patient bear weight to observe the papules; otherwise, the lesions can be easily overlooked. At times, an unusual presentation may confound the diagnosis. One proposed tool for a correct diagnosis is using high-frequency ultrasound (US) to confirm findings found on the exam. On ultrasound (US), isoechoic lesions within the underlying subcutaneous cellular tissue will be seen. Ultrasound provides an easy, non-invasive means to confirm the diagnosis.

A consultation with an orthopedist or podiatrist might be necessary if the diagnosis is uncertain, if patients exhibit significant symptoms, or if a second opinion is needed in disabled patients. A cardiology consult may be indicated if the examination reveals evidence of mitral valve prolapse.
