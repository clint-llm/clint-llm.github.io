Treatment options are based on the onset scenarios: acute or chronic.

**Acute or Abortive Treatment**

Acute treatment aims to stop the progression of a headache. It has to be treated quickly and with a large single dose. Oral agents can be ineffective in patients with migraine-induced gastric stasis. Therefore, parenteral medication could be the rule for some patients, especially the ones with nausea or vomiting.

- **NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs):**Ibuprofen (400 to 600 mg), naproxen (275 to 825 mg), diclofenac (65 mg), aspirin (900 to 1000 mg), or acetaminophen (1000 mg).

- **Triptans (the first line in patients with allodynia):**Sumatriptan (administered as a subcutaneous injection of 6 mg, a nasal spray of 20 to 40 mg over 24 hours, a nasal powder of 10 to 30 mg over 24 hours, or orally 50 to 100 mg once), zolmitriptan 10 mg per 24 hours (nasal 2.5 to 5 mg as a single dose and oral 2.5 mg as a single dose), eletriptan, rizatriptan, almotriptan. They might be used with or without naproxen for moderate to severe attacks. Unlike NSAIDs, patients who do not respond well to one triptan may respond to another; therefore, therapy may be individualized.
- To avoid medication overuse, triptans should be limited to less than ten days of use within a month.
- Because of the activation of the 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors on coronary arteries and cerebral vessels, there are recommendations against its use in patients with ischemic stroke, ischemic heart disease, poor-controlled hypertension, angina, pregnancy, hemiplegic or basilar migraine. In these patients with cardiovascular risks, the best-suited medication is a selective serotonin 1F receptor agonist that does not produce vasoconstriction; lasmiditan.
- It is recommended to monitor therapy if the patient takes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or selective serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors because of the risk of serotonin syndrome.
- The combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) with triptan appears more effective than using either drug class alone. In a single tablet, sumatriptan succinate 85 mg and naproxen sodium 500 mg may be prescribed as initial therapy.

- **Antiemetics:**Metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, or prochlorperazine. They are generally used as adjunctive therapy with NSAIDs or triptans to decrease nausea and vomiting, especially in the emergency department. Diphenhydramine can also be added to prevent dystonic reactions (mostly metoclopramide).

- **Calcitonin-gene-related peptide antagonists:**Rimegepant (75 mg as a single dose) or ubrogepant could be considered in patients who don't respond to conventional treatment or those with coronary artery disease.

- **Selective serotonin 1F receptor agonist:**US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved lasmiditan oral tablets in October 2019 for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. The initial dose of lasmiditan is 50 or 100 mg, particularly effective for patients who cannot use triptans due to cardiovascular risks. The dose may be increased to 100 or 200 mg per requirement, but no more than one dose should be taken over 24 hours. However, one significant side effect is dizziness. So patients should not engage in potentially hazardous activities or drive a motor vehicle for at least eight hours after each dose of lasmiditan.

- **Ergots:**Ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous, and intranasal use) are recommended for acute attacks as a parenteral administration and effective as bridge therapy for medication overuse headache and status migrainosus. Ergotamine has not demonstrated particular effectiveness yet and can present significant side effects, including cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, and peripheral ischemic complications.

- **Dexamethasone**can reduce the recurrence of early headaches but does not provide immediate relief.

- **Transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation**can reduce intensity.

- **Transcranial magnetic stimulation**is proved effective as a second-line treatment, with no serious side effects. It can also be offered as an option to treat chronic migraines. It is contraindicated in patients with epilepsy.

- **Nonpainful remote electric neurostimulation**could be considered a first-line treatment in some patients.

- **Peripheral nerve blocking**(occipital plexus and sphenopalatine ganglion) may also be tried.

**Prophylactic or Preventive Treatment**

Preventive treatment aims to reduce attack frequency, improve responsiveness to acute attacks' severity and duration, and reduce disability.

- Indications for preventive treatment are:

- Frequent or long-lasting headaches
- Attacks that cause significant disability and reduced quality of life
- Contraindications or failure to acute therapies
- Significant adverse effects of abortive therapies
- Risk of medication overuse headache
- Menstrual migraine (along with short-term premenstrual prophylaxis)
- Hemiplegic migraine
- Brainstem aura migraine
- Persistent aura without infarction
- Migrainous infarction

- Preventive treatment agents are the following:

- Beta-blockers: Metoprolol and propranolol - especially in hypertensive and non-smoker patients
- Antidepressants: Amitriptyline and venlafaxine - especially in patients with depression or anxiety disorders and insomnia
- Anticonvulsants: Valproate acid and topiramate - especially in epileptic patients
- Calcium channel blockers: Verapamil and flunarizine - especially in women of childbearing age or patients with Raynaud's phenomenon
- Calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists: Erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab

**Alternative Treatment**

- Lifestyle changes; must be a commitment from the patient; however, social support is of great importance to improve mental health to help the patient's involvement.

- Regular exercise

- Yoga

- Relaxation training

- Cognitive-behavioral therapy

- Biofeedback

- Reduction of triggers

- Detoxification

- Butterbur

- Melatonin
