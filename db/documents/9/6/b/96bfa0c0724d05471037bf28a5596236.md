A dilated pore of Winer is characterized histopathologically by a markedly dilated follicular infundibulum extending deeply into the dermis.  The cavity is filled with lamellar keratin material.  It is lined by epithelium that is atrophic near the ostium and acanthotic at the deeper portion of the invagination.  Radiating off of the epithelium are regularly spaced, small, finger-like epithelial projections pushing into the surrounding dermis.  These finger-like projections do not contain keratin cysts, ducts, or hair shafts.
