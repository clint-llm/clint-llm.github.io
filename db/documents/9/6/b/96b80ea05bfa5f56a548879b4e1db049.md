Ophthalmia neonatorum and primary blepharoconjunctivitis respond well with antiviral treatment and have a very good prognosis with the least complications. HSV epithelial keratitis resolves within 1Â to 2 weeks with topical antiviral therapy. Stromal keratitis and iritis occur in 25% of people affected with epithelial keratitis and often recurs and results in corneal scarring, glaucoma, neovascularization, and corneal melting leading to irreversible loss of vision. The Australian corneal graft registry has reported that 4% of their failed grafts are due to HSV ophthalmicus.
