The drug's administration is usually via intravenous infusion over 15 minutes. It is not recommended as a push.

The suggested dosage ratio of dexrazoxane to doxorubicin is 10 to 1 (e.g., 500 mg/m^2 dexrazoxane to 50 mg/m^2 doxorubicin). It is advisable to give dexrazoxane before doxorubicin. Administration of doxorubicin within half an hour after the completion of dexrazoxane infusion is recommended.

Administer the diluted solution of dexrazoxane in lactated ringer's intravenously over a quarter of an hour (15 minutes) before doxorubicin. Doxorubicin is usually infused approximately 30 minutes after dexrazoxane. It is not advisable to use dexrazoxane with a non-anthracycline chemotherapy regimen.

For extravasation prevention, the proposed dosage and rate is 1,000 mg/minute IV within 6 hours post extravasation. This administration is then followed with doses of 1,000 mg/minute and 500 mg/minute after 2 and 3 days, respectively.

Dosing mechanism differs in people with renal or hepatic impairment.

**Dosing in Renal Impaired Patients:**

The dose of dexrazoxane requires a reduction in patients who have moderate to significant renal impairment (e.g., creatinine clearance lower than 40 mL/min) by 50%, i.e., dexrazoxane to doxorubicin ratio reduced to 5 to 1 (e.g., 200 mg/m^2 dexrazoxane: 40 mg/m^2 doxorubicin).

**Dosing in Hepatic Impairment:**

In a patient with hyperbilirubinemia, it is necessary to decrease the dosage of doxorubicin, leading to a subsequent dosage reduction of dexrazoxane in this group of patients, while still maintaining the 10 to 1 ratio.

Dexrazoxane is recommended for use only in patients who have been administered an increasing doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m^2, or doses of epirubicin >550 mg/m^2 and are continuing with anthracycline therapy.
