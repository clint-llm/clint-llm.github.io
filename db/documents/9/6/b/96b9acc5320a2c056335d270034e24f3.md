The blood vessels pass through the foramina present in the wings of the sphenoid bone. The ophthalmic artery passes through the optic canal to enter the orbit. The ophthalmic veins pass out of the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. The accessory meningeal artery passes through the foramen ovale to enter the skull. The foramen spinosum allows passage for the middle meningeal artery and vein. Only some small meningeal arterial branches and veins pass through the foramen lacerum, though cartilage may close it off.
