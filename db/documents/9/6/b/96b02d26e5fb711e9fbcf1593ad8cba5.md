Neurotmesis is caused by transection of a nerve and is the worst degree of peripheral nerve injury. In neurotmesis, the entire nerve, including the endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium, is completely severed. Neurotmesis leads to the rupture of the axon, myelin sheath, and connective tissues. The prognosis for spontaneous recovery is poor without surgical intervention.

Sunderland’s fifth-degree injury corresponds to the definition of neurotmesis in Seddon’s classification and represents the highest degree of nerve injury, with a complete nerve defect.

Neurapraxia is a nerve injury commonly induced by focal demyelination and/or ischemia and is the mildest type of peripheral nerve injury. In neurapraxia, the conduction of nerve impulses is blocked in the injured area, motor and the sensory connection is lost, but all morphological structures of the nerve stump, including the endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium, remain intact. Axonotmesis is a comparatively more severe type of peripheral nerve injury and usually is caused by crush, stretch, or percussion. In axonotmesis, the epineurium is intact, while the perineurium and endoneurium may be disrupted. The axon is separated from the soma, and the axon and the myelin sheath are disrupted. Wallerian degeneration occurs in the axon stump distal to the injury site within 24 to 36 hours after peripheral nerve injury. The remaining surrounding stroma benefits axonal elongation along with the intact tissue framework.

After neurotmesis, Schwann cells adaptively respond to axonal interruption, switching from a highly myelinated state to a de-differentiated state. De-differentiated Schwann cells engulf axon and myelin debris and form a regeneration path for axon growth. Moreover, activated Schwann cells secrete a group of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 alpha, and leukemia inhibitory factor, to recruit macrophages and facilitate debris digestion. Schwann cells also secrete a group of neurotrophic factors, including nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, to encourage neuron survival and axon elongation.

Needle electromyography (EMG) is the most sensitive electrodiagnostic study for motor axon loss, and with lesions of great severity, low-amplitude motor responses appear. The motor response amplitude decrement begins around days 2–3 and is complete by day 6. This reflects the fact that neuromuscular junction degeneration precedes axon degeneration, and the motor responses are dependent on neuromuscular junction transmission.
