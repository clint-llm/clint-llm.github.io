Laboratory tests should be directed to the possible underlying etiology. For example, laboratory studies to evaluate for suspected liver disease.

Echocardiogram with agitated saline bubble study is a very useful initial test to evaluate the presence of intracardiac or extra-cardiac shunts. The appearance of microbubbles in the left atrium during the first 3 beats after opacification of the right chambers suggests an intracardiac shunt whereas the appearance of microbubbles in the left side after more than 3 to 6 beats suggests an extracardiac shunt, for example, an intrapulmonary shunt like in hepatopulmonary syndrome). A Valsalva maneuver may help increase the right-to-left shunting. Other tests to evaluate shunts include a contrast-enhanced echocardiogram, macroaggregated albumin scintigraphy scan, and an invasive angiogram.

Chest plain radiograph may show some underlying lung disease that can explain the platypnea, but this test may not be sensitive.

CT scan in case of suspected lung abnormality may give further details. For example, CT with contrast may show arteriovenous malformations that are causing the right-to-left shunt.
