Several recent reports in the general media and scientific and professional journals have documented instances of infection control breaches in dental care settings, resulting in state health department investigations and patient notifications about possible infection. These breaches are the result of failures in compliance with accepted infection control practices and policies. Even though all breaches do not result in healthcare-associated infections, they are unacceptable, particularly when we have the knowledge and ability to prevent them. We must take the proper precautions to stop this needless suffering, cost, and harm to the patients we serve, as well as the damage it causes to our professional credibility. Lack of infection control is life-threatening for both the patient and the dental professional and requires more effort. Formal programs in "Infection Control and Safety" must be developed and strictly followed by the entire dental health care professional.
