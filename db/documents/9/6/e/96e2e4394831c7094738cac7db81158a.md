Linitis plastica is mostly asymptomatic till advanced disease; this is attributed to the weak sensitivity of the stomach to the limitation of its volume. The symptomatic cases mostly present with dyspepsia (55%) along with vomiting (33%) associated with regurgitation of food from the esophagus and dysphagia (33%) due to the infiltration of the submucosa and muscle layer with gastric wall stromal thickening, thus causing massive limitation in the stomach distensibility.

Symptoms include pain in the stomach, the feeling of a lump in the epigastrium, and unintentional weight loss.
