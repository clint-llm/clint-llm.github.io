Flexor pollicis longus receives its blood supply from the anterior interosseous artery, a branch of the ulnar artery. As the ulnar artery passes beneath the ulnar head of the pronator teres muscle, the common interosseous artery branches off moving laterally and deep before quickly bifurcating into the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries. The anterior interosseous artery courses distally along the interosseous membrane, with the anterior interosseous nerve (AIN), between the flexor pollicis longus and flexor digitorum profundus.

Branches of the median nerve artery provide the blood supply to the pre-digital portion of the FPL tendon. The digital portion of the FPL tendon is supplied via vincula: V1 and V2. V1 is located immediately proximal to the MCP joint and originates from either the princeps pollicis artery or both digital arteries. V2 is located at the IP joint and originates from both digital arteries.

Lymphatic drainage from the hand and forearm occurs via superficial channels that run alongside the cephalic and basilic veins as well as deep channels that run alongside arteries. The lymphatics drain to lymph nodes within the elbow, including the cubital and epitrochlear lymph nodes, before predominantly draining into the axillary or infraclavicular lymph nodes.
