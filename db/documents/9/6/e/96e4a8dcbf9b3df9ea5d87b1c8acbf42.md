Ninety percent of Proteus infections occur as a result of P. mirabilis, and these are considered community-acquired infections.

Though not a common cause of nosocomial infections, Proteus species have also been shown to cause infection from the colonized skin and oral mucosa of patients and personnel working in a hospital or long-term care facility.

Patients who acquire an infection in the hospital, have a history of recurrent infections, structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, or urethral instrumentation have a greater risk of acquiring an infection by Proteus (in addition to other organisms such as Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Staphylococci, and Enterococci).

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur as a result of bacterial migration along the mucosal sheath of the catheter or up the catheter lumen from contaminated urine.
