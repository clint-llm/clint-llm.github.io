Papillary muscle rupture is a rare and potentially fatal complication that typically follows a myocardial infarction or occurs secondary to infective endocarditis. Acute rupture frequently results in severe mitral valve regurgitation, acute life-threatening cardiogenic shock, and pulmonary edema. Papillary muscle dysfunction leads to regurgitation of blood through the valves causing the backward flow of blood and can lead to left or right-sided heart failure. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of papillary muscle rupture and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the causes of papillary muscle rupture.
- Describe the typical presentation of papillary muscle rupture.
- Outline the treatment options for papillary muscle rupture.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving coordination and communication to advance prompt diagnosis and immediate treatment of papillary muscle rupture.
