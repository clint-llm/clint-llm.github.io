Pericardiocentesis is a procedure performed to remove pericardial fluid from the pericardial sac. It is often performed in the setting of pericardial tamponade to correct hypotension due to decreased stroke volume from extrinsic compression of the chambers of the heart.

Pericardiocentesis is performed using one of several approaches and may be performed blind or using real-time imaging adjuncts such as transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) or fluoroscopy to reduce the risk of procedural complications. The procedure may be performed at the bedside or in the cardiac catheterization lab. The decision on where to perform the procedure and what adjuncts to use is based on the stability of the patient, comfort of the operator, and availability of imaging adjuncts.
