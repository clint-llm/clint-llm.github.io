The initial diagnosis is based on the clinical manifestations and is primarily is a diagnosis of exclusion.

The initial investigations in a patient with SCD, who presents with hematuria or proteinuria include:

- Basic metabolic panel

- Urine analysis and urine microalbumin to creatinine ratio

- Renal imaging with a renal ultrasound

- Intravenous pyelogram for papillary necrosis.

- CT scan to rule out medullary renal carcinoma especially in sickle cell trait patients.

- Serum albumin levels

- Autoantibodies and complement levels

- HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C serologies

- Serum electrophoresis

- Renal biopsy when clinically indicated

- Review of the current and previous medication history

In a patient with eGFR less than 60 ml/mt/1.73mt2 with a rapid decline in eGFR by greater than 5mls/mt/1.73mt2 or with persistent proteinuria needs a nephrologist referral and evaluation. Especially, SCD patients with urinary protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) greater than 300 mg/gm should be evaluated for other causes of CKD.
