Recommended radiographic evaluation includes anteroposterior and lateral views of the affected knee. In a complete rupture, radiographs may reveal patella alta (superiorly displaced patella). The Insall-Salvati ratio is a quick method to determine patella alta or baja (inferiorly displaced patella) on the lateral knee radiograph. It is defined as the ratio between the length of the patellar tendon and the length of the patella. Ideally, this is measured on a lateral radiograph with the knee flexed to 30 degrees. A normal ratio is between 0.8 and 1.2, with patella alta having a ratio greater than 1.2 and patella baja having a ratio of less than 0.8.

Radiographs also may reveal avulsion fractures or other concomitant knee injuries. An MRI of the knee is an appropriate diagnostic study if a patellar tendon rupture is suspected. It is the most sensitive imaging modality and can differentiate partial from complete tendon rupture. It helps determine the exact location of the rupture, the presence of any tendon degeneration, the position of the patella, and any concomitant intraarticular knee lesions. Ultrasound also may be used as an adjunctive study in the suspected case of acute or chronic patellar tendon rupture. It is effective in detecting and localizing tendon disruption. It is much less expensive than obtaining an MRI and can be more convenient depending on the availability of an ultrasound machine and an experienced user.
