With the ulnar bursaâ€™s location deep to the flexor retinaculum of the wrist, surgeons frequently encounter it during hand and wrist surgeries, including carpal tunnel release operations. Carpal tunnel releases are the most common hand and wrist surgeries in the United States with more than 400000 procedures annually.

If the ulnar bursa becomes infected, which most commonly occurs through a spread from communicating flexor tendon sheaths in the hand, prompt irrigation and debridement are necessary, in addition to intravenous antibiotics.
