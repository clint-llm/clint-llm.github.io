Appropriate patient selection is important for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding with endometrial ablation. Candidates for endometrial ablation include women of reproductive age who have met their desired parity with heavy menstrual bleeding due to a benign cause that significantly impacts their quality of life. Further criteria should include AUB that is not related to a structural cause, hyperplasia or malignancy, and failure or intolerance of medical management. The ideal patient has AUB related to the endometrium as determined by the FIGO classification system and does not desire definitive management with a hysterectomy.
