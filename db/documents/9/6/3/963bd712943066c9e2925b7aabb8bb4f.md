There are two different classifications of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia: usual type (uVIN) that has correlations with human papillomavirus (HPV), or differentiated type (dVIN) that correlates with chronic inflammation. Classification of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia is made on morphology and does not involve HPV testing.Â Differentiated type correlates with a greater potential for progression to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The likelihood of other anogenital cancers increases with the usual type of VIN.
