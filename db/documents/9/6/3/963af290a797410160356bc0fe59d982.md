Diet can play a significant role in overall health but is often not discussed enough with patients. The lack of education regarding diet may be due to a lack of interest or incomplete understanding of how each nutrient influences health or due to a lack of time for the patient encounter. This activity focuses on the current evidence on how dietary changes can impact a patient's general health. As the topic can be quite broad, it emphasizes some of the most well-known macro- and micronutrients, such as sodium, potassium, carbohydrates, lipid, etc., and how dietary intake affects health conditions. It includes some leading causes of mortality worldwide, such as obesity, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. It also outlines the roles played by various healthcare professionals in assisting patients in adopting healthier dietary practices.
