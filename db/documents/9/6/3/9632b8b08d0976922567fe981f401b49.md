Occlusion of dural sinuses leads to decreased venous flow, increased venous pressure, decreased relative cerebral perfusion pressure, and physical dilation of cerebral veins. Some combination of these forces can lead to local areas of hypoperfusion of brain tissue and resulting in hypoxic tissue damage. Additionally, the thrombosis itself can damage the vessel wall and predispose to vessel rupture and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The decreased cerebral venous outflow decreases cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow. This leads to elevated intracranial pressure and associated signs and symptoms, e.g., headaches, papilledema.
