There are no definite answers to the cause of hyperlipidemia, but many theories have been proposed. In an article by Jankowski and coauthors (2012), the authors explained that the cause of hyperlipidemia in patients with cholestasis is due to the regurgitation of cholesterol and bile salts into the circulation.

In cholestasis, bile acids are unable to be secreted due to obstruction. Bile accumulates in plasma, causing an increase in bile lipoprotein, which is a precursor to Lp-X. Lp-X forms from the combination of bile lipoprotein and albumin.

Lp-X has a similar density as LDL; however, its metabolism is different from that of LDL. This is because Lp-X cannot be taken up by LDL receptors. One of the possible causes of hyperlipidemia in these patients is the inability of Lp-X to cause negative feedback in cholesterol production.
