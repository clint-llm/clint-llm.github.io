The aortic valve separates the left ventricular outflow tract from the aortic root. It is generally a trileaflet valve composed of three distinct leaflets: the left coronary, right coronary, and non coronary leaflets. The aortic valve annulus is interconnected with the fibrous skeleton of the heart and is in continuity with the aorto-mitral curtain. The conduction system resides usually underneath the right coronary cusp extending towards the right-non commissure. In a small proportion of patients, the aortic valve is composed of two leaflets, leading to a bicuspid aortic valve.
