The differential diagnosis following history and physical examination would explore the causes of diastolic murmurs heard along the left sternal border. A murmur in this location could either be related to aortic regurgitation or pulmonary regurgitation. These can be differentiated using maneuvers. Being a right-sided murmur, the pulmonary regurgitation diastolic decrescendo murmur would increase in intensity on inspiration due to the negative intrathoracic pressure generated and would reduce in intensity if the patient performs the Valsalva maneuver. These distinguishing characteristics can be used if an asymptomatic patient presents with a murmur. However, if the presenting symptom is related to the complications that can arise as a result of pulmonary regurgitation, the differential diagnosis would cover the causes of right heart failure as well. It is essential to explore the causes of the same, which include chronic pulmonary emboli, constrictive pericarditis, infective endocarditis, and restrictive cardiomyopathy.
