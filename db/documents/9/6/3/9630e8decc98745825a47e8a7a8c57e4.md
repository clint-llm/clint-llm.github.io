Simulation center usage, access, storage, maintenance, and audio/visual recording all capture data. Recorded data is used to enhance learner education primarily through the assessment and evaluation of learner performance.  Additionally, data can assist with curriculum development and enrichment. Gathering and retaining data on student performance is necessary for faculty to monitor and intervene early when learners require remediation to improve performance.  To identify learner performance, medical student, and residency programs, collect data on educational objectives met by simulation activities.

The American College of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) provides a framework of physician competency domains as a means of recording data related to the resident’s specialty performance milestones. Medical students are evaluated using the American College of Medical Education (ACME) Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) defined by responsibilities that medical students are expected to be able to perform while unsupervised.
