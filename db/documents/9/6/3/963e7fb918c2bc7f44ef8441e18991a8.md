Low-grade gliomas are benign tumors and are grade 1 and grade 2 tumors according to WHO classification. They can be due to some genetic mutations or environmental factors that are responsible for the growth of these tumors. The presentation varies according to the location and size of the tumor. These are common in children at a young age and need early diagnosis and prompt treatment for a better prognosis. There are no known causes of gliomas, and the risk factors favoring the development are poorly understood. Therapeutic irradiation is the only major environmental factor increasing the risk of all brain tumors, including low-grade gliomas. This activity reviews the different modalities to evaluate and treat low-grade gliomas and explains the importance of the interprofessional team's performance in improving patient care in this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of low-grade gliomas.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of low-grade gliomas.
- Review the management options available for low-grade gliomas.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance diagnosis and treatment of low-grade gliomas, and improve outcomes.
