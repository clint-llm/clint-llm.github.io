Bone turnover marker levels can be affected by multiple contributors to pre-analytical variability. Factors that can be adjusted and minimized, termed controllable factors, include circadian rhythm variations, food intake, exercise level, alcohol intake, seasonal variation, and medications such as oral glucocorticoids and aromatase inhibitors. Factors contributing to pre-analytical variability that cannot be controlled, known as uncontrollable factors, include age, degree of mobility/immobility, ethnicity, presence of fracture, and menopausal state.

Other factors capable of confounding measurements include the concomitant presence of conditions accelerating bone turnover, such as hyperparathyroidism or immobility, diseases capable of lowering BTMs, such as hypothyroidism, and diseases known to dissociate the typically synced processes of formation and resorption in bone turnover, as seen with rheumatoid arthritis or multiple myeloma. Current literature recommends that when assessing BTMs, sampling should be done in an environment that best minimizes interference from the controllable factors. At the same time, it is crucial to be aware of uncontrollable factors as possible confounders.
