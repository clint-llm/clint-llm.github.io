The management of NSCLC depends on an interprofessional approach for the care of the patient. This begins with prevention, in which the primary clinician has an integral role in smoking cessation counseling. The primary clinician also has an integral role in the potential early diagnosis of this disease with lung cancer screening before it evolves to advanced stages where prognosis worsens. Once the diagnosis is made, an interprofessional approach should be utilized with medical oncology, radiation oncology, thoracic surgery, and pathology in order to optimize the patient's treatment plan depending on their TNM staging at the time of diagnosis.
