Uremia, a clinical condition associated with worsening renal function, is characterized by fluid, electrolyte, hormone imbalances, and metabolic abnormalities. The literal meaning of uremia is "urine in the blood," which develops most commonly in chronic and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Still, it may also occur due to acute kidney injury ifÂ loss of kidney function happens rapidly. Urea itself is both directly and indirectly toxic to a range of tissues.

Patients with uremia generally present with nausea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, muscle cramps, pruritus, and altered mentation.

Putative uremic toxins include parathyroid hormone, macroglobulin, advanced glycosylation end products, and beta2 microglobulin, though no specific uremic toxin has been identified as responsible for all clinical manifestations of uremia.
