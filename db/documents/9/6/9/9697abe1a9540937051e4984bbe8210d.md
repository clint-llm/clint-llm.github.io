The management of molluscum contagiosum is best done with an interprofessional team that also includes the primary care provider and nurse practitioner. The important thing is that these lesions spontaneously resolve in most patients; thus patient education is vital. Patients should be told that there is a small risk of autoinoculation or infection of others. For those who decide to be treated, more than one session may be required. This information is important for the patient as it prevents them from seeking unnecessary therapies and making unreasonable demands. Parents should not keep children out of school, but the infected skin area can be covered with a garment. Since this virus can be sexually transmitted, the patient should be encouraged to practice safe sex and use barrier methods for protection.

**Outcomes**

In the majority of patients, molluscum contagiosum resolves without any residual scars. The disorder is benign and spontaneous resolution is the usual outcome, but it may take 12-24 months. In some individuals, the lesions may persist for 3-5 years and may be disfiguring. Recurrences occur in one-third of patients. In patients with HIV or those who are immunocompromised, the lesions are generalized and occur when the CD4 counts are low. In these patients, spontaneous resolution of the lesions is rare.
