A prospective multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted among 87 HSE patients to evaluate the potential benefit of adjuvant oral valacyclovir 6 g per day in the reduction of neuro-psychological sequelae assessed at 12 months. Valacyclovir was administered for three months in continuation with standard IV acyclovir therapy for all patients in the treatment arm. The clinical benefit of additional valganciclovir for three months was negated by the lack of clinical benefits observed in this study.

The clinical benefits of adjuvant corticosteroids in HSE treatment continue to be controversial. A non-randomized retrospective study on 45 HSE patients where adjuvant corticosteroids were added to acyclovir did a stepwise logistic regression analysis. It concluded that the predictors of poor outcome were advanced age, GCS at the time of acyclovir initiation, and non-initiation of adjuvant corticosteroid.
