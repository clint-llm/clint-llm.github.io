When examining amniotic fluid under a microscope, arborization, or ferning, will be identified. A pH test can be performed of vaginal fluid. Amniotic fluid typically has a pH of 7.1-7.3, while normal vaginal secretions have a pH of 4.5-6.0. Causes of false positive pH tests include presence of blood or semen, alkaline antiseptics, or bacterial vaginosis. False-negative results may occur with prolonged rupture of membranes. It can sometimes be difficult to definitively diagnose PROM based on the above evaluation. There are additional tests that may aid in the diagnosis. Ultrasound should be performed to evaluate amniotic fluid index. Fetal fibronectin is a sensitive but nonspecific test for rupture of membranes. In addition, there are several commercially available tests for amniotic proteins which report high sensitivity for diagnosis of rupture of membranes
