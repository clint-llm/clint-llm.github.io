High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) is a fatal form of severe high-altitude illness. HAPE is a form of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that occurs secondary to hypoxia. It is a clinical diagnosis characterized by fatigue, dyspnea, and dry cough with exertion. If left untreated, it can progress to dyspnea at rest, rales, cyanosis, and a mortality rate of up to 50%. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that consists of an internist, sports physician, neurologist and cardiologist. The key to prevention is education of the patient. Individuals may consider resuming ascent at an appropriate rate once symptoms resolve and they no longer require oxygen or vasodilator therapy and have an increased exercise tolerance compared to symptom onset. Clinicians also should consider nifedipine, PDE inhibitors, or salmeterol as prophylaxis for those with a prior incidence of HAPE.
