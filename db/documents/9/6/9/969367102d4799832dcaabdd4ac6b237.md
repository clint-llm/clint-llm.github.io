Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common congenital disorders, with an incidence as high as 9.1 per 1000 live births.

Anatomically there may be one well-developed ventricle and another hypoplastic or two well-developed ventricles with complete or near-complete obstruction to the inflow/outflow. Hypoxemia may ensue from birth when the parallel circulation of the fetus starts transitioning to the series circulation of the adult. Some conditions may even need immediate medical and surgical management to sustain life.

Anesthesiologists encounter infants with single ventricular physiology in cardiac catheterization labs and the operating rooms. A clear understanding ofÂ single ventricle physiology is imperative for managing these lesions in the perioperative period. This activity summarizes different conditions that present with single ventricle physiology and their anesthetic management during the perioperative period.
