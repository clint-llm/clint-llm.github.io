Osteoradionecrosis occurs in approximately nine percent (9%) of patients who receive more than 7000 cGy of ionizing radiation to treat a head or neck malignancy, two percent (2%) of patients receiving 6000 cGy to 7000 cGy, and almost no patients who receive less than 6000 cGy. Tooth extraction in a previously irradiated field is also a potential precipitant of osteoradionecrosis in the mandible.

Patients affected by osteoradionecrosis are typically older than 55 years of age.
