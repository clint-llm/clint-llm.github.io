Treatment of West Nile virus is primarily supportive care. Researchers have tried several agents including interferon, ribavirin, and intravenous immunoglobulin. No clear efficacy data exists as only one controlled study has been performed to date.

Once the clinician has made a diagnosis of West Nile virus, individuals withÂ milder cases can be managed symptomatically as outpatients and tend to have an excellent prognosis. However, toxic patients with neurologic symptoms usually require long-term ICU care. These patients will typically require long-term physical and occupational therapy at rehabilitation centers. After the infection, neurologic injury from the West Nile virus may include gross motor, cognitive, and fine motor abnormalities. Many patients have residual neurologic deficits, which can take a long time to recover, and some deficits may be permanent.

When the CNS is involved, many patients become bed ridden and hence pressure sores, aspiration and DVT are common; thus prophylaxis is warranted.
