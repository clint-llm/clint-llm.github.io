All patients with mastocytosis should carry epinephrine-filled syringes at all times and should receive education regarding the administration of epinephrine in cases of emergency. They should understand the avoidance of triggers such as exposure to heat or cold, medications such as aspirin, strenuous activity, alcohol, spicy foods, anesthesia, surgery, or endoscopy. Clinicians need to administer premedications before any surgery, minor procedures, or radiocontrast dye to avoid anaphylaxis. Premedications include diphenhydramine, ranitidine, montelukast, and prednisone. Insect stings (Hymenoptera) could also precipitate anaphylaxis in patients who developed IgE-mediated sensitivity. Patients should have testing for venom allergy and, if positive, should be treated with venom immunotherapy to decrease subsequent anaphylaxis to insect stings.
