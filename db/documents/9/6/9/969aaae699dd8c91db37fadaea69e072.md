Patients with nasal polyposis need to be evaluated by an otolaryngologist to investigate the underlying etiology and treat their disease state. Once an underlying etiology has been established and an endotype has been implicated, several consultations should be considered. For patients with AERD, CRSwNP, and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, the allergist should be consulted; either immunotherapy, aspirin desensitization, or both might be indicated.

For patients with underlying CF, EGPA, or other systemic diseases, the role of the pulmonologist is imperative. In these cases, treating the underlying condition will most likely result in significant improvement of the nasal symptoms. An interprofessional team approach in patients with nasal polyposis should always be considered due to the complexity of this disease process and its associated comorbidities.
