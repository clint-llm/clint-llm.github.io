There are several different anatomic variants of the origin of the popliteal vein. Typically the vein originates at the level of the popliteal muscle from the confluence of the anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal veins. However, documented variants include popliteal veins that originate more proximal near the adductor hiatus from either two or three of the contributing tributaries. Additionally, there have also been cases reported of duplicate popliteal veins.

Variations also exist in the veinâ€™s anatomical relationship with its arterial counterpart. The popliteal vein is typically posterolateral to the popliteal artery, though anatomists have noted variations in which the vein crosses the artery and lies medial to it. Additionally, there have been cases reported in which there were no popliteal nor femoral veins but rather a persistent sciatic vein draining the lower extremity in their place.
