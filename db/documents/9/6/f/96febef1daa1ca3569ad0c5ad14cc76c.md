Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be the initial approach as it is the least invasive way of diagnosing papillary fibroelastomas. The sensitivity and specificity of TTE for the detection of PFE greater than 2 mm are 88.9% and 87.8%, respectively. However, if the index of suspicion is high for a cardioembolic source of stroke, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) can be obtained to visualize the intracardiac structures better.

Papillary fibroelastoma sizes on echocardiography generally range from 2 mm to 40 mm and are usually found to be pedunculated. They have independent mobility with a speckle pattern along the edges of the PFE. PFEs may arise from the aortic or ventricular surface of the valves. In the study by Tamin et al., the lesion occurred in equal proportions on both sides of the valves. Other published literature has reported ambiguous results regarding location, with some studies reporting PFEs more commonly found on the aortic side of the aortic valve leaflets, while other studies demonstrated PFE on the ventricular side of the aortic valve.
