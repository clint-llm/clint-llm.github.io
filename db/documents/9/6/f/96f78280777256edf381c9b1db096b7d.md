As their name implies, the mismatch repair genes produce proteins that are responsible for correcting mistakes that are made during base-pair matching of DNA replication. Defects in these genes result in an increased number of unrepaired mistakes which cause an increased probability of tumorigenesis. Biallelic defects in the MYH gene cause the autosomal recessive form of Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS II). The function of the protein expressed by this gene is base excision repair. Microsatellite instability is not seen in this subset of Muir-Torre syndrome.
