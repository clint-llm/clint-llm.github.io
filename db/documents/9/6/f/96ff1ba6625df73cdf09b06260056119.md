Microneedling is a form of therapy that utlilizes instruments containing rows of thin needles that penetrate the dermis to a uniform depth, creating a controlled skin injury. This controlled skin injury induces rapidly-healing micropunctures with subsequent stimulation of collagen and elastin fiber production, resulting in skin remodeling.

Microneedling was initially developed as a tool for skin rejuvenation. However, it is now being used for a number of indications, which include: various forms of scars, alopecias, drug delivery, hyperhidrosis, stretch marks, and more.

Microneedling is a commonly-used procedure in dermatology. It is regarded as a safe and relatively inexpensive alternative to other forms of skin rejuvenation that is well-tolerated with minimal downtime. Despite its common use and wide variety of indications, strong evidence for the efficacy of microneedling is not evident in the literature.
