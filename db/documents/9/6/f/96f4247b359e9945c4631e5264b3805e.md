Uveitis is a condition that can present in emergency departments or primary care settings.  It is important to recognize symptoms and make an accurate diagnosis.  It is vital for primary care providers to refer the patient to an ophthalmologist if uveitis is suspected. If a patient presents to a facility with symptoms that are consistent with uveitis, and the facility does not have the capabilities to evaluate the complaint properly (i.e., slit lamp expertise and tonometer); the patient should be transferred to a facility that is capable of such exams.

Initiating treatment with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics is important once the diagnosis of uveitis is made.  Because this can be a vision-threatening disease, providers should ensure that patients can afford the prescribed treatments before discharge.  If the patient is unable to afford medications, social services can provide patient assistance. Uveitis accounts for approximately 10% of blindness in the United States, thus appropriate treatment and follow up is essential.

Treatment for uveitis should be handled by an interprofessional team approach that includes ophthalmologists, retina and uveitis specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating to support the patient's treatment regimen and bring about the best possible outcome. [Level V]
