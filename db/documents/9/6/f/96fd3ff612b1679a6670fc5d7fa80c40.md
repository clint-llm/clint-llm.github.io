The currently used classification system for PRS cases is:

- Mild: Skin and/or subcutaneous fat atrophy over a single division of the trigeminal nerve

- Moderate: Skin and/or fat atrophy involving two branches of the trigeminal territory

- Severe: Atrophy spread over all three divisions of the trigeminal nerve or any bony atrophy
