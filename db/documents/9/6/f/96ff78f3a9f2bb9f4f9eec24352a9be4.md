The palatine (or faucial) tonsils, commonly referred to as tonsils, are bundles of lymphatic tissue located in the lateral oropharynx.  They sit in the isthmus of the fauces, bordered anteriorly by the palatoglossal arch and posteriorly by the palatopharyngeal arch.  Both of these mucous membrane-enclosed anatomic borders are continuous with the roof of the oral cavity and are formed by the palatoglossus muscle and palatopharyngeus muscle, respectively.  The palatine tonsils also serve as a component of Waldeyer's ring which in addition to the palatine tonsils consists of the adenoids, tubal tonsil, and lingual tonsil.
