The interprofessional team plays a pivotal role in the management of bariatric patients. The team consists of bariatric surgeons, bariatric physicians, specialist anesthetists, bariatric nurse specialists, and psychologists. Many patients are also encouraged to attend support groups.

Another role of the team is to identify treatable comorbidities in the surgical candidate and optimize these. The focus should be on managing obstructive sleep apnoea and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Risk stratification of patients is an area of research aiming to optimize better which patient cohorts receive an offer for bariatric surgery. The Obesity Surgery-Mortality Risk score (OS-MRS), validated for use in gastric bypass, scores patients out of 5 for the male sex, age greater than or equal to 45, BMI greater than or equal to 50, presence of hypertension, known risk of venous thromboembolic disease. Low-risk patients class A (0-1 points) have a 12 fold decreased risk of mortality compared to class C (4-5 points).

Patients should start on a two-week milk diet, which reduces liver size and reduces resistance and constraints on laparoscopic instrument movement.

On the day of the surgery, the patient receives venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, and TED stockings or intermittent pressure calf compression devices are applied bilaterally.
