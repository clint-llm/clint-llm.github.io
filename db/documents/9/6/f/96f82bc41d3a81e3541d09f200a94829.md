The hypothalamus is the region in the ventral brain which coordinates the endocrine system. It receives many signals from variousÂ regions of the brain and in return, releases both releasing and inhibiting hormones, which then act on the pituitary gland to direct the functions of the thyroid gland, adrenal glands, and reproductive organs and to influence growth, fluid balance, and milk production.
