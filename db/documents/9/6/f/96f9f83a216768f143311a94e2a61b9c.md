Taking mirtazapine with other sedative drugs can severely increase the sedative effect. In addition, mirtazapine has various drug interactions and should be used cautiously or is contraindicated. These include:

- Diazepam

- Tramadol

- Cimetidine

- Ketoconazole

- St. John’s wort

- Tryptophan

- Seizure medications: phenytoin, carbamazepine

- Migraine medications: sumatriptan, zolmitriptan

- Medications for mood and thought disorders: lithium, other antidepressants, and antipsychotics

In the event of an overdose, mirtazapine is a relatively safe drug, although it is slightly more toxic than most of the SSRIs (except citalopram) in overdose cases. Unlike tricyclic antidepressants, mirtazapine demonstrated no significant adverse cardiovascular effects at 7 to 22 times its maximum recommended dose. Case reports in which the patients overdosed with 30 to 50 times the prescribed dose described mirtazapine as relatively non-toxic compared to tricyclic antidepressants.

Signs and symptoms associated with overdose also were associated with disorientation, drowsiness, and impaired memory. As discussed above, serious outcomes (including fatalities) may occur at doses higher than recommended, especially with mixed overdoses.
