Serum levels of alpha-tocopherolÂ in 0.1% of United States adults over the age of 20 have been found to be deficient. Surveys of the same data set have shown that 89.8% of men and 96.3% of women 19 years of age or older have insufficient intake of alpha-tocopherol. Some studies have shown alpha-tocopherol to be lower in pediatric populations and higher in pregnancy.
