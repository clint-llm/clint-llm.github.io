As with any soft tissue diagnosis, it is important to obtain a good history from the patient. It is important to ask the patient about any pertinent underlying medical problems that could be contributing to the disease as well as pertinent family history. In regards to the history, it is important to ascertain how fast the mass has been growing, whether or not it is causing them pain/night pain, if they have noticed color changes, or if there was any history of recent trauma to the area.
