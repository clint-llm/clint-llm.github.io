The global prevalence of HPV infection, the main cause of papillomas, is around 11% to 12%. However, reliable surveillance figures are difficult to obtain regarding the prevalence of warty lesions. For non-genital warts, two large population-based studies found prevalence rates of 0.84% in the US and 12.9% in Russia, with prevalence being highest in children and young adults.

Acrochorda or skin tags have been reported to have a prevalence of 46% in the general population with a higher prevalence among older age groups, unlike warty papillomas. They are more common in the obese and tend to grow in areas of skin-to-skin contact. They have an equal distribution among males and females.
