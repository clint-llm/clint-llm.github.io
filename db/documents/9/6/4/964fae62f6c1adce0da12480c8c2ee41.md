Laryngitis refers to inflammation of the larynx. This is often due to an acute viral infection, which is typically a mild and self-limiting condition that lasts for a period of 3 to 7 days. There are non-infectious causes and more serious conditions that can present with acute laryngeal symptoms, and practitioners must be familiar with the differential diagnosis and workup. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of acute laryngitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of acute laryngitis. 
- Explain how to diagnose and manage acute laryngitiss as well as develop a differential diagnosis to rule out more serious pathology. 
- Review how to counsel a patient with acute laryngitis.
- Summarize an interprofessional, team approach to improve care for patients with acute laryngitis.
