As TCAs are third-line drugs for depression, patients' demographics either receiving amoxapine or are under consideration for commencing the drugs are generally presenting with recurring or reactive depression; this means that other forms of medication and treatment have failed to control the symptoms. As such, these patients are at a higher risk of self-harming and suicidal behavior. Therefore, they must have a cohesive interprofessional team involved in their treatment, including frequentÂ coordination between their primary physician, their psychiatrist, and/or counselors to ensure proper compliance with medication regimen and response to treatment. During every office visit, they must undergo evaluation for suicidal ideations, plans, or inclinations. Overdose and proper precautions should commence in case patients are at any risk to themselves or others.

Therapy with amoxapine and other antidepressant medications is best with an interprofessional healthcare team that oversees all aspects of the patient's case. This team includes physicians, who will prescribe and make other decisions regarding the regimen, specialists, who will dig more deeply and specialize in the condition treated, specialty-trained nursing staff, who can monitor care, verify patient adherence, and assist with monitoring, and pharmacists, who will perform medication reconciliation and verify dosing. All the interprofessional team members need to collaborate and have open communication to ensure optimal care and outcomes. [Level 5]
