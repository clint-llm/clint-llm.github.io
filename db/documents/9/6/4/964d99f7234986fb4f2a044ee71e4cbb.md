Around 75% of tumors have no known etiology, but the most common known etiologic factors are exposure to vinyl chloride monomer and other industrial materials, iatrogenic exposure to colloidal thorium dioxide (Thorotrast), androgenic steroid use, chronic arsenic ingestion, and exposure to radium. There have also been studies showing an association between cancer and exposure to diethylstilbestrol, urethane, cyclophosphamide, and oral contraceptives. Hepatic angiosarcoma due to environmental exposure has a prolonged latency period of 10-40 years.

Vinyl chloride was formerly used in the production of polyvinyl chloride. It was recognized in 1949 that the highly reactive epoxide chloroethylene oxide produced during the reaction caused hepatorenal damage. The latency period is about 20 years. Cancer-associated with vinyl chloride monomer exposure has been found to have TP53 mutations.

Thorotrast was used as a radiocontrast material, but its use was stopped shortly after following several reports of organ damage and fatalities. In the liver, the substance is taken up and stored by Kupffer cells and then gets stored in the periportal area after its destruction. This results in periportal, periacinar, and Glissonâ€™s capsule fibrosis. KRAS-2 mutations have been found in cancer cells from thorotrast exposure.

Chronic arsenic intoxication initially results in hepatomegaly followed by the development of steatosis, cell necrosis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis.
