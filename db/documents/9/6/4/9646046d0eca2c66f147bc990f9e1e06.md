Best disease (Best vitelliform macular dystrophy, BVMD) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder due to the mutation of BEST1 (or VMD2, TU15B, OMIM #607854) gene with incomplete penetrance and variable expression which typically presents in childhood. However, there are also reports of autosomal recessive BVMD.

Its characteristic presentation is by bilateral fundus changes of egg-yolk appearance (as in a fried egg with sunny side up) at the macula in both eyes. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is primarily affected. The electrooculogram (EOG) is typically affected, with reduced Arden ratio both in carriers and patients. The visual prognosis of the disease is usually good, usually maintaining driving/reading capability in at least one eye throughout life.

Other names of the condition include Best macular dystrophy, Best disease, vitelliform dystrophy, early or juvenile-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy, vitelline dystrophy, and vitelliruptive degeneration. The disease gets its name from a German ophthalmologist Dr. Friedrich Best who described a pedigree suffering from various stages of the disease in 1905.
