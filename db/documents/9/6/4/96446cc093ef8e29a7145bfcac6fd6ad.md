Angioma serpiginosum is a benign vascular condition. It is characterized by pinpoint violaceous to coppery-red punctate maculopapular eruptions that cluster together in linear, serpiginous or gyrate patterns on an erythematous background, chiefly on the lower limbs of females. This activity examines when this condition should be considered on differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate for it. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of angioma serpiginosum.
- Outline the physical features of angioma serpiginosum.
- Discuss the treatment and management options available for angioma serpiginosum.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to evaluate and treat angioma serpiginosum and improve outcomes.
