A 2001 review of Indinavir overdoses (n=79) took into account all reports of indinavir overdose. It defined an acute overdose as a single dose of 2400 mg and a chronic overdose as recurring doses less than or equal to 2400 mg.

Common treatment methods for symptomatic Indinavir overdose include hydration (oral or intravenous), diuresis, and activated charcoal to decrease absorption. 87% of patients recovered based on follow-up information provided (n=45).
