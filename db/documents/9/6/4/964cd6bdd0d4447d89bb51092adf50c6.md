Olfactory training is a non-pharmacological and non-surgical treatment option for patients with olfactory dysfunction. Patients undergoing olfactory training expose themselves to 4 different odors twice daily for at least 24 weeks. The main indications include post-infectious, post-traumatic, and idiopathic olfactory dysfunction and olfactory dysfunction due to Parkinson disease. This activity reviews the details of olfactory training and highlights the role of the interprofessional team during olfactory training.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the physiology of olfactory training.
- Identify the main indications for olfactory training.
- Explain the protocol for olfactory training.
- Summarize how an interprofessional team approach can provide patient benefit when performing olfactory training.
