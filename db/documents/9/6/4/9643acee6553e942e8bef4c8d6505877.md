Diagnosis of UP can be made clinically. However, a definitive diagnosis requires a skin biopsy. The hallmark finding histologically for UP is having an increased amount of mast cells in the dermis. UP skin lesions can have up to a 40-fold higher mast cell count than normal skin. Mast cells have a rounded or cuboidal appearance. Stains that help identify mast cells include toluidine blue, Leder, Giemsa, tryptase, and CD117 (KIT). Eosinophils are commonly found in the dermis and hyperpigmentation of the basal layer can also be found. Molecular studies for KIT mutations can be performed on biopsy specimens.

Biopsy specimens from normal skin in patients with mastocytosis will not show an increased amount of mast cells. Therefore, if there are no skin lesions and systemic mastocytosis is suspected, a bone marrow biopsy, or biopsy from the GI tract may be needed. A total serum tryptase level can help in identifying the extent of mast cell disease.Â  A tryptase level greater than 20 ng/ml represents one of the minor criteria for systemic mastocytosis.
