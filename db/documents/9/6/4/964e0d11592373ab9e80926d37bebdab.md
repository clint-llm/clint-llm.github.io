Achlorhydria is not a very common disorder in clinical practice. Even when it presents, the signs and symptoms are vague. However, in order to avoid high morbidity, healthcare workers, including the primary care provider, must consider it in the differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with epigastric discomfort. The pharmacist should assist with pain control. To make the diagnosis of achlorhydria, testing is always required. Once the diagnosis is made, the treatment depends on the cause. Even though there are no current guidelines on screening or monitoring of these patients, the clinician should always be aware that cases of gastric cancer have been reported in these patients.
