The mechanism of initiation of fever results from complex interactions between cells in the periphery that are then transmitted centrally to the hypothalamus, specifically to the ventral medial preoptic (VMPO) area. Multiple studies showed that the VMPO houses fever-activated neurons, specifically localized near the vascular organ of lamina terminalis (VOLT), which lacks a blood-brain barrier (BBB). This lack of a BBB allows circulating substances access to the brain, which includes fever-related molecules from the immune system.
