Scurvy is largely a clinical diagnosis. Serum ascorbic acid levels may be measured (greater than 11 micromoles/L), but this typically reflects recent dietary intake. Measurement of leukocyte ascorbic acid levels tends to be more accurate, but testing is not widely available. Normochromic normocytic anemia is common due to blood loss, folate deficiency, and iron deficiency.

Test dichlorophenolindophenol to measure vitamin C level in urine and serum/plasma and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to measure storage level in lymphocytes and tissues.

The recommended daily intake of vitamin C is 40 to 120 mg, depending on age and gender.

Scurvy is treated with ascorbic acid 100 to 300 mg daily until symptoms remit. Clinical improvement is noted within the first 1 to 2 weeks, with a resolution of fatigue, joint swelling, ecchymoses, and gingiva healing. Complete recovery frequently occurs within three months.
