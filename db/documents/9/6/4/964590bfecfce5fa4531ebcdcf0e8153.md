Beta-1 blockers are monitored via the patient's vital signs. Heart rate and blood pressure checks, along with regular physical examination, are sufficient for basic patient monitoring. Regular blood level monitoring of beta-1-blocker levels is not indicated in most circumstances. If there are reasons to be concerned about reaching therapeutic levels or toxicity, then blood levels of specific beta-1 blockers can be ordered and reviewed. In cases that prove to be refractory to treatment for an overdose, more intensive measures can be taken, including continuous monitoring of heart rate, cardiac electrical activity, and blood pressure.
