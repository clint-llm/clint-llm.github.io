Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapy is part of the first-line treatment for seronegative spondyloarthropathies and has been shown to demonstrate significant improvement in inflammatory back pain. Further, NSAIDs have been demonstrated to improve patientâ€™s duration of morning stiffness and chest expansion in related arthropathies. In association with other interventions shown to be effective, such as exercise and physical therapy, these medications can significantly improve the quality of life in patients with inflammatory back pain.

While little or no data exists directly linking inflammatory back pain and increased risk of mortality. Ankylosing spondylitis and other spondyloarthropathies involving the axial spine have correlations with a 36 to 76% increase in risk for acute coronary syndrome and a 50% increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Of note, female patients with psoriatic arthritis have been shown to have nearly double the risk of ACS compared to the general population. However, given the relatively young age of presentation of these diseases and associated inflammatory back pain, the absolute risks of ACS, VTE, or stroke in these populations are modest.
