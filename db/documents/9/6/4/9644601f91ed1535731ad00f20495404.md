Lumbosacral radiculopathy is a pathological disorder affecting the nerve root in the lumbosacral region of the spinal cord. Radiculopathy is commonly the result of compression of the nerve root from a structural lesion (i.e., herniated nucleus pulposus, calcified facet joint, or vertebral osteophyte), but may also result from irritation secondary to an infection, tumor, or surrounding tissue inflammation.

Numbness, tingling, weakness, and radiating neuropathic type pain are all common symptoms of radiculopathy, which typically present unilaterally.
