Histopathological attributes of a CTO lesion commonly consist of calcium, lipids (both intracellular and extracellular), smooth muscle cells, an extracellular matrix, and neovascularization. Occlusions typically have a dense concentration of collagen-rich fibrous tissue at the proximal and distal ends contributing to a columnar lesion of calcified, resistant fibrous tissue surrounding a softer core of organized thrombus and lipids. Lesion classification is as soft, hard, or a mixture of both. Soft plaques are more frequent in occlusions less than 12 months of age and consist of cholesterol-laden cells and foam cells. Hard plaques are more prevalent in occlusions that are older than 12 months of age and are characterized by dense fibrous tissue with fibrocalcific regions without neovascular channels.
