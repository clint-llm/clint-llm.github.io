Magnesium is an important electrolyte. It is a key part of many reactions that occur in the human body, affecting cellular function, nerve conduction, and other needs. Normal serum magnesium levels are between 1.46 and 2.68 mg/dL. Hypomagnesemia is an electrolyte disturbance caused by a low serum magnesium level (less than 1.46 mg/dL) in the blood. Hypomagnesemia can be attributed to chronic disease, alcohol use disorder, gastrointestinal losses, renal losses, and other conditions. Signs and symptoms of hypomagnesemia include mild tremors and generalized weakness to cardiac ischemia and death. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and complications of hypomagnesemia and underscores the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the potential etiologies that can lead to hypomagnesemia.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with hypomagnesemia, including laboratory ranges.
- Summarize the treatment options for hypomagnesemia.
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of hypomagnesemia.
