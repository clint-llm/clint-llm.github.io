The pathophysiology is an injury to the urethral epithelium attributed to any of the specific etiologies causing a leak of urine to the corpus spongiosum or by direct trauma to the corpus spongiosum. Either of which initiates inflammation and fibrous changes of the corpus spongiosum. This form of fibrous tissue causes contraction compressing the urethral lumen.
