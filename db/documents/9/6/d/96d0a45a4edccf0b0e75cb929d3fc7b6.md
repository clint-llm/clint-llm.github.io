As female humans age, fertility is affected through that process. While in earlier times, a mother at the age of 35 would be a rarity, it is not uncommon for women aged 35 to be conceiving their first or second child nowadays. The decline in fertility is a modern problem that is not always easily solved by artificial reproductive technology.

The number of gametes is decreased through the process of atresia, with an initial decline from the max number of approximately 6-7 million gametes around 20 weeks gestation to approximately 1 to 2 million oocytes at birth to 300,000 to 500,000 at puberty to 25,000 at 37 years old and around 1,000 at the age of 51.

There is no known way to slow or reverse this decline in the number of gametes. Additionally, as previously mentioned, the caliber of these oocytes also declines. While the exact mechanism is unknown, this is believed to be related to the changes in circulating hormones, specifically a rising level of follicle-stimulating hormone paired with declining levels of anti-müllerian and inhibin B hormones.

A high-quality oocyte is key for fertility. It has been found that gamete quality is tied closely to the genetics of the gametes, which is more frequently negatively affected in women of increasing age. As a person ages, the chances for chromosomal abnormalities, specifically aneuploidy, increase. The presence of such aneuploidy dramatically affects the quality of an oocyte. This affects fertility as the presence of aneuploidy is a common cause of early miscarriage, attributed to approximately 65 to 75% of early missed abortions and about 35% of clinically recognized abortions. The occurrence of aneuploidy is largely attributed to meiotic nondisjunction due to meiotic spindle changes, but there is very little information regarding how to affect that process. Age is clearly related: in mothers below 25 years of age, there is a rate of down syndrome to be around 2%, and in women greater than 35, that risk jumps to almost 35%.
