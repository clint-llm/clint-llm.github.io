The technique is built on the principle of the Doppler effect, with measurement of the change in the frequency and wavelength of a sound wave transmitted and reflected by moving red blood cells within the vessel, termed as Doppler frequency shift.

There are many parameters that should be optimally adjusted to achieve reliable results. The actual angle of insonation / Doppler angle should be less than <60 degrees (as close as possible to parallel) to improve the accuracy of measurements (the calculated velocity will be less precise if calculated/extrapolated from a nearly perpendicular angle).

Spectral analysis including peak systolic velocity (PSV), peak diastolic velocity (PDV), mean maximum velocity, and pulsatility index can then be obtained. Spectral Doppler waveform evaluation gives critical information about flow dynamics at the point of sampling, which depends on hemodynamic factors affecting a proximal or distal portion of the vessel.

With complete occlusion of ICA, the external carotid doppler waveform can change from high resistance to low resistance due to the development of low resistance collateral pathways.  This is known as the internalization of the external carotid.

Peak systolic velocity of greater than 125 cm/s correlates with 50% or higher ICA stenosis.

The final assessment is done on vertebral arteries to determine the direction of flow. Vertebral arteries are located deep in the neck. Therefore, time gain compensation should be optimized.
