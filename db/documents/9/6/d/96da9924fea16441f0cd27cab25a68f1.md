The nerves acting on the muscles regulate the function and mechanisms of the hand. Below are the muscles, nerves, and the mechanisms of action produced by the combination.

**Thenar Muscles**

**Opponens pollicis **

- Mechanism: Opposition of the thumb

- Nerve: Recurrent branch of median nerve (C8, T1)

**Abductor pollicis brevis**

- Mechanism: Abduction of the thumb

- Nerve: Recurrent branch of median nerve (C8, T1)

**Flexor pollicis brevis**

- Mechanism: Flexion of the thumb

- Nerve: Recurrent branch of median nerve (C8, T1)

**Adductor Compartment**

**Adductor pollicis**

- Mechanism: Adduction of the thumb

- Nerve: Deep branch of ulnar nerve (C8, T1)

**Hypothenar Muscles**

**Abductor digiti minimi**

- Mechanism: Abduction of the little finger

- Nerve: Deep branch of ulnar nerve (C8, T1)

**Flexor digiti minimi brevis**

- Mechanism: Flexion of the little finger

- Nerve: Deep branch of ulnar nerve (C8, T1)

**Opponens digiti minimi**

- Mechanism: Opposition of the little finger

- Nerve: Deep branch of ulnar nerve (C8, T1)

**Short Muscles**

**Lumbricals**

- Mechanism: Flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints with the extension of the interphalangeal joints
