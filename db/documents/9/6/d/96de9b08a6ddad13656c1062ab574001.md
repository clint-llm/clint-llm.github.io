**History**

Most patients describe a history of chronic or acute-on-chronic back pain, which may be radicular with dermatomal pain, reduced sensation, or weakness.

A study by Hulens et al. has shown that symptomatic Tarlov cysts present more frequently with perineal pain/discomfort, bladder and bowel disturbance, and sexual disturbance (dyspareunia, impotence). They found that patients are more likely to report that their pain worsens with activity (neurogenic claudication), Valsalva maneuvers, and sitting.

Other details to cover in the history include trauma, signs, and symptoms of infection, and malignancy.

**Examination**

A detailed neurological examination should be performed on symptomatic areas.

The dermatomes and myotomes of the lower limbs and perineum, as well reflexes of the lower limbs, and if there are features of urinary retention and anal sphincter tone.

As it is a lower motor neuron lesion, it may result in reduced reflexes and anal tone in addition to sensory loss or motor weakness.
