Candida infections are treated with antifungal medications such as nystatin, clotrimazole, amphotericin B, miconazole. Mild or moderate genital Candida infections can have treatment with antifungal vaginal cream. The antifungal creams come in 1, 3, or 7-day treatment. Econazole or fluconazole 150 mg orally one-time dose can also be prescribed.

Oral and topical treatments have similar efficacy, but oral medications are more expensive. Clinicians should avoid prescribing fluconazole in the first trimester of pregnancy.

In cases of denture stomatitis, the patient should refrain from using their denture for at least two weeks along with the topical application of antifungal medication. Angular cheilitis occurs due to loss of vertical dimension. Thus, after the infection subsides fabrication of new denture prostheses with proper vertical dimensions is essential. Oral application of probiotics can serve as an adjuvant in treating oral candidiasis.
