Substance use and substance use disorders in pregnancy are common and linked with multiple obstetric and neonatal adverse outcomes. Ideally, all pregnant women should be screened, and those with positive screens should be promptly diagnosed and treated to avoid the morbidity and mortality associated with continued substance use during pregnancy. This activity reviews the adverse outcomes associated with the most commonly used substances and the need to collaborate with an interprofessional team to counsel, appropriately treat, and support women during their pregnancies for better outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the common adverse outcomes associated with the most commonly used substances during pregnancy.
- Review the use of validated screening instruments to better identify substance use in pregnancy.
- Implement the recommended treatments for substance use disorders in pregnancy.
- Collaborate with an interprofessional team to counsel and support women during treatment for substance use during pregnancy for better outcomes.
