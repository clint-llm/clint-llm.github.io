The primary mechanism of action of doxorubicin involves the drugâ€™s ability to intercalate within DNA base pairs, causing breakage of DNA strands and inhibition of both DNA and RNA synthesis. Doxorubicin inhibits the enzyme topoisomerase II, causing DNA damage and induction of apoptosis. When combined with iron, doxorubicin also causes free radical-mediated oxidative damage to DNA, further limiting DNA synthesis. Iron chelators, such as dexrazoxane, may prevent free radical formation by limiting the binding of doxorubicin with iron.
