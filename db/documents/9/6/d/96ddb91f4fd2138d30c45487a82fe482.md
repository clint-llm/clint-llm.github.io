Patients with xerostomia, regardless of the etiology, usually report the following symptoms:

- A sensation of oral dryness

- Oral burning or soreness

- Diminished or altered taste

- The need to sip water when swallowing, for which patients usually carry a water bottle at all times

- Difficulty swallowing dry foods, e.g., crackers

- A sensation of thickened saliva

- Sensitivity to acidic or spicy foods

- Loss of appetite and weight loss

Clinical examination findings may include:

- Fissured tongue and lips

- Filiform papillae atrophy

- Erythematous and parched oral mucosa

- The finger may adhere to the oral mucosa during palpation

- Evident lack of saliva on the floor of the mouth

A decrease in salivary production makes the oral cavity more susceptible to dental caries - particularly cervical caries - periodontal disease, halitosis, and candidiasis. Patients using dentures also report loss of retention and denture discomfort. Patients with xerostomia associated with Sjögren syndrome may initially complain of dry eyes and parotid gland enlargement before oral symptoms occur.
