**Surface Anatomy**

Surgery of the brows demands a thorough understanding of surface anatomy, brow position, and brow contour. Although there is variation in brow position and shape among different ethnicities, the overall differences between males and females apply to most situations.

**Scalp and Forehead**

The five layers of the scalp are:

- Skin

- Fibrofatty superficial fascia, which is adherent to the undersurface of the skin

- Galea aponeurotica, which is contiguous with the fascia of the occipitalis and frontalis muscles

- Areolar tissue, which lies between the periosteum and the muscle/galea layer and contains emissary veins and small arteries

- Periosteum

**Muscles**

The eyebrow-forehead complex is composed of the following major muscles, all innervated by the facial nerve:

**Occipitofrontalis**

Occipitofrontalis is composed of two posterior bellies, the occipitalis, and two anterior bellies, the frontalis. The galea aponeurotica or epicranial aponeurosis connects these muscles. The superior nuchal line on the occipital bone gives origin to the occipital muscle bellies. The frontalis muscle is attached to the skin and fascia of the eyebrows, passing through the orbicularis oculi muscle anteriorly; posteriorly, it becomes the galea aponeurotica and then joins with the occipitalis. The blood supply to the occipitalis comes from the occipital artery, a branch of the external carotid artery. The supraorbital and supratrochlear arteries, branches of the internal carotid via the ophthalmic artery, supply the frontalis. The frontalis muscle inserts into the eyebrow and also interdigitates with the corrugator supercilii muscles.

**Orbicularis Oculi**

The orbicularis oculi muscle is composed of orbital and palpebral portions, with the palpebral portion further divided into preseptal and pretarsal segments. The preseptal muscle forms the lateral palpebral raphé laterally, and the pretarsal muscle fibers unite laterally at the lateral canthal tendon. The orbicularis oculi is a constrictor, causing closure of the eyelids, but it also draws in the brows, the lower part of the forehead, and the temple regions, mostly via its orbital component. The orbital orbicularis oculi is the only depressor of the brow, and sometimes a portion of it is known as the "depressor supercilii." Injections of botulinum toxin into these lateral orbital orbicularis fibers can produce a "chemical brow lift," but this technique must be performed very carefully due to the risk of blepharoptosis if the toxin contacts the levator palpebrae superioris.

**Corrugator Supercilii**

These are responsible for producing the vertical frown lines, the "number elevens." These muscles originate from the frontal bone at the superomedial orbital rim (nasal process) and insert laterally into the medial and central third of the brow, interdigitating with the frontalis muscle. The lateral extent of the corrugator muscles varies among individual patients. Sometimes, it extends all the way to the lateral third of the brow but is often much shorter and may only reach halfway. Assessment of corrugator action is important when treating patients with botulinum toxin for cosmetic reasons or when planning surgical myomectomy as part of a brow lift.

**Procerus Muscle**

This muscle arises from the nasal bones and merges into the inferior part of the frontalis muscle, which lies deep to it. The procerus pulls down the medial eyebrows, resulting in horizontal nasal root wrinkles. Over time, the resulting crease can become quite deep as the central frontalis muscle descends; only by lifting the frontalis does the horizontal groove improve. This is the "fat nose syndrome" caused by a combination of medial movement of the brows because of the corrugator supercilii, inferior movement caused by the procerus, and a vertical descent of the frontalis muscle, resulting in a widening of the soft tissues at the nasal root.

**The Retro-Orbicularis Oculi Fat Pad (ROOF)**

Deep to the interdigitation of the orbicularis oculi and the frontalis muscles, there is a fibrofatty layer of tissue which has been called the "brow fat pad" or the retro-orbicularis oculi fat (ROOF) pad. This fibrofatty layer was described in 1909 by M. Charpy, although he mistook it to be a lateral fat pocket; in some countries, it is referred to as "Charpy's fat pad." It is distinct from the preaponeurotic fat, which lies behind the orbital septum, while the ROOF sits on the periosteum of the orbital rim and frontal bone, in front of the orbital septum, and allows the brow to glide up and down easily. In some cases, at the medial brow, the fat extends farther inferiorly below the orbital rim and into the eyelid, even as far as the inferior septal attachment to the levator aponeurosis. This fat provides the youthful fullness of the brow seen before the aging process begins and skeletonizes the brow as the fat atrophies. In general, resection of this fat should be avoided to prevent long-term cosmetic dissatisfaction.

**Motor Nerves**

**Facial Nerve**

The motor innervation to the forehead, brow and periocular muscles comes from the facial nerve, which exits the skull via the stylomastoid foramen. It enters the deep posterior aspect of the parotid gland and then travels within the gland, superficial to the retromandibular vein and external carotid artery. It is typically divided into five terminal branches: frontal or temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular, and cervical.

**Frontal Branch of the Facial Nerve**

This nerve is the most superior branch; it exits the superior part of the parotid gland and supplies the anterior and superior auricular muscles, the frontalis muscle, the orbicularis oculi muscle, and the corrugator supercilii muscles.

- The course of the frontal branch is approximated by Pitanguy's line, which starts 0.5 cm below the tragus and extends to a point 1.5 cm above the lateral brow and 2 cm lateral to the lateral orbital rim.

- The nerve travels in the musculoaponeurotic layer, and superior to the zygoma, it runs on the undersurface of the temporoparietal fascia.

- The anterior branch of the superficial temporal artery and vein are lateral to the frontal branch.

- Although portrayed as a single nerve, the nerve divides into several branches over the zygomatic arch.

- Most of the nerve's branches will cross the zygomatic arch roughly 1/3 of the way from the auricle to the lateral orbital rim, but the distribution along the zygomatic arch can be broad and varied.

- The medial corrugator and procerus muscles are innervated by the zygomatic and buccal branches of the facial nerve, which loop medially and superiorly. They also supply the medial canthal region of the medial upper and lower lids.

**Sensory Nerves**

The three primary sensory nerves of the forehead and brow are the supraorbital nerve, the supratrochlear nerve, and the infratrochlear nerve.

The supraorbital nerve is the largest and most lateral branch of the frontal nerve, which is itself the largest branch of the ophthalmic nerve (V1). The supraorbital nerve exits the orbit either through a notch on the superior orbital rim or through a foramen just above the rim, deep to the corrugator supercilii muscle. The nerve then divides into a medial (superficial) branch, which passes over the frontalis muscle and provides sensation to the forehead skin and the anterior 3.5 cm of the scalp. A deep (lateral) branch runs between the galea aponeurotica and the periosteum towards the coronal suture. It supplies sensation to the upper eyelid, the forehead, and the scalp as far as the lambdoidal suture. This lateral division is commonly injured intraoperatively, resulting in paresthesia and scalp numbness.

- A recent study on Sri Lankan skulls found that 73.8% of supraorbital nerves exited through a notch, with the rest passing through a foramen.
- 36.3% had a notch on one side and a foramen on the other side.
- 55.1% had bilateral supraorbital notches.
- 8.6% had bilateral supraorbital foramina.

- Accessory branches of the supraorbital nerve may be present in up to 20% of cases, usually exiting the skull lateral to the notch or foramen.

- The supraorbital nerve notch or foramen is typically encountered approximately 24 mm from the midline, approximately 28 mm medial to the temporal crest of the frontal bone, and approximately 29 mm from the frontozygomatic suture.

- When a foramen is present, it is located approximately 2 mm above the supraorbital margin in males and approximately 3 mm in females.

- In 80% of cases, the supraorbital foramen or notch is a few millimeters medial to the infraorbital foramen, contrary to the popular belief that both lie in the same sagittal plane.

The supratrochlear nerve may exit through a foramen, although it often exits through a notch or depression in the bone. The nerve exits lateral to the corrugator supercilii muscle's bony origin. It then enters the muscle and divides into three to four branches. After penetrating the frontalis muscle, the nerves run vertically up the scalp. The supratrochlear nerve supplies sensation to a vertical strip roughly 1 cm wide in the central forehead.

The infratrochlear nerve is a branch of the nasociliary nerve, which is a branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. This nerve runs along the upper border of the medial rectus muscle and will often anastomose with the supratrochlear nerve. Several branches of the infratrochlear nerve travel to the medial canthus of the eye, supplying sensation to the medial upper and lower eyelid skin, the side of the nose, the conjunctiva, the lacrimal sac, and the caruncle.

The supraorbital nerve is typically located 2.7 cm from the midline and the supratrochlear nerve 1.7 cm. There is, however, notable variability in these measurements among individuals.

**Fascia**

The temporoparietal fascia is an extension of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS), which extends across the zygomatic arch and, together with the galea, the frontalis, and the occipitalis forms a continuous fascial plane in the face. The temporoparietal fascia is also known as the superficial temporal fascia. The frontal branch of the facial nerve lies deep within or on the deep surface of the temporoparietal fascia.

The deep temporal fascia has superficial and deep subdivisions. The superficial temporal fascia is separated from the deep temporal fascia by loose areolar tissue, which allows easy dissection when performing a temporal dissection. This plane, also called the subaponeurotic plane, is avascular and allows quick, blunt separation.

The deep temporal fascia, or temporalis muscle fascia, is thick and overlies the temporalis muscle before splitting into two layers. Below the level of the superior orbital rim, the deep temporal fascia splits into a superficial and a deep part, separated by Yasargil's fat pad, also known as the superficial temporal fat pad (or intermediate temporal fat pad, depending on preferred nomenclature), which extends from down to the zygomatic arch.

The buccal fat pad and the deep temporal fat pad overlying the inferior part of the temporalis muscle and tendon are continuous under the zygomatic arch.
