Trench foot is one of three subclasses of immersion foot, which are differentiated by the temperature of the exposure. Trench foot is caused by prolonged exposure to a cold temperature that is usually above freezing and damp, sometimes unsanitary conditions. The condition ultimately causes skin and tissue breakdown which increases the risk of infection and increases associated morbidity and mortality. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of trench foot and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the signs and symptoms of trench foot. 
- Identify the population at risk for developing trench foot. 
- Explain the management and treatment of trench foot. 
- Outline the importance of improving coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by trench foot.
