The locus coeruleus (LC) is one component of the reticular activating system (RAS). The RAS is composed of the reticular formation, raphe nuclei, and locus coeruleus. It is involved in many important functions; normally, the RAS mediates consciousness, wakefulness, and attentiveness. The loss of muscle tone during REM sleep is influenced by the caudal third of the locus coeruleus, although the locus coeruleus appears to be mostly inactive during REM sleep inÂ some studies. The locus coeruleus primarily functions through the transmission of norepinephrine via a g protein-coupled receptor pathway. Arousal, sleep-wake cycle, memory, emotions, and stress are all influenced by the locus coeruleus.
