According to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, a tonsillectomy is a "surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil, including its capsule, by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall." In the United States, tonsillectomy is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures. Over 500,000 cases are performed annually in children less than 15 years of age. Two common reasons for this surgery are sleep-disordered breathing and recurrent throat infections. Several complications can occur with a tonsillectomy and include bleeding, velopharyngeal insufficiency, and dehydration. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and technique involved in performing tonsillectomy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing these patients before and after surgery.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for tonsillectomy.
- Describe the technique of tonsillectomy.
- Review the presentation of a patient with tonsillectomy.
- Explain a structured interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients undergoing tonsillectomy.
