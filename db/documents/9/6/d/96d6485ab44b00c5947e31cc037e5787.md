The spleen is an encapsulated hematopoietic organ that lies within the posterior aspect of the left upper quadrant in the peritoneal cavity. It has proximity to the 9th, 10th, and 11th ribs, left kidney, stomach, transverse and descending colon, left hemidiaphragm, and pancreas. The spleen is the visceral organ most frequently injured in blunt abdominal trauma. Trauma is also the most common cause of a ruptured spleen. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with splenic rupture and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of splenic rupture.
- Explain how to evaluate a patient for splenic rupture.
- Outline the treatment options available for splenic rupture.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance management of splenic rupture and improve outcomes.
