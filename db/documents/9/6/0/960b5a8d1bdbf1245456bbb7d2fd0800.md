The term tracheomalacia indicates a condition characterized by a structural abnormality of the tracheal cartilage inducing excessive collapsibility of the trachea. It constitutes about half of the congenital pathologies of the trachea and is distinguished in diffuse and localized varieties depending on the extent of the disease. The distinction also concerns the primary forms due to an alteration of the development of the trachea and the secondary conditions produced by causes that act after the normal development of the organ. The primary forms can be diffuse or localized; the secondary ones are generally localized. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of tracheomalacia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of tracheomalacia.
- Summarize the investigations required to enable an adequate evaluation of tracheomalacia.
- Describe the management options available for tracheomalacia.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients with tracheomalacia.
