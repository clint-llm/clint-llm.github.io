The classical presentation would suggest individuals presenting with epigastric pain, nausea, and occasionally vomiting; however, this is rare. The most common presentation is anemia. This can manifest as generalized weakness, tiredness, headaches, and palpitations.

We know that most of the individuals with H. pylori-induced multifocal atrophic gastritis are asymptomatic.  The symptoms, if present, like nausea and vomiting, are short-lived and recurrent.

Similarly, autoimmune metaplastic atrophic gastritis usually has nonspecific signs and symptoms in mostly females over 60 years of age.

Pernicious anemia can develop in AMAG with an overall prevalence of 0.1%. It can present with fatigue, dizziness, irritability, depression, insomnia, and mood swings. Occasionally, it can present with normal vitamin B12 levels.

Most individuals are already treated for their iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency without a confirmed underlying diagnosis.

The presentation can be variable and can lead to diagnostic difficulty when individuals have associated autoimmune conditions such as hypothyroidism, myelodysplastic syndromes, sideroblastic anemia, or coexisting iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia.

The physical examination is of limited use and is usually nonspecific with rare evidence of pallor, anemia, and emaciation due to poor appetite, but these are uncommon.

In AMAG, there may be stigmata of associated autoimmune disease with jaundice, tachycardia, and a systolic murmur.
