The majority of adults with coronary artery anomalies (CAAs) are asymptomatic, and the first presenting symptom usually is sudden cardiac death. In addition, patients can also present with myocardial ischemia and congestive heart failure.Â In less than 30% of patients, symptoms may be reported as anginal chest pain at a relatively young age, syncope with exercise, dyspnea on exertion, palpitations, and fatigue. Most often, however, the relationship between the anomaly and the presenting symptoms is not clear, and these symptoms rarely raise suspicion for coronary artery anomaly (CAA).
