Vasodilation is the widening of blood vessels as a result of the relaxation of the blood vessel's muscular walls. Vasodilation is a mechanism toÂ enhance blood flow to areas of the body that are lacking oxygen and/or nutrients. The vasodilation causes a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and an increase in blood flow, resulting in a reduction of blood pressure.
