In children over five years of age and adults, pre and post-bronchodilator spirometry can help confirm the diagnosis. Spirometry is a non-invasive, objective test that can be performed in the office setting and is recommended in the EPR 3 guideline as to the preferred lung function test to assign asthma severity.

The baseline spirometry provides the following information FVC (forced vital capacity), FEV1 (forced expiratory volume at 1 sec.),  FEV1/FVC, and F25 to 75 (the difference between the forced expiratory volume at 25% and 75%). Assessment of the bronchodilator response begins with the baseline spirometry followed by the administration of a short-acting bronchodilator (most commonly, albuterol 2 to 4 puffs in adults and older children). According to the ATS/ERS guidelines, reversibility is significant when there is an over 12% improvement from baseline or an increase of greater than 200 ml in FEV1.  In patients who do not demonstrate a significant bronchodilator response and in whom you continue to have a clinical suspicion of asthma, a 2 to 3 week trial of an oral corticosteroid may be a consideration.
