As with most traumatic injuries, pediatric facial fractures benefit from ice, rest, and pain control. Once fractures are identified, the appropriate specialists should be consulted for further management and treatment recommendations. These specialists may include any of the following: pediatric specialists in facial surgery (both otolaryngology and plastic surgery, depending on local resources), ophthalmology, neurosurgery, anesthesia (for advanced airway stabilization), psychiatry (if self-harm is suspected), as well as any other team that is clinically indicated for consultation.

Child-specific approaches to anxiolysis, pain control, and soft tissue facial injuries in pediatric facial trauma patients are addressed further in an alternative StatPearls article, and these concepts apply well to pediatric facial fracture patients.

**Antibiotics and Vaccination**

For any dental injuries or open wounds, the patient’s tetanus vaccination status should be confirmed. There is no evidence that antibiotics give any mortality benefit or reduce the rate of complications, such as infections or poor healing.

**Fracture Management**

In general, most facial fractures in children can be managed conservatively without surgery, in consultation with a pediatric facial specialist. As the child grows, even greatly deformed structures can remodel during the healing and normal growth processes. A trial of watchful waiting and observation may be a reasonable approach. Facial and jaw restructuring can also be accomplished with orthodontic manipulation, particularly for injuries causing malocclusion.

**Fractures Requiring Operative Repair**

- Frontal bone fractures: only if more than minimally displaced, especially after initiation of pneumatization.

- Zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures: with significant facial height or contour deficits, dental occlusion, or visual deficits, isolated fractures to the zygomatic arch may be treated conservatively.

- Orbital fractures: with extraocular muscle entrapment, traumatic optic neuropathy, or floor defects >1 cm; should be treated within 24-48 hours to prevent long-term vision deficits.

- Nasoorbitoethmoid fractures: typically, all treated surgically.

- Mandible fractures: only if substantial deformation or severe malocclusion, displacement of condylar fragments into the external auditory canal or middle cranial fossa, or lateral extracapsular dislocation; otherwise, a trial 4-6 weeks of jaw rest, soft diet, possible immobilization, and delayed orthodontic evaluation is preferred.

**Isolated Nasal Fractures and Eye, Ear, and Dental Injuries**

Management of pediatric soft tissue injuries, pediatric dental injuries, and nasal fractures are discussed in other StatPearls articles.
