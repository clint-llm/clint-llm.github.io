Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive chemical in marijuana. THC is lipid-soluble and hence easily distributed to the brain and fat. THC readily crosses the placenta and can reach high fetal concentrations on repeated exposures.

The chemical structure of THC is similar to endogenous cannabinoids that affect the areas of the brain influencing pleasure and memory. Cannabinoids exert their neurological effects through cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) which plays an important role in the development of a fetal brain, its neurotransmitter systems, and neuronal migration and differentiation. Animal studies have shown that fetal exposure to exogenous cannabinoids can affect normal brain development.

The two most studied cannabinoids are tetrahydrocannabinolic acid and cannabidiolic acid. In the body, these are decarboxylated to their active analogs, THC, and cannabidiol (CBD). CB1 and CB2 are both G protein-coupled receptors. Agonists at CB1 receptors cause decreased neuronal signaling across the synapse where the receptors are activated. THC increases acetylcholine release in the hippocampus; dopamine in the nucleus accumbens; and acetylcholine, glutamate, and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex. CBD acts as an inverse agonist at CB1 receptors.

There is little research on the effects of the currently available strengths of cannabis products or on administration routes other than smoking.
