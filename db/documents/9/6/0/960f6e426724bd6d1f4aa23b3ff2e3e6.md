Treatment of pentobarbital toxicity involves supportive care, as there is no antidote. Overdose can lead to airway compromise, cardiovascular collapse, coma, and death. Treatment often requires intubation, hemodynamic support with vasopressors, and maintaining body temperature with warmers, commonly in an ICU setting. In mild or early cases of toxicity, activated charcoal and alkaline diuresis have been added but show minimal benefits. Always contact poison control if poisoning or overdose is suspected.

Special care is necessary for those with renal and hepatic impairment. The manufacturer does not provide dosage adjustment recommendations for renal impairment, but it is essential to monitor kidney function if using high doses or before undergoing prolonged treatment. Similar effects occur in those with hepatic impairment, and recommendations are for close patient monitoring.

Pentobarbital interacts with several major classes of drugs and requires close monitoring to ensure therapeutic drug levels are maintained. As a class, barbiturates induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, which increase the rate of metabolism of other drugs metabolized by these hepatic enzymes. In particular, anticoagulants can be affected, and patients taking these drugs, predominantly Warfarin, may require dosage adjustments. Other drug interactions to be aware of include levothyroxine, corticosteroids, doxycycline, phenytoin, valproic acid, alcohol, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI's), and some hormones such as estradiol, estrone, and progesterone, to name a few.
