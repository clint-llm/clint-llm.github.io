The following should specifically be examined in cervical myelopathy patients:

- Gait: Examine balance issues or spasticity issues

- Reflex examinations for hyperreflexia: Biceps, brachioradialis, patellar, Achilles

- Lhermitte sign: Neck flexion causes an electric shock-like (positive exam)

- Hoffman sign: Examiner will extend the distal phalanx of the long finger (or flick the end of the digit), then rapidly release this digit- the patient will respond with a reflex flexion of the thumb and/or index finger.

- Crossed radial reflex: Extension of both the biceps and wrist following a biceps reflex test

- Inverted radial reflex: Extension of both wrist extension and finger flexion following tapping the brachioradialis

- Finger escape sign: The patient is unable to hold the ulnar digits in extension and adduction.

- Grip test: Failure to repetitive make a tight fist

**Imaging**

- X-ray: Paramount to all spine evaluations are radiographs AP and lateral of the spine. If possible, flexion and extension views will help determine ligamentous stability.

- Torg ratio:Â Compares the diameter of the cervical canal to the width of the cervical body on the lateral view. Mid-posterior vertebral body to the nearest point on the lamina, divided by the width of the corresponding vertebral body. A ratio lower than 0.8 may indicate congenital stenosis (baseline narrowing).

- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Canal space of less than 10 mm indicates stenosis. Best to evaluate cord and disk space. Of note, up to 19% of asymptomatic patients have significant cervical abnormalities, which can be misleading. An MRI is imperative to evaluate spine pathologies. Compression and signal changes on T1 and T2 are indicative of myelopathy pathologies.
