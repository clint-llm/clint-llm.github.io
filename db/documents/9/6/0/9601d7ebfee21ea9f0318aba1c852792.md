Providers serving the AIAN community must appreciate the cultural differences and the history of the community. Although many of the AIAN community has moved out of reservations into the urban areas, significant disparities still exist in their healthcare and health outcomes. Coupled with the constant lack of resources and funding in the IHS, healthcare disparity tends to increase exponentially. Having a flexible approach towards individual patients may help to navigate tough situations and provide optimal care.
