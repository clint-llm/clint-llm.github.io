Though minimal class I evidence is available to support the use of SEPs or any form of intraoperative neuromonitoring, the use of such monitoring techniques has been shown to improve outcomes after surgeries that could lead to neurologic impairment.

During intraoperative monitoring, baseline SEP waveforms should be recorded for the patient. Then, the surgeon, anesthesia provider, and other surgical team members should be alerted if there are critical changes in the waveform. "Critical changes" include a decrease in the wave's amplitude by 50% or higher, and/or an increase in the waveform's latency by 10% or more.

SEPs are less reliable and helpful in patients with preexisting damage to the spinal cord or the nerve(s) subject to monitoring.
