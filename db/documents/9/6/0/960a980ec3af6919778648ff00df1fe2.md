If a primary ACTH secreting tumor is found, first-line treatment is surgical resection of the adenoma via trans-sphenoidal surgery (TSS).

Alternatively, pituitary radiation therapy can be used after an unsuccessful TSS.

Lastly, bilateral adrenalectomy can be used to provide an immediate reduction of cortisol levels in patients with Cushing disease. However, these patients will then require lifelong administration of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy.

Post-treatment testing with 24-hour urine and blood samples are used to detect the level of cortisol.

In cases of recurrent or remnant Cushing disease pharmacological therapy can control the associated hormonal imbalances.

Centrally acting agents include pasireotide and cabergoline that have been shown to control Cushing disease in 35-40% of the cases.

Adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors include ketoconazole, metyrapone, etomidate, mitotane, and osilodrostat. Ketoconazole that is the most commonly prescribed medication for Cushing has shown lab normalization in over 60% of cases that is lasting over 24 months. Its use is limited by hepatotoxicity that presents in 10-20% of the treated patients but it is easily reversible after reducing the dose or stopping the medication in the majority of those patients.

Lastly, mifepristone can be used as a glucocorticoid-receptor blocker. It has shown to normalize several symptoms and signs of Cushing disease, including the hyperglycemia, in over 60% of patient in recent studies. The cortisol levels remail high and so this test cannot be used to monitor its adrenal effect, but better the use of clinical presentation is needed for diagnosis adrenal insufficiency and treat the patients with appropriate cortisol replacement therapy. This medication also caused irregular vaginal bleeding in female patients due to the anti-progesterone effect. Close monitoring of other hormone levels, like the thyroid also needs to be done regularly.

Other medications, like retinoic acid and silibinin, have shown some promising results but its use is limited by high cost and side effects, but more studies are conducted and further results are expected in the near future.
