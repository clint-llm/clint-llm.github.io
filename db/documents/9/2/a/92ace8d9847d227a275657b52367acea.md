The pathogenesis of apraxia of eyelid opening and blepharospasm is poorly understood, but there a few hypotheses based on animal model studies. Nigro-striatal basal ganglia pathways may project to the premotor control of eyelid coordination. Therefore, it is associated with dysfunction in the corticothalamic, basal ganglia, and focal cranial nerve circuitry.

At the biochemical level, abnormal dopamine neurotransmission likely underlies the abnormal blinking and eyelid muscle contraction. Secondary causes of eyelid opening problems include neuromuscular junction diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune disease, and ocular or central nervous system structural lesions.
