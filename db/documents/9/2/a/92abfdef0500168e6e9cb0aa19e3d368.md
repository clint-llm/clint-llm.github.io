Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics change during an acute illness, especially during sepsis. For a given drug, the volume of distribution varies depending on the phase of the illness or recovery. This is an important concept and must be considered when determining dosing medication dosings, especially for drugs like aminoglycosides and beta-lactams. Another important determinant of the dosing of renal-excreted medications is the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which may be impaired in sepsis. The IDSA and ATS recommend selecting antibiotic dosing based on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for critically ill patients with ventilator-associated Pneumonia.
