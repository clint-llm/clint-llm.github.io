Another clinically relevant pathology of the DPA is an aneurysm, although its occurrence is rare (0.5%). When present, it is palpable as a pulsatile mass on the dorsum of the foot. DPA aneurysm can lead to restriction of ankle dorsiflexion, paresthesia, pain, localized distal ischemia, contracture, and gangrene of the toes.

The DPA is of clinical relevance because of its surgical and nonsurgical value. It is a potential target for surgical revascularization for limb salvage and provides outflow to the foot for more proximal procedures. The DPA also allows clinicians (both surgical and non-surgical) the ability to assess vascular disease on physical examination by both palpation and utilization of the ABI.
