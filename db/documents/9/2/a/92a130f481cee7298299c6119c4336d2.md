The patient’s history and physical exam can help clinicians to differentiate between acute and chronic decompensation as well as primarily cardiac or renal causes. Examples of helpful historical information would include if the patient presents with an acute myocardial ischemic event that can be triggering for severe cardiac dysfunction, which subsequently results in renal injury or recent-onset diarrhea and vomiting, causing acute renal injury, which might lead to a sharp decline in heart function. Other historical clues, such as medication use and prior laboratory values (such as creatinine), may be helpful.

- Elevated jugular venous pressure

- Generalized swelling and edema with “third spacing” presenting as pleural effusion(s), ascites, or peripheral edema

- Crackles or rales on lung auscultation

- Patients may also demonstrate manifestations of decreased cardiac output with hypotension, fatigue, diminished peripheral pulses, and abnormal heart rates (either tachycardia or bradycardia)

Other possible signs indicating a primary renal cause of cardiorenal syndrome may include:

- Pallor from anemia

- Monitoring oliguria or anuria preceding cardiac dysfunction
