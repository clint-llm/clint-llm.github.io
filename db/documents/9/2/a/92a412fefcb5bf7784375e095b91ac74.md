The term renal failure denotes inability of the kidneys to perform excretory function leading to retention of nitrogenous waste products from the blood. Acute and chronic renal failure are the two kinds of kidney failure. When a patient needs renal replacement therapy, the condition is called end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, presentation and diagnosis of renal failure and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Recall the causes of renal failure.
- Describe the laboratory features of renal failure.
- Summarize the treatment options for renal failure.
- Explore modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by renal failure.
