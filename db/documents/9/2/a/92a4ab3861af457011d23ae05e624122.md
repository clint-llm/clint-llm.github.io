Without a clear-cut rabid bite history, rabies is often a diagnosis of exclusion. In early stages, it may manifest similar to influenza, Coxsackie, enterovirus, and herpes. In later stages, rabies may present similarly to delirium tremens, tetanus, botulism, diphtheria, tick-borne diseases, and Guillain Barre. It is common for physicians to check CBC, electrolytes, cultures, CT, chest x-ray, and MRI and still, have no idea that rabies is the culprit. Unless isolated in a rabies-specific viral culture, detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in saliva, found to have positive antibody titer, or isolated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the diagnosis may continue to be elusive until too late.

Rabies can be diagnosed through multiple routes using CSF, blood, saliva, tears, and tissue biopsies (neck, immunofluorescent stain). CSF analysis can show a pleocytosis and may allow isolation of the virus.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that no single test is enough to rule in or out rabies.  Ultimately, a high level of suspicion is required in developed countries due to the rarity of the disease.

If the biting animal can be euthanized and tested then that may prevent the need to administer post-exposure prophylaxis. Public health may be able to facilitate the testing of the animal.
