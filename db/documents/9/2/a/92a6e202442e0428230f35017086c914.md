While odontogenic infections are often evident in their etiology, repeated infections or infection in an otherwise healthy individual can be an indicator of oral cavity malignancy.

Dental or surgical follow-up should assess for resolution of any mucosal or bony irregularities and maintain a low threshold for biopsy. Occasionally, infection presumably of dental origin can originate from other adjacent sites such as the paranasal sinuses, temporal bone, congenital or acquired neck mass, or aerodigestive tract.

When there is no obvious infected tooth or the history of dental pain is questionable, a thorough investigation of the nearby anatomy should be performed through a physical exam or imaging studies when applicable. Patients presenting with odontogenic infections as one of many soft tissue infections should be evaluated for possible immunodeficiencies, either congenital or acquired.
