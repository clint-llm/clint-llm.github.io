The hypoglossal nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve. It originates from the posterior portion of the medulla oblongata and exits the skull in the posterior fossa through the hypoglossal canal. It then descends between the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which lies superiorly, and the external carotid artery, which lies deep to the nerve. The hypoglossal nerve then turns horizontally and travels to the greater cornu of the hyoid bone, where it comes close to the lingual artery.

The hypoglossal nerve innervates all the intrinsic muscles of the tongue, as well as the extrinsic muscles of the tongue, except for palatoglossus.
