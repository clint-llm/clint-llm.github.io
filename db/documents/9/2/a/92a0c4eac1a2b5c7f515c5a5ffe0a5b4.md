Contraindications to intrathecal morphine are the same as intravenous morphine and include allergy to morphine or other opiates, acute bronchial asthma, upper airway obstruction, severe hypovolemia, or other etiology of severe hypotension.

Intrathecal morphine use requires extreme caution in patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure. Pupillary changes (miosis) from intrathecal morphine may interfere with the diagnosis and monitoring of intracranial pathology. Hypercarbia from respiratory depression may worsen intracranial hypertension. High doses of neuraxial morphine may produce myoclonic events, which may interfere with the assessment of intracranial pathology.

Intrathecal morphine use also requires caution in patients with decreased respiratory reserve (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], severe obesity, kyphoscoliosis, phrenic nerve palsy, muscular dystrophies, and others) as acute respiratory failure is possible following administration of intrathecal morphine.

Elimination half-life may be prolonged in patients with reduced metabolic rates and with hepatic or renal dysfunction. High blood morphine levels due to reduced clearance may take days to develop, so patients should be subject to close monitoring.
