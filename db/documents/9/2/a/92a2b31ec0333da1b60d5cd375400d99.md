Meticulous preparation for PSA is mandatory and best practiced beforehand in a simulation environment.

Standard operative checklist procedures should be followed; the World Health Organization (WHO) template is useful.

- Verify identity, procedure, and consent.

- Mark the site/side.

- Check that needed medications are available. This may include reversal drugs (e.g., opioids/naloxone, benzodiazepines/flumazenil) and "agents/adjuncts" as some procedural medications lack reversal agents but have reversal adjuncts (e.g., propofol/bag-mask).

- Check monitoring devices: EKG, SaO2, EtCO2 (preferred if available as it is more sensitive for hypoventilation than SaO2) and review potential errors from devices (e.g., SaO2 may drop during automated blood pressure cuff inflation by occlusion of arterial flow.) Review allergies.

- Assess for airway difficulties/anomalies (e.g., Mallimpati score).

- Patients with contact lenses should be removed (especially for nitrous oxide use).

- Individually confirm team members' roles and preparation.

- Display the necessary images.

At the conclusion of the procedure, as the patient recovers, confirm each team member's confirmation that their role shows stability before leaving the procedure room.
