C. pneumoniae, previously known as TWAR, belongs to the genus Chlamydia. The other two chlamydial species infecting humans are C. psittaci and C. trachomatis.
C. pneumoniae and C. psittaci cause respiratory tract infections in adults, and Chlamydia trachomatis causes pneumonia mostly in children.

Only 1 serovar or strain of C. pneumoniae has been identified to date.C. pneumonia was then isolated from the respiratory tract from a University of Washington student before being recognized as a major respiratory pathogen in 1983.C. pneumoniae exists in two distinct morphological forms; the elementary body (EB), which is infectious, and the reticulate body (RB), which is metabolically active and replicates after causing cell lysis.C. pneumoniae.

C. pneumoniae is one of the pathogens commonly involved in community-acquired pneumonia, and it spreads from human to human via respiratory droplets without any known animal reservoir. Transmission via asymptomatic carriers has also been reported. The incubation period can be about 3-4 weeks, which is more than most respiratory infections.

C.psittaci can transmit through contact with infected birds, usually when humans inhale the pathogen present in dried feces of birds. However, human to human transmission can also occur.

C.trachomatis pneumonia is transmitted from the infected mother’s birth canal to the child during childbirth.
