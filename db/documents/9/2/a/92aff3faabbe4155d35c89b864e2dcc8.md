It is best to administer digoxin intravenously to achieve rapid digitalization. Intramuscular injections are highly discussed. No more than 2 ml of the drug should be injected at the same site. The injection should be made deep into the muscle, and the overlying area massaged post-injection. Intravenous injections are metabolized more efficiently than intramuscular injections and are the preferred route, as only about 80% of the drug is absorbed in intra-muscular injections as compared to intravenous dosing. There is a risk of local irritation or myonecrosis.

Digoxin has an oral bioavailability of approximately 75%, although intake efficacy might diminish when taking digoxin with high-fiber foods. Some patients possess gut flora that metabolizes digoxin to dihydrodigoxin, thereby decreasing the drug's absorption. Macrolides interfere with normal gut microbiota, which normally metabolizes digoxin and can lead to higher absorbed concentrations. Metoclopramide decreases digoxin absorption. Indomethacin and spironolactone decrease the clearance of the drug.

Important considerations during administration include

- Requesting an electrocardiogram before digoxin administration

- Electrolytes, mainly potassium levels, must be assessed and normalized before digoxin administration.

- If bradycardia is present, re-evaluate and withhold treatment as necessary.

Clinical staff should monitor the plasma digoxin level at least 6 hours or 12 hours post-administration of the last loading dose, as this is the time to achieve steady-state levels. Recommended thresholds of therapeutic serum digoxin levels are between 0.5Â to 2 ng/dl.
