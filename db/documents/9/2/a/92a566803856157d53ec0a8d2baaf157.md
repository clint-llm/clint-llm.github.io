TEN can be induced by medications, infections, vaccines, or even idiopathic. Reaction to certain drugs is by far the most common cause. Various medications have been linked to TEN, including antibiotics (sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, penicillins, and quinolones), antiepileptics (barbiturate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate, and lamotrigine), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), especially oxybutazone and piroxicam, antiviral drugs (oseltamivir and abacavir), and allopurinol. According to the 2008 Euro-SCAR study, the drugs with a high risk of TEN are lamotrigine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, nevirapine, phenobarbital, sulfonamide, sulfasalazine, allopurinol, and oxicam-NSAIDs.

Other potential etiologies include infections such as mycoplasma pneumoniae, hepatitis A and human herpesvirus 7, malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer, and vaccination especially meningococcal vaccine.
