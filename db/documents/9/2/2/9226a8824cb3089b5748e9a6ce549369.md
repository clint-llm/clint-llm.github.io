The prognosis of gout depends on the comorbidity of each individual. Mortality is higher in individuals with cardiovascular comorbidity. When gout receives proper treatment, most patients will live a normal life with mild sequelae. Patients whose symptoms appear earlier in life will usually have a more severe disease at presentation. For those who do not modify their lifestyle, recurrent flare-ups are common.
