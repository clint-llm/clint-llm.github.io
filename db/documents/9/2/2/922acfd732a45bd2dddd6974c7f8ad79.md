Common Pitfalls encountered when designing simulation scenarios include the following:

- Lack of Realism: The scenario does not match real-world experience, and the learner is disengaged.

- Excessive Complexity: The scenario is so complex that the learner is overloaded cognitively, and the learning objectives are not met.

- Ineffective Scenario: The scenario design is such that the learner has been diverted from the objectives, and performance cannot be ascertained based on the design.

- Unattainable Objectives: The learners have not reached the requisite level of knowledge, training, or experience to reasonably attain the objectives.

- Objectives Overload: The scenario incorporates too many objectives, again confusing the learner and overloading the learner cognitively.

- Abbreviated Debriefing: The learners do not have adequate time to process their own performance, learning objectives, and educational points from the scenario.

When designing a simulation scenario, these pitfalls should be kept in mind as the objective of the scenario, whether formative or not, is to assist the learners in achieving the learning objectives rather simply performing the scenario.
