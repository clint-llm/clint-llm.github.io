Scleroderma renal crisis is a life-threatening complication of scleroderma. It typically presents with the abrupt onset of severe hypertension accompanied by rapidly progressive renal failure, hypertensive encephalopathy, congestive heart failure, and/or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of scleroderma renal crisis and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe factors that suggest increased risk of developing scleroderma renal crisis.
- Review the typical presentation of scleroderma renal crisis.
- Explain the management of scleroderma renal crisis.
- Identify strategies to optimize care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by scleroderma renal crisis.
