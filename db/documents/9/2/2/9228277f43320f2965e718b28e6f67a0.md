There is no clear consensus on the origin of the procedure's name, nor when it was first performed. However, the belief that Julius Caesar was born in this fashion appears to be inaccurate. At the time of his birth, the procedure was performed only on a dead mother, in hopes to increase the population of the empire. Caesar's mother, Aurelia, was documented to have witnessed his invasion of Britain in 55 BC.

There are multiple speculations as to the origin of the name. One such speculation is that Lex Regia, Royal Law, prohibited a pregnant woman dying in pregnancy to be buried until the fetus was first removed for separate burial. Roman King Numa Pompilius made this declaration sometime between 715 BC and 673 BC

The origin of the procedure's names is as mysterious as the date the procedure first was first. Greek mythology attributes Apollo as the one delivering Asclepius from his mother in this manner. According to modern medicine, one report dated the first procedure in Switzerland in 1500, and others place it in the British Isles in 1738 by a midwife. Both report survival of the mother.
