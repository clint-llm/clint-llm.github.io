Information regarding the mechanism of injury is extremely important as it will guide decisions about the timing of the nerve repair. The majority of neurotmesis injuries will involve sharp cuts with glass, knife, or sharp metals.

Physical examination of the extremity involved and the muscles innervated will point toward a specific nerve involved. The sensory distribution of the nerve involved is tested. There is complete anesthesia of the sensory distribution of the nerve. All muscles involved will show flaccid paralysis. A flicker of movement or some degree of preserved sensation indicates that the lesion is incomplete. Eliciting a Tinel sign is useful in following patients with a peripheral nerve injury to determine the regeneration of axons across the defect.
