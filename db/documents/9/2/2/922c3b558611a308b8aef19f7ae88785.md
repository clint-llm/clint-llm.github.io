Histological examination demonstrates that BPH is a hyperplastic process with an increase in cell number on histology (hyperplasia); these occur both in the periurethral and transition zones. Histological studies have demonstrated both glandular and stromal proliferation. Specifically, periurethral zones demonstrate stromal nodules, whereas glandular nodular proliferation is seen within the transition zone.
