The examination of the abdomen is an essential component of all comprehensive examinations of all patients of all ages. It is performed in routine or scheduled examinations, in patients with focused or generalized trauma, in patients with non-specific complaints or specific abdominal or gastrointestinal complaints. The examination may be detailed or rapid, depending on the situation or condition necessitating the examination. However, the role of abdominal examination in the developed world has largely been replaced by imaging techniques in the past two and a half decades. A review article found that the number of CT scans performed in children visiting the emergency departments increased five-fold from 1996 to 2008.

An abdominal examination is helpful for the diagnosis of multiple pediatric diseases or conditions. Performing an abdominal examination in children, however, is challenging. This is partly due to difficulty in understanding the procedure and lower pain tolerance in children. Some sources mention that classic findings, such as right lower quadrant tenderness in appendicitis, may not be appreciated during pediatric abdominal examinations.
