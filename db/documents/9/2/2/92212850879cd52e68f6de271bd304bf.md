Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is a subtype of the marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), which is non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is also called extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (EMZL). It is frequently noted in the stomach but virtually can involve any mucosal site like the salivary gland, ocular adnexa, lung, and elsewhere. EMZL is clinically distinct from the other types of MZL, the splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), and the nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL) with specific diagnostic criteria, clinical behavior, different genetic features, and therapeutic implications.
