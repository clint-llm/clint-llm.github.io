A modified Allen test is a must before an ABG is drawn from either of the upper extremities to check for adequate collateral flow. Alternatively, pulse oximetry and duplex ultrasound can be used too. The arterial site commonly used is the radial artery, as it is superficial and easily palpable over the radial styloid process. The next most common site is the femoral artery. The test is performed on the unilateral upper extremity chosen for the procedure (Please look at the attached image for graphical illustration). The selected upper extremity is flexed at the elbow, and the patient requested to clench the raised fist for 30 seconds. Then pressure is applied over the ulnar and radial arteries with the intent to occlude the blood flow. After five seconds, unclench the raised fist. The palm will now appear pale, white, or blanched. Then pressure over the ulnar artery is released while the radial artery compression is maintained. In 10 to 15 seconds, the palm returns to its original color, indicating adequate Ulnar collateral blood flow. If the palm does not return to its actual color, it is an abnormal test and unsafe toÂ puncture the radial artery. Similarly, the radial collateral blood flow is assessed by maintaining ulnar artery pressure and releasing the radial artery pressure.
