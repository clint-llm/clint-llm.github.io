Due to similar presentation and resemblances of the underlying pathophysiology, other causes of pulmonary hypertension should be ruled out. Certain rheumatological and autoimmune diseases, such as mixed connective tissue disorder, scleroderma, and systemic lupus erythematosus, may have similar presentations. Hepatitis B, C, and HIV serologies also must be considered, as these may have systemic vascular presentations.
