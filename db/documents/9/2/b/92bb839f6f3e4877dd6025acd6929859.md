As mentioned, during thyroid and parathyroid procedures, surgical injury to these nerves is a feared complication. Intraoperative superior and recurrent nerve monitoring during head and neck procedures is common and is used frequently with thyroid and parathyroid procedures. Monitoring is primarily by the placement of a neural integrity monitoring (NIM) endotracheal tube. The nerve monitor is part of the endotracheal tube and is testable before the procedure begins to ensure proper placement.
