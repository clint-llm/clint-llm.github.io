The onset and spectrum of symptoms in gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) depend on the underlying etiology of the obstruction. The patients often present with nausea and vomiting as their chief complaint. Acute onset of symptoms may lead a health care provider to suspect gallstones, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, volvulus, or migration of PEG-tubes in specific cases. Benign causes of GOO most commonly present with early satiety (53%) and bloating (50%), while more malignant causes include pain, vomiting, weight loss, and malnutrition.

The physical examination may reveal evidence of hypovolemia and weight loss. Abdominal distension and a succussion splash occur in about 25% of patients and is a reflection of retained gastric material. If a succussion splash is noted more than four hours after a meal, it is suggestive of GOO with a 50% sensitivity.

A detailed drug history to elucidate the use of NSAIDs, aspirin, opioids, anticholinergic medications is important. The patients who smoke should be educated and advised against the use.
