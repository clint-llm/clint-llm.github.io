Osteomyelitis is a common and potentially devastating complication of postoperative, traumatic or chronic wounds. Patients with diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy, and foot ulcers are at high risk for osteomyelitis as are those who abuse IV drugs, and children. Clinicians must have a high index of suspicion and order appropriate lab tests and diagnostic imaging studies as soon as a wound does not respond to standard treatment in a timely fashion.  Any diabetic foot wound that does not improve with 4 weeks of standard wound care including debridement and appropriate dressings should be checked for osteomyelitis.

Chronic refractory osteomyelitis is diagnosed after an infection has not shown improvement or resolution after 4 to 6  weeks of adequate and appropriate surgical debridement and culture-directed antibiotics. At that point, it is appropriate to add adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen treatment to the regimen. Patients are usually treated at 2.4 atmospheres absolute for 90 minutes with 5-minute air breaks every 30 minutes for 40 to 60 treatment sessions. The Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein should be measured every 4 to 6 weeks during treatment to assess response. These levels should fall to normal with adequate culture-directed antibiotic therapy.  IV antibiotics are often needed for 6 weeks or more.
