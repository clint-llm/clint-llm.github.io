There are now percutaneous inserted ventricular assist devices available. This device is a non-pulsatile axial flow pump that is placed across the aortic valve and pumps blood from the left ventricle (LV to aorta). This activity reviews types, indications, contraindications, and complications of such a device. It is a type of mechanical circulatory support device that requires a team of health professions, well trained in managing high-risk patients that require ventricular support.

**Objectives:**
- Define percutaneous inserted ventricular assist devices and explore the different types of these devices.
- Outline the indications of percutaneous inserted ventricular assist device placement.
- Summarize the pertinent clinical trials regarding percutaneous inserted ventricular assist devices.
- Describe the effect of the interprofessional team on the outcome of patients with percutaneous inserted ventricular assist device placement.
