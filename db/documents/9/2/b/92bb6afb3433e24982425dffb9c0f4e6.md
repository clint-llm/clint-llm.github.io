The classic history of myoglobinuria points towards rhabdomyolysis and includes the triad of weakness, muscular pain, and dark urine. However, many cases of myoglobinuria present only with dark urine without any other physical symptoms. Patients may complain of some mild non-specific symptoms like tiredness or body aches with dark urine.

The history of the patient typically includes some pointers towards the cause of rhabdomyolysis like trauma, drug use, strenuous exercise, coma, or some muscle tissue disorder.

Physical examination may reveal muscle weakness, tenderness, or signs of trauma, but in non-trauma cases, it often is negative. If the muscle tenderness is present, it is usually more prominent in the proximal muscle groups in inflammatory etiologies.
