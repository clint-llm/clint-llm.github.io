Genetic hearing loss accounts for 50% of all cases of hearing loss.  The remainder is due to acquired causes such as infection, trauma, noise exposure, and ototoxicity.

Inherited genetic hearing loss can be categorized as part of a syndrome (30% of inherited hearing loss) and non-syndromic (70% of inherited hearing loss). For non-syndromic hearing loss, autosomal recessive is the most common inherited form, accounting for 75 to 80% of cases. Autosomal dominant comprises approximately 20%. X-linked, Y-linked, and mitochondrial-inherited comprise the remaining 5%.
