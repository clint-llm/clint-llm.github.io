# Definition/Introduction

In the late 1800s, Dr. Chvostek noticed that mechanical stimulation of the facial nerve (as with the examiner's fingertip, for example) could lead to twitching of the ipsilateral facial muscles.

The normal individual has four parathyroid glands that are usually located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. One or more parathyroid glands may get accidentally resected during surgical intervention on the thyroid. The parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH), and any resection of those glands can decrease PTH levels.

# Issues of Concern

The correlation between hypocalcemia and the Chvostek sign has long been accepted in the medical community, despite very little literature supporting this claim.

Chvostek sign has also been described in children with measles, diphtheria, scarlet fever, whooping cough or rickets, as well as myxedema.

# Clinical Significance

Among the most common postoperative complications following thyroid surgery is hypocalcemia.Â Research by Rio Del et al. showed a 13.8% incidence of hypocalcemia status post a thyroid lobectomy and a 38.8% incidence status post total thyroidectomy.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

One common physical exam finding with hypocalcemia is perioral numbness or tingling.
