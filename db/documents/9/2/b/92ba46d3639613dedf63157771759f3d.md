Fever of unknown origin (FUO) was first described by Dr. Petersdorf and Dr. Beesom in 1961.

A comprehensive history and physical examination can aid in diagnosis and direct diagnostic testing. Recommended investigations for work-up include complete blood count (CBC) with differential, three sets of blood cultures (from different sites, several hours apart, and before initiation of antibiotic therapy, if indicated), chest radiograph, complete metabolic panel (including hepatitis serologies if liver function tests are abnormal), urinalysis with microscopy and urine culture, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RA), cytomegalovirus IgM antibodies or virus detection in blood, heterophile antibody test, tuberculin skin test, HIV testing and computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen.

Over 200 malignant/neoplastic, infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, and miscellaneous disorders can cause FUO.

It is important to note that immunocompromised and HIV patients may require an entirely different approach in diagnosing and treatment of recurrent fevers. This article focuses on FUO in immunocompetent adult patients.
