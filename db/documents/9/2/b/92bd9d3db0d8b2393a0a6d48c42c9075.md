Post-operative management:

- Maintain adequate hydration and circulation volume

- Analgesia

- Keep the affected limb elevated and warm

- Frequent monitoring of the replant capillary refill, color, and temperature

- Avoid dressings changes in the first 48 to 72 hours to minimize manipulation of the repair

- Consider anticoagulation

- In cases of artery-only replants, consider stab incision to the distal amputated tip and apply heparin soaked gauze to allow venous drainage or use leeches instead. This treatment can end once the finger becomes pink with normal capillary refill thus indicating adequate venous drainage

Some patients require further surgery to improve their function, such as tenolysis, bone grafting, tendon transfer, etc.
