Once a patient presents with symptoms suggesting a Schatzki ring, the initial study in evaluation is a barium esophagram. If significant enough, it will show an area of the distal esophagus that is less distensible, creating a ring-like structure on radiographic images.  Often, a patient is asked to swallow a substance like a marshmallow or a barium tablet to assess the diameter of the ring. This is often followed by an endoscopy to evaluate the ring and then treat patients with symptoms. If the finding is incidental and the patient has no symptoms, treatment is not necessary until symptoms occur. However, endoscopy is still recommended to rule out other causes of strictures, especially esophageal malignancy. Biopsies should be performed if there is an irregular Z-line at the gastroesophageal junction to assess for Barrett esophagus. Biopsies of the ring can be done as a treatment method as well.
