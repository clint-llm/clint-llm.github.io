Cannabinoids are a collective group of compounds that act on cannabinoid receptors. They include plant-derived phytocannabinoids, synthetic cannabinoids, and endogenously-derived endocannabinoids. The primary source of cannabinoid toxicity is from plant-derived cannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoids. These agents act as cannabinoid receptor agonists. More than 60 naturally occurring cannabinoids are found in the Sativa and Indica species of Cannabis, with delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) being the main psychoactive compound. Other naturally occurring cannabinoids include cannabidiol and cannabinol. Marijuana is the most common colloquial name for crushed, dried leaves and flowers of the Cannabis plant. This activity describes cannabinoid toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of cannabinoid toxicity.
- Review the presentation of cannabinoid toxicity.
- Summarize the treatment options for cannabinoid toxicity.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by cannabinoid toxicity.
