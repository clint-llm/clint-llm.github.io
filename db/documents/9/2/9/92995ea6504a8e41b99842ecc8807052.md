Histologically PRP presents with irregular, psoriasiform acanthosis of the epidermis along with a very characteristic overlying "checkerboard" pattern of parakeratosis (alternating vertical and horizontal ortho-and parakeratosis). Often predominant follicular plugging with shoulder parakeratosis is noted. Thick, rather than thin, suprapapillary plates and lack of neutrophils in the stratum corneum may help distinguish PRP from psoriasis. Variable mild superficial perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, occasional epidermal spongiosis and focal acantholytic dyskeratosis have been reported but are not consistently found.
