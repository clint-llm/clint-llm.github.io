The non-stress test is one of the most widely used techniques for antepartum fetal evaluation. Antepartum fetal surveillance techniques are used to assess the risk of fetal death in pregnancies complicated by preexisting maternal conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus) as well as those in which complications have developed (e.g., fetal growth restriction).

The interpretation of the non-stress test is as reactive or none reactive. The criteria for a reactive NST are at least two FHR accelerations lasting at least 15 seconds and rising at least 15 beats/minute above the established baseline heart rate. Most term fetuses have many of these accelerations in each 20- to 30- minute period of active sleep, and the term fetus seldom goes more than 60 minutes, and certainly not more than 100 minutes without meeting these criteria.

Vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) may be used to change fetal state from quiet to active sleep and shorten the length of the NST. If the NST remains nonreactive after 60 minutes.

Preterm fetuses, fetuses with intrauterine growth restriction at similar gestation, fetuses with maternal medications such as sedatives and magnesium sulfate frequently have paired accelerations-movement that do not meet these criteria.

Falsely reactive NSTs occur at a rate of four to five per 1000 in the largest studies. These occur in asymmetric IUGR, oligohydramnios, or metabolic problems associated with fetal macrosomia for whom false-reassuring rates may reach 15%. Thus, NST has significant liabilities in the groups at highest risk. Strong evidence, including data from randomized trials, shows that practitioners should not rely on the NST in isolation when determining the antenatal status of such fetuses.

The nonreactive NST is, by definition, an FHR monitoring interval that does not meet the criteria above. There is variation in the total duration allowed for NST. It ranges from 20 minutes recommended by ACOG to 40 minutes and even 60 minutes by some authors.  The most common explanation for a nonreactive NST is the presence of a longer than average sleep cycle in a normal fetus.  A nonreactive NST, especially if variability remains present and there are no decelerations, should not be assumed to indicate fetal compromise. The present standard of care is to conduct an ultrasound evaluation with a full biophysical profile. NST in isolation has seen frequent use for post-term pregnancies. However, the presence of decreased fetal movement in post-term pregnancies indicates a more comprehensive evaluation with full ultrasound biophysical profile.

Fetal heart rate acceleration may be absent during a period of quiet fetal sleep. Studies demonstrated that the longest time between successive acceleration in the healthy term fetus is approximately 40 minutes.  However, the fetus may fail to exhibit heart rate accelerations for up to 80 minutes and still be normal. CNS depressants such narcotics, phenobarbital, magnesium sulfate and beta blockers such as propranolol can reduce fetal heart rate reactivity.

Variability, constant fluctuations form baseline FHR, as well as decelerations, slowing of FHR, can also be detected on NST. Moderate variability has an amplitude that ranges from 6 to 25 beats per minute and is an indication of a healthy nervous system. Decelerations that are nonrepetitive, and last less than 30 seconds, do not require intervention. Deviation from these guidelines can be associated with fetal compromise and require further evaluation.
