Patients are commonly seen with complaints of cramping pain, occurring during and after exercise and relieved by rest. This condition is known as claudication. A detailed history and physical examination are vital to determine the severity of the disease and distinguish it from other diagnoses. Typically, more proximal muscle cramping is related to a higher degree of stenosis. In a particular subset, patients present with a triad of buttock claudication, erectile dysfunction, and absent femoral pulses in a grouping known as Leriche syndrome.

Patients may present on an emergent visit due to sequelae of severe stenosis or an acute embolic event, causing chronic limb-threatening ischemia.
