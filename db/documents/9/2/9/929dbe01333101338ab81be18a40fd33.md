The entire upper limb consists of the shoulder, arm, forearm, and hand. The function of the forearm is to serve as a bridge between the motion of the arm and the wrist and hand. The nerves of the forearm are ultimately responsible for innervating the muscles of the forearm. In addition to motor function, the nerves of the forearm provide afferent cutaneous sensation to the forearm, wrist, and hand.

The nerves carry a lot of information: electrical, biochemical (immune substances, growth factors, and hormones). The nerves participate in the metabolism of the tissue in which they pass.
