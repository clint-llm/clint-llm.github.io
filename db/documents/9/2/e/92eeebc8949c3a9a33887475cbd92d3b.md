Cor triatriatum is a rare congenital heart defect in which a thin, fibromuscular membrane causes division of either the right or left atrium, resulting in the presence of three atrial compartments. Infants are usually diagnosed during the first year of life, however, in some cases this disease is not diagnosed until adulthood. Patients may present with cough, dyspnea, wheezing, pulmonary congestion, tachycardia, heart murmur, palpitations, pallor, and/ or failure to thrive. This condition requires surgical management or heart failure may develop due to complications such as recurrent pneumonia and bronchial inflammation. This activity reviews the clinical evaluation of cor triatriatum and the role of the health professional team in coordinating the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain when cor triatriatum should be considered on differential diagnosis. 
- Identify the best tests for cor triatriatum.
- Review the management of cor triatriatum.
- Describe how coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid diagnosis of cor triatriatum and subsequently decrease associated morbidity and mortality in affected patients.
