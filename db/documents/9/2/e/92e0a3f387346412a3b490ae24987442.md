The mechanisms of apoptosis may help elucidate the pathologies of uncontrolled cell growth or death. Apoptosis is under the mediation of two major pathways: the extrinsic or death receptor pathway and the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway.

The BAX gene (Bcl-2 Associated X-protein) is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 gene family; it encodes a 21-kDa protein named BAX-alpha, whose association with Bcl-2 researchers believe plays a critical role in regulating intrinsic apoptosis.
