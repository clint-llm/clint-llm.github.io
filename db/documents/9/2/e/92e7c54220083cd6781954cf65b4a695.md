While the exact pathophysiology of opsoclonus is unclear, three theories have been hypothesized. Considering that the abnormal eye movements are saccadic in nature, the first theory hypothesizes that there may be underlying damage to omnipause neurons (ONs) in the pontine nucleus raphe interpositus resulting in saccadic intrusions.

A second theory, the brainstem theory, postulates that the saccadic intrusions in opsoclonus result from the changes in the synaptic membrane properties of burst cells, predisposing them to either excessive post-inhibitory rebound excitation after sustained inhibition by ONs or alternatively rendering these burst cells unresponsive to the efficient ON inhibition.

The final theory is the cerebellar theory. It proposes that there are dysfunctional cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), which result in failure to inhibit the fastigial nucleus (FN) in the cerebellum resulting in reinforcement of ONs inhibition and subsequent unopposed burst cell oscillation with resultant opsoclonus.

Recently, both humoral and cell-mediated immune mechanisms have been linked to paraneoplastic and idiopathic opsoclonus.

Due to the variability of the presence of these autoantibodies and many cases without any identifiable antibodies, it is unclear if their presence has any direct influence on the pathogenesis of opsoclonus or if they are merely an epiphenomenon of tumor presence.
