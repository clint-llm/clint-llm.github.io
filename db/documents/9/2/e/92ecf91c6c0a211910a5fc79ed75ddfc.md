All of the retinopathies reviewed here are leading worldwide causes of vision loss. Hypertensive retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy, and AMD will be increasingly important due to aging populations with increased incidences of hypertension and diabetes.  Advances in the treatment of prematurity have increased survival rates in ROP, thereby contributing to increased ROP incidence.   Moreover, most retinopathies have a multifactorial etiologies with lifestyle, environmental factors, and genetics all playing important roles.

About one-third of individuals with diabetes have signs of diabetic retinopathy.

Hypertensive retinopathy is present in about two-thirds of all hypertensive outpatients with hypertensive duration, age, and systolic blood pressure all being significant risks.

Age-Related macular degeneration (AMD) is a prime cause of blindness in the elderly (older than 60 years old) and is less prevalent in people with African ancestry.  Early AMD is more prevalent in people with European ancestry compared to Asians.

A very large-scale and comprehensive study (the USA and Canada) on the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity shows that at least 40% of at-risk-premature infants develop some stage of ROP but that most of these newborns improve without treatment.
