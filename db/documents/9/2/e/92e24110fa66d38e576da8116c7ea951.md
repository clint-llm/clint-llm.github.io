Myelophthisic anemia is categorized under the normocytic type of anemia. Myelophthisic anemia is anemia characterized by the presence of immature erythrocytes in the peripheral blood due to infiltration of the bone marrow by abnormal tissue. It is also one of the hypo-proliferative anemias because it results from inadequate production of red blood cells from the bone marrow. This activity reviews the cause and presentation of myelophthisic anemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the cause of myelophthisic anemia.
- Describe the peripheral blood smear in a patient with myelophthisic anemia.
- Summarize the treatment of myelophthisic anemia.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by myelophthisic anemia.
