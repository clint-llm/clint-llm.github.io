Vitamin A has a role in the regeneration of visual pigment, maintenance of mucosal membranes, and immune function. Deficiency can lead to night blindness due to poor regeneration of visual pigment in retinal rods. If the deficiency is allowed to persist, the rods will degenerate, and xerophthalmia will develop, leading to true blindness.
