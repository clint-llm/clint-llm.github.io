The location of the mammillary bodies is one factor that surgeons use as a guide in patients with craniopharyngiomas that involve the hypothalamus. In these patients, the location of the mammillary bodies move. Surgeons can measure the angle between the base of the mammillary bodies and the plane of the floor of the fourth ventricle in a midsagittal MRI as an indicator of the location of these types of tumors. Angles less than 60 degrees indicate a tuberal-interventricular tumor. Angles greater than 90 degrees show tumor invagination of the third ventricle. Thus mammillary body position is a quick reference for the location of these types of tumors. By understanding the location of the tumors, surgeons have more information on how to treat and manage these tumors.
