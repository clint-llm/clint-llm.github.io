Peripheral venous access is a key need for resuscitating patients of all ages. An ideal site for venous catheterization is one that is easy to access and poses very little risk to the patient. Sites for venous access in young children include the hands, feet, forearms, and scalp. The most common reasons for intravenous therapy in infants include the delivery of maintenance fluids, blood and blood products, medications, and nutrition. The scalp veins are commonly used to secure intravenous access in neonates and infants, often after unsuccessful attempts at cannulation of upper and lower limb veins. This activity illustrates the technique, indications and contraindications of scalp vein catheterization and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of infants requiring intravenous access.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the techniques for performing scalp vein catheterization.
- Describe the indications for scalp vein catheterization.
- Outline the complications of scalp vein catheterization.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients requiring scalp vein catheterization.
