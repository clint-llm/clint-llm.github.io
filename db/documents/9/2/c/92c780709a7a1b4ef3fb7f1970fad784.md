Parents need to be reassured regarding cosmetic outcomes and counseled to have realistic expectations. During counseling and education, emphasis should be given to improving the functionality of the lid and retaining the visual potential of the eye. Treatment of other ocular problems, such as astigmatism, amblyopia, and strabismus, will need continued management, so parents should understand that follow-up will be necessary for the patient's best possible visual outcome. Genetic consultation is essential in children with associated syndromes, especially Treacher Collins syndrome, as it is transmitted autosomal dominantly.
