The biliopancreatic diversion was first described by Scorpinaro in 1979. This procedure combined a horizontal gastric resection with the closure of a duodenal stump, gastroileal anastomosis, and an ileoileal anastomosis, to create a 50 cm common channel and a 250 cm alimentary channel. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing the patients for biliopancreatic diversion.
