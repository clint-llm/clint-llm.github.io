Initial symptoms of mixed connective tissue disease are usually non-specific and include arthralgia, malaise, myalgia, and low-grade fever. Almost any organ system can be affected by MCTD.

Skin: The most common skin change is the Raynaud phenomenon, which is also the most common presenting feature of MCTD. Hand edema, acrosclerosis, calcinosis cutis, telangiectasia, erythema nodosum, hair loss, and vasculitis of digits are other manifestations. Discoid plaques and a malar rash similar to SLE can also occur. Nailfold changes are visible by capillary microscopy. Case reports describe panniculitis involving the abdomen, legs, and breasts.

Joint: Joint involvement is usually more severe than in SLE. Arthritis with deformities similar to RA can also occur. Arthritis mutilans resembling psoriatic arthritis is rarely present.

Muscle: Inflammatory myopathy clinically and histologically similar to polymyositis often manifests as myalgia and is a common symptom of MCTD. Rarely myositis can also be the initial presentation.

Lung: Pulmonary involvement occurs in almost 73% of patients, and dyspnea is the most common symptom. Patients can also be asymptomatic until fatal consequences arise.

Heart: Pericarditis is the most common variant of cardiac disease involving up to 40% of patients.

Kidney: Renal involvement occurs in 15 to 25% of MCTD patients. Most patients are usually asymptomatic.

The central nervous system(CNS): Though the lack of CNS involvement is characteristic of MCTD, mild involvement has been described in about 25% of patients.

Gastrointestinal tract: Esophageal hypomotility, dilatation, and GERD are frequent features. Less common manifestations are pancreatitis, megacolon, duodenal bleeding, portal hypertension, and autoimmune hepatitis. Rarely patients can present with protein-losing enteropathy. They often have anasarca due to hypoproteinemia.

Hematological involvement: Anemia and leukopenia are common, while there are also reports of thrombocytopenia.
