The SIR 2013 practice guidelines

- clinically significant renal hematoma (4.9%)

- clinically significant pain (1.2%)

- pneumothorax (0.6%) and

- hemorrhage requiring transfusion (0.4%).

Anecdotally, vascular injuries not requiring treatment are much more common than are reported in such studies, which do not screen all patients post-biopsy with ultrasound to assess for their presence.  Whereas an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is not mentioned in either of the two sources above, an AVF requiring clinical attention occurred after about 1% of biopsies in a study performed by an experienced physician

Nearly every patient develops at least some degree of perirenal hematoma, which is detected more easily on CT or MRI than on US.  One in several thousand patients will lose his/her kidney secondary to a complication, and deaths have occurred following complications of renal biopsies.
