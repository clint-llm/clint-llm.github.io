HIV crosses the blood-brain barrier and infiltrates the macrophages in the central nervous system. A virus-induced fusion of macrophages leads to the formation of giant cells and astrocytes activation and damage (astrocytes are cells that provide metabolic support and detoxify neurons), ultimately leading to neuronal damage in many parts of the brain. The damage is caused by verotoxins, including HIV proteins gp41, gp120, Tat, Vpr, Nef, and Rev. The subcortical structures are most affected, like the limbic structures and basal ganglia.
