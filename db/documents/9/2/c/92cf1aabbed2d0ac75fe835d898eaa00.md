Gross examination of hepatocellular adenomas reveals that the lesions are well-circumscribed, may appear yellow or light brown in color, and have a soft consistency. Most are solitary and range in size from 2 to 15 cm. These lesions tend to be larger in women on the oral contraceptive pill. Most are located in the right lobe and are subscapular. The microscopic exam usually reveals no sign of malignancy, but the cells contain abundant glycogen or fat. The liver architecture is absent, and one may not visualize central veins, bile ducts, or portal tracts.
