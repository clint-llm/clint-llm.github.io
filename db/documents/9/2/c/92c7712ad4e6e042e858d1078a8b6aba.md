The cardiovascular system provides blood supply throughout the body. By responding to various stimuli, it can control the velocity and amount of blood carried through the vessels. The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, arteries, veins, and capillaries. The heart and vessels work together intricately to provide adequate blood flow to all parts of the body. The regulation of the cardiovascular system occurs via a myriad of stimuli, including changing blood volume, hormones, electrolytes, osmolarity, medications, adrenal glands, kidneys, and much more. The parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems also play a key role in the regulation of the cardiovascular system.
