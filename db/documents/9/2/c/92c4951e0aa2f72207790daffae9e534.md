Setmelanotide is a medication that acts on the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) for the treatment of severe obesity caused by genetic disorders, including deficiency of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1), or leptin receptor (LEPR). This activity reviews the indication, mechanism of action, adverse events, contradiction, monitoring, and toxicity of setmelanotide therapy, which can provide essential information to the clinical team members responsible for managing the care of patients with severe obesity and its related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of setmelanotide.
- Identify the most common adverse effects of setmelanotide therapy.
- Summarize the contraindication associated with setmelanotide therapy.
- Outline the indication, monitoring, and toxicity associated with setmelanotide.
