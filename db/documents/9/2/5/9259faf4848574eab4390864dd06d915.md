The spinal trigeminal nucleus (SN) is located in the lateral medulla of the brainstem. It extends down to the level of the C3 vertebra, at which point it becomes continuous with the dorsal spinal horn.

The SN incorporates sensory information from different cranial nerves, but its inputs and physiological importance come principally from the three extracranial divisions of the trigeminal nerve (V1, ophthalmic; V2, maxillary; V3, mandibular). These extracranial nerves initially fuse at the trigeminal ganglion,****enteringÂ the cranial vault through the superior orbital fissure, foramen rotundum, and foramen ovale.

The spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve is a longitudinally-shaped nucleus situated in the caudal pons and medulla, which receives sensory afferents relating to pain and temperature from the orofacial region supplied by the trigeminal nerve and, together with the principal sensory nucleus, is sometimes termed the trigeminal sensory nuclear complex (TSNC)

The spinal trigeminal nucleus is further subdivided anatomically into the pars oralis, pars interporalis, and pars caudalis

The SN projects both contralaterally and ipsilaterally to the ventral posteromedial nucleus of the thalamus via the ventral and dorsal trigeminothalamic tracts
