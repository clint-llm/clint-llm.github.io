The International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) progressive supranuclear palsy study group published the MDS-PSP criteria in 2017

**Radiographic Features**

Neuroimaging in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy by MRI shows atrophy and signal increase in the midbrain, degeneration of the red nucleus, atrophy of the quadrigeminal plate, enlargement of the aqueduct and third ventricle, atrophy of the pons and cerebellum, and signal increase in the inferior olives. With the progression of the disease, frontal and temporal lobe atrophy may develop. While no feature on MRI or functional imaging studies is entirely specific for progressive supranuclear palsy, the “hummingbird sign” is often present, in which the shape of the rostral midbrain atrophy on mid-sagittal images looks like a hummingbird.
