The most common indications for abdominal hysterectomy are the following:

- Abnormal uterine bleeding

- Malignancy and premalignant disease

- Uterine leiomyoma

- Endometriosis

- Pelvic organ prolapse

- Chronic pelvic pain

- Pelvic infection

Whenever feasible, the vaginal route is the preferred surgical approach for hysterectomy.

Uterine size larger than 12 weeksâ€™ gestation considered a reasonable qualification for an abdominal approach to hysterectomy; however, with the advances in surgical technology and the consistently proven superior outcomes of patients undergoing hysterectomy with minimally invasive approaches, less invasive techniques are favored over the abdominal route when feasible.
