Due to the black box warning for hypersensitivity reactions and bone marrow suppression, paclitaxel should not be given to patients who have had a severe hypersensitivity reaction with paclitaxel, patients with solid tumors who have a baseline neutrophil count of fewer than 1500 cells/mm^3, or patients with AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma if the baseline neutrophil count is less than 1000 cells/mm^3. Bone marrow suppression is dose-dependent and is a dose-limiting toxicity. If it occurs, future doses should be reduced by 20% for severe neutropenia and consider supportive therapy (growth factor treatment).
