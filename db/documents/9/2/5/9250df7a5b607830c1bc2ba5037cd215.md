Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) describes a transient airway narrowing occurring during physical exertion. The name EIB is favored over exercise-induced asthma (EIA) as recommended by the American Thoracic Society (ATS), and American Academy/College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. EIB can also be denoted as EIB with asthma (EIBa), and EIB without asthma, (EIBwa).
