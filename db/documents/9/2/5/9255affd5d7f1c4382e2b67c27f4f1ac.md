The American Society of Hematology defines immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) as isolated thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000/microL) with normal white blood cells and normal hemoglobin in the setting of a generalized purpuric rash.Â ITP was previously known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or immune thrombocytopenic purpura. ITP without a secondary cause or underlying disorder is known as primary ITP and is the focus of this article.

Primary ITP is further categorized into three phases based on the timing and continuation of symptoms.
