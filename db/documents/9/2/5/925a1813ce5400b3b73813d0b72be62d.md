Phacoemulsification is a modern cataract surgery first developed by Charles Kelman in 1967. The discovery of phacoemulsification came as a boon for the medical fraternity, where a cataractous lens could be emulsified through a small incision of 2-3 mm, giving perfect visual outcomes. There have been a lot of modifications to the current technique, but the basic technique of phacoemulsification remains the gold standard for cataract extraction. It involves the creation of a superior or temporal clear corneal incision of 2-3 mm, two side port incisions of at 2-3 clock hours on either side of the main wound. An ultrasonic probe is used to the trench, emulsify, and aspirate the cataractous lens from the main wound. The creation of small wounds revolutionized modern cataract surgery as it was self-sealing, astigmatically neutral, anatomically better-wound strength, and less incidence of complications. This also gave way to the concept of foldable IOL, wherein a foldable IOL can be implanted in the capsular bag through the smaller incision. Recent innovations have led to the development of micro-incisional cataract surgery (MICS), phakonit, and microphakonit. This activity gives insights into etiology, epidemiology, clinical evaluation by an interprofessional team, investigations needed, the technique, differential diagnosis, and complications of phacoemulsification.
