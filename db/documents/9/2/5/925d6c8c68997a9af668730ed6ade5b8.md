Doxycycline is the preferred drug for the treatment of ehrlichiosis, as well as for rickettsial infection. There is no clinical data to support the use of alternative agents for ehrlichiosis, although in vitro studies suggest that rifampin may be an option. However, as there is no demonstrated clinical efficacy of rifampin in treating ehrlichiosis and as rifampin has no efficacy against rickettsial infections, which can be indistinguishable from ehrlichiosis in the early stages of illness, doxycycline remains the drug of choice. Patients with ehrlichiosis typically defervesce in 48 to 72 hours after initiation of doxycycline. Treatment courses are typically five to seven days, based on illness severity. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that tooth staining is a rare cosmetic complication of doxycycline at the doses and duration used to treat ehrlichiosis and rickettsial infections. Concerns regarding age and potential tooth staining should not delay treatment with doxycycline in children with suspected ehrlichiosis. There is currently no recommendation for post-tick bite prophylaxis against ehrlichiosis in endemic areas.
