Alpha thalassemia has a broad spectrum of clinical presentations. Thus, an accurate and precise diagnosis is of utmost importance for appropriate patient management. A prenatal diagnosis of alpha thalassemia in such pregnancies where the fetus is diagnosed with Bart hydrops fetalis syndrome can be terminated, or timely initiation of intra-uterine transfusions can result in the birth of non-hydropic infants without significant neurological or congenital abnormalities in some of them.

Parents with undetected silent carriers or alpha-thalassemia minors can be given proper counseling. Techniques like molecular analysis can be used in hematological and clinically difficult cases, even with family hematological evaluations. This may be due to the occurrence of mild mutations or α- and β-interactions. The laboratory evaluation of alpha thalassemia thus holds paramount importance in improving the quality of life of such patients by timely initiation of therapy, counseling sessions, blood transfusions, if required, and prevention of future complications.
