Cinacalcet is a medication used in the management and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (on dialysis population), primary hyperparathyroidism for which the patient may not be a surgical candidate, and the treatment of calciphylaxis in patients with advanced kidney disease or on dialysis. It belongs to the calcimimetic class of medications. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for cinacalcet as a valuable agent in treating the conditions mentioned above. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the healthcare team in the care of patients with hyperparathyroidism and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of cinacalcet.
- Describe the possible adverse effects of cinacalcet
- Review the appropriate monitoring for patients receiving therapy with cinacalcet
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance knowledge regarding the side effects of cinacalcet and improve outcomes.
