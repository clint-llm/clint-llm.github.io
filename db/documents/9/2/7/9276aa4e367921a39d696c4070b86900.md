Males are more at risk of developing PSS. Though a study reported more females (56.6%), most studies have shown a male predilection.****However, affected age groups from various studies show significant regional variation. For instance, a European study reported that the incidence of PSS was highest in the 20 to 29 year age group.

Rates of PSS in Japan and Singapore have been documented to be within 1.7% to 4.3% of all uveitis diagnoses.****According to a Japanese study, the rate of glaucoma varies from 6.5% to 11.4% of all uveitic glaucoma.
