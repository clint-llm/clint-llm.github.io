Before initiating the procedure, a preoperative evaluationÂ is necessary according to WHO guidelines. This evaluation must include the medical-surgical history, the assessment of tumor generalization, the history of preoperative or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and the analysis of cardiopulmonary examinations. Current treatment should also be noted, including the consumption of anti-coagulants to minimize the risk of bleeding during surgical cytoreduction because it is a major surgery that will precede the act of HIPEC.

The patient must understand the advantages and disadvantages of the operation as well as the benefit/risk ratio of HIPEC because the procedure must be able to improve the survival of the oncological patient. A detailed description of the procedure is required to obtain informed consent from the patient.

The role of the anesthetist is essential during cytoreduction and HIPEC. Specific training is desirable.

Finally, this procedure must be performed in a qualified university center specializing in medico-surgical oncology and equipped with an appropriate medical surveillance infrastructure.
