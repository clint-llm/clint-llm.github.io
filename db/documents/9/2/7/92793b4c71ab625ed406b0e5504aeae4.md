Any form of steroid administration can cause glaucoma. It may occur after the administration of topical steroids for a relatively trivial condition, after the postoperative administration of steroids for refractive surgeries, or after prolonged systemic corticosteroid treatment for inflammatory conditions.

On examination, the eye is usually unremarkable. The IOP becomes elevated beyond the normal range of 10 mmHg to 22 mmHg, and upon soliciting a history of steroid use, the patient is said to have steroid-induced hypertension. As for all types of glaucoma, tonometry is crucial in diagnosing SIG.

The age of the patient may influence the clinical picture of SIG. Children may present with enlarged corneal diameters and buphthalmos similar to congenital glaucoma. Elderly patients who have received steroid treatment and had it subsequently discontinued may present as normal-tension glaucoma. It is critical to ask about a history of steroid use when presented with a patient with elevated IOP.
