In a normal healthy adult, the pleural cavity has minimal fluid, which acts as a lubricant for the two pleural surfaces. The amount of pleural fluid is around 0.1 ml/kg to 0.3 ml/kg and is constantly exchanged. Pleural fluid originates from the vasculature of parietal pleura surfaces and is absorbed back by lymphatics in the dependent diaphragmatic and mediastinal surfaces of parietal pleura. Hydrostatic pressure from the systemic vessels that supply the parietal pleura is thought to drive the interstitial fluid into the pleural space and hence has a lower protein content than serum. Accumulation of excess fluid can occur if there is excessive production or decreased absorption, or both overwhelming the normal homeostatic mechanism. If a pleural effusion is mainly due to increased hydrostatic pressure, they are usually transudative. Increased mesothelial and capillary permeability or impaired lymphatic drainage usually causes exudates.
