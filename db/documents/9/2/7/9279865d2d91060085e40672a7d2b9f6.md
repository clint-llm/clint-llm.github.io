Docusate has been in use in the U.S. since the 1950s. It has a well-documented safety and tolerability profile.

Docusate undergoes metabolism in the liver and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism to both active and inactive metabolites. Despite its hepatic metabolism and high plasma protein binding, there are no drug-drug interactions or reports of clinically apparent hepatoxicity.
