Scorpions are a common arthropod found on every continent except Antarctica. Scorpions may use their long, flexible tails to sting potential predators. Often, individuals unknowingly come into contact with scorpions and are stung, causing painful sensations associated with envenomation. This activity describes the presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment of scorpion stings and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the types of scorpion envenomation and associated toxicity of each species.
- Review the signs and symptoms of scorpion envenomation.
- Summarize the treatment of scorpion envenomation.
