The general mechanism of stimulants revolves around increased catecholamine levels and increased agonistic activity at adrenergic receptors.

**Caffeine**

- Caffeine has a unique mechanism as a stimulant as it works as an inhibitor at the adenosine receptors. Agonism at these receptors induces a sensation of drowsiness, and therefore inhibition at these receptors leads to increased energy levels.

- Caffeine also increases intraocular pressure in those affected with glaucoma.

**Amphetamines**

- The general mechanism of action of amphetamines is the induction of catecholamines, specifically norepinephrine and dopamine. These catecholamines lead to increased energy levels, euphoria, increased libido, and higher cognition.

**Methylphenidate**

- This drug blocks the dopamine transporter (DAT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), leading to increased dopamine and norepinephrine levels with the inhibition of their reuptake.

**Ephedrine**

- The primary mechanism of ephedrine is increased norepinephrine activity at the adrenergic receptors. Pseudoephedrine specifically works also as a nasal and sinus decongestant.

**Cocaine**

- The induction of most of the effects of cocaine is through the blockade of the dopamine transporter protein. This results in increased dopamine levels at the synaptic cleft, and hence the effects of dopamine become amplified.

**Pseudoephedrine**

- Pseudoephedrine is a drug used as a nasal decongestant and stimulant.

**Khat (Catha edulis)**

- Khat is a flowering plant indigenous to the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa.

**Modafinil**

- This is a CNS-stimulating agent used to treat sleepiness related to obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and shift-worker disorder. It is a weak dopamine uptake inhibitor, although the precise mechanism for its stimulating effects remains unknown.

Additional stimulants are available, especially in pre-workout supplements, which have direct agonistic effects on adrenergic receptors. Examples include synephrine, which is present in many supplements, and methylsynephrine, which the WADA banned. Other known stimulants, such as 1,3-dimethlamylamine (DMAA), have lesser-known pharmacologic mechanisms.
