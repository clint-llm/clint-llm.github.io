Propofol is a drug commonly used for sedation and the implementation of general anesthesia.  It is a phenol derivative given as an intravenous drug.  The most common formulation is in a lipophilic emulsion which allows for rapid distribution into the tissues, including across the blood-brain barrier. It is commonly used for sedation in the ICU because it has a short duration of action and rapid clearance.  It has dose-dependent effects leading to changes in blood pressure and heart rate at higher doses.  The initial administration can cause pain at the injection site. Though propofol has a generally favorable profile as a sedative, administering toxic doses can harm a patient’s overall condition.  Propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS) is the manifestation of propofol toxicity.
