Renal angiomyolipomas are mostly asymptomatic and typically diagnosed incidentally.

Historically, up to 15% of patients would present with a spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage (also called Wunderlich syndrome). This can be severe and lead to shock in about one-third of patients.

Possible clinical signs and symptoms include flank pain, palpable abdominal mass, urinary tract infection, hematuria, anemia, severe renal insufficiency, and shock.

Renal angiomyolipomas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex or pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis tend to be more aggressive, occur at an earlier age, are likelier to be bilateral and multifocal, and are larger at initial diagnosis than the more common sporadic variety.
