Following a detailed history, the clinical evaluation should include a thorough examination of ocular motility. Clinical features of Brown syndrome will be sought, and a forced duction test conducted. This can be performed with a local topical anesthetic (the patient may experience discomfort), or it can be performed with the patient anesthetized in theatre. A positive test is demonstrated by restriction of passive elevation in adduction of the affected eye. Retroplacement of the globe with forceps during attempted passive elevation in adduction will stretch the superior oblique muscle, accentuating the restriction of Brown syndrome. Dependent on the etiology, further imaging or laboratory investigations may become necessary, e.g., radiological imaging in cases of traumatic Brown syndrome and referral to medical teams for management of inflammatory causes may be warranted.
