Once a patient is diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma, the  AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) system for AIDS-related KS is used to determine the stage. It considers three factors:

- The extent of the tumor: Is the tumor localized (T0) or widespread (T1)?

- The status of the immune system: Is the CD4 T-cell count greater than 150 (I0) or less than 150 (I1)?

- The extent of systemic illness: Is there no systemic infection present (S0), or are there signs of systemic infection (S1)?

The stages that are considered good risk are T0 S0, T1 S0, or T0 S1. The stages that are considered poor risk are T1 S1. Since the introduction of HAART therapy for the treatment of HIV, the status of the immune system has been less important and is often not counted.

The staging of cutaneous angiosarcomas follows the staging used for soft tissue sarcoma, which is the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system. This is based on the following data:

- The extent of the tumor (T)

- The spread to nearby lymph nodes (N)

- Metastasis to other organ sites (M)

- The grade (G) of the cancer

After a TNM stage has been assigned, further information can be gathered to grade the tumor. The French or FNCLCC system is used to grade soft tissue sarcomas. Different parts of the body have different grading systems. A grading system has not been established for the head and neck in the same fashion that it has been formulated for the trunk, extremities, and retroperitoneal sarcomas.
