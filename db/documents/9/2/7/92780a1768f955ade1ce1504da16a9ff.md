The potential for MDMA toxicity exists with every ingestion. MDMA is commonly ingested orally through tablet form; however, the powder itself can be snorted.  Recreational doses of the drug can vary significantly. During the 1990s and early 2000s, doses ranged between 73 mg to 103 mg, while doses have also been reported to be as low as 50 mg to as high as 150 mg per tablet. Analysis of compounds sold as ecstasy/molly has also revealed the variability of composition with other substances aside from MDMA, including MDEA, MDA, ephedrine, ketamine, paracetamol, and other inactive substitutes and others that may have profound hemodynamic effects.

Ecstasy is also often taken with other illicit drugs, which can potentially compound each drug’s individual effects on the neurologic and cardiovascular system.
