Viruses invade the host at a site outside the CNS and replicate. Most then reach the spinal cord and brain hematogenously. HSV, rabies, and herpes zoster virus are important exceptions to this. They travel to the CNS from nerve endings in a retrograde manner. Once in the brain, the virus and the host’s inflammatory response disrupt neural cell function. On gross examination, there us usually cerebral edema, vascular congestion, and hemorrhage. Infiltration with leukocytes or microglial cells is also a common feature. With EEE and JE, the extent of necrosis can be significant.

Following arbovirus encephalitis, calcification often is seen, especially in children.

Herpes simplex tends to produce focal necrotic lesions with obvious intranuclear inclusions.
