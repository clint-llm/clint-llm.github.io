**Technical Considerations for EEG recordings in neonates**

- A sampling frequency of 256 Hz is the recommendation. Screen display settings include a gain of 10µV/mm, a minimum time constant of 0.3 sec, filter settings (high pass 0.5Hz, low pass at 70 Hz).

- Typically, the duration of the recording in neonates should include at least one complete sleep cycle (about 60-70 min ideally). However, under clinical situations, contingencies may force a shorter duration of the recording.

- Paper speed may be set at the standard speed of 30mm/sec. We may sometimes use slower paper speeds because it compresses the record and facilitates visual recognition of delta activity, which is the dominant frequency seen in neonates.

- A polygraphic recording should include at least eight scalp EEG electrodes, EKG, and respiration.

- We use a modified 10-20 EEG electrode placement system permitting a combination of a longitudinal and transverse bipolar montage.
