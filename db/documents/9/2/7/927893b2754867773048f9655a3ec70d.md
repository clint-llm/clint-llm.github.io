Many different factors can cause gallbladder dysfunction. Long periods of fasting, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and drastic weight loss can all increase the incidence of acalculous cholecystitis. Often other more serious conditions are present. Patients in the intensive care unit or those recovering from major surgeries or other serious ailments such as a stroke, heart attack, sepsis, severe burns, and extensive trauma are all at a higher risk to develop acalculous cholecystitis. Gallbladder stasis secondary to lack of gallbladder stimulation leads to the concentration of the bile salts with a build-up of pressure within the organ. This leads to ischemia, pressure necrosis and eventual perforation. This static condition also increases seeding and growth of enteric pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Bacteroides, Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Enterococcus faecalis. Individuals with chronic acalculous cholecystitis may have decreased function of gallbladder emptying, hypokinetic biliary dyskinesia. This may be from a variety of factors including hormone-related, vasculitis, and decreased nerve innervation from conditions such as diabetes. Often the exact etiology of chronic acalculous cholecystitis is unknown.
