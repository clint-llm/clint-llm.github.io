The body tends to store a small amount of natural silver, so the cumulative content of silver increases with age in the body. The accumulated composition is comprised of the binding protein and is present in tissues. With an increased amount of silver, the photoactivation and metal reduction produce a bluish-gray discoloration of the skin in light-exposure areas.

There are three subtypes of argyria

1. Generalized argyria: This is due to systemic exposure to silver followed by its uptake by the dermis, leading to a gray/blue saltish or metallic diffuse hue to the skin. This color difference becomes evident predominantly in sun-exposed areas.

Azure lunula is a subtype in which there will be a bluish discoloration of the lunula of the fingernails.

2. Localized argyria: This is due to local silver deposition through skin incisions or percutaneous absorption via sweat gland pores. The resultant macular spots or clusters of spots tend to be darker, sometimes almost black.

Amalgam tattoo is the most common subtype of localized argyria and is due to the impregnation of silver-contained dental amalgam into oral mucosa that may occur during restorative dentistry procedures. It is characterized by a flat, dark-blue mucosal lesion near a restored tooth.

3. Argyrosis: This is due to the deposition of silver in the eye. The lesions have a predilection for the corneal Descemet membrane and appear small, darker lesions with greenish and brownish tones.
