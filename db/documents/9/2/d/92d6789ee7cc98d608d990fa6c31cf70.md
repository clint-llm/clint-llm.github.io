The history given by a patient with koilonychia can vary greatly. It can either be a congenital defect that is present at birth or it can be a defect that has gradually become apparent. It can be present at any age. Patients or their family members may complain of a nail that appears scooped out. The abnormality is more clearly appreciated from the lateral side of the nail plate. The findings on history and physical examination shall further assist in narrowing the differential diagnosis.

Subtle koilonychia may be difficult to grasp only on visual examination and in the clinical setting, it is not practical to take appropriate measurements of the nail plate convexity as complex mathematics is required. So, to diagnose koilonychia, a clinical test has been classically described called, the “Water-drop test”.
