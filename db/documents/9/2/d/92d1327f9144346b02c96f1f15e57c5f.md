High-energy trauma is usually required to cause tibiofemoral dislocation at the knee joint.Â To disrupt this joint, multiple concomitant ligamentous injuries and instability would also be expected. Motor vehicle collisions, sports-related injuries involving high velocity, and falls all have been implicated as causes. Posterior and anterior dislocations occur most frequently; medial, lateral, and rotatory dislocations are also possible.
