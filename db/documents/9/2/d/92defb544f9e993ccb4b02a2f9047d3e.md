A history and examination are obtained with a focus on detecting any contraindications to non-surgical rhinoplasty, as listed previously (SEE CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Preoperative photography using standard rhinoplasty views should be taken both before and 1 to 2 weeks after the procedure. Digital imaging software should be considered, as this helps to improve patient-clinician communication and provides a realistic expectation of the procedure results.

The skin should undergo meticulously disinfecting using chlorhexidine gluconate wipes.

Topical anesthetic (e.g., lidocaine) is applied 30 minutes before the procedure.

A marking pen may be useful to identify key nasal landmarks, including the midline, nasion, rhinion, and tip-defining points. The clinician may also find it helpful to outline any contour irregularities (e.g., concavities) or other areas needing attention.
