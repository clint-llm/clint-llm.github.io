A thorough history and physical should be performed prior to surgical planning of penile prosthesis placement. While a full discussion of the clinical evaluation of erectile dysfunction is beyond the scope of this article, several considerations should be made prior to proceeding with implantation. It is vital to obtain some baseline understanding of the patient’s symptoms. Specific questionnaires, such as the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), can be used to determine the patient’s degree of erectile function.

It is equally important to obtain a detailed assessment of the patient’s prior surgical history. Any major pelvic surgery, including radical prostatectomy, radical cystectomy, colorectal surgery, and renal transplantation, should be noted, as incision site and reservoir placement may need to be adjusted. If the patient has a history of ischemic priapism or advanced Peyronie disease, it is useful to obtain a timeline of these conditions. Further, ED can act as a harbinger for many other conditions, including advanced cardiovascular disease.

Finally, careful examination of the genitalia is warranted. The stretched length and girth of the penis should be evaluated. Any curvature or palpable plaques should be carefully documented. This may also be an appropriate time to discuss the goals of implant surgery. The surgeon should clearly discuss that the stretched penile length will be a realistic goal for erectile length after the implant is placed.

It should be noted that this procedure will not lengthen the penis, and a small but not insignificant penile shortening may occur. Once a thorough history and physical exam are performed, patient counseling on the risks and benefits of the procedure is warranted. The surgeon should stress that this procedure is intended to be a permanent treatment for ED. Additionally, the risk of implant infection, erosion, and the possibility for revision in the future should be discussed. Injury to the bladder and urethra are unlikely, but additional possible complications of the procedure. As with all implant surgery, infection control remains paramount. Therefore, certain modifiable factors should be addressed prior to surgery. First, patients with diabetes should be counseled on the importance of blood glucose control, as hemoglobin A1C greater than 8.5% has been shown to increase postoperative surgical site infections with regard to PP.
