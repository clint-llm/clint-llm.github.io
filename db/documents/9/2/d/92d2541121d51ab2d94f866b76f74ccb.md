First described by the German pediatrician Johann Otto Leonhard Heubner (1872), H.F. Aitken (an artist at the Massachusetts General Hospital) later labeled it as ‘Heubner’s artery’ (1909). Joseph Shellshear, an anatomist at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in London, later termed the more appropriate and the current term ‘recurrent artery of Heubner’ for the same, pertaining to its characteristic course along the A1 portion of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) subsequent to its origin (1920).
