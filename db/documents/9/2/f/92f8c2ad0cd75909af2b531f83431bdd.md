# Introduction

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a chemical created by trophoblast tissue, tissue typically found in early embryos and which will eventually be part of the placenta. Measuring hCG levels can be helpful in identifying a normal pregnancy, pathologic pregnancy, and can also be useful following an aborted pregnancy. There is also a benefit in measuring hCG in a variety of cancers including choriocarcinoma and extra-uterine malignancies.

# Etiology and Epidemiology

Human chorionic gonadotropin is a hormone produced primarily by syncytiotrophoblastic cells of the placenta during pregnancy. The hormone stimulates the corpus luteum to produce progesterone to maintain the pregnancy. Smaller amounts of hCG are also produced in the pituitary gland, the liver, and the colon.

The hormone itself is a glycoprotein composed of two subunits, the alpha and beta subunits.

# Specimen Requirements and Procedure

**Urine Testing**

- Urine should not be collected after the patient has been drinking a large amount of fluid, as a dilute specimen may result in a falsely negative test.

- Blood in the urine may cause a false positive test result.

**Serum Testing**

- Peripheral blood can be obtained for a serum hCG test.

# Diagnostic Tests

Serum tests for hCG are immunometric assays. This means that they use 2two antibodies that bind to the hCG molecule, a fixed antibody and a radiolabeled antibody which adhere to different sites on the molecule, sandwiching and immobilize the molecule to make it detectable.

Urine assays are similar, although many detect total hCG levels greater than 20 mIU/mL.

Serum testing is much more sensitive and specific than urine testing. Urine testing, however, is more convenient, affordable, comfortable for patients, has a fast turnaround (5 to 10 minutes), and does not require a medical prescription.

# Testing Procedures

**Urine Testing**

- Urine is placed in or on a designated receptacle (most commercially available and medical point of care tests)

- An indicator (typically a colored line or symbol), along with a control, will appear if the test is positive

- An isolated control line/symbol will be evident if the test is negative

**Serum Testing**

- Serum hCG testing is performed in a laboratory equipped with the proper machinery and uses a peripheral blood sample

- If a hook effect/gestational trophoblastic disease is suspected, the lab should perform a dilution prior to testing

# Interfering Factors

There are multiple reasons why an hCG test (serum or urine) may have a false report. While uncommon, false positive hCG tests can result in unnecessary medical care and/or irreversible surgical procedures. False negatives may be equally concerning and result in a delay in care or diagnostic evaluation. Potential causes of false results are listed and briefly discussed.

**Serum False Positives (1/1000 to 1/10,000)**

- Ectopic production of hCG (hydatidiform mole, choriocarcinoma, and germ cell tumors,

- Heterophile antibodies (autoantibodies and antibodies formed after exposure to animal products that interact with the assay antibodies)

- Rheumatoid factors (can bind the antibodies in the assay as well)

- IgA deficiency

- Chronic renal failure or ESRD on hemodialysis (rare)

- Red blood cell or plasma transfusion of blood with hCG in it have been reported

- Exogenous hCG preparations for weight loss, assisted reproduction, doping

**Serum False Negatives**

- Early measurement after conception

- "Hook effect" can occur when hCG levels are about 500,000 mIU/mL.

**Urine False Positives**

- Blood or protein in the urine

- Human error in result interpretation

- Ectopic production of hCG

- Exogenous hCG

- Drugs (aspirin, carbamazepine, methadone, high urinary pH and seminal fluid)

**Urine False Negatives**

- Early measurement after conception

- Dilute urine specimen

- "Hook effect" as discussed above

# Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings

HCG levels are reported in milli-international units of hCG hormone per milliliter of blood, or mIU/mL. International unit per liter (IU/L) may also be used.

Urine hCG testing is qualitative, reporting a positive or negative result. The assays detect hCG levels typically starting at 20 to 50 (reportedly as low as 6.3 to 12.5)

Serum assays can measure beta-hCG as low as 1 to 2 mIU/mL.

# Clinical Significance

**Pregnancy**

HCG is an important hormone in pregnancy, and its clinical utility is primarily centered around its detection in early pregnancy, along with serial measurement during pregnancy and pregnancy-related complications.

Levels of hCG can vary widely between women with normal pregnancies. Typically, serum and urine concentrations of hCG rise exponentially in the first trimester of pregnancy, doubling about every 24 hours during the first 8 weeks. The peak is usually around 10 weeks of gestation and then levels decrease until about the 16th week of gestation where they remain fairly constant until term.

Patients who have hCG levels that plateau prior to 8 weeks or that fail to double commonly have a nonviable pregnancy, whether intra-uterine or extra-uterine. Extra-uterine (ectopic) pregnancies usually have a rate-of-rise that is low without the typical doubling. However, given the large range of normal hCG levels and inconsistent rates-of-rise of this hormone, checking serum levels is typically paired with ultrasound evaluation to improve sensitivity and specificity.

Return of hCG to zero following delivery or termination of pregnancy ranges from 7 to 60 days.

It notable that there are many different combinations of antibodies used in commercial assays. This results in heterogeneous results with as much as a 50-fold difference in immunoassay results.

**Gestational Trophoblastic Disease**

Detection of hCG is also useful in the evaluation of trophoblastic disease, including complete and partial hydatidiform mole, postmolar tumor, gestational choriocarcinoma, testicular choriocarcinoma, and placental site trophoblastic disease. All of these entities produce hCG, varying levels of which are reported on commercial assays. A total hCG level of greater than 100,000 mIU/mL in early pregnancy, for example, is highly suggestive of a complete hydatidiform mole,

**Non-Pregnant Patients**

HCG in the serum increases with age in nonpregnant women. A cut off of 14 mIU/mL has been suggested for use in interpreting results in women over the age of 55. In all nonpregnant patients, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, or other malignancy should be evaluated as a source of persistently positive hCG testing.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Knowing the utility and variability of different hCG assays is clinically relevant to a wide range of medical providers. False positive and false negative testing has a large impact on patient care. All providers in a patient care team should be aware of common limitations in testing, for example, urine assay false positives with hematuria, false negatives with dilute urine, along with more obscure but still very relevant causes of inaccurate testing. Interpreting results that may be false should be undergone with care to help prevent unnecessary testing and treatment.
