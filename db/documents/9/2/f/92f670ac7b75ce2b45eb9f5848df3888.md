Oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios are both common conditions that can have serious implications during pregnancy. Healthcare providers performing prenatal care should be aware of conditions that warrant enhanced screening for these conditions and abnormal findings. Providers skilled at performing and interpreting detailed anatomic ultrasounds should be involved in the care team due to the high rate of associated fetal anomalies. These providers often include pediatric radiologists and maternal-fetal medicine physicians.

The interprofessional healthcare team should include the newborn provider, designated personnel capable of providing resuscitation during the delivery; this can include specialty-trained NICU nursing staff, as well as the clinicians. In severe cases, delivery should occur at a tertiary care facility due to the high NICU admissions rate and increased rate of anomalies identified postnatally. WIth an interprofessional team approach to fetal evaluation and delivery, the best outcomes are possible for both newborns and mothers.
