The anterior and middle cerebral arteries provide the postcentral gyrus blood supply. The anterior cerebral artery is responsible for perfusing the medial third of the postcentral gyrus, while the middle cerebral artery perfuses the lateral two-thirds of the postcentral gyrus. Venous blood drains through the superior sagittal sinus for the superior two-thirds of the postcentral gyrus and the superficial Sylvian veins to the transverse sinus for the inferior third of the postcentral gyrus.
