The differential diagnosis for erosive lichen planus may vary based on the affected location.

- Crohn disease may present with erosions of the oral cavity, vulva or perineum, or anus, and may present years before any bowel findings.

- Autoimmune bullous diseases may present clinically identical to erosive LP and can be differentiated by immunofluorescence studies.

- Behcet syndrome, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome all may present in ways clinically similar to erosive LP.

- When affecting the female genitalia, erosive LP may be confused with lichen sclerosus. However, unlike erosive LP, lichen sclerosus rarely affects the vagina or oral mucosa.

- Other disorders of the genitalia that should be considered include plasma cell vulvitis, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasm, and atrophic vaginitis.

- When occurring in the oral cavity, the differential for erosive LP should consist of oropharyngeal candidiasis, leukoplakia, squamous cell carcinoma, leukoedema, and allergic contact mucositis.
