Screening for hot flashes should take place in all perimenopausal women. Hot flashes should also receive treatment if they impair a woman's quality of life, particularly daytime activities and sleep. At the same time, many women have hot flashes and do not need treatment. In the most severe cases, a woman can awake several times during the night, which, in theÂ long term, can cause cognitive and anxiety disorders.
