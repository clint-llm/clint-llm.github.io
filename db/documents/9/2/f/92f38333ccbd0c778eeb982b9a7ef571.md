There are many ongoing attempts to predict type 1 diabetes mellitus; all of them are still in the research phases.

The level of evidence regarding the usefulness of screening for type 2 diabetes for long-term complications (especially macrovascular complications) has been a matter of debate. There are conflicting studies that show no mortality benefit of screening for diabetes compared to those who receive a diagnosis on a clinical basis. Newer studies dispute this claim as more data for greater than ten years becomes available in the future.

The recommendations are, at present, based upon the different sets of risk factors to determine those who are considered moderate or high risk. Each such recommendation defines high-risk patients differently. As more data emerges, there may be more congruency in those definitions. Among the different methods to determine the level of risk in developing diabetes, one of the most popular is FINDRISC.
