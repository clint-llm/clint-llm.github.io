Hematoxylin and eosin staining does not reveal any defects in the skin.  Melanin staining and melanocyte-special stains (dopa oxidase or HMB45) will be slight to moderately positive since pheomelanin and melanocytes are still present in the skin. Tissues pathology is rarely done outside of evaluation for dermal malignancies, as it is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
