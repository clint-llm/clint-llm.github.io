Often, the patients are asymptomatic but may present with symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, cramping (secondary to potassium wasting), headaches, and palpitations. They can also have polydipsia and polyuria from hypokalemia-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

Many patients are discovered to have Conn syndrome as a result of persisting hypokalemia and hypertension. Others may present with serious arrhythmias after being started on diuretics for hypertension. Finally, there are some patients who present with hypertension that is refractory to treatment.

Physical findings:

- Hypertension

- Abdominal distension

- Ileus associated with hypokalemia

- Hypertension associated bruits, altered mental status, retinopathy

It is important to note that Conn syndrome is not associated with edema because of spontaneous natriuresis.
