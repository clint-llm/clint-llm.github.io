During puberty, under the influence of androgens, sebum secretion is increased as 5-alpha reductase converts testosterone to more potent DHT, which binds to specific receptors in the sebaceous glands increasing sebum production. This leads to an increased hyperproliferation of follicular epidermis, so there is retention of sebum. Distended follicles rupture and release pro-inflammatory chemicals into the dermis, stimulating inflammation. C. acnes, Staphylococcus epidermis, and Malassezia furfur induce inflammation and induce follicular epidermal proliferation.

Factors aggravating acne include:

- Food with a high glycemic number like dairy products (which also contain hormones), junk food, and chocolates which cause insulin-like growth factors that stimulate follicular epidermal hyperproliferation

- Oil-based cosmetics and facial massage

- A premenstrual flare-up in acne seems to follow edema of the pilosebaceous duct. This occurs in 70% of female patients.

- Severe anxiety and anger may aggravate acne, probably by stimulating stress hormones.
