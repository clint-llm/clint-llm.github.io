Essential thrombocytosis is not curable; however, patients should be aware that to prevent complications from the disease, they have to be compliant with recommended medications. It is also vital for patients to follow up with their health care providers for close monitoring of their platelets values. Some patients with extreme thrombocytosis could also be required to get hydroxyurea because of the high risk of thrombosis so patients should follow up their platelet levels.
