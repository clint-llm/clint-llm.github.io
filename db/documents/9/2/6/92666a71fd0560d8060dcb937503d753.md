To mitigate the psychosocial effects of isolation, it is necessary for patients to understand the importance of contact isolation. Educating and emotionally preparing the patient for such a need will reduce anxiety, distress, and help them cope better.

One way to prevent delirium in patients in the ICU is to engage family members in their care. Open communication should be established between family members and healthcare professionals. Family members are encouraged to bring personal items (i.e. pillows, frames, eyeglasses, hearing aids) belonging to patients. This would ease communication and orientation, therefore assisting in cognitive stimulation.
