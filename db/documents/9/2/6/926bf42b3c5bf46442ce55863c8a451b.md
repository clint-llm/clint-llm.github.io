The bullous deformity of the digits is due to excessive deposition of collagen fibers and interstitial edema. Histologically, in addition to these changes, there is an increased number of arteriovenous anastomoses, small vessel dilation, vascular hyperplasia, and vessel wall thickening with perivascular lymphocytic infiltration.

The presence of Weibel-Palade bodies, perivascular infiltrate, endothelial activation, and thickened, reduplicated capillary basal membranes confirm structural damage to the vessels on electron microscopy.
