In 1956, Epstein and Kligman described that "milia are probably the commonest benign tumors of the skin." Histopathologic studies support the notion that milia are not retention cysts, but instead, they represent a simple keratinizing type of benign tumor. Histologically, primary congenital milia look like small cysts of the vellus hair follicles emerging at the level of the sebaceous duct and contain walls of several layers of thick stratified squamous epithelium with a granular cell layer and in the center contain keratinous material. On the other hand, secondary milia lesions present with the same histological characteristics as primary milia lesions. They may also derive from any epithelial structure, including parts of the pilosebaceous apparatus and eccrine glands, such as the epidermis, hair follicle, sebaceous duct, or sweat duct.
