To detect vitamin E toxicity, serum levels of circulating alpha-tocopherol can be obtained.  The average range of plasma alpha-tocopherol in a patient that eats a well-balanced diet is 20 micromoles/liter.****The levels of circulating alpha-tocopherol are very dependent on the lipid content of the blood. In patients with extremely high or extremely low cholesterol levels, the levels of circulating alpha-tocopherol are not an accurate measure of vitamin E. In a patient with average cholesterol levels, the levels of circulating alpha-tocopherol are still not an accurate measure of vitamin E. This is due to the upregulation of biliary and urinary excretion once vitamin E levels are increased in the body.****Because of these irregularities in vitamin E metabolism, there is no set cut-off level of circulating alpha-tocopherols considered universally toxic.

In a study performed on patients with intracranial hemorrhages and taking vitamin E supplementation, alpha-tocopherol levels ranged from 23.3 micromoles/L to 46.7 micromoles/L in patients that were discovered to have intracranial hemorrhages.
