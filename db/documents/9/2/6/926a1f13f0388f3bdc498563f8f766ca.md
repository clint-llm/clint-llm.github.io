Biologists have studied Microsporidia for more than 150 years. Microsporidia include 187 genera with approximately 1500 species. Microsporidia are ubiquitous in the environment; they have evolved in a unique and sophisticated manner so that they not only survive in the surrounding environment but are also able to live inside other cells.

Classification of Microsporidia is based on microscopic morphology and ultrastructural spores characteristics. The host range in many cases is incongruent with the phylogenetic relationship that is further revealed by molecular methods through rRNA genetic sequencing which is currently used as the principle way of defining taxonomy.
