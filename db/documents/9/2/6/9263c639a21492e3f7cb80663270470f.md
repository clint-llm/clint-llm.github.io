An understanding of the anatomy of the median nerve is required to properly identify median nerve palsiesÂ and differentiate them from radial or ulnar nerve palsies. Each of these nerves has specific sensory and motor innervation patterns that distinguish themselves on careful physical examination.

Cervical radiculopathies may fool diagnosticians, as the median nerve receives innervation from C5-T1. An understanding of nerve root anatomy can help to better distinguish a nerve root palsy from a more peripheral injury to the median nerve.

Parsonage-Turner syndrome or neuralgic amyotrophy is defined as transient neuritis of the brachial plexus. It is characterized by abrupt unilateral shoulder pain, followed by progressive weakness, reflex changes, and sensory abnormalities classically following a viral illness. The etiology is thought to be an autoimmune response to viral antigen. While a specific inciting event may be difficult to ascertain, a proper history should include a history of recent illness.
