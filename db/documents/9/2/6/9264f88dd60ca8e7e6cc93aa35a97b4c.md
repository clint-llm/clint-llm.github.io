Ideally, double clamping of a 10 cm to 20 cm umbilical segment should occur as early as possible after delivery. Blood drawn into a pre-heparinized syringe from this isolated segment should be immediately placed in ice and transported to the laboratory for analysis.

Studies have shown, pH, pO2, and pCO2 measured from clamped portions of the umbilical cord remain reliable for up to 60 minutes after birth.

Lactate levels obtained from samples after 20 minutes of birth are also unreliable, regardless of collecting the sample from a clamped or unclamped cord.

Therefore, it is imperative to note the timing of blood sampling and the source of the sample: a clamped or unclamped segment.
