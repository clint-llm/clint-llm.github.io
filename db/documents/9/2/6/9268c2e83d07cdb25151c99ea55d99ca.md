ADPKD is an autosomal dominant disease, so it is found in males and females equally, and each offspring has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease.

ADPKD involves at least two genes. PKD1 accounts for most ADPKD cases and is located on 16p13.3. PKD2 accounts for 15% of ADPKD cases.

PKD1 codes for polycystin 1, a 4304 amino acid protein. Polycystin 1 interacts with polycystin 2 and is involved in cell cycle regulation and intracellular calcium transport. PKD2 codes for polycystin two, which is structurally similar to polycystin 1. It is a member of the family of voltage-activated calcium channels.

Polycystin 1 and two are located in the epithelial cells of the renal tubules and other areas of the renal cell epithelium. Both form heteromeric complexes and are found in the primary cilium of epithelial cells in kidneys. The primary cilium is considered a mechanical receptor that can sense changes in tubular fluid flow, and that can transduce them into an intracellular calcium signaling. ADPKD1 is more severe than ADPKD2.
