Infections are usually self-limited. Most syndromes result in complete recovery, with a few exceptions. While aseptic meningitis due to Enterovirus has an excellent prognosis, some patients may experience malaise and fatigue for a couple of weeks. Infants and children who suffer from aseptic meningitis may have mild intellectual complications. Myocardial syndromes can sometimes lead to poor outcomes.
