Asthma is a common pathology, affecting around 15% to 20% of people in developed countries and around 2% to 4% in less developed countries. It is significantly more common in children. Up to 40% of children will have a wheeze at some point, which, if reversible by beta-2Â agonists, is termed asthma, regardless of lung function tests. Asthma is associated with exposure to tobacco smoke and inhaled particulates and is thus more common in groups with these environmental exposures.

In childhood, asthma is more common in boys with a male to female ratio of 2:1 until puberty when the ratio becomes 1:1. After puberty, the prevalence of asthma is greater in females, and adult-onset cases after the age of 40 years are mostly females. Asthma prevalence is greater in extreme of ages due to airway responsiveness and lower levels of lung function.

Of all the asthma cases, about 66% are diagnosed before the age of 18 years. almost 50% of children with asthma have a decrease in severity or disappearance of symptoms during early adulthood.
