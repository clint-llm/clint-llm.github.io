For an acute thrombotic coronary event to cause ST-segment elevation on a surface ECG, there needs to be a complete and persistent occlusion of blood flow. Coronary athersclerosis and presence of high risk thin cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) can result in sudden onset plaque rupture

Coronary artery occlusion in animal models shows a "wave-front" of myocardial injury that spreads from the sub-endocardial myocardium to the sub-epicardial myocardium resulting in a transmural infarction that appears as an ST elevation on surface ECG.
