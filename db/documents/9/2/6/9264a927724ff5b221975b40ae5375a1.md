The prognosis of exacerbations of primary headache disorders and PDPH is excellentÂ as neither of these diseases is life-threatening. However, both conditions can lead to a delayed return to function, economic hardship, and additional emotional turmoil during an already stressful life change. Physicians should consider these non-mortality-centered issues when counseling patients, giving discharge instructions and arranging for follow-up care. The prognosis for other causes of secondary headaches depends on the primary disease. Patients with postpartum courses complicated by preeclampsia have a mortality rate of 6.4 per 10,000 cases.
