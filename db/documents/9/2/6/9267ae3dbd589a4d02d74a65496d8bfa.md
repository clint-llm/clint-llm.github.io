Peripheral vascular bypass (PVB) is the surgical revision of blood flow to restore perfusion distal to an occluded or otherwise disrupted arterial segment. PVB procedures can involve any arteries, excluding those in the heart or the brain. Vascular surgeons typically do these open surgical procedures.

Most patients with PAD are asymptomatic, and their risk for limb loss is negligible. Therefore intervention is not indicated in asymptomatic patients. However, symptomatic patients might present with claudication and rest pain. A significant subset of patients with symptomatic PAD present with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI).
