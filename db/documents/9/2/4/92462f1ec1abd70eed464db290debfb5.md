Tc-99m sulfur colloid or Tc-99m heat-damaged red blood cells are radiotracers used to identify splenic tissue. In both cases, the radiotracer is injected intravenously and taken up by the spleen, after which a gamma camera is used to acquire images. A major indication for the study is detecting splenic tissue in the setting of splenosis, which is heterotopic implantation of splenic tissue occurring in cases of splenic trauma or splenectomy. Other indications include differentiating a mass closely related to the hemidiaphragm, as a diagnostic adjunct in spleno-gonadal fusion, asplenia, and polysplenia syndromes, and identifying a wandering spleen.
