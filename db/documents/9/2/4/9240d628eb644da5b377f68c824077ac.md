Once malignancy and other differential diagnoses are ruled out, the mainstay of treatment in patients with Meigs Syndrome could be placed in two categories.

**Symptomatic treatment:**Patients with large pleural effusions need recurrent thoracentesis to manage dyspnea. Likewise, paracentesis will help them with abdominal discomfort and troubled breathing.

**Curative treatment:**Abdominal surgery (laparotomy or laparoscopy) with removing the tumorÂ to perform a frozen section is the initial evaluation. If the tumor is benign, especially in young patients who want to preserve their fertility, a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is performed. In postmenopausal women, a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is performed.
