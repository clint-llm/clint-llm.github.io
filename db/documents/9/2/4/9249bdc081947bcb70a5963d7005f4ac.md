A spinal cord injury is a potentially crippling injury which often results in severe and permanent disability. Quite often when we encounter multi-system trauma in a patient, the presence of spinal injury should be highly suspected. Moreover, up to 5% of patients with a head injury may also have an associated spinal injury, making it an injury with a need for time-sensitive intervention. Spinal cord injury involves various levels of the spine. The rates of incidence are cervical (55%), thoracic (15%), the thoracolumbar junction (15%), and lumbosacral region (15%).
