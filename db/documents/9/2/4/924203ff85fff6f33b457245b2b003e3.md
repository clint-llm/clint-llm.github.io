Congenital junctional ectopic tachycardia usually occurs in infants less than six months old, but diagnosis can be delayed after six months as well. Patients typically have heart rates of 200 to 250 beats per minute. Patients can develop fetal tachycardia prenatally and present as congestive heart failure or hydrops in the fetus.

Infants can present with dyspnea with dilated cardiomyopathy at presentation, ventricular fibrillation, and also complete heart block leading to sudden cardiac death.

The clinical characteristics are gradual onset with the warm-up phase and cooling down phase with rate variability.Â Postoperative JET usually presents within 72 hours after surgery. On physical examination, the patient is noted to have tachycardia with signs of congestive heart failure. Cannon waves may be seen in jugular venous pulse if ventriculoatrial dissociation has occurred.
