The dorsal column, also known as the dorsal column medial lemniscus (DCML) pathway,Â deals with the conscious appreciation of fine touch, two-point discrimination, conscious proprioception, and vibration sensations from the entire body except for the head. In the spinal cord, this pathway travels in the dorsal column, and in the brainstem, it is transmitted through the medial lemniscus; hence the name dorsal column medial lemniscus pathway. Phylogenetically, this is a relatively new pathway and serves to recognize and communicate highly localizable and discriminative sensations.
