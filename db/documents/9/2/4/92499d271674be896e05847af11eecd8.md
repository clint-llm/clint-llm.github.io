Diagnosing drug-induced esophagitis may be challenging because patients tend to underreport the symptoms if they are mild. Clinicians also may not consider it as a cause if missed medication history. Failure in early diagnosis can lead to unnecessary work-up and investigations for these symptoms. A lack of awareness about drug-induced esophagitis can cause persistent injury from the causative drug and eventually lead to complications.
