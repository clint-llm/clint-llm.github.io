The Pap smear is responsible for decreasing the incidence of and mortality rates from cervical cancer. The Papanicolaou (Pap) smear is a collection of cells from the squamocolumnar junction of the cervix where the columnar epithelium is juxtaposed to the smooth squamous epithelium. In this area, squamous metaplasia is causing squamous cells to replace columnar cells. This cell growth and change can allow the entrance of human papillomavirus (HPV), the cause of more than 90% of cervical cancer. The Pap smear is a sample of cells from this area to screen a patient for abnormalities such as cervical dysplasia. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of cervical dysplasia and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of cervical dysplasia, starting with its precursors and progressing through to its most serious sequelae.
- Describe the history, examination, and evaluation procedures for patients with suspected cervical dysplasia.
- Summarize the appropriate treatment approach to cervical dysplasia based on degree.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes with cervical dysplasia.
