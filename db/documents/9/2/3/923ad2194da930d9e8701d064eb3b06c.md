Leo SternbachÂ was an Austrian scientist working for Hoffmann-La Roche in Nutley, NJ, and has been accredited for his work in developing many drugs, in particular, benzodiazepines. In 1956, he serendipitously created chlordiazepoxide, which was approved for medical use in 1960. He later developed an improved, safer version named diazepam in 1963. Diazepam became widely popular, and between 1969 and 1982, it was the most prescribed drug in the United States, with over 2.3 billion doses sold in its peak year in 1978.
