The precursor to the brain and spinal cord, the neural tube, begins closing to form its cylindrical shape around embryonic day 21. The tube then begins to bend and expand to further specialized structures, in response to chemical signals from nearby tissues that influence their developmental fate. Those signals cause the neural tube to develop into three primary vesicles: the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon. By day 24, the neural tube further develops into secondary vesicles. The prosencephalon divides into telencephalon and diencephalon, the rhombencephalon develops into metencephalon and myelencephalon, and the mesencephalon does not further divide. The mesencephalon, also known as the midbrain, is the embryonic structure from which the tectum forms.

Multiple molecular signals are essential in the process of IC formation, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 8 and FGF17. The absence of either of the growth factors mentioned earlier results in abnormal formation of the midbrain and cerebellum in mice.Pax2 and Pax5 proteins in the development of the midbrain in mice. Knockout of Pax2 in Zebrafish disrupts the organization of the midbrain, while knockout of Pax5 protein results in underdeveloped or absent IC.Neurod1, which is a protein essential for the tonotopic structure of the auditory system throughout the pathwayâ€” in the ear, cochlear nuclei, and IC.
