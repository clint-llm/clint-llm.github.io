**Congenital tricuspid atresia**- Can be differentiated from Ebstein anomaly by the absence of apical displacement of the septal and/or posterior leaflets, no annular dilation, presence of thickened leaflets with rolled edges as well as foreshortened and fused chordae, and no "atrialization" of the RV.

**Uhl's anomaly**- Patients with this anomaly have congenital absence of RV myocardium that leads to RV failure. It is frequently associated with pulmonary atresia, RV aneurysm, and thrombi. There is no apical displacement of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. The major similarity is the RV and right atrial dilation, making it hard to distinguish from Ebstein anomaly.

**Aberrant tendinous tricuspid valve chords with tethering of the leaflets**- Aberrant tendinous tricuspid chords produce impaired leaflet mobility, which results in incomplete coaptation of the tricuspid valve leaflets with severe regurgitation. This is a very rare congenital heart defect.

Other cyanotic congenital heart conditions whose presentation can mimic Ebstein anomaly include transposition of the great arteries, tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and total anomalous pulmonary venous return. Echocardiography allows correct diagnosis.
