Incomplete and delayed facial paralysis are contraindications to facial nerve repair. The nerve is intact in both situations and should be allowed to recover spontaneously. Additionally, if the facial nerve injury occurs medial to the lateral canthus, not only would repair be technically difficult, the redundancy of innervation close to the target muscles is usually sufficient that spontaneous functional recovery is highly likely.

The absence of electrical activity, specifically the lack of insertion or fibrillation potentials, on preoperative EMG of the target muscles indicates atrophy of the neuromuscular junction with possible fibrosis of the muscles and an inability to accept reinnervation.

Patients with advanced-stage malignancies or other chronic diseases likely to shorten life expectancy may not live long enough to justify the surgical risk of facial reinnervation. In cases of malignancy, facial reinnervation should be delayed until tumor resection is completed. Additionally, patients in a persistent vegetative state or those with severe dementia will be unable to participate in facial retraining, reducing the benefits of facial reinnervation procedures.

Preexisting dysphagia, while not a contraindication to facial reinnervation in general, is a contraindication for hypoglossal nerve transfer; the procedure may exacerbate the problem, particularly in older patients.
