Intermittent claudication occurs due to atherosclerosis-mediated narrowing of lower extremity vessels. Oxidative injury to the inner layer of endothelial cells is the nidus of atherogenesis. The subsequent dysfunction of endothelial cells promotes localized deposition of oxidized-LDL and synthesis of pro-inflammatory factors. This creates a fibro-inflammatory plaque that propagates as macrophages are recruited and become resident foam cells as they phagocytize the oxidized-LDL. The foam cells form a classic histologic feature called a “fatty-streak.” As the plaque enlarges and matures, surrounding vascular smooth muscles migrate into it, and collagen deposition forms a fibrous cap. The most common location of plaque formation in peripheral arterial disease is in the superficial femoral artery, which may lead to IC symptoms in the calf. Other locations include the aortoiliac bifurcation, producing hip and buttock pain, and the common femoral artery, which can cause thigh or calf claudication.

The resting blood flow in these individuals is similar to healthy adults, but during exercise or physical activity, the blood cannot flow through the areas of obstruction. At the same time, these individuals take a long time to recover from physical activity compared to healthy adults.
