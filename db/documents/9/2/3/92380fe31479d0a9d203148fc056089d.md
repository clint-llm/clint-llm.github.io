Biopsy specimens are a rarely available for Takayasu arteritis but are most common in the unusual case of a potential biopsy of an excised segment, or from an autopsy. Inflammation targets areas around the vasa vasora and at the medio-adventitial junction. Mononuclear cell infiltration is common, and giant cell granulomatous reaction may be present. Reactive fibrosis and increased ground substance in the intima may also be present. In the aorta specifically, the arterial walls will feel extraordinarily stiff and rigid if palpated, with often strikingly high degrees of adventitial and periadventitial fibrosis.
