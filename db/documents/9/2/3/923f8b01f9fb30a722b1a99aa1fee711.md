Cardiac rhabdomyomas are asymptomatic and regress spontaneously. In rare instances of hemodynamic compromise and congestive heart failure, pharmacotherapy with angiotensin-converting (ACE) enzyme inhibitors, digitalis, and diuretics is indicated. Prostaglandin E can be used to manage hemodynamic instability in a critically ill newborn. Anti-arrhythmics are useful when there are conduction defects or any other ventricular arrhythmia.

Partial or complete surgical resection of the mass is indicated in cases of hemodynamic compromise and congestive heart failure due to a large tumor.
