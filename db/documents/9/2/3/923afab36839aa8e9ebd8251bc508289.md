The main complication of a polyp is associated with infertility when they grow big enough to block the external os of the cervix.

Moreover, the polyps can become inflamed or infected. In this case, the patient will present with yellowish vaginal discharge.

However, a polypectomy itself can be associated with a few complications, which include:

- Infection

- Hemorrhage

- Uterine perforation - to reduce this risk, only polyps that are visible easily should be removed in the outpatient setting. Clinicians should not blindly attempt to remove polyps from the cervical canal or intrauterine position.
