The lymph node architecture is effaced by small mature lymphocytes with condensed nuclear chromatin. Pseudofollicles have a pale nodular appearance due to the proliferation of large lymphocytes having open nuclear chromatin and more abundant cytoplasm.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a low-grade B-cell malignancy and is often characterized by a low proliferation index except for pseudofollicles, which may show increased Ki-67 expression. The expression of CD20, CD5, and CD23 by the neoplastic cells either by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry is diagnostic of CLL. Additional findings include smudge cells found as cellular debris and commonly associated with the disease.
