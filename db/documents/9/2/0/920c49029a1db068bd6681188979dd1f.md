Miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks gestation.

Before 12 weeks, gestation most pregnancy loss is due to chromosomal abnormalities.

Maternal health such as high blood pressure, obesity, and cigarette smoking may increase the risk of miscarriage.

Advanced maternal age has been proven to increase the risk of miscarriage with risks as high as 74% for women over age 40.

It is important to evaluate using transvaginal ultrasound to determine whether or not a pregnancy is viable.

For women with no co-morbid conditions, all 3 treatment options (medical, surgical, or expectant management) have been proven equally safe and effective.
