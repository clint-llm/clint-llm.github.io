Patients will typically present with variable wrist deformity and displacement of the hand relative to the wrist. The wrist usually swells, with ecchymosis, tenderness, and painful range of motion. The mechanism of injury should be investigated to assist in assessing the energy and level of destruction. It is essential to establish the patientâ€™s functional status before the injury as well as occupational demands as these may aid in determining treatment direction. Document co-existing medical conditions that may affect healing such as osteoporosis, diabetes, and/or tobacco use.

The physical examination should include careful attention to the following:

- Condition of the surrounding skin and soft tissue

- Quality of vascular perfusion and pulses

- The integrity of nerve function

- Sensory 2-point discrimination

- Motor function of intrinsic, thenar, and hypothenar muscles of the hand

- Careful attention to median nerve function as acute carpal tunnel syndrome can occur up to 20% of the time

- The integrity of the median nerve requires assessment and documentation

Associated injuries include:

- Ipsilateral elbow

- Ipsilateral shoulder

- Distal radial ulnar joint

- Radial styloid fracture

- Triangular fibrocartilage complex

- Scapholunate ligament

- Lunotriquetral ligament
