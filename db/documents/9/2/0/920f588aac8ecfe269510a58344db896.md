Both genetic and environmental factors have been studied in the development of testicular cancers.

**Epidemiological risk factors:**They include cryptorchidism, decreased spermatogenesis evidenced by sub- or infertility, disorders of sexual development, familial history of testicular tumors among first-degree relatives, the presence of a contralateral tumor or germ-cell neoplasia in-situ (GCNIS), etc**.**

The most common environmental risk factors for testicular cancers can be summarized as below:

- Cryptorchidism —2–4 fold increase in risk.

- Family history—relative risk increased 6–10 fold in brothers or sons of affected man

- Infections - Human papillomavirus (HPV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Parvovirus B-19, and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

- Testicular trauma

- High maternal estrogen levels

- Carcinoma in situ (intratubular germ cell neoplasia)

- Prior history of testis cancer or extragonadal germ cell tumor

**Genetic risk factors:**Multiple genetic changes have been described in the etiology of testicular cancer. The isochromosome of the short arm of chromosome 12 – (i12p) – is pathognomonic of all types of adult germ cell tumors (GCTs),****as well as GCNIS. Alterations in p53 have been observed in about 66% of cases of GCNIS.****

However, current genetic studies have not revealed any evidence for a major single high-penetrance gene known to cause increased testicular cancer susceptibility.
