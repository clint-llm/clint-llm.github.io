The location and extent of injury, the development of complications, and the functional result determine outcome and prognosis. High voltage electrical injuries have poor outcomes as compared to low voltage. Recent advances in ICU care, resuscitation, nutritional support, and surgical techniques, along with new skin substitutes, have significantly improved outcomes.
