Gilbert syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder of bilirubin metabolism within the liver. Reduced glucuronidation of bilirubin leads to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and recurrent episodes of jaundice. This activity addresses the epidemiology, triggers, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, testing, treatment, and prognosis of patients who have Gilbert syndrome. Additionally, the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in evaluating and managing patients with Gilbert syndrome will be addressed.

**Objectives:**
- Review triggers that are associated with Gilbert syndrome. 
- Describe the epidemiology of Gilbert syndrome.
- Review the pathophysiology of Gilbert syndrome. 
- Review the clinical manifestations, diagnostic testing, treatment, and prognosis of patients with Gilbert syndrome.
