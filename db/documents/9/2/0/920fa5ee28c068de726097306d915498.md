A thorough history is essential to characterize the frequency, duration, and intensity of the thumb sucking.Â Physical exam in these patients can be remarkable for blisters located in the affected thumb since vigorous sucking can induce this. Sucking pads or calluses can appear as well, being the result of hyperkeratosis. Findings on the oral exam include upper incisors with proclination and retroclination of the lower incisors due to the thumb's placement behind the upper incisors.
