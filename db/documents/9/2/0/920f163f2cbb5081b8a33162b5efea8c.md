Acute cystitis is typically caused by a bacterial infection of the urinary bladder. Women are particularly susceptible due to the close proximity of the rectum to the urethral meatus as well as the relatively short urethral length in females. Accounting for approximately 75% to 95% of cases, Escherichia coli is the most common etiologic agent in uncomplicated UTIs in women, followed by Klebsiella.Enterobacteriaceae family, such as Proteus mirabilis, and other bacteria, such as Staphylococcus saprophyticus and enterococcus. Other bacterial species very rarely cause UTIs and usually represent contamination when isolated from the urine culture of an otherwise healthy person. These include bacteria such as Group B streptococci, Lactobacillus, and other coagulase-negative staphylococci other than S. saprophyticus.

Escherichia coli is also the most common cause of complicated cystitis, but the spectrum of microbial pathogens that may cause a complicated UTI is much broader and includes organisms such as Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Serratia, Pseudomonas,
enterococci, staphylococci, and even fungi. The incidence of antimicrobial resistance in complicated infections is also significantly higher. Notable resistant organisms include the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria, as well as carbapenem-resistant and fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms, particularly E. coli.
