GLP-1 analogs are now used in the management of diabetes.

DPP-4 inhibitors inhibit the degradation of endogenous GLP-1 by DPP-4 and thus increase the half-life of the endogenous product. Examples include sitagliptin, saxagliptin, and linagliptin, among others. The efficacy of linagliptin may be adversely affected by CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein inducers such as rifampin or St. Johnâ€™s wort, thus requiring the use of alternative agents that are not pharmacodynamically affected by changes in CYP-450 drug metabolism.

GLP-2 analogs are currently emerging as a treatment for short-bowel syndrome due to their trophic effects on the small intestine.
