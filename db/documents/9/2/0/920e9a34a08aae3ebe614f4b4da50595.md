The prognosis dependsÂ on the severity of the infection. It is a potentially severe complication that may result in the death of the patient if the appropriate management is not given. Patients are at risk of multiple organ failure and sepsis, and in cases in which the infected abscess is not removed either surgically or endoscopically, the mortality rate can reach 100%.
