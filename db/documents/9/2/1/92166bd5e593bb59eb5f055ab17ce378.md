Differentiation of the genotype-phenotype relationship of spinocerebellar ataxia subtypes helps to improve the prognosis. Although it takes a long time to appreciate the full range of the signs and symptoms, it is almost irreversible once it is evident. But, the symptomatic treatment may improve the prognosis. Survival depends upon the length of CAG repeat expansion. One longitudinal cohort study concluded that the average 10-year survival rate of SCA1 is only 57%, while that of SCA6 is 87%. SCA complicated by dysphagia has the shortest survival rate.
