Mitomycin is an antibiotic that is isolated from the broth of Streptomyces caespitosus. This drug has demonstrated antitumor activity.

Once activated by a reduction cascade, a series of spontaneous transformations cause mitomycin to attack DNA twice, resulting in cross-linking of strands of DNA double helix, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Mitomycin is non-specific for a particular cell cycle phase but can exert its maximum effect in both the late G as well as the early S-phases.

It also suppresses RNA and protein synthesis at higher concentrations, hence being useful against some bacteria, spirochetes, and viruses. Lending to its toxic profile, mitomycin has a limited role as an antibiotic.

In glaucoma surgery, the antifibrotic property of mitomycin prevents tissue scarring when surgeons create a surgical ocular flap to relieve excess fluid buildup.
