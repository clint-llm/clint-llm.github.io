This activity describes and reviews the role of physicians and nursing providers in evaluating and managing patients with posterior cortical atrophy. The article highlights the difference in the presentation of posterior cortical atrophy compared to typical Alzheimer's disease. It describes the common underlying etiologies for this condition. It reviews the most common symptoms upon presentation, course of the illness, co-morbid psychiatric symptoms and describes neuropsychological and radiological findings. This activity examines the possible early interventions, including safety measures required to be implemented, developing compensation strategies, psychosocial interventions, and patient education with prompt recognition and diagnosis of this neurodegenerative disorder. This activity emphasizes the interprofessional team's approach involving neurologists, psychiatrists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, and social workers.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of posterior cortical atrophy.
- Identity the presentation (both in cognitive assessment and radiological findings) of a patient with posterior cortical atrophy.
- Review the diagnostic criteria via cognitive assessment findings and radiological imaging findings associated with posterior cortical atrophy.
- Explain the treatment strategies that will improve outcomes in patients with posterior cortical atrophy.
