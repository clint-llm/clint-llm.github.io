Identifying patient-specific risk factors helps to avoid WPV.

- Triage flagging systems are a preliminary approach to identifying patients at greater risk of committing WPV. Risk assessment tools such as Staring Tone Anxiety Mumbling Pacing (STAMP), Violence Risk Screen Decision Support in Triage (VRSDSiT), the Alert System, and Broset Violence Checklist (BVC) may be useful in quick recognition of behavioral patterns associated with risk WPV.

- Behavioral cues include anxiety, agitation, restlessness, a sense of entitlement or dissatisfaction, glaring, staring, or an angry or otherwise inappropriate tone of voice.

- Signs of criminal intent or drug-seeking behavior may be subtle but raise concern.

- Arrival via law enforcement officers.

- Male gender, age <30 or >65, or parental relationship to the patient are well-documented demographic risk factors.

- Historical predictors include mental illness, medication noncompliance, substance abuse, and documentation of previous aggressive behavior.
