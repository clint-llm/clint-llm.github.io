Subacromial bursitis is a common etiology of shoulder pain. It results from inflammation of the bursa, a sac of tissue present under the acromion process of the shoulder. It is usually brought about by repetitive overhead activities or trauma. Avoidance of such activities, rest and oral NSAIDs are effective in resolving the condition. Steroid injections and rarely surgery may be necessary in persistent cases.
