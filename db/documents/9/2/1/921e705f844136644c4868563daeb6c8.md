Asherman syndrome (intrauterine adhesions or intrauterine synechiae) occurs when scar tissue forms inside the uterus and/or the cervix. These adhesions occur after surgery of the uterus or after a dilatation and curettage with tuberculosis and schistosomiasis being a less common cause. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of Asherman syndrome and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of Asherman syndrome.
- Summarize the American Fertility Society classification of the severity of Asherman syndrome.
- Review the treatment considerations for patients with Asherman syndrome.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to routinely monitor the endometrium for evidence of endometrial cancer which will improve outcomes in those with Asherman syndrome.
