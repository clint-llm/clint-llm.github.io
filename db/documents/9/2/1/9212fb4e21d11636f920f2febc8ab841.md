Patients with blepharitis typically describe itching, burning, and crusting of the eyelids. They may experience tearing, blurred vision and foreign body sensation. In general, symptoms tend to be worse in the morning with crusting of the lashes being most prominent upon waking. The symptoms tend to affect both eyes and can be intermittent. The physical exam is best performed using a slit lamp. In anterior blepharitis, slit lamp exam reveals erythema and edema of the eyelid margin. Telangiectasia may be present on the outer portion of the eyelid. Scaling can be seen at the base of the eyelashes forming "collarettes." Also, loss of lashes (madarosis), depigmentation of lashes (poliosis), and misdirection of lashes  (trichiasis) may be seen. In posterior blepharitis, the meibomian glands are dilated, obstructed, and may be capped with oil. Secretions from these glands may appear thick, and scarring of the lid may be present in the area around the glands. In all types of blepharitis, the tear film may show signs of rapid evaporation. This is best evaluated measuring the tear break-up time. A slit lamp exam is performed, and fluorescein dye is placed in the eye. The patient is asked to blink fully then maintain an open eye for 10 seconds. The tear film is examined for breaks or dry spots under cobalt blue light. There is general agreement that a tear break-up time less than 10 seconds is considered abnormal.
