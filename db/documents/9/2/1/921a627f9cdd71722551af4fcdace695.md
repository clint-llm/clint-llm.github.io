Typical symptoms can be divided into the subtypes PDS and EPS, and there exists an overlap between the two syndromes. These symptoms can be acute or chronic. PDS patients report loss of appetite, early satiation, nausea, retching, vomiting, and bloating. In EPS, patients have stomach cramping and other upper abdominal pain. Some symptoms are non-gastrointestinal. Patients often report associated diaphoresis, headache, sleep disorders, and irritable bladder.  Functional dyspepsia symptoms usually do not progress and lack red flag signs of unintentional weight loss, dysphagia, night sweats, and persistent vomiting.
