Histopathologic examination within cicatricial alopecia areas of GLPLS shows a dilated follicular lumen superior to the sebaceous gland with a dense hyperkeratotic plug in the lower portion of the infundibulum.  Epithelium in the nearby periphery of the follicular infundibulum shows hypergranulosis, vacuolar degradation of keratinocytes, and a lymphocytic infiltrate that obscures the dermal-epidermal junction with increased dense bundles of collagen at the follicular base.  Examination of the hyperkeratotic papules on the trunk and extremities show an expanded keratin-filled follicular opening and vacuolar degradation of adjacent keratinocytes and a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate at the dermal-epidermal junction.
