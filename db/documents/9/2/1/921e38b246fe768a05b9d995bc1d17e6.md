As a synthetic steroid, danazol has many adverse effects in line with other androgens, making its adverse effects broad and systemic in nature. The most commonly reported side effects of danazol include weight gain, gastrointestinal symptoms including bloating, nausea, vomiting, gastroenteritis, elevated liver function tests, joint pain, muscle spasm, lethargy, headache, and depression.

Also, since this drug is a synthetic steroid, elevated blood pressure can occur and remains an area that merits further investigation, along with its effects on adrenal activity.

Thromboembolism, including stroke, thrombotic and thrombophlebitic events (e.g., sagittal sinus thrombosis, stroke), pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), peliosis hepatitis, benign hepatic adenoma has been reported with danazol use. Elevated concentrations of hepatic enzymes (e.g., alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT) and/or jaundice have been reported with doses of more than 400 mg daily. Danazol treatment may also cause decreased HDL and increased LDL. Danazol causes possible interference with laboratory measurement of androgens, for example, testosterone. Moreover, danazol is reported to be a CYP3A4 inhibitor; hence its concurrent use with statins has been reported to cause rhabdomyolysis.
