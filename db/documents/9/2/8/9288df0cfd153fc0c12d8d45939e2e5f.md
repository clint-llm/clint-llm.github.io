Ultrasound is a safe, radiation-free imaging test that is readily available. Being portable, it can be performed at the bedside, especially for very sick neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit or patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), who cannot be transferred to the radiology department for CT or MRI. It is usually the initial imaging test performed to evaluate the brain in neonates presenting with seizures or other symptoms of suspected intracranial pathology.

Though the sensitivity of US is less than MRI in the detection of early changes of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIE), it can make the diagnosis in severe cases of HIE and several other intracranial pathologies such as intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, periventricular leucomalacia (PVL) and others. It can also determine the need for further imaging. It is also routinely used for follow-up of known intracranial pathologies.

Radiologists, especially pediatric radiologists, should be well aware of the US's normal brain anatomy and appearance in both term and preterm infants and imaging appearances of various intracranial pathologies that can be seen in infants. In conclusion, the US is a safe, reliable, portable, and readily available imaging test that canÂ be performed at the bedside to evaluate the brain in neonates with suspected brain pathology.
