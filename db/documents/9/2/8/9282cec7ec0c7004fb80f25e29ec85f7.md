The most likely case necessitating surgical removal of an accessory spleen independent of the removal of the normal spleen is torsion of an accessory spleen. Symptoms for this condition can include flank pain and nausea. Pain from the torsion can arise from inflammation due to infarction or strangulation, venous congestions due to twisting of the vascular pedicle, or direct interference with adjacent organs. Hemorrhagic shock, peritonitis, and bowel obstruction are potential consequences of untreated torsion of an accessory spleen.
