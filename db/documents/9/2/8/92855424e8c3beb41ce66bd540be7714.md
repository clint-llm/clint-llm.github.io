Aortic arch development is a complex process that occurs between weeks two and seven of gestational life. Six pairs of arches emerge and regress in a sequential fashion leaving remnants that form important vessels. This setup forms the basis of the aortic arch variants and anomalies. The first two arches disappear early, leaving the maxillary, hyoid, and stapedial arteries. The third branch forms the common carotid arteries and a small portion of the internal carotid arteries. The fourth pair of arches give rise to the bilateral aortic arches. In week five of gestation, the right-sided arch regresses, and the left-sided arch remains, leaving a normal left-sided aortic arch.

Failure of the regression of the right-sided arch with the persistence of the left-sided arch leads to the formation of a double aortic arch. Conversely, a solitary right-sided aortic arch may remain if the left-sided arch regresses while the right-sided arch persists. Three types of double aortic arches have been described and include (in order of decreasing frequency) dominant right-arch with small left-arch, dominant left-arch with small right-arch and balanced aortic-arches. The fifth pair of arches do not contribute to significant vasculature, whereas the anterior bud of the sixth pair of arches gives rise to the pulmonary arterial trunk and ductal artery.
