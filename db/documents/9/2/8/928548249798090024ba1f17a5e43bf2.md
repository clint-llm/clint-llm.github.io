A major protein modified by heavy metal toxicity is lipoic acid, which is necessary for pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, leading to the disruption of the citric acid cycle and the accumulation of pyruvic acid.

Dimercaprol is a dithiol that acts by forming a stable five-membered ring between its sulfhydryl groups and certain heavy metals, thereby neutralizing its toxicity and promoting its elimination.

Dimercaprol is more efficacious when given soon after the metal exposure because it is better at preventing enzyme inhibition than reactivating enzyme function.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption**

Dimercaprol undergoes rapid absorption after deep intramuscular injection. Peak plasma concentration occurs within 30 to 60 minutes.

**Distribution**

Dimercaprol is highly lipophilic and readily crosses into the intracellular space. As a result, it gets distributed in all tissues, and it is most concentrated in the liver, kidneys, brain, and small intestines.

**Metabolism**

Dimercaprol that is not complexed with metal undergoes hepatic metabolism via glucuronidation and gets converted into inactive metabolites.

**Excretion**

Dimercaprol has a short half-life and is excreted as an inactive metabolite or complexed with metal. The kidneys mainly eliminate dimercaprol, but a small amount gets eliminated in bile. Dissociation of the bond between the metal and sulfhydryl group can occur in the acidic tubular urine and cause the redistribution of metal into renal tissue. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain a dimercaprol concentration in the plasma that favors the continuous formation and excretion of the stable dimercaprol-metal complex.
