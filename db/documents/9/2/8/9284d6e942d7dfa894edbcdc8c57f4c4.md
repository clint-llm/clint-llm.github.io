Clinicians should consider baclofen toxicity in patients with access to baclofen if they present with altered mental status, abnormal vital signs, or an abnormal neuromuscular exam. Baclofen toxicity can be difficult to identify as it can mimic other medical conditions such as other sedative-hypnotic drugs, opioids, or other central nervous system depressants. Other medical etiologies that could be considered include sepsis, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances.
