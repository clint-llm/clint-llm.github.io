Surgery is the mainstay of treatment.

**Ameloblastoma**

There is no consensus on the biological behavior of multicystic ameloblastoma and the best way to treat them. However, most agree that aggressive management is essential to achieve a cure. Many modalities have been described ranging from simple enucleation and curettage with a recurrence rate of around 50% to wider resection.

Most cases of unicystic ameloblastoma are misdiagnosed as a dentigerous cyst. For that reason, surgeons should always open any cystic lesions to look for any luminal proliferation. It is also advisable to get the frozen section done. This should include multiple sections throughout the whole specimen as this will help with the subclassification of uni-cystic ameloblastoma to its three different categories. If it is luminal or intra-luminal variants, enucleation with curettage would be sufficient with a recurrence rate of 10% to 20%.****wide local excision is the most acceptable treatment modality to achieve negative margins.

Owing to the well-circumscribed nature of the adenomatoid odontogenic tumor lesion and it is being encapsulated, enucleation and curettage are considered to be curative in the majority of cases.

In most cases of odontogenic ghost cell tumors (calcifying odontogenic cyst), enucleation and curettage will be the treatment of choice unless there is any malignant potential on histological evaluation.nucleation and curettage as recurrence is rare. In cases of recurrent cases, resection should be performed as 45% of ameloblastic fibrosarcoma develop in the context of recurrent ameloblastic fibroma. Odontoma can also be treated by enucleation, and curettage is the treatment of choice as not known to recur.

The main treatment of odontogenic fibroma is enucleation and curettage unless extremely large, and then local excision will be the treatment of choice.

**Malignant Odontogenic Tumors**

Resection of the lesion remains the mainstay treatment along with dealing with metastases such as neck dissection for cervical lymph node metastases. The role of chemotherapy and radiotherapy is still controversial and usually reserved for recurrent or unresectable cases.
