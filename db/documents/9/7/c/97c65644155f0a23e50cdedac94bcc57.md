The main risk factor for developing NMS is the initiation or increase in the dosage of neuroleptic medication. High-potency and long-aging neuromuscular depot forms carry the greatest risk. The concurrent use of multiple neuroleptic agents or lithium also increases the risk. Abrupt withdrawal of dopaminergic agents is a less common but important cause of NMS. Symptoms of NMS develop over one to three days and include distinctive clinical features: fever, muscle rigidity, mental status changes, and autonomic rigidity.

The DSM-V criteria for diagnosing NMS are as follows:

**Major Criteria (all required)**

- Exposure to dopamine-blocking agent

- Severe muscle rigidity

- Fever

**Other Criteria (at least two required)**

- Diaphoresis

- Dysphagia

- Tremor

- Incontinence

- Altered level of consciousness

- Mutism

- Tachycardia

- Elevated or labile blood pressure

- Leukocytosis

- Elevated creatine phosphokinase
