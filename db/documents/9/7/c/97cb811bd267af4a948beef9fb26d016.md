Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), also referred to as non-alcoholic destructive pancreatitis, and sclerosing pancreatitis, is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized histologically by chronic inflammation of the pancreas and clinically by various symptoms related to biliary and pancreatic pathologies.

AIP has been classified into two clinical subtypes

- Type 1: IgG4 related pancreatitis, associated with high serum IgG4 concentration and IgG4 bearing plasma cell infiltration of the pancreas with a background of lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis

- Type 2: Idiopathic duct centric pancreatitis, granulocytic epithelial lesions in pancreatic duct without IgG4 positive cells or systemic involvement
