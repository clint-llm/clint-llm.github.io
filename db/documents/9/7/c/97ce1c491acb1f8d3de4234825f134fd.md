The causes of portal vein thrombosis can be divided into two categories; inherited and acquired.

**Inherited**

- Factor V Leiden mutation

- Prothrombin gene mutation

- Anti-thrombin III deficiency

- Protein C deficiency

- Protein S deficiency

**Acquired**

- Lupus anticoagulant syndrome

- Liver disease

- Iatrogenic

- Disseminated intravascular coagulation

- Burns

- Sepsis

- Malignancy

- Myeloproliferative disorders

- Peripartum

- Oral contraceptives

- Inflammatory states

Rare iatrogenic causes include bariatric surgery, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or fine-needle aspiration of pancreatic cancer.

In children, the most common cause of portal vein obstruction is an intra-abdominal infection. Placement of an umbilical catheter in neonates is also a common cause of the disorder. Other causes include congenital abnormalities of the portal venous system.

In adults, the vast majority of cases are due to cirrhosis, followed by neoplasms. Tumors can compress, invade or induce a hypercoagulable state leading to portal vein thrombosis. About 10% of cases are idiopathic.
