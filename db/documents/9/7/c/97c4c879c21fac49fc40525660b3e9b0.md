The mfERG is a non-invasive test with minimal risks. Patients may experience mild ocular discomfort during the procedure or, in sporadic cases, develop a corneal abrasion depending on the type of electrode used.

**Interfering Factors**

- Deviating from standardized testing conditions (i.e., lighting, flash intensity, recording environment, duration of light or dark adaptation, and pupil size)

- Electrode-based artifacts including poor contact with skin or cornea, incorrect placement, unstable position, and high electrical impedance

- Eye blinking or movement

- Defocus or uncorrected refractive error

- Reduced electrical response with aging

- Ocular media opacification

- Diurnal fluctuation

- Depressed response under anesthesia

- Variability in recordings between different device types and normative databases between laboratories

**Common Artifact Types**

- Line frequency interference

- Movement errors

- Eccentric fixation

- Positioning errors and head tilt

- Erroneous central peak (weak signal artifact)

- Averaging and smoothing artifacts

- Blindspot
