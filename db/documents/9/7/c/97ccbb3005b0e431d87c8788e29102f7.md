A team-based approach to the management of retroperitoneal bleeding is vital to ensuring the best possible patient outcomes. Necessary hospital personals include an immediately available 24-hour emergency team trained in managing the complicated trauma patient as well as a patient in acute hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock. This acute care team contains a diverse complement of vital individuals such as ambulance personal, imaging technologists, respiratory therapists, nurses, pharmacists, and residents. Rapid access to a vascular surgeon with advanced endovascular skills as well as a trauma surgeon comfortable with complicated visceral rotations and retroperitoneal access is also vital. An excellent relationship with the local blood bank and the ability to rapidly initiate a massive transfusion protocol is necessary when bleeding is profound.

Necessary hospital resources include EMS personal, bedside ultrasound, rapid CT access, and fully equipped endovascular and operating suites.
