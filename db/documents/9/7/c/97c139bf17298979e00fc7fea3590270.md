Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), commonly known as throat cancer or tonsil cancer, refers to the cancer of the middle part of the pharynx, known as oropharynx, which extends vertically from the soft palate to the superior area of the hyoid bone and includes the base and posterior one-third of the tongue, the tonsils, soft palate, and posterior and lateral pharyngeal walls.

More than 90% of oropharyngeal cancers are squamous cell cancers, which is the cell lining of the oropharynx

Two types of oropharyngeal cancer can be distinguished, HPV-associated, due to an oral human papillomavirus infection, and non-HPV-associated, mainly dueÂ to tobacco smoking and alcohol use.

In addition to the direct invasion of the tissues, oropharyngeal cancer can spread through blood and lymphatics. The major symptoms of oropharyngeal cancer include sore throat, odynophagia, and dysphagia. Diagnosis is made on the basis of biopsy results of the affected tissue. Treatment involves surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these therapies.
