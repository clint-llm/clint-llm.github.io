The supraspinatus has the least variation of this group of muscles, while the subscapularis has the most variability. The supraspinatus muscle bulk may have separate muscle fibers originating from the most anteromedial supraspinous fossa.

Some physiological variants include the subscapularis muscle, which research has shown to have small accessory muscles with tendons that insert along with the primary tendon.

There are multiple variations of the deltoid. One variation is the posterior fibers of the deltoid can be separated from the rest of the deltoid by a fascial sheath.

The biceps brachialis and the brachial triceps may have supernumerary muscular bellies.

The latissimus dorsi muscle may have direct contact with the deltoid muscle through the presence of the axillary arch muscle.

The pectoralis major muscle could have an additional extension in the abdomen due to the presence of a rare muscle known as chondrocoracoideus muscle or muscle of Wood. The latter also blends with the muscle fibers of the deltoid at the clavicular level.

The trapezius muscle may have a relationship with a rare muscle known as the cleidocervicalis muscle, involving the cervical tract (C5) and the clavicle.
