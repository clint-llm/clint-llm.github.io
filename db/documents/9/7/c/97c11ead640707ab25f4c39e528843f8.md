Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common conditionÂ which is caused by pulmonary and extra-pulmonary pathologies, and it carries high rates of mortality and morbidity. It was first described 50 years ago. The definition is non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema that occurs because of an inflammatory process that increases capillary membranes permeability leading to impairment in oxygenation and gas exchange presenting with hypoxemia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.
