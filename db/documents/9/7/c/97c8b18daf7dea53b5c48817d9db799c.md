The feelings of appetite and satiety involve complex interactions between hormones from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to the hypothalamus and subsequent feedback. Within the hypothalamus are specific regions where hormones interact to produce sensations of appetite and satiety, leading to food consumption or a feeling of fullness. Through the interactions of ghrelin and leptin, the hypothalamus can regulate the sensation of hunger and satiety, leading to energy homeostasis. Ghrelin, termed the "hunger hormone," was initially discovered through its receptor, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R), before explaining its role as a growth-hormone-releasing peptide.

Leptin was discovered primarily as a signal in regulating body weight.
