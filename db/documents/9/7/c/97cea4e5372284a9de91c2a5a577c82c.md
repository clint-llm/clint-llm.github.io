Nursing monitoring should include:

- Auscultate lung sounds

- Wheezing they may need a breathing treatment or if significant, intubation
- No breath sounds or stridor is usually an ominous sign and requires immediate reporting to the healthcare team leader
- Crackles they may have pneumonia and may need suctioning

- Positioning the patient in an upright position

- Obtain a baseline peak flow and monitor for the decline - the smaller the number the less amount of air they are moving

- Complete prescribed breathing treatments such as albuterol treatments for bronchodilation and ipratropium to decrease bronchospasm

- Give all prescribed medications such as corticosteroids which provide an anti-inflammatory effect

- Make sure the entire medical team is aware if the patient is getting worse; know the location of the crash cart

Safety first! If you think the patient is declining, impending airway closure may be imminent, it is better to be proactive than reactive - contact the medical team if you have a concern
