The standard bundle of His ECG is an invasive electrophysiology study which involves inserting an electrode catheter into the femoral vein, through the inferior vena cava, and into the heart. It is advanced into the right ventricle and pulled back until the continuous monitor notes a spike between the P wave and the QRS complex, signifying the depolarization of the bundle of His.

Because the bundle of His transmits the electrical impulse from the AV node to the bundle branches, malfunction of the bundle of His can lead to heart blocks ranging from AV conduction delays (first-degree heart block) to a complete dissociation in the electrical conduction between the atria and ventricles (third-degree heart block). Conduction delays are a direct cause of arrhythmias, and should therefore be clinically evaluated. Although the twelve-lead electrocardiogram is the gold standard for the evaluation of cardiac arrhythmias, other modalities such as the His bundle electrocardiogram may be more useful in narrowing the source of the conduction defect.

The His bundle electrocardiogram is useful in detecting the following conduction delays and clinical findings

- First-degree heart block with normal QRS above the bundle of His

- Trifascicular block with delay in conduction below the bundle of His in patients with left bundle branch block or intraventricular conduction defects

- Wenckebach (Mobitz type I) block above the bundle of His

- Mobitz type II block potentially within the bundle of His

- Mobitz type II block below the bundle of His on an ECG that shows non-conducted P waves andÂ  intraventricular conduction defect

- Mobitz type II block with the presence of a prolonged QRS interval which may evoke intermittent trifascicular block, leading to potential complete heart block

- Second-degree AV block-conduction delay at the AV node or perinodal area-block above the bundle of His

- Localization of second-degree AV blocks; conduction delay proximal to the bundle of His may indicate issues with the AV node, whereas conduction delay distal to the bundle of His may indicate issues with the His-Purkinje system

- Complete (third-degree) heart block that occurs within the bundle of His
