These typically are related to the underlying disease. Prolonged exposure of the cornea may result in secondary exposure keratopathy if the cornea becomes very dry, particularly at night, if there is incomplete eyelid closure. This condition may lead to chemosis and conjunctivitis. Corneal ulceration and keratitis may follow as further complications. Permanent visual disturbance such as diplopia is rare if the underlying etiology receives treatment early and swiftly. Other rare complications have also included superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis and optic atrophy.
