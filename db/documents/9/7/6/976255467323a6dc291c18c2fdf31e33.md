Pathological involvement of the hepatobiliary system in patients with CF typically develops before or during puberty with an incidence of 15% to 17%, clinically manifesting in a diverse manner ranging from asymptomatic elevation in liver function tests to advanced liver disease with decompensation. In infants with CFTR dysfunction, liver dysfunction may manifest in the form of cholestasis, which is relatively rare but is seen in approximately 50% of newborns with CF when it cooccurs with meconium ileus.
