Several theories and triggering factors have been proposed concerning BS, but the ultimate etiology of this entity remains uncertain. Although the majority of cases are limited to the eyelid, there are reports of blepharochalasis associated with other systemic abnormalities. Some authors have, therefore, suggested that blepharochalasis might be part of a more complex systemic disorder.

The different etiological theories that have been proposed include involvement of hormone influences, allergies, localized forms of cutis laxa, and idiopathic angioedema. However, most recent histopathological studies suggest that immunoglobulin (Ig) A deposits might play a role in the etiopathogenesis of the disease.
