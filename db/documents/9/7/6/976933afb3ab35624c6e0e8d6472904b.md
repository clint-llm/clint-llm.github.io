The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is a branch of the United States Department of Labor that oversees and enforces standard workplace conditions to minimize workplace health and safety risks. In addition to setting and overseeing workplace standards, OSHA also provides additional education and outreach to high-risk fields, including healthcare.

While OSHA sets general standards that transcend nearly all fields of work, many specific regulations pertaining to the healthcare field are in place including, but not limited to, bloodborne pathogens, harmful chemicals, infectious diseases, and personal protective equipment necessary to prevent exposure of individuals to hazardous materials/organisms. One such potentially hazardous chemical is formaldehyde, a colorless gas with a strong, distinct smell that is the most commonly used tissue preservative and fixation product in pathology and anatomy laboratory settings in the United States.

Outside of the healthcare field, formaldehyde is commonly found in household products, glues, plywood, fabrics, paper products, and industrial cleaning solutions. Regulated via under standard 29 CFR 1910.1048, formaldehyde safety is enforced by OSHA to mitigate the potentially harmful effects of acute and chronic exposure to the gas, vapor, liquid, or solution (formalin) states of formaldehyde.
