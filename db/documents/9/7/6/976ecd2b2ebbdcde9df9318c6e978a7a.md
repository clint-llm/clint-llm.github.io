Chemotherapy patients should be counseled regarding the potential for developing febrile neutropenia, including education on the symptoms for which they must watch. If they develop neutropenia, they need to avoid exposure to persons with respiratory infections, as well as crowded places. If their ANC falls below 1000/microL, they should wear a facemask in public places. Taking their temperature daily is also recommended, especially if they develop symptoms such as chills, sweats, or feeling feverish.
