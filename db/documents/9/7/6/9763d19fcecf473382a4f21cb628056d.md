The exact prevalence of hirsutism is not well known. It may be 10% or even higher than 50%. The psychological problem that this disease causes depends on ethnic and socio-cultural factors. Indeed, in some societies where the lack of hair is considered an important criterion of female beauty, minimal hirsutism could be considered a severe disorder, while much more pronounced hirsutism could be accepted in other societies.

Hirsutism appears to be most common in dark-skinned individuals.Â  Hirsutism can occur in men but is difficult to recognize. In children, hirsutism is a sign of precocious puberty.

Hirsutism is also known to occur in women who discontinue the oral contraceptive pill and gain weight.
