Type 1 diabetes occurs when there is the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells leading to insufficient insulin production and resulting hyperglycemia. With insulin replacement, type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease requiring intensive effort on the part of the person with diabetes and caregivers. There is an emphasis on reducing hyperglycemia while minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia. The complex balance of glucose is affected by food, insulin doses, body stresses, exercise, and dozens of other factors. Patient and family education is key, as is an acknowledgment of the normal developmental stages and the challenges this brings in the context of daily living with a chronic disease. With proper care and support, children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes can expect to lead long and fulfilling lives.
