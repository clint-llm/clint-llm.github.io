Carotidynia presents as a distinct inflammation of the vascular and perivascular tissues, mostÂ commonly at the level of the carotid bifurcation leading to the thickening of the vessel wall without significant luminal narrowing.

On gross examination during carotid endarterectomies, it appears as a fibrinous grey exudate.
