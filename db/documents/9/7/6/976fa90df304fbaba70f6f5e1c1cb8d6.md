If pain control, corticosteroids, and an appropriate exercise plan with physical therapy has been prescribed, Ferrante et al. reported 89% of patients recovered within three years, 75% within two years, and 36% within the first year. Recent studies show that many of these patients will continue to have pain and some functional limitation, however, full recovery of strength is possible and can take up to 8 years. As seen in the Van Alfen et al. study, per­sistent pain was experienced by 30% of patients and functional limitations by 66% after a mean of 2.5 years.

Some factors associated with poorer prognosis are female gender, persistent pain as well as lack of motor recovery by three months, lower trunk involvement (upper trunk involvement has better prognosis), and hereditary cases (idiopathic cases have rare recurrence rate whereas hereditary cases have much more common recurrence rates).
