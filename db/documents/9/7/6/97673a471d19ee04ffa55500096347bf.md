Blunt cardiac injury: BCI may affect anyone, but most often affects males with an average age in the 30s.  Pediatric patients with blunt cardiac injury are also often male, with an average age of 7, and most commonly from motor vehicle accidents. Patients with blunt thoracic trauma have been noted to have as high as a 30% incidence of electrical abnormalities.

Penetrating cardiac injury: Any gender or aged individual may be the victim of a penetrating cardiac injury, but males and those in the 3rd or 4th decade of life are most common.  The right ventricle is most frequently injured, followed by the left ventricle, and then atria or multiple-chamber injuries.
