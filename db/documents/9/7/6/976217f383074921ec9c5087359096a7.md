Niacin is a pharmacotherapeutic pleiotropic agent with properties still yet to be fully understood. It is encouraged that interprofessional healthcare team members (clinicians, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, primary care providers, nurses) stay updated on niacin's properties and side effects uncovered by ongoing research. Niacin can cause flushing, a significant adverse impact that significantly affects its compliance in patients. Knowing how to titrate from a minimal dose will help minimize such unwanted effects and benefit patient health outcomes. Close monitoring and periodic blood work on initiating or increasing the dosage of niacin is necessary as it is known to increase the risk of bleeding, hypotension, hyperuricemia, and cause alterations in glycemic control. Its adverse effect on glycemic control in patients with dyslipidemia, both with or without diabetes, is one of its most concerning effects as it may cause diabetes in predisposed patients or make the management of diabetes a challenge. Using an interprofessional approach with each discipline contributing from their area of expertise will result in better patient outcomes and fewer adverse effects from niacin. [Level 5]
