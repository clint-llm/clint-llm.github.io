Like other lung etiologies, NTM lung infection affects the host in several ways. Clinical manifestation could mimic other lung infections, such as Mycobacterial tuberculosis, atypical bacterial infections, and chronic lung diseases. Clinicians should approach the differential diagnosis of pulmonary pathologies based on the clinical manifestations and radiological characteristics. Among the differential diagnosis infections, neoplasias, and connective tissue diseases most commonly share similarities to NTM lung infections. Mycoplasma, chlamydia, and viral pneumonia are relevant entities to include in the differential. Others are fungal lung infections like Aspergillus, Histoplasma, and Coccidiosis, to name a few. Small cell and non-small-cell lung cancer are important to consider. Moreover, disorders of the connective tissue, such as rheumatoid arthritis lung diseases, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, represent an essential part of the differential as well. Overall, any entity that presents with respiratory manifestations, and either cavitary or bronchiectasis radiological lung pictures on images, is part of the differential diagnostic, and these conditions need to be ruled out.
