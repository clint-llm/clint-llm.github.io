**Perioperative Complications**

- Anchor failure

- Glenoid fracture

- Nerve injury (0.3%) - musculocutaneous or axillary nerve injury

- Hematoma formation

- Infection (0.2%)

**Postoperative Complications**

**Arthroscopic Bankart Repair**

Recurrence - Arthroscopic Bankart repair shows a recurrence rate of 10.7% to 13.1%.

- Young age

- Excessive preoperative dislocations

- Significant bone loss

- Inferior capsule hyperlaxity

Decreased range of motion- reduction in external rotation is a common finding after arthroscopic Bankart repair.

**Open Bankarts Repair**

- Recurrence: Open Bankart repair is associated with a low recurrence rate of 8%

- Reduced range of motion- external and internal rotations are reduced - open Bankart repair shows more loss of rotations than arthroscopic Bankart repair

- Subscapularis rupture

- Prolonged operative time

- High incidence of sepsis
