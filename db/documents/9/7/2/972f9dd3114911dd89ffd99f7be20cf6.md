The most common laboratory investigations done during evaluation of the ulcer include a fasting blood sugar, glycated hemoglobin levels, complete metabolic panel, a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP).

Recent guidelines and the literature suggest that in patients with diabetic foot ulcers, results of specimens for culture taken by swabbing do not correlate well with those obtained by deep tissue sampling; this suggests that superficial swab specimens may be less reliable for guiding antimicrobial therapy than deep tissue specimens.

Radiological investigations include plain x-rays to look for any underlying osteomyelitis, the presence of air in the subcutaneous tissue, any signs of underlying fractures, and presence of a foreign body. If osteomyelitis is suspected, MRI is the most preferred test. A bone scan with technetium can also be used to diagnose underlying osteomyelitis. Arterial Doppler with ankle-brachial index (ABI) is useful to rule out underlying peripheral vascular disease.

The probe-to-bone test (PTB) i dperformed by probing the ulcer with a sterile metal probe is a bedside test that can help with the diagnosis of underlying osteomyelitis. If the probe hits the bone, it is a positive test.
