Amniotic membrane graft is placed epithelial side up on the ocular surface and cornea. The identification of the stromal side is by noting the stickiness. The membrane may be placed as inlay to fill the areas of stromal thinning as one layer or as a multilayer graft. An amniotic membrane may also be used as a bandage to cover epithelial defects as an onlay. The membrane may be spread across the ocular surface and tucked into the fornices in cases of chemical injury, and held in place by a conformer. The amniotic membrane may be used as a substrate for the placement of limbal stem cells.

In all these procedures, the amniotic membrane may be fixed with 10-0 nylon sutures or 8-0Â polyglactin 910 sutures to the ocular surface. Fibrin glue may also be used to anchor the membrane.
