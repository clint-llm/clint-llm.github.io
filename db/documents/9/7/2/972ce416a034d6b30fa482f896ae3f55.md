The FDA recognized the combination of acetylsalicylic acid (250 mg), acetaminophen (250 mg), and caffeine (65 mg) as safe and effective in treating acute headaches, especially migraine, and was considered effective also by the American Headache Society.

This combination may have other benefits according to the components.

**Caffeine**

Caffeine is legal, cheap, and not regulated in almost all parts of the world. It can be found as over-the-counter (OTC) medication or in other sources such as coffee, tea, sodas, gum, and candy.

**Headaches**

Besides migraines and tension-type headaches, caffeine is considered effective for other types of headaches like post-dural puncture headaches and hypnic headaches, which can present with cranial autonomic features.

Clinical studies showed that caffeine citrate (intravenous [IV]) might be used alone in acute migraine attacks, but it might be inferior to magnesium sulfate (IV) in moderate-to-severe migraines. Early administration of ergotamine/caffeine compounds may also be effective.

A clinical study showed that discontinuing caffeine before a migraine attack can increase the efficacy of acute treatment.

**Physical Performance**

Caffeine improved high-intensity exercise tolerance and less fatigue but no change in power. Therefore, athletes use it as an ergogenic aid to increase physical performance.

**Pain**

Adding 100 mg or more caffeine to a standard dose of commonly used analgesics provides a small but significant increase in pain relief in postoperative procedures

**Other Uses**

Premature Babies

Caffeine has a significant role in treating and preventing further damage in premature babies younger than 32 weeks and with very low birth weight (500 to 1250 g). It is used as therapy for apnea of prematurity, decreases the risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and decreases brain damage in hypoxic brain injury. Furthermore, it has a role in decreasing the rate of patent ductus arteriosus requiring treatment and reducing the likelihood of discharging home with oxygen. It can help shorten the time of mechanical ventilation in premature babies who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, which may reduce the risk of lung injury. Other clinical studies showed decreases in bilirubin neurotoxicity after introducing caffeine to rats.

Habitual caffeine consumption may have benefits in other fields such as neurodegenerative disorders, dementia in Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease and improve the neurobehavioral performance without changing the subjective assessment of sleepiness and fatigue.

**Acetaminophen**

Acetaminophen is also known as paracetamol, and it is the most commonly used analgesic and antipyretic drug around the world. It may be used without a prescription and is the drug of choice in patients who cannot have treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as well as those patients with bronchial asthma, peptic ulcer disease, hemophilia, salicylate-sensitized people, children under 12 years of age, and pregnant or breastfeeding women.

Acetaminophen is used alone or combined with other medications to treat acute primary headaches; it is combined with aspirin and caffeine for a migraine and tension-type headache and combined with tramadol for a cluster headache.

**Other Uses**

- First-line treatment for pain associated osteoarthritis

- Chronic pain (safer to use than opioids)

- It may be used orally to close the patent ductus arteriosus by decreasing prostacyclin synthesis without peripheral vasoconstrictive effect in infants with contraindications to NSAIDs

Some studies showed the association of acetaminophen use with:

- Inhibition of cell proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells when used with metamizole

- When used orally is more effective than deferoxamine injections in the treatment of iron overload and associated cardiac complications

- Improve the healing of the tendon in tendinopathy when combined with NO by decreasing the water content and enhancing the collagen content of the injured tendon

**Acetylsalicylic Acid (Aspirin)**

Asprin is metabolized into salicylic acid (SA) and used at doses of less than or equal to 325 mg per day to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events; whereas it is used at higher doses (500 to 1000 mg as a single dose and 3000 to 4000 mg per day) to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation.

Used alone or combined with other drugs. Aspirin 500 to 1000 mg is a first-line therapy for moderate to severe primary headaches. It may be combined with ibuprofen 400 mg for a tension-type headache or metoclopramide 10 mg for acute migraines. It may also be used as a prophylactic treatment of migraine with aura.

Intravenous administration of aspirin for inpatient management of a headache is considered safe, effective, and useful, and in migraine headaches, it is considered superior to sumatriptan with minor possible side effects.

Acetylsalicylic acid is contraindicated in children under the age of 12 because of the risk of Reye syndrome, except in Kawasaki disease, when used with intravenous immunoglobulin.

Aspirin is used as an antiplatelet drug at lower doses (75 to 325 mg) to reduce cardiovascular events in high-risk patients.

It has anti-inflammatory properties so that it can be used in an exercise-induced inflammatory response, chronic pain, or even in inflammation-induced cancers. Other studies showed an association between the use of aspirin with a preventive and therapeutic role in the following cancers:

- Breast cancer

- Esophageal adenocarcinoma

- Colorectal cancer

- Pancreatic cancer

- Glioma

- Mesothelioma

It has been used to decrease the nocturnal pain in osteoid osteoma.

Aspirin may have a neuroprotective role in peripheral nerve injuries and Alzheimer disease.
