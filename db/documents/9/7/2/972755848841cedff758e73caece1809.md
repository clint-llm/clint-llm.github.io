OME is most commonly caused by either viral or allergy-related factors, not bacterial infection. Therefore, the use of antibiotics is not recommended. Also, corticoids for the treatment of allergies have not been significantly proven to impact the outcomes of OME in patients. For these reasons, antibiotics and corticoids are not recommended to treat OME. The best practice for OME patients is watchful waiting for three months as a first-line measure. In cases where OME persists, a specialist referral may be made to assess for surgical treatment options.
