The peroneal artery arises from the tibial-peroneal trunk distal to the popliteal artery. The peroneal artery is also called the fibular artery. The peroneal artery is the blood supply to the lateral compartment of the leg. Muscular branches of the peroneal artery supply the peroneus brevis muscle.

Venous drainage of the lateral compartment of the lower leg is by superficial veins that drain into the small saphenous vein and deep veins that drain into the posterior tibial vein, which then becomes the popliteal vein when joined by the anterior vein.

The lymphatics of the bilateral peroneus brevis muscles and lateral compartments first drainÂ to the popliteal and inguinal nodes and subsequently to the external iliac nodes. The external iliac nodes then drain into lumbar (aortic) nodes.
