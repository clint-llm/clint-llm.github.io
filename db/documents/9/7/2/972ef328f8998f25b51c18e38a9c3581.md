There are very few contraindications when performing anesthesia for eye surgeries, and many are based on patient factors. An absolute contraindication would be patient refusal and anaphylactic reactions to local anesthetics when anesthetic care for regional blocks is selected. Local anesthetics used for eye surgeries may consist of aminoesters and aminoamides. The most commonly used local anesthetic is lidocaine which is an aminoamide. True anaphylactic reactions are rare and mainly result from the preservative (methylparaben), commonly added to lidocaine.

During retinal detachment surgeries, the ophthalmologist may inject a gas bubble of either sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) or perfluoropropane (C3F8) that will be used to intentionally tamponade the retinal break. This gas bubble must be completely reabsorbed, which may take several weeks before nitrous oxide can be used as part of an anesthetic under general anesthesia. This is an absolute contraindication because of the permanent blindness that may result in weeks later as nitrous oxide enters and expands this gas bubble, thereby increasing intraocular pressure. Other relative contraindications which may guide anesthetic care to improve surgical outcomes are based on the age of the patient in pediatric patients, diseases that inhibit cooperation such as dementia or Parkinson disease, inability to tolerate supine positioning secondary to comorbidities, localized eye infections, and increased long axial length of the eye undergoing the operation.
