While we point out that there has been a shift from QA to QCI or TQM, QA remains relevant based on goals. For example, QA remains a driving force for harmonization and standardization for laboratory medicine.

Teaching hospitals continue to use and benefit from QA systems by utilizing peer review at surgical audit meetings.

Since its development, QA has been intimately intertwined with clinical practice. Practitioners tend to positively view interventions intended to improve their practice. Basic quality assurance activities such as continuing medical education (CME) requirements and checklists for surgical equipment have become commonplace. New QA metrics are being tested all the time and affect healthcare providers on all specialties, including hospital and nursing managers, medical doctors, nurses, medical technicians, medical records officers, and quality improvement officers.
