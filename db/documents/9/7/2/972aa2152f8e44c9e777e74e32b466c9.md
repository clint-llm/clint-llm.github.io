The diagnosis and management of KMP is with an interprofessional team that includes a hematologist, radiologist, intensivist, pediatrician, nurse practitioner, and the primary care provider. Once the diagnosis is made, the treatment is largely supportive and includes prevention of life threatening complications like hemorrhage. The underlying tumor must be treated. Both surgery and embolization have been used but both carry high risk of injury to adjacent structures. In some children, radiation may induce regression of the mass, but the therapy can also lead to growth retardation and induction of secondary malignancies.

Many potent chemotherapeutic agents have been used but the response is variable and not always predictable. The outlook for most children with KMP is guarded.
