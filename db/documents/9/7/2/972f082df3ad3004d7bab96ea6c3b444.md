Previously hepatic histology was considered normal in Crigler-Najjar syndrome. However, recent studies show some pathological changes in histology. Microscopically, bile plugs can be seen occasionally within canaliculi as a result of cholestasis. Crigler-Najjar syndrome can have a hepatic parenchymal injury. A small study reported transplant patients with significant fibrosis seen in the explants.
