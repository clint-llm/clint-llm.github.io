Chronic pruritus is a broad category with multiple etiologies and a lifetime incidence of over 20%. Notalgia paresthetica falls in the subcategory of chronic neuropathic pruritus, a subcategory which is thought to constitute approximately 8% of all cases of chronic pruritus. Notalgia paresthetica does not have a racial predilection for other pruritic neuropathic syndromes such as brachioradial pruritus, which favors those with lighter skin tones.****Notalgia paresthetica is typically a unilateral disease, often present on the contralateral side of the dominant hand. The majority of the population is right hand dominant. Therefore, a left-sided parascapular pruritus that the patient can reach with their dominant hand is highly suggestive of notalgia paresthetica. Females are reported to be affected more than males, but small study sizes may be misleading.
