Singh-Vaughan Williams classification included five classes of antiarrhythmic drugs- Class I drugs produce moderate (Ia), weak (Ib), or marked (Ic) Na channel block and reduce AP phase 0 slope and overshoot while increasing, reducing, or conserving AP duration (APD) and effective refractory period (ERP), respectively, Class II drugs, comprising β-adrenergic inhibitors, reduce sino-atrial node (SAN) pacing rates and slow atrioventricular node (AVN) AP conduction, Class III drugs, comprising K channel blockers, delay AP phase 3 repolarization and lengthen ERP whereas Class IV drugs, comprising Ca channel blockers, reduce heart rate and conduction. Mexiletine is a class 1B antiarrhythmic agent.

Mexiletine is a sodium channel blocker and further classified as a Class 1B antiarrhythmic in the Vaughan-Williams classification scheme of antiarrhythmic drugs. Mexiletine is an oral medication that blocks sodium channels in cardiac myocytes and nerve cells. In cardiac myocytes, mexiletine affects phase 0 of the cardiac myocyte action potential, inhibiting the inward sodium current, and its mechanism of action can be generalized across all Class 1B antiarrhythmics.

Furthermore, most Class 1 antiarrhythmics exhibit a property called "use dependence." Use dependence is so named relative to the state of the channel that is being affected. Class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs block sodium channels best when these channels are in use, specifically when the sodium channel is in an open or inactive state. Cardiac myocyte sodium channels occur more often in these states at faster heart rates, allowing more of the drug to bind at these higher rates.

Relative to nerve cells, blocking sodium channels disrupts the resting membrane potential, causing inhibition of the propagation of electrical impulses. Mexiletine increases the ratio of effective refractory period to action potential duration but unlike drugs, like quinidine, it does not have an effect on QRS or QT/QTc potential.

It is important to note that metabolites of mexiletine were also studied, specifically meta-hydroxymexiletine (MHM). MHM is one of the metabolites of mexiletine through the CYP2D6 system. Mexiletine has been approved for use since 1969.in vitro setting. They report that MHM possesses about two times the blocking activity of mexiletine on cardiac sodium channels but did not impair motor coordination and showed no cytotoxicity compared to mexiletine. With the potential to have a more favorable side effect profile than mexiletine, MHM warrants further studies and research in the use of neuropathic pain and arrhythmias as a safer alternative to mexiletine.

Lei et al discuss a modern classification of antiarrhythmic drugs, incorporating advances that have been made since the original Vaughan Williams classification was introduced in 1970.
