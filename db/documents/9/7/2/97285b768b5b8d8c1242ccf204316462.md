In patients with severe toxicity, a consult with a medical toxicologist or poison control center may be beneficial. If intoxication or overdose occurred accidentally, patient or caregiver education is key to decrease repeated episodes. Proper storage techniques and the utilization of children-proof containers should be emphasized to keep medications out of the reach of children, given most incidences are pediatric. Collaboration with emergency medicine pharmacists might be beneficial as they can recommend appropriate supportive therapy and identify any drug-drug interactions as well. Concomitant administration of diphenhydramine with other medications that can also cause sedation or respiratory depression should be avoided.

If intoxication or overdose occurred with the intention of self-harm, psychiatric services should be consulted as part of inpatient care. Referral to outpatient behavioral health resources prior to discharge would also be warranted to mitigate the risk of repeated intoxication or overdose.
