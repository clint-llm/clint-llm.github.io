Complications that can be encountered with this type of fracture can include loss of motion, malunion, disuse quadriceps atrophy, nonunion, physeal disruption/growth disturbance (recurvatum deformity, distal femoral valgus deformity, limb length discrepancy), laxity, hardware irritation/impingement (most common with metal suture and screw fixation), mechanical impingement, arthrofibrosis, chondral injury.

Another complication that can occur is interposed soft tissue within the fracture site. This can impede fracture reduction and prevent fracture healing or lead to malunion and subsequent impingement of the malreduced fracture. Soft tissue that can become interposed includes the transverse intermeniscal ligament and the anterior horn of the medial or lateral meniscus.

In regards to arthrofibrosis after surgical management, Watts et al. found there was no difference in the incidence based on the surgical approach independently; however, they found in their study that patients that underwent arthroscopic fixation had more risk factors for arthrofibrosis (time to referral to a pediatric orthopedic surgeon who performs the technique, length of surgery).  Watts et al. advocated that time to surgery greater than 7 days from injury and that prolonged operative time greater than 120 minutes put patients at an increased risk for arthrofibrosis.
