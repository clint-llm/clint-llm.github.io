- Centralized pain occurs when the central nervous system becomes sensitized to pain, leading to a lower pain threshold.

- The prevalence of widespread pain or central pain is relatively standard. It is present in up to 20% of patients with chronic pain from any cause.

- Common symptoms of centralized pain are: pain from nonpainful contact or pressure (allodynia) and increased pain from painful stimuli (hyperalgesia).

- Patients suffering from chronic rheumatological and musculoskeletal conditions for at least three months are at increased risk of developing central pain syndrome.

- There is both an environmental and genetic component to developing central pain syndrome.

- A patient can have both a chronic disease causing pain (peripheral pain) and centralized pain (central pain syndrome), and this risk increases over time.

- Functional MRI may be a practical diagnostic test in diagnosing various pain disorders.

- Centralized pain can significantly and negatively impact multiple chronic disease states, including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

- A pain medicine specialist alongside a primary care physician may be necessary to treat central pain syndrome.

- Treatment of a comorbid disease alongside centralized pain can improve a patient's pain.

- First-line treatments for centralized pain include antidepressants and anticonvulsants.
