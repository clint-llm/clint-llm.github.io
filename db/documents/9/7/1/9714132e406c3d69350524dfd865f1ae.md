Tracheal trauma represents a high-risk time-sensitive acute condition with the potential to adversely affect the patient's ability to maintain an airway. A team-based approach including emergency medicine, trauma and ENT specialists, as well as ancillary services including nursing and respiratory therapy, is required for optimal initial stabilization. Definitive treatment which often involves urgent surgical intervention, has been shown to be beneficial; delays in definitive treatment have been associated with poorer outcomes (Level V).
