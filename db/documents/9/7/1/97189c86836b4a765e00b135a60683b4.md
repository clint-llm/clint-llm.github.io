Contraindications to microvascular surgery, in general, are applicable to patients being considered for osteocutaneous radial forearm free flap reconstruction. Contraindications specific to the OCRFFF include the following:

- High risk of distal extremity ischemia with blood supply from the ulnar artery only.

- High risk of flap failure due to an insufficient radial artery.

- Inability to support a free flap with recipient site blood vessels.

- Inability to reconstruct the defect with 10 to 12 cm of bone.

- Requirement to place dental implants into the transferred bone.

As discussed in a previous section, the harvest of the OCRFFF also includes the harvest of the radial artery. After harvest of the radial forearm free flap, the remaining blood supply to the hand is based solely on the ulnar artery and the network of collateral flow between the superficial and deep palmar arch. The absence of ulnar artery inflow (e.g., traumatic injury, profound peripheral vascular disease, arterial agenesis) or the suggestion of an incomplete arch are contraindications to harvest the OCRFFF. Likewise, insufficient blood flow in the radial artery is a contraindication to use of the radial forearm free flap. Example etiologies of arterial insufficiency include injury to the radial artery (e.g., trauma, peripheral vascular disease), congenital absence of the vessel, and thromboembolic or hypercoagulable states. If the radial artery is damaged or absent due to these conditions, the flap will not be viable.

If the flap can be harvested, the recipient site must be able to receive the flap. There are a number of arteries in the neck suitable for microvascular anastomosis, including branches of the external carotid system and the thyrocervical trunk vessels. If the neck is depleted of these vessels, one can turn to the contralateral neck because of the length of the vascular pedicle. If both necks are vessel-depleted, the internal mammary artery can be dissected and rotated superiorly into the neck to serve as a recipient vessel. If the use of the internal mammary artery is the primary reconstructive option to perfuse the OCRFFF, patient health and other factors may point toward aborting free flap reconstruction in favor of a regional flap, such as the pectoralis major flap or a construct using a plate wrapped with soft tissue.

The size and quality of the bone harvested are also significant limiting factors in the use of this flap. Reconstructions that require more than 10 to 12 cm of bone, such as a total mandibulectomy, cannot be reconstructed with a single OCRFFF. The thickness of the bone is also limited. Under optimal conditions, the fibular free flap is preferred for bony reconstructions. It offers many of the same qualities the OCRFFF does; it is pliable, thin, and has a long pedicle. It has the added advantage, however, of greater bone stock thickness, and most lower extremity weight-bearing is on the tibia, not the fibula. The fibular free flap similarly requires that blood flow to the distal extremity (i.e., the foot) be sufficient after the loss of the contribution of the peroneal artery. This might not be a major issue in a young trauma patient needing osseous free flap reconstruction. However, head and neck cancer patients, who may have smoking-related vasculopathy, be of older age, and may have other medical comorbidities, may have insufficient blood flow to the distal extremity (or through the peroneal artery) to support the fibular flap as a viable reconstruction option. It is not uncommon for a vascular study to contraindicate the use of the fibular flap, leaving the osteocutaneous radial forearm, scapular/parascapular flaps, or iliac crest flap as the next option. Each of these reconstructive options has advantages and disadvantages associated with it.

Patients with previous trauma to the wrist and prior wrist surgeries should be approached carefully, athough an history of wrist surgery is not an absolute contraindication to use of the OCRFFF. As flap harvest can alter manual dexterity, the author's preference is to harvest from the non-dominant hand. However, the preoperative assessment may favor raising the flap from the dominant arm due to vascular considerations. The need to harvest a flap from the dominant upper extremity could be considered a relative contraindication in the eyes of the surgeon. Similarly, occupations and hobbies with high demand for manual dexterity can be considered relative contraindications to this procedure.

Other patients may have medical comorbidities that increase their risk for flap failure. These include, but are not limited to, severe peripheral vascular disease, coagulopathies, and cardiovascular disease. Patients with severe peripheral vascular disease present a higher risk of flap failure due to vessel stenosis, intimal disease, poor vessel pliability, baseline inflammatory state, and hypercoagulability. Patients with hypercoagulable pathologies, such as Factor V Leiden thrombophilia, also present an increased risk of flap failure with thrombosis of the vessel anastomosis or clotting within the microcirculation of the flap itself. Smokers also have an elevated risk of microvascular free flap failure. Nonetheless, patients with these conditions have frequently undergone successful microvascular reconstructive procedures.

Cancer patients with multiple, severe medical comorbidities may not be healthy enough to undergo lengthy microvascular operations and may opt for alternative reconstructive options instead. For patients with multiple medical comorbidities, the risks and benefits of microvascular reconstruction may need to be weighed against a functionally or cosmetically suboptimal, but lower risk (and perhaps more reliable), pedicled flap. An example would be a mandibular reconstruction bar wrapped with a pectoralis myofasciocutaneous flap.
