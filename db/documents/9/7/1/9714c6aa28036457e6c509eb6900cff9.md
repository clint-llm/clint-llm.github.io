The treatment for schizencephaly depends on multiple factors, including the signs and symptoms and severity of the condition.

Treatment generally consists of drugs to prevent seizures and/or physical therapy. In cases complicated by hydrocephalus, a surgically implanted shunt can divert fluid to another area of the body from which it can be absorbed.

Management is mainly supportive, which includes rehabilitation for motor deficits, intellectual disability, and seizure management. Surgery can be a choice in cases with hydrocephalus or raised intracranial pressure.
