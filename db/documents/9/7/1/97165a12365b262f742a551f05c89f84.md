To safely perform ear irrigation, one should use an otoscope. You will need your cerumenolytic of choice. The water you will use for irrigation must be warmed before use. You can either use a thirty milliliter to a 60-mm syringe with a 16 or 18 gauge intravenous (IV) catheter attached (with the needle removed) or a pulsating water device (such as a WaterPik) to irrigate the impacted cerumen out of the ear. You will also need an ear irrigation basin or emesis basin to catch the water and pieces of cerumen as it leaves the ear.

Due to the availability of syringes and IV catheters when compared to pulsating water devices, the syringe and IV catheter method is more common.

A cerumen spoon or alligator forceps can be used to remove loose cerumen pieces following the ear irrigation procedure.
