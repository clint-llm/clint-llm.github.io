Oxytocin may be given when indicated, during all stages of labor.

Most labor and delivery units will have an established protocol for the administration of oxytocin that entails the administration of the proper medication and dosage, as well as criteria for an incremental increase as clinically warranted. The protocols also include monitoring maternal and fetal status and avoiding tachysystole and abnormal fetal heart rate patterns. Such protocols allow collaborative care between the nursing staff and the obstetrician.

Therapeutic rest and analgesia may be provided during a prolonged latent phase of the first stage of labor.

In the case of maternal/fetal compromise, immediate preparation for delivery is indicated.
