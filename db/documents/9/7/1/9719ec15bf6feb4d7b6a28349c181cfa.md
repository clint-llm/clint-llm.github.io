Genital warts are very common in clinical practice. Because of the risk of cancer, there is now a vaccine available to prevent these warts. Healthcare workers, including nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and primary care physicians, need to work in an interprofessional effort to educate patients about the importance of the HPV vaccine as it can prevent a variety of genital cancers. The ACIP recommends routine male HPV quadrivalent vaccinations at age 11-12.  If not previously given or incomplete (the vaccines are a three-dose series), the vaccine should be given up to age 21. From ages 22 to 26, the vaccine is considered optional. In other words, the optimal age for male HPV vaccination is 11 to 12 years, but it may be given up to age 26 years.
