The synthesis of leukotrienes primarily occurs in leukocytes. Different leukocytes tend to predominantly produce a specific leukotriene, either leukotriene B (LTB) or the cysteinyl class of leukotrienes. Neutrophils are the primary synthesizers of LTB and produce little of the cysteinyl leukotrienes. Eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells are the primary producers of the cysteinyl leukotrienes. They have minimal capacity to produce LTB. Macrophages and monocytes serve as intermediaries, having adequate capacity to produce both LTB and the cysteinyl leukotrienes. Other cells typically do not produce significant levels of leukotrienes as they often do not express 5-lipoxygenase or 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP). However, cells can take up leukotriene A (LTA) produced by leukocytes and then synthesize bioactive leukotrienes if they express more distal enzymes in the metabolic pathway. This process has been termed “transcellular biosynthesis.”
