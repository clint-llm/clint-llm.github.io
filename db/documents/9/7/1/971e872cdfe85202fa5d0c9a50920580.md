Diphenhydramine overdose

- Delirium, agitation, confusion, restlessness, hallucinations, ataxia, tremor, seizure

- Dry sweat glands and mucous membranes

- Flushed skin

- Elevated body temperature

- Mydriasis and blurry vision

- Urinary retention

- Tachycardia

- Rhabdomyolysis

Treatment involves the following:

- May attempt activated charcoal if within 1 hour of ingestion

- Benzodiazepines for agitation and seizures; however, phenobarbital and propofol, may be needed (avoid phenytoin/fosphenytoin, as they further block sodium channels)

- Sodium bicarbonate for widened QRS to overcome sodium channel blockade; 2 mEq/kg, typically 2 to 3 amps of bicarb, then continuous infusion. Mix 3 ampules of sodium bicarbonate in 1L D5W, and run this infusion at 250 mL/hr.

- Magnesium sulfate should be administered intravenously for prolonged QT interval.

- Vasopressors if hypotension develops

- May consider physostigmine (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that binds reversibly to inhibit acetylcholinesterase in the central and peripheral nervous system, which in turn allows acetylcholine to bind to muscarinic receptors to overcome the anticholinergic block.Â  This should be given in concert with medical toxicologist/poison control.

- Dose: 0.5 to 2 mg IV over 5 min, onset within 20 min
- Have atropine at the bedside, and watch for bradycardia

- Further studies are needed to investigate the potential treatment of diphenhydramine toxicity using sodium bicarbonate and intravenous lipid emulsion therapy.
