Myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (MEI) is a rare self-limited epileptic syndrome characterized by brief myoclonic seizures in previously healthy and developmentally normal children with onset in the first three years of life. MEI is popularly called "benign myoclonic epilepsy in infants" (BMEI), first described by Dravet and Bureau in 1981.

BMEI does not have a benign course or prognosis in some children, so the word "benign" was removed from the name. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) has included MEI among neonatal/infantile epileptic syndromes under Idiopathic generalized epilepsies with age-related onset.
