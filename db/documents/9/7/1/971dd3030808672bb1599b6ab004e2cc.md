High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is the term for doses higher than 500 mg/ml. Patients may experience nausea, mucosal ulceration, alopecia, fatigue, fever, increased risk of infection, leukopenia, GI bleeding, pancreatitis, cirrhosis, aplastic anemia, malignancy (lymphoproliferative disorders), infections, interstitial pneumonitis, renal impairment, and teratogenesis.

The three antidotes used for MTX toxicity are leucovorin, thymidine, and glucarpidase.

Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion can also lower MTX levels. Intrathecal overdoses require CSF drainage and exchange, steroids, antidotes, and suspension of the medications that interfere with methotrexate clearance (e.g., NSAIDs, salicylates, TMP, penicillin, warfarin, valproate, proton pump inhibitors, cyclosporin, cisplatin).
