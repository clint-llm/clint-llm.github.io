In incidentally detected tumors, there is controversy regarding the timing of surgery.

In symptomatic patients, gross total resection (GTR) is the treatment of choice as these tumors are benign. Recent advances in imaging, surgical approaches, and quality of intensive care have improved surgical outcomes with the chances of a cure reaching almost 100%.

Adjuvant chemotherapy, though limited in use, can prevent recurrence and prolong survival.
