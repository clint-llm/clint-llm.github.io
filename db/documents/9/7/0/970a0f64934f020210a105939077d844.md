Provide informed consent to the patient by explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure, as well as the alternatives to the procedure

Choose an appropriately sized central venous catheter for the patient. This decision may be influenced by the clinical indication, patient size, and vessel caliber. Consider the following:

- Catheter size in French (F) (e.g., 4F, 7F)

- Catheter length (in centimeters)

- Number of lumens required

Perform a procedural “timeout” to confirm that the correct procedure is being performed on the valid patient and the correct side of the patient (i.e., right or left side)

Position the patient:

- The patient can be placed in a reverse Trendelenburg position to engorge the femoral vein, which could potentially increase the vessel’s caliber

- The patient’s leg can be positioned in one of three ways: frog-leg position, external rotation at the hip with full leg extension, or abduction of a fully extended leg with external rotation at the hip.

- Proceduralist washes hands with soap and water.

- Proceduralist dons sterile personal protective equipment (PPE) (i.e., cap, facemask, sterile gown, and gloves)

- Sterile prepping of the skin at the site of insertion with chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone-iodine solution

- Place a sterile drape over the patient ensuring coverage from head to toe

- If ultrasound guidance is utilized, insert non-sterile ultrasound gel into the clean probe cover and place the ultrasound probe into the cover. The sterile ultrasound gel will be used in the sterile field to assist with the visualization

- Administer local anesthetic as an effort to minimize the use of systemic analgesia/sedation

- Flush all lumens of the central venous catheter with normal saline.
