HPNS is a significant consequence of modern deep diving. There are several preventive approaches. These approaches should be considered carefully by divers and diving supervisors. In this regard, diving protocols may be designed in tandem with diving experts. Diving supervisors should record any abnormal symptoms or signs during deep dives and consult with a diving expert. The symptoms usually ease after decompression, but some of the symptoms, such as lethargy, may continue for a while.

An interprofessional team, including neurologists, undersea specialists, hyperbaric nurses, and occupational medicine physicians and nurses, are best suited to caring for and preventing HPNS. Initial evaluation by emergency department personnel is crucial. Intensive care and neuroscience nurses care for patients, educate families about the condition, and relay updates to the rest of the team. [Level 5]
