Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia, affecting approximately 8% to 9% of the world’s population.

Anemia is more prevalent in:

- Developing countries due to malnutrition and lack of proper medical care

- Women due to pregnancy and menstrual bleeding

- African Americans due to sickle cell disease and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency

- Older adults, due to multiple comorbidities like chronic kidney disease (CKD), malignancy, medications, among others.
