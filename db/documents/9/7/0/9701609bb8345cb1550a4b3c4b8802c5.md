Schwannomas (also known as neuromas, neurinomas "of Verocay," and neurilemmomas) are benign, well-encapsulated, slow-growing nerve sheath tumors composed exclusively of Schwann cells. The tumor can originate from any myelinated central or peripheral nerve with Schwann cells. The World Health Organization classifies schwannoma as a grade I benign tumor. Schwannomas are solitary in 90% of the cases. The multiple occurrences in the same patient should bring attention to syndromic associations (neurofibromatosis type 2, schwannomatosis, and Carney complex). This activity outlines the evaluation and management of schwannoma and highlights the role of the healthcare team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of schwannoma.
- Review the steps in the evaluation of schwannoma.
- Outline the management options available for schwannoma.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in patients with schwannoma and improve outcomes.
