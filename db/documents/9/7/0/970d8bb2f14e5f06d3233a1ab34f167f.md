Aplasia cutis congenita (ACC) is a rare congenital skin defect characterized by a focal or extensive absence of the epidermis, dermis, and occasionally subcutaneous tissue.

A classification for ACC was proposed in 1986, which is still accepted today, and presented below.

- Group 1: Scalp ACC without multiple anomalies

- Group 2: Scalp ACC with limb abnormalities

- Group 3: Scalp ACC with epidermal and organoid nevi

- Group 4: ACC overlying congenital malformations

- Group 5: ACC with associated fetus papyraceus or placental infarct

- Group 6: ACC with epidermolysis bullosa

- Group 7: ACC localized to extremities without blistering

- Group 8: ACC due to specific teratogens

- Group 9: ACC associated with malformation syndromes
