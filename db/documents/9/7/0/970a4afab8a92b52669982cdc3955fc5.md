The action of heroin on the opioid receptors is fairly well characterized at this point. An ongoing area of investigation is forensic, namely what opioid contaminants might be lurking within the next shipment of heroin coming into the United States from elsewhere. Many of these contaminants, such as carfentanyl, are not found on usual drug screens, and gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy can be needed to determine the exact contents of a given dose.
