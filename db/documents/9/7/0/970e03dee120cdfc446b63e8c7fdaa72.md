In assessing patients with in-toeing, it is important to remember the age of the patient and the natural course of the lower leg development. The physiologic conditions causing in-toeing will have a spontaneous resolution, requiring good follow up, and parental reassurance. Rare causes will persist past the age of normal correction, but patients do not typically develop sequelae or symptoms. Detailed examination of the feet, ankles, knees, and hips will allow the examiner to differentiate between in-toeing of the possible areas that may be affected.
