Arbovirus infections can vary in clinical presentation. As patients can present with nonspecific symptoms, one's initial differential diagnosis must remain broad. Fevers, headaches, altered mental status, seizures, and focal neurological deficits are common findings in individuals who present with encephalitis. Some infected patients may experience a flu-like illness prior to having any neurological symptoms. Importantly, the combination of fever, headache, and altered mental status can symbolize acute encephalitis syndrome.

Physical exam findings can also assist in determining the cause of a patient's encephalitis. Skin rashes, for example, can be associated with WNV or zika virus. Ocular findings such as chorioretinitis, retinal hemorrhages, and vitreitis can be seen with WNV.
