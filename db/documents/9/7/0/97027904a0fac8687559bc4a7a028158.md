Because of the wide variety of modalities available for neck rejuvenation, an interprofessional team is an optimal method of providing comprehensive care to the cosmetic patient, ensuring that all pertinent options are presented and discussed appropriately. Experts in all relevant fields should participate in inpatient counseling to determine goals and set reasonable, attainable expectations. Surgeons, dermatologists, nurses, and anesthesia providers all have major roles to play before, during, and after rejuvenation of the aging neck.
