Trigeminal neuralgia (TN), also known as tic douloureux, is a chronic pain condition characterized by recurrent brief episodes of electric shock-like pains affecting the fifth cranial (trigeminal) nerve, which supplies the forehead, cheek, and lower jaw. This condition is almost always unilateral and can involve one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve.
