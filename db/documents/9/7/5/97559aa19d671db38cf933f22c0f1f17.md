Patients with ACO usually have the same asthma and COPD symptoms, including cough, sputum production, shortness of breath, and wheezing. However, exacerbation rates were 4 to 5 times higher in ACO patients compared with those with asthma or COPD alone.

The physical examination findings include wheezing and hyperinflation signs, the same as in chronic obstructive lung disease findings. However, findings can be normal, with periodic exacerbations in between.
