Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAE) are sounds generated from the ear without an acoustic stimulus and can be measured with microphones placed in the external ear canal. Their frequencies are between 500 Hz to 4,500 Hz. A small percentage, 1 to 9%, of people can perceive their SOAE as tinnitus.

Evoked otoacoustic emissions (EOAE) can be evoked utilizing three different acoustic stimuli: transient evoked, stimulus-frequency, and distortion product. Transient evoked and distortion product otoacoustic emissions are the most commonly used techniques for a newborn hearing screening.

Transient-evoked OAE (TEOAE) are evoked using a click or tone-burst stimuli. A click stimulus has an abrupt onset, short duration, and covers a broad frequency range up to 4 kHz to evoke responses from multiple nerve fibers.

Since the response emission contains the same frequencies as the stimuli, distinguishing the response emission can be challenging. Multiple repeated stimuli are required and averaged to distinguish the response emission from the initial stimulus. Response emissions are recorded at 2 to 23-millisecond latencies corresponding to the frequency of the stimulus. Higher frequencies propagate a shorter distance along the basilar membrane to the base and need a shorter latency, whereas lower frequencies travel further towards the cochlear apex and require a longer latency.

Stimulus-frequency OAE (SFOAE) is evoked by a single pure tone stimulus. However, the response emission occurs at the same frequency as the stimulus and is hard to distinguish from residual stimulus energy. Thus, there is limited clinical use for this technique.

Distortion-product OAE (DPOAE) is evoked using two simultaneous pure tone stimuli (f1 and f2). Unlike TEOAE, which provides an overall view of cochlear function across a broad range of frequencies, DPOAE can be customized to assess frequencies that match the patient’s audiogram and are more sensitive for detecting high-frequency hearing loss.

Studies have shown a stimulus level of 55 to 65 dB SPL intensity, 10 dB SPL difference between the two tones, the frequency range between 2000 Hz and 8000 Hz, and a frequency ratio (f2/f1) of 1.2 provides the best accuracy in separating normal hearing patients from those with hearing loss.

When measuring the DPOAE, the largest response emission should occur at the frequency calculated from the formula: 2f1-f2.
