Smoking is associated with an increased risk of surgical site infection and poor wound healing. All patients should undergo smoking cessation education and be smoke-free for at least 30 days before scar revision. Patients should have their glucose under control with blood glucose levels less than 180 mg/dL.

The patient should remain NPO after midnight if any sedation or general anesthesia is planned for the operation. Patients can take most, if not all, of their normal medications the morning of the procedure. Aseptic practice and sterile technique are necessary for all procedures.

It is essential to carefully plan the incision before making a cut. The surgeon should identify relaxed skin lines or the desired orientation of the scar. Preoperative marking should be placed appropriately toÂ correspond with these lines and ensure the skin edges will be closed successfully without tension.
