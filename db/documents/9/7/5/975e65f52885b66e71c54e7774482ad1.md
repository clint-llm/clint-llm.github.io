The rib cage surrounds the chest organs. This allows for additional protection against environmental influences but confers a higher difficulty for surgeons to reach the structures of interest. Surrounded by the ribs laterally, the sternum anteriorly, and the thoracic spine posteriorly, 2 compartments can be divided: the bilateral pleural and the mediastinal compartment. The pleural spaces contain both wings of the lung. The mediastinum encloses many structures such as the esophagus, the trachea, the vena cava superior and inferior, thoracic arteries, the vagus nerve, azygos vein, lymphatic vessels, thymic remnant and the pericardial sac containing the heart. The confined space of the pericardial sac poses the heart at risk for tamponade physiology. This occurs hematoma compresses the heart obstructing normal cardiac blood flow.

As blood flows through the 4 chambers of the heart, it passes 4 valves. Reaching the right atrium via the superior and inferior vena cava, blood passes through the tricuspid entering the right ventricle and pulmonary valve to be released into pulmonary circulation. The right heart is a low-pressure system compared to the left heart, which supplies the systemic circulation that requires more myocardial tissue to produce higher pressure. Blood is collected from the 4 pulmonary veins to enter the left atrium, passes through the mitral valve, the left ventricle, and the aortic valve into the systemic circulation.

All cardiac valves are surrounded by an annulus that poses difficulties for creating artificial grafts without leakage. To illustrate the importance of anatomy and physiology, the example of mitral valve replacement and the negative consequence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction can be named. While the aortic valve annulus is circular, the mitral valve annulus is more crescent-shaped requiring more sophisticated prosthesis and implantation technique. This is expressed by a plentitude of artificial valve models each having advantages and disadvantages regarding anatomic, physiologic, technical, and procedural characteristics. Having a closer look on the mitral valve the annulus and the anterior and posterior valve each consisting of 3 segments (A1 to A3 and P1 to P3) and are connected to the subvalvular apparatus which consists of chordae tendineae connecting the valve leaflet to the papillary muscles.

The heart has intrinsic rhythmic activity, that can be slowed or quickened through the influence of the autonomic nervous system with sympathetic reaction leading to accelerated heart rate and parasympathetic reaction leading to decelerated heart rate. The cardiac electrical conduction is structured hierarchically and runs from the sinus node through the right atrium to the atrioventricular node, the His bundle, and via the Purkinje fibers to the ventricles. The anatomic and physiologic role of the cardiac electrical activity is important to understand its clinical implications. Following cardiac surgery, atrial fibrillation is common. The Maze procedure applies anatomical knowledge to interrupt uncontrolled atrial activity for solving atrial fibrillation. The implantation of artificial heart valves can lead to atrioventricular blocking due to proximity to the valve area.

The quality of vessel grafts is important for the outcome of CABG surgery. Surgeons can harvest a variety of vessels. Arteries are of superior, long-term durability compared to veins.
