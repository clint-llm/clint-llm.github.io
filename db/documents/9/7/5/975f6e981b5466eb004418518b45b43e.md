Several chronic lung diseases such as COPD, cancer, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, severely affect the lungs via the cellular stress response. Smoke inhalation injures the cilia involved in the mucociliary escalator, allowing more and more particles into the lungs, activating the ISR.

Research has shown that heightened ER stress, a CHOP-dependent mechanism that leads to oxidative protein folding, has been seen in increased exposure to cigarette smoke in vitro, which thereby likely contributes to the COPD diagnosis.

Infections of the lungs resulting from several microorganisms that trigger the ISR. As mentioned above, PKR is triggered by dsRNA in viruses that inhibits protein translation and thereby stops the replication of the virus.
