Placental abruption is the early separation of the placenta from the lining of the uterus before the completion of the second stage of labor. It is one of the causes of bleeding during the second half of pregnancy and is a relatively rare but serious complication of pregnancy that places the well-being of both mother and fetus at risk. This activity describes the pathophysiology of placental abruption and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing affected patients.
