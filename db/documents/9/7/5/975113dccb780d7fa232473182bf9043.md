Kratom has only four known pharmacologically active compounds.

The half-life of mitragynine has an estimated half-life of 3 hours.

One of the important differences between opioids and the alkaloids in kratom is that they are pharmacologically and structurally different. Like opioids, the alkaloids from kratom initiate G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) signaling; however, the major difference is that the kratom alkaloids don't initiate the beta-arrestin pathway.
