During prone CPR, pressure injuries to the ribs, clavicles, scapula, shoulder joints, spine, and eyeballs are common. In addition, accidental endotracheal or tracheostomy tube dislodgements could occur during prone CPR, and the patient may have to be turned for re-intubation, which will adversely impact the quality of the CPR process. During surgical procedures, chest compressions may be challenging to perform in an open surgical field, and a counterforce on the sternum may be needed.
