A complete Circle of Willis is present in a minority of the population, with many physiologic variants containing duplicated, fenestrated, hypoplastic, or absent vessels in certain regions of the ring.

The most common variation in the CoW involves changes in the ACom. Examples include ACom duplication (up to 18% prevalence), fenestration (up to 21% prevalence), and an azygous ACA. An azygous ACA occurs when the two ACA vessels fuse to form a single, midline vessel, accompanied by the absence of the ACom; this occurs in up to 2% of the population.
