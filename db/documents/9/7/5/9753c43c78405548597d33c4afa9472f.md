The prognosis of spasticity can vary tremendously from patient to patient. If a patient’s spasticity responds well to treatment, whether physical modalities, therapy, or pharmacological intervention, the patient may carry a favorable prognosis in terms of managing the spasticity symptomatically. Additionally, as previously mentioned, spasticity may carry with it certain benefits for the patient, such as helping the patient with ambulation thereby preventing DVTs, maintaining muscle bulk, weight-bearing, and in turn preventing osteoporosis.
