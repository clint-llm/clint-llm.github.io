The cause of pericarditis is mostly idiopathic which makes up around 90% of cases. Other causes are infections caused by viruses, bacteria or tuberculosis.  Other causes could include neoplasms, a connective tissue disorder, renal failure, post-myocardial infarction (also known as Dressler syndrome), open heart surgery (also known as the postpericardiotomy syndrome) and drugs, especially procainamide and hydralazine.

Cardiac tamponade may be caused by the accumulation of pericardial fluid from either a transudate, exudate, or blood. Slow accumulation such as in infections such as tuberculosis or myocarditis, autoimmune diseases, neoplasms, uremia, and other inflammatory diseases are better tolerated than rapid accumulation as seen in hemorrhages such as from a penetrating wound to the heart, ventricular wall rupture after myocardial infarction (MI) or following a pacemaker insertion complication.
