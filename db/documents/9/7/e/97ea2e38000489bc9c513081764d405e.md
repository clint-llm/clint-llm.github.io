ERCP uses endoscopy to find the major and minor papillae. Cannulation is done, and contrast material is injected to identify the biliary and pancreatic ductal systems. During ERCP, diagnostic procedures can be done, namely cholangiopancreatoscopy, biopsy, or brush cytology. An intraductal ultrasound may also be done. Therapeutic uses include sphincterotomy, stent placement, and stone removal.

ERCP indications include obstructive jaundice, biliary or pancreatic ductal system disease treatment or tissue sampling, suspicion for pancreatic cancer, pancreatitis of unknown cause, manometry for sphincter of Oddi, nasobiliary drainage, biliary stenting for strictures and leakage, drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts, and balloon dilation of the duodenal papilla and ductal strictures. Sphincterotomy is indicated in cases of the sphincter of Oddi dysfunction or stenosis, difficulty with biliary stenting or accessing the pancreatic duct, biliary strictures, bile duct stones, bile sump syndrome following choledochoduodenostomy, choledochocele, and in poor surgical candidates with ampullary carcinoma.
