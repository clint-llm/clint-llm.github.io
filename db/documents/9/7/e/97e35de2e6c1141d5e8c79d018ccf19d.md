Although not often performed, the gold standard for the diagnosis of critical illness neuropathy remains electrodiagnostic testing, which includes nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography. This activity describes the invaluable electrodiagnostic findings of both nerve conduction tests as well as needle EMG studies and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating patients with ICU related critical illness neuropathy (CIN).

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for electrodiagnostic testing in critically ill patients.
- Describe the nerve conduction study findings in a patient with critical illness neuropathy. 
- Review the electromyographic findings in a patient with critical illness neuropathy. 
- Outline the importance of communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with critical illness neuropathy.
