In 1841, a British anatomist, Alfred Poland, discovered a rare congenital chest wall muscle deficiency that he later named Poland syndrome (PS). Poland syndrome most frequently involves unilateral underdevelopment or absence of chest wall muscle that is present at birth with some associated anomalies of the hand/upper extremity on the same side. Rarely, itÂ is found to have bilateral chest muscle deficiency involvement. Some even suggest an association with vascular, skeletal, and inner organ anomalies. There is extensive variation in the presentation of Poland syndrome, which can sometimes make it difficult to diagnose.
