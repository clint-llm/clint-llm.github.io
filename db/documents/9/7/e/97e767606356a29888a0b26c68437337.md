Due to their close proximity, the obturator muscles are clinically relevant when there is an injury to the hip, such as dislocation. Posterior hip dislocations are the most common type of hip dislocation. They are typically caused when a posteriorly directed force is applied to a flexed knee while the hip is flexed and adducted. This drives the femoral head posteriorly and causes dislocation of the hip. During dislocation, gluteal muscles and short external rotator muscles, such as the obturator internus, can be injured. However, the most common complications from posterior hip dislocation are avascular necrosis and sciatic nerve injury. The deep branch of the MCFA is the primary blood supply of the femoral head. Damage to this vessel dramatically increases the likelihood of avascular necrosis. Studies have shown that the obturator externus plays a vital role in the protection of the deep branch of the MCFA during hip dislocation in any direction.

In addition to becoming damaged as a result of hip dislocations, the obturator internus can also become strained from sports that involve kicking, tackling, and falling.

One study by Byrne et al. examined two cases of obturator internus strains and found that this strain can happen both acutely or as a result of overuse. Additionally, obturator internus strains can occur in association with adductor longus strains or independently.

The obturator externus bursa also has involvement in pathological conditions. A study performed by Robinson et al. analyzed eight cadaver hemipelvises and ten clinical patients with obturator externus bursa enlargement and associated intraarticular hip abnormality to better understand the anatomy of this bursa and its clinical significance.

Lastly, deep gluteal syndrome is a term used to describe the compression of the sciatic or pudendal nerve by a combination of gemelli-obturator syndrome, piriformis syndrome, ischiofemoral impingement syndrome, and proximal hamstring syndrome.

Gemelli-obturator syndrome occurs when the sciatic nerve becomes compressed between the gemellus muscles and obturator internus during passive hip rotation.
