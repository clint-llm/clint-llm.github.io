Postoperative ileus is an abnormal pattern of slow or absent gastrointestinal motility in response to surgical procedures. Clinically, it is manifested by intolerance of oral intake and abdominal distention due to inhibition of the gastrointestinal propulsion without signs of mechanical obstruction.

Prolonged impairment, however, can lead to several considerable impediments, including increased hospital stay, healthcare costs, and patient discomfort. It is estimated that the economic impact of postoperative ileus is approximately 750 million dollars annually in the United States alone.
