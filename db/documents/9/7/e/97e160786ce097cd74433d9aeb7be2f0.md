Up to 26% of the global population menstruates.Indications, 800 million people menstruate on any given day, and bothersome menstrual-related symptoms (heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, premenstrual syndrome, bloating, fatigue) impact up to 2.5 million people annually.

Negative symptoms associated with menses may lead to absenteeism from school or work, resulting in loss of education and income, decreased participation in social, athletic, professional, or recreational activities, embarrassment or social ostracization, excessive income spent on menstrual hygiene products like pads, tampons, menstrual cups, and panties, increased risk for genitourinary infections, and excessive blood loss and associated anemia. These consequences may disproportionately impact those living in poverty, adolescents, persons with developmental or physical disabilities, gender-diverse persons, military personnel, athletes, and persons with malignancy (see discussion of "period poverty" and "Special Populations" in Indications).

By utilizing menstrual suppression methods, amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea may be achieved, and the described negative impacts of menses may be mitigated (see discussion of the impact on special populations in Indications).

Rates of amenorrhea per method are as follows:

- OCPs: 88% by 12 months

- POPs: widely variable depending on formulation and dose, 10 to 76%

- DMPA: up to 71% by 2 years

- Levonorgestrel-releasing IUD: 50% by 12 months, 60% by 2 years

- Subdermal etonogestrel implant: 13 to 22%

- GnRH agonists: up to 96%

- Testosterone: undefined
