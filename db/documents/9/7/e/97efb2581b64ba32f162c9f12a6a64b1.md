Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus are the principal species that infect humans. Ancylostoma ceylanicum is currently considered a significant cause of zoonotic infections in some regions of Asia. However, it doesnâ€™t cause blood loss. Ancylostoma caninum, a dog hookworm, might cause enteritis and ileitis. Ancylostoma braziliense is the primary cause of cutaneous larva migrans.
