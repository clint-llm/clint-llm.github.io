Chronic pain affects a person's lifestyle due to its somatic and psychological effects. Hence, a multidisciplinary team consisting of a pain medicine specialist, an internist, and a psychiatrist should manage these patients. The condition is best addressed with potent analgesics like opioids, and regular follow-ups for theÂ side effects and changes in dosage as needed are required. Moreover, due to the fatal side effects of opioids, patients should be educated about the adverse signs and symptoms and the potential for drug abuse and dependence.
