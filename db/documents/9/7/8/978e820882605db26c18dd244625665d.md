Tracheal and laryngeal pathologies can be categorized into stenosis, infection, neoplasm, and aspiration.

The differentialÂ diagnosis for subglottic stenosis, more specifically, can be benign or malignant. Benign causes include diseases like posttraumatic status, infection and rheumatic disease, and tumors like papilloma, hemangioma, and granular cell tumor. Malignant differentials include squamous cell carcinoma, chondrosarcoma, and laryngeal lymphoma.
