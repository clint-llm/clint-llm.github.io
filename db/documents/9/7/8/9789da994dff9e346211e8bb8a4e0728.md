The number one reported side-effect of glatiramer acetate is injection site reaction, which manifests as a lump at the subcutaneous injection site. Approximately 10% of patients will report fever, chills, and aches. In addition, many patients note a transient episode of flushing, shortness of breath, and palpitations which self resolves within 30 minutes.

Less than 1% of patients will develop lipoatrophy, a visible dent at the injection site due to local necrosis of adipose tissue.

Serious but rare side effects to various organ systems, including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematopoietic, lymphatic, musculoskeletal, nervous, and urogenital systems, have been noted, as has Jessner lymphocytic infiltrate, a cutaneous condition characterized by a persistent papule or plaque eruption.
