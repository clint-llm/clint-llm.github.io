The anatomy relevant to the biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch includes the stomach, the surrounding structures, and the vascular supply from the superior mesenteric artery and celiac trunk.

**Stomach**

The stomach is a muscular tube that begins at the gastroesophageal junction. It extends from the lower esophageal sphincter to the first portion of the duodenum. It is divided into five portions, which include the cardia, which is the portion distal to the GE junction. The fundus abuts the left diaphragm, body, antrum, and pylorus, which is the most distal portion entering the duodenum. The greater curvature is the long left lateral border of the stomach, which extends from the fundus to the pylorus.  The greater curvature is connected to the greater omentum.  The lesser curvature is beneath the liver and has the incisura angularis, which is the transition point from the body of the stomach to the antrum. Posterior to the stomach lies the lesser sac, which contains the pancreas.

**Ligaments**

Gastropherenic ligament- connects the fundus to the left hemidiaphragm

Gastrohepatic ligament- connects the lesser curvature to the medial liver edge. The left and right gastric arteries run within the gastrohepatic ligament.

Gastrosplenic ligament- connects the greater curvature to the spleen and contains the short gastric vessels.

Gastrocolic ligament- connects the inferior stomach to the transverse colon and is part of the greater omentum. The gastroepiploic vessels can be found within the gastrocolic ligament.

**Vascular Supply**

The celiac artery has three major branches; the left gastric, the common hepatic, and the splenic arteries.  The left gastric artery is located on the superior lesser curvature and combines with the right gastric artery. The common hepatic artery gives off the gastroduodenal artery, which runs behind the first portion of the duodenum. After the gastroduodenal artery comes off, the common hepatic artery becomes the proper hepatic artery. The right gastric artery is a typical branch off of the proper hepatic artery and joins the left gastric artery on the lesser curvature. The gastroduodenal artery gives off the right gastroepiploic artery and runs along the greater curvature to combine with the left gastroepiploic artery. The left gastroepiploic artery originates off of the splenic artery. The splenic artery also gives off the short gastric arteries, which can be found in the gastrosplenic ligament, which is connected to the gastric fundus.

**Physiology**

Important hormones that are directly impacted by Bariatric surgery that have a significant impact on patients' weight loss and outcomes are leptin, incretins (GIP and GLP1), ghrelin, and insulin.

Ghrelin is a peptide hormone produced by ghrelinergic cells in the GI tract and functions as a neuropeptide in the central nervous system.

Leptin is a hormone that is made by adipose cells and enterocytes. White adipose tissue is the main source of circulating leptin and adiponectin. Leptins' main function is to regulate energy balance by controlling hunger and fat storage. Leptin circulates at concentrations proportional to fat mass and inhibits food intake. In obesity, leptin levels are elevated, mainly because of an increase in adipose tissue mass.

With obesity, there is a decreased sensitivity to leptin, which results in an inability to achieve satiety. In starvation, leptin falls, it crosses the blood-brain barrier to act via its receptor to inhibit orexigenic and stimulate anorexigenic neuropeptides.

Incretin hormones such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptides and glucagon-like peptide 1 are secreted respectively from the upper duodenum K cells and the ileum L cells.

Insulin is an amino acid peptide hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreatic islets. Insulin regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and protein. It is the main anabolic hormone of the body. It regulates the absorption of glucose from the blood and regulates the metabolism of glycogen in the liver and skeletal muscles. Glucose production and secretion by the liver are inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood.

Decreased insulin sensitivity leads to diabetes mellitus and obesity. It has been shown that insulin sensitivity improves with all types of bariatric surgery. Hepatic insulin sensitivity has been shown to improve within days of the procedures, increased peripheral sensitivity follows after.
