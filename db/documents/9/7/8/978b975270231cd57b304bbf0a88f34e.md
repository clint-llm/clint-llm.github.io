The prognosis of BAO depends on the severity of the stroke, time to LKN, the treatment offered, successful recanalization, and access to tertiary care hospitals and comprehensive stroke centers. Overall, mortality is very high in this population; patients with successful recanalization after thrombectomy has a lower mortality rate of 33 to 50% versus 74 to 100% in patients without thrombectomy or failed reperfusion.

The pre-endovascular treatment diffusion-weighted imaging cerebellar infarct volume is an independent predictor of 90-day mortality.
