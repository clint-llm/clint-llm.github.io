The most commonly recognized forms of diabetes mellitus include type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disorder, and type 2 diabetes, a polygenic disorder influenced by both genetics and environment. Now, it is understood that more than just 2 forms of diabetes exist, although hybrid forms occur much less frequently. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a type of monogenic diabetes first described as a mild and asymptomatic form of diabetes that was observed in non-obese children, adolescents, and young adults. Improvement in blood glucose levels has been observed with sulfonylurea treatment. With the expansion of genetic technology, many genes linked to MODY have been sequenced and described. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of MODY and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of mature onset diabetes of the young. 
- Summarize the history and physical exam findings typically seen in patients with mature onset diabetes of the young. 
- Describe the management considerations and treatment choices for mature onset diabetes of the young.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve clinical outcomes for patients affected by mature onset diabetes of the young.
