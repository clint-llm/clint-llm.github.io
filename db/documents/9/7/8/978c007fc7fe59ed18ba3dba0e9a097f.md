Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, hence, toxicity is possible, although rarely noted. Hypervitaminosis D results from excess oral intake and not due to excessive sunlight exposure. Toxicity has been reported at a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of more than 88 ng/mL. Acute intoxication can lead to acute hypercalcemia that can cause confusion, anorexia, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, and muscle weakness. Chronic intoxication can lead to nephrocalcinosis and bone pain.
