The capillary unit possesses a vital role in allowing the exchange of metabolites between the vascular system and tissues. Capillaries have a unique morphology, consisting of only a single layer of endothelium, enabling them to carry out their function in delivering needed nutrients to organs and tissues. Furthermore, despite the thin diameter of capillaries, they are the most numerous of the vessel types and thus possess the highest total surface area enhancing overall exchange.
