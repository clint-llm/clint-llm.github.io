Conservative management is used asÂ first-line therapy to treat facet-mediated pain. Anti-inflammatory medications, weight loss, muscle relaxers, physical therapy, and massage are therapies used in conjunction with one another as a multimodal approach to treating the pain. When conservative measures fail, interventional procedures are considered to reduce pain, improve functionality and reduce side effects from medications.

There are currently no guidelines available to support arthrodesis when interventional procedures fail to provide pain relief. Surgery may be indicated for grade I or grade II spondylolisthesis; however, this is not first-line management and may not result in the reduction of pain.
