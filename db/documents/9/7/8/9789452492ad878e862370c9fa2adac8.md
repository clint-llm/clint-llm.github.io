Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a rare systemic vascular disease, affecting younger women and accounting for 10% to 20% of the cases of renal artery stenosis. FMD is an idiopathic, non-inflammatory, non-atherosclerotic disease commonly involving renal and carotid arteries; however, it can affect any arterial bed. FMD classically presents as renovascular hypertension but can also manifest as stroke in young adults. Early diagnosis and treatment are important for a long-term prognosis. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and presentation of fibromuscular dysplasia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of fibromuscular dysplasia.
- Describe the presentation of fibromuscular dysplasia.
- Summarize the treatment of fibromuscular dysplasia.
- Outine the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by fibromuscular dysplasia.
