While BLT can be used in any region of the body. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of sacroiliac and lumbosacral somatic dysfunctions and highlights the role of interprofessional teams in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**

- Outline the management considerations for patients with absolute contraindications to using BLT in the pelvis.
- Describe the common treatments using BLT to address somatic dysfunction in the pelvis as discussed in this article.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by pelvic somatic dysfunction.
