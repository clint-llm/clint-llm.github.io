Although testosterone is considered a predominant male sex hormone, not all tissues are responsive to testosterone. The 5 alpha-RD2 enzyme converts testosterone into a more potent form of the male sex hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). During male fetal development, testosterone and DHT have a specific predetermined role in sexual development. Testosterone is the driver for the development of male internal genitalia, including the Wolffian duct, whereas DHT has a role in the genesis of male external genitalia. At puberty, testosterone is responsible for aggressive psychosexual behavior, deepening of the voice, increased muscleÂ mass, and initiating spermatogenesis. On the contrary, DHT has a role in the development of the prostate and male pattern of hair growth at the time of puberty.
