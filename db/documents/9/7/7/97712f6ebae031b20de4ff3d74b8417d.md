The pathophysiology of zinc toxicity relates to the route of exposure and the dose delivered. Additionally, toxicity from acute exposure differs significantly from chronic toxicity.

Acute toxic ingestions of zinc sulfate and concentrated zinc chloride will primarily cause gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including hematemesis, due to their direct caustic effects. Renal injury, ranging from asymptomatic hematuria to interstitial nephritis or acute tubular necrosis, has also been reported. ARDS, liver necrosis, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and even death have been reported from acute exposures, though primarily due to iatrogenic parenteral administration of toxic doses.

With chronic GI exposures, bone marrow and neurologic effects can also manifest. Chronic ingestion of zinc and resultant copper deficiency can lead to sideroblastic anemia, granulocytopenia,Â and myelodysplastic syndrome.
