A review of 50 published reports of ulnar nerve compression suggests that patients with a minimal degree of compression can have an excellent outcome 50% of the time with non-operative techniques such as anti-inflammatories, external padding, and positional modification. Surgical intervention results in nearly 100% relief of symptoms, provided the location of nerve compression is properly identified and released with anterior transposition of the nerve where appropriate.
