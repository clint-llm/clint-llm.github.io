Turtle and hypnic headaches can last for years. Fortunately, a large portion of patients who suffer from this condition does well with treatment. A systematic review identified 70 plus patients with hypnic headaches who had follow-up ranging from six months to five years. This study found that 47% of patients had no remission of headaches. 43% had remission after undergoing treatment. 7% had a relapse after remission, and 3% had spontaneous remission.
