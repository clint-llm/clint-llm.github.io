Donepezil hydrochloride is a piperidine derivative and a centrally acting, rapid, reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that degrades acetylcholine after release from the presynapse. Donepezil binds reversibly to acetylcholinesterase and inhibits the hydrolysis of acetylcholine, thus increasing the availability of acetylcholine at the synapses, enhancing cholinergic transmission. Some in vitro data has suggested that the anticholinesterase activity of donepezil is relatively specific for acetylcholinesterase in the brain. It is structurally unrelated to other anticholinesterase agents like tacrine and physostigmine.

Some noncholinergic mechanisms have also been proposed. Donepezil upregulates the nicotinic receptors in the cortical neurons, adding to neuroprotective property. It inhibits voltage-activated sodium currents reversibly and delays rectifier potassium currents and fast transient potassium currents, although this action is unlikely to contribute to clinical effects.
