Infections of the hand may arise in a myriad of ways, but most frequently occur due to direct inoculation and contiguous spread to adjacent structures after a traumatic injury.

Numerous bacterial and fungal pathogens have been isolated from infections of the hand. Staphylococcus aureus is cited as the overall most common microorganism causing infections of the hand, followed by Streptococcus species.Staphylococcus aureus is increasingly being identified, especially in urban communities, with some studies suggesting it may account for around 50% of hand infections in this setting.Eikenella corrodens and Pasteurella multocida are identified frequently in human and animal bites, respectively.Group A, B-hemolytic Streptococcus, is cited as being the most common, single organism isolated in cases of necrotizing soft tissue infections.Candida albicans.

Atypical infections with nontuberculous mycobacterial species, such as Mycobacterium marinum or Vibrio spp may cause soft tissue infections of the hand after injury occurring in aquatic environments.Mycobacterium avium, can cause infection in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Frequently these infections are insidious, and diagnosis is delayed.
