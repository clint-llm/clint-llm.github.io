Prognosis depends most heavily on the extent of the initial injury with mild-moderate ingestions having the most favorable prognoses and severe ingestions requiring emergency surgery having the most complications. Grade III injury or above, involves emergency surgery immediately and follow-up care. Patients tend to doÂ worse if they require surgery, and complications are high such as mediastinitis and perforation.

An extremely important topic that the surgical team should discuss with the patient before radical resection or esophageal reconstruction is the quality of life after such surgical procedures. In one study, there were significant drops in quality of life scores compared to normal populations. This should not dictate whether surgery is performed or not, but discussing with and priming the patient for potential problems is paramount.
