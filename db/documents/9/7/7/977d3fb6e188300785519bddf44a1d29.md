The deep peroneal nerve, also called the deep fibular nerve, innervates the tibialis anterior muscle. The deep peroneal nerve is one of two terminal branches at the bifurcation of the common peroneal (fibular) nerve. The other branch is the superficial peroneal (fibular) nerve, which innervates the muscles of the lateral compartment of the leg. The common peroneal nerve itself derives from the terminating bifurcation of the sciatic nerve at the apex of the popliteal fossa; the other terminal branch is the tibial nerve. Spinal nerves L4 through S1 comprise the common peroneal nerve. This nerve wraps around the neck of the fibula and passes between the attachments of the fibularis longus before giving rise to the superficial peroneal nerve and deep peroneal nerve.

The deep peroneal nerve travels with the anterior tibial artery in an inferomedial direction to innervate all four muscles in the anterior compartment of the leg. Both the nerve and the artery pass between the tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus proximally and between the tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus distally. The nerve then travels beneath the extensor retinaculum as it crosses the ankle joint; it terminates in the dorsum of the foot, dividing into a lateral branch and a medial branch.
