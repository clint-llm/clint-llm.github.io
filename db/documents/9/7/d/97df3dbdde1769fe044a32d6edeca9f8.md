**Laboratory Evaluation**

All the laboratory values are non-specific and are only used to detect the underlying conditions. The preferred labs are listed as follows:

- Complete blood count (CBC) and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) to rule out protein-calorie malnutrition

- Assessment of ACTH, cortisol, ACTH stimulation test is of prime importance in patients with Allgrove syndrome to diagnose adrenal insufficiency.

- Aldosterone and renin levels can detect mineralocorticoid deficiency.

- Determination of anti-adrenal antibodies can help in identifying Addison disease.

- Lumbar puncture and baseline blood glucose can clue towards the underlying cause for seizures.

- Esophageal motility tests are pertinent in patients presenting with signs and symptoms of achalasia.

**Other Diagnostic Modalities**

- Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of Brain is preferred in patients presenting with seizures or other neurological symptoms.

- Barium esophagogram is a preferred modality in patients having achalasia. Other alternatives include esophageal manometry and endoscopy

- Ophthalmological evaluation for alacrima includes a Schirmer test, slit-lamp examination, and fluorescein staining.

- Brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) testing is helpful in patients having hearing deficits.
