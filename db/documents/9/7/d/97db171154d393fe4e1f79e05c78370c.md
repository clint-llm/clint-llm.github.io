Informed consent from the patient or the patientâ€™s legal guardian must be obtained before the procedure. Risks including bleeding, pain and possible scar formation should be relayed. The verification of tetanus immunization status is also an important step in preparation.

The clinician performing the procedure should follow universal precautions that include wearing a gown, gloves, and a facemask or goggles for protection. Although I&D is not considered a sterile procedure (given that the area of interest is already infected), it is prudent to practice sterile precautions.
