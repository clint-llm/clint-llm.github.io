The main function of the biceps muscle is forearm supination and elbow flexion. The biceps also contribute 10 percent of the total power in shoulder abduction when the arm is in external rotation. Consequently, biceps tendinitis, a condition describing inflammation of the tendon that attaches the biceps muscle to the bone, can impair patients' ability to perform many routine activities. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and treatment of biceps tendinitis and underscores the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of biceps tendinitis.
- Describe the history and physical exam of a patient with biceps tendinitis.
- Summarize the treatment options for biceps tendinitis.
- Describe how enhanced coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid recognition of biceps tendinitis and subsequently improve the evaluation, enhancing detection of pathology and allowing for treatment when indicated.
