The four major factors that influence bone healing are biomechanics, osteogenic cells, scaffolds, and growth factors. In some circumstances, this process does not go as expected, and healing does not occur without additional intervention. A diagnosis of nonunion can typically be made when there is no evidence of progression of the healing process for 3 months or no healing after 9 months from the time of injury. This activity reviews the risk factors, evaluation, and management of tibial nonunion and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of tibial nonunion. 
- Review risk factors for tibial nonunion.
- Identify management strategies for tibial nonunion. 
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by tibial nonunion.
