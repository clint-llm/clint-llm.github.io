There is no cure for Noonan syndrome as it is a genetically inherited disease. Management of Noonan syndrome is targeted toward symptomatic improvement and supportive care. Interprofessional care is often needed; multiple organ systems are to be addressed. Hearing tests and ophthalmic exams are appropriate throughout childhood. In males with cryptorchidism, orchiopexy should be performedÂ when the child is around one-year-old if the testes have not descended to reduce the risk of development of testicular cancer in adulthood.

For congenital heart defects, an echo and ECG should be obtained. Even in patients without a diagnosis of cardiac defects, a cardiac evaluation is needed every five years. Short stature can be evaluated for the treatment of growth hormone. Appropriate supportive measures can be used to target lymphedema.
