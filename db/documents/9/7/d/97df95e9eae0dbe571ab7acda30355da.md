The treatment of vernal keratoconjunctivitis depends on the extent and severity of the disease at the time of presentation. The management may vary from conservative treatment to surgical interventions.

**Conservative treatment –**The foremost step in managing these patients shall be an attempt to remove any possible allergens in the patient’s surroundings. Cold compresses have a soothing effect.

**Medical treatment –**In cases with moderate severity, topical mast cell stabilizers like sodium cromoglycate (2%), sodium nedocromil (2%), lodoxamide are helpful.

Dual-action drops with H-1 blockers and mast cell stabilizers are preferred for moderate to severe diseases. These give the advantage of the immediate onset of action and have a long-term disease-modifying action. Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have also shown a beneficial effect in patients with VKC.

Topical corticosteroids, especially low absorptions steroids like fluorometholone, loteprednol, remexolone, are safe alternatives. Severe cases might need more robust alternatives like dexamethasone or betamethasone. Topical steroids need a quick taper and close monitoring for intraocular pressure.

For patients with recurrent episodes, steroid-sparing agents are a better alternative. Topical immunomodulators like cyclosporin (0.05 to 2%) and tacrolimus (0.1%) are the most commonly used in this class.

Systemic treatment may be necessary for a few patients with VKC. These may be particularly useful in patients with a history of an associated atopic disease like atopic dermatitis or asthma. Drugs like montelukast, a leukotriene receptor inhibitor, which acts by inhibiting interleukin-10 helpful in treating asthma, have demonstrated benefits by reducing signs and symptoms among VKC patients.
