Patients should be educated that eating foods that are high in fiber can soften stools naturally and improve some symptoms. The use of fiber supplements, including psyllium, can help improve symptoms. Patients should also attempt to avoid caffeine, smoking, complex sugars, and alcohol, as these can worsen diarrhea and lead to worsening pain and bleeding. Patients should also be educated that if the bleeding is excessive or they experience symptoms of dizziness and weakness, they should seek immediate medical attention.
