Hearing loss can be broadly characterized as congenital or acquired in the pediatric population.

**Congenital Causes**

Congenital hearing loss can be classified as genetic and non-genetic in etiology. The former category is responsible for greater than half of congenital causes and can be due to either an autosomal dominant, recessive or sex-linked mutation.

TORCH organisms (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes) have been identified as key infective causative agents. CMV is the most common cause of congenital non-genetic hearing loss in the developed world. Other congenital causes include trauma, ototoxic medications used in the antenatal period and several perinatal risk factors such as prematurity, low birth weight, and hyperbilirubinemia.

**Acquired Hearing Loss**

Otitis media with effusion is the number one cause of acquired hearing loss in children. It is beyond the scope of this article to cover this in detail, but it classically has a bimodal beak at 2 years and 5 years of age and is characterized by a conductive hearing loss associated with flattened tympanogram.

High-risk factors in neonates:

- Congenital infections

- Family history

- Craniofacial anomalies

- Hyperbilirubinemia

- Birth weight 1500 g

- Low Apgar

- Bacterial meningitis

- Need to prolonged intubatio
