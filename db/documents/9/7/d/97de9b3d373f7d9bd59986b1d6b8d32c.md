The primary function of the uterus is reproductive. The principal elements of uterine physiology are the endometrium and myometrium. The uterus accepts the ovum after fertilization, holds and provides nutrients and oxygen for the fetus and during birth, and it contracts to cause delivery. The uterus is a hormone-sensitive organ: differentiation, proliferation, exfoliation of the endometrium, and contraction during childbirth get regulated by the interaction between itself and the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and ovaries.
