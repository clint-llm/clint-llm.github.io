Scorpaenidae envenomation results in physiologic changes that are well studied. In an experimental rodent model, the venoms cause vasodilation, hypotension, muscular weakness, and neuromuscular paralysis. In humans, initial symptoms include intense burning pain at the puncture site, and systemic symptoms may include the following: a headache, weakness, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hypotension, chest pain, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, syncope, and even pulmonary edema.
