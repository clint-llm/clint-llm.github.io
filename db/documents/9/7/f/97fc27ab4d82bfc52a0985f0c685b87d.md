Chronic CSCR cases, if not treated, can have complications. Chronic CSCR with PED can develop RPE rip with secondary exudative retinal detachment. Such patients complain of sudden diminution of vision. Other complications can be CNVM and macular degeneration. Diffuse retinal pigment epitheliopathy in CSCR may be the cause of the irreversible visual decline.
