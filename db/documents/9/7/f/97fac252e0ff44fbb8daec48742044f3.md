Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), also known as ERBB, ERBB1, HER1, NISBD2, PIG61, andÂ mENA, is a transmembrane glycoprotein with an intracellular tyrosine kinase that serves as a receptor for extracellular protein ligands. EGFR was the first member of the ErbB receptor family to be described. The ErbB receptors are a subfamily of four tyrosine kinase receptors including EGFR, HER-2/neu, HER-3, and HER-4. Ten different ligands can selectively bind to each receptor, and ligand binding leads to downstream pathways involved in cellular growth and proliferation as well as differentiation.

EGFR overexpression is involved in multiple tumors and is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease. The pathologies associated with EGFRs have led to novel treatment modalities, including monoclonal antibodies designed to inhibit EGFR signaling.
