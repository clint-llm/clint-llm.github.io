The following pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to define the main reason for rhabdomyolysis occurring in polymyositis.

Direct damage due to the cellular immune response that develops as a result of abnormal activation of cytotoxic T cells (CD8) and macrophages with some involvement of type B lymphocytes and dendritic cells.

Indirectly, damage can happen due to the release of inflammatory mediators in circulation by the cells such as cytokines and interleukins. A study reported a significant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-21, both in the muscle and serum of affected patients, along with the increased expression of IL-21 receptors (IL-21R) in damaged muscle fibers in these patients.

In addition to causing direct damage, certain cytokines such as IL-1alpha and IL-17 also upregulate the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway to increase MHC-1 class expression. NF-kappaB also damages myofibrils by affecting the myocytes' differentiating ability negatively.

Other possible pathological causes for polymyositis include damage to vascular endothelium leading to extravasation of inflammatory mediators from circulation as well as the involvement of humoral immune response depending on the presence of certain antibodies.
