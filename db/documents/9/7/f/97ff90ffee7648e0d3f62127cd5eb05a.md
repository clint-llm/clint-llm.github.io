Nebivolol is an FDA-approved medication for hypertension. All interprofessional healthcare team members must be aware and up to date on the indications, interactions, adverse effects, and other pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic factors that can affect successful therapy implementation and lead to improved patient outcomes.

If an overdose is intentional, a psychiatrist consultation should be obtained. If the interprofessional teamwork of MDs, DOs, PAs, NPs, and pharmacists is in place, nebivolol therapy has its best chance for therapeutic success with minimal adverse events. Study finding suggests thatÂ direct care provided by medical toxicologists has been shown to reduce the length of stay and decrease healthcare utilization in drug-related overdose.
