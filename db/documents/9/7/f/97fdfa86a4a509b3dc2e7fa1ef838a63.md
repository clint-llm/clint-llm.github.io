Doxycycline is the drug of choice for the treatment of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, including in children. Defervescence typically occurs within three days of starting appropriate antibiotic therapy, although other symptoms may be slower to resolve. The treatment course is usually seven to ten days, or for at least three days after defervescence. It is important to note than in severe rickettsial disease, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, mortality rates are as high as 20% to 30% without prompt antibiotic treatment. Thus, treatment should not delay while awaiting confirmatory laboratory testing in a patient with a suspected rickettsial infection; this is particularly important in children, who are at high risk of morbidity and mortality but may experience delays in treatment due to concerns with doxycycline use in children younger than age 8. The risk of dental staining in the treatment of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is very low, as dental staining is a cumulative dose effect, and treatment for Rocky Mountain spotted fever is typically seven to ten days. Thus, concerns regarding tooth staining should not delay treatment in suspected Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
