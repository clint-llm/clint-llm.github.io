Phalanx fractures of the hand are often related to blunt, penetrating, or crush trauma; however, pathologic causes such as tumor and infection cannot be overlooked.

Bending forces to the phalanx shaft tend to produce transverse fractures while torsional and angular forces produce spiral and oblique fractures. In general, crushing injuries produce significant comminution in fractures. Intra-articular fractures are often caused by axial loading but can also be caused by avulsion of tendinous insertion sites causing angular patterns.
