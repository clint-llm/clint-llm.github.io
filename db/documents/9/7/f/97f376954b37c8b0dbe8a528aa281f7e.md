Critical elements pertinent to the differential diagnosis of CPN injury entail discerning the following:

- Chronicity of the injury

- Acute, subacute, or chronic

- Injury location

- CPN injury can occur proximally about the hip (e.g., acetabular fracture, posterior hip dislocation), at the knee/fibular head/neck, or more distally in the SPN or DPN distributions

- Underlying etiology

- Traumatic injuries (fracture/dislocations)
- Atraumatic mechanisms

- Systemic or inflammatory conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus)


- Iatrogenic causes
- External (splint/cast) or internal (anatomic) sources of compression

Other clinical entities/pathologies that can mimic these types of presentations can include, but are not limited to:

- PeronealÂ tendon pathology

- Other compressive neuropathies

- Tarsal tunnel syndrome
- Anterior tarsal tunnel syndrome
- Nonspecific tendinitis affecting lower limb muscles/tendons

- Chronic ankle pain
