Choking is the blockage or hindrance of respiration by a foreign body obstruction in the airway.

Several factors make children especially prone to choking. A child’s airway is much smaller than that of an adult. Since air resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional radius to the fourth power (Poiseuille's law), a small object can have a drastic effect on a child’s ability to breathe. A child does not generate the same force when coughing as an adult, so their efforts may not be enough to dislodge a foreign body.

Round foods are more likely to cause fatal choking in children, with hot dogs being the most common, followed by candy, nuts, and grapes.

For adults, autopsy results from 200 choking victims showed meat, fish, and sausage to be responsible for death in 71% of cases followed by bread and bread products (12%) and fruits and vegetables (7%).
