Erythropoiesis is the physiological process that leads to the production and maintenance of RBC mass. This process is regulated by a variety of hormones, receptors, and factors.

Red blood cells are essential for oxygen transport. An increase in RBC mass will lead to increased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Patients with secondary polycythemia due to a physiologically appropriate response require higher RBC mass than normal for a proper tissue oxygen delivery.

It has been reported that a hematocrit higher than 45% is associated with hyperviscosity in normovolemic subjects. A hematocrit higher than 45% has also been associated with decreased cerebral blood flow, which is corrected after phlebotomy. There is a fine balance between the hyperviscosity and normal tissue oxygenation in such patients; that is the therapeutic goal.
