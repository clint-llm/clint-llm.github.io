The peroneus quartus muscle is the most common anatomical variant of the lateral leg compartment, reported in between 5% and 20% of individuals.

Variations in the retro-malleolar groove can predispose the peroneal tendons to tear and dislocation. Imaging and cadaveric studies demonstrate smooth, concave retro-malleolar grooves in approximately 80% of people, whereas a flat groove was seen in 11% and a convex groove in 7% of individuals.

Another known variation in the anatomy of the peroneus brevis muscle is a low-lying muscle belly, defined as the peroneus brevis being beyond the expected end of the muscle belly at approximately 2 cm above the distal fibular tip.

There are also many reported variations of the insertional anatomy of the peroneus brevis tendon at the fifth metatarsal. Cadaveric studies have identified six insertion types (Ia, Ib, IIa, IIb, IIIa, IIIb). Types Ia and Ib are the most common, describing a single insertion at the inferior part of the lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal and a widened insertion encompassing the entire lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal, respectively.
