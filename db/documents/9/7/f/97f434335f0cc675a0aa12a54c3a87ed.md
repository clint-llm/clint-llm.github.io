Recommended evaluation of the patient with mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome:

**Complete Physical Examination**

- Type and extent of skin lesions, with an estimation of body surface area, must be noted. Look for ulceration in the lesions.

- For lesions in the tumor stage, evaluate the number, size, and sites of the lesions.

- Look for lymphadenopathy and organomegaly.

**Skin biopsy**

- The biopsy site must be chosen carefully. Usually, the most indurated area is selected.

- Immunophenotyping for the following markers is performed: CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, and a B-cell marker like CD20.

- Evaluation for clonality of TCR gene rearrangement

****Blood tests****

- CBC, liver function tests, LDH, etc.

- TCR gene rearrangement.

- Abnormal lymphocyte evaluation may be performed by Sezary cell count with the determination of the absolute number of Sezary cells and flow cytometry.

******Radiologic tests******

- Chest X-rays, ultrasounds of peripheral nodal groups, chest CTs, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET scans, and MRIs may be performed to evaluate for any potential lymphadenopathy or visceral involvement, depending upon the stage of the disease.

********Lymph Node Biopsy********

- In clinically suspicious lymph nodes, such as firm, irregular, or fixed nodes, or large nodes of diameter greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in diameter, an excisional biopsy may be performed. It is performed from the largest draining lymph node or as guided by an FDG-PET, the node with the highest standardized uptake value (SUV).

- Cervical lymph nodes are the preferred sites, followed by axillary and then inguinal. The biopsy specimen is analyzed for histopathological examination, flow cytometry, and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement.
