There are several rare but important pathological variations of the configuration of the great vessels that may require cardiac surgery in the neonatal period or later in life as a life-saving intervention or improve quality of life. Failure of some of these procedures may ultimately lead to patients with these conditions requiring further cardiac surgery

**Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA)**

This condition has a prevalence of 0.2 per 1000 live births. In patients with TGA, there exists a ventriculoarterial discordance; in other words, the aorta arises from the morphological right ventricle instead of the left ventricle, and left ventricle instead gives rise to the pulmonary artery**.**

**Truncus Arteriosus (TA)**

TA represents approximately 3% of all congenital heart disease, presenting with a single outflow tract from the ventricles to the pulmonary, coronary, and systemic circulation

**Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)**

A patent ductus arteriosus estimates to occur in 1 in 2000 births

**Pulmonary artery sling**

This rare condition involves the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk in which the left pulmonary artery instead arises from the right pulmonary artery and, as a result, passes posterior to the trachea, forming a vascular sling
