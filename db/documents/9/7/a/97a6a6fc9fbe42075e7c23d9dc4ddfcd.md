Treatment of acute bronchopulmonary aspergillosis consists of a glucocorticoid regimen plus itraconazole. Voriconazole is another alternative in cases where itraconazole is not well tolerated. Systemic glucocorticoids are the mainstay of treatment followed by a slow oral taper over the course of 3 months. The initial dose of prednisone is usually 0.5 mg/kg.

Monitoring consists of measuring serum total IgE every 1 to 2 months.

In poorly controlled patients, asthma studies have shown that omalizumab a humanized monoclonal antibody against IgE have suggested benefits in patients without cystic fibrosis.

Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis treatment varies with the manifestations of the disease in the wide range previously described and patient's pulmonary status:

- Aspergilloma: surgical resection with or without embolization can be considered in patients with limited disease and good respiratory function to prevent hemoptysis, along with pre and postoperative antifungal therapy such as Voriconazole to avoid pleural aspergillosis. However, patients with stable radiographic findings, asymptomatic, immunocompetent a conservative management guided by close monitoring is also a feasible option.

- Aspergillus nodules that have been resected to rule out lung cancer should not be treated with antifungal therapy unless the patient is symptomatic. Monitoring with imaging and serum antibody titers is recommended.

- Chronic cavitary/fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis: require antifungal treatment. Studies have been done with Itraconazole, Voriconazole, Posaconazole, Isavuconazole, Amphotericin B and Micafungin, leaving the latter 2 for severely ill patients who have failed azole therapy. Embolization is reserved for patients who develop hemoptysis. Treatment duration recommended is 6 months, however, if the disease progresses lifelong therapy may be warranted.

- Invasive aspergillosis treatment can either be monotherapy with voriconazole or in combination with an echinocandin. However, it is important to take into account the species of Aspergillus when choosing the right antifungal therapy. If there is no good response to the initial therapy or progression/deterioration of patient's status is noted then salvage therapy with other drug regimens such as isavuconazole, amphotericin B plus echinocandins should be considered. The length of treatment depends on the location of the infection with a minimum duration of 6 to 12 weeks that could be prolonged for months or years. Debridement of necrotic tissue might be required as adjunctive therapy in severe cases.
