A thorough history and physical, including pertinent questioning of social, environmental, and psychologic factors, are needed to identify imposter syndrome. A holistic approach to identifying and understanding the constellation of factors is critical because no standardized or externally validated diagnostic criteria exist.

The Clance Imposter Phenomenon Scale is the most commonly utilized diagnostic tool; it consists of 20 Likert-Scaled questions which have not been externally validated. Additional scales have been created, including the Harvey Impostor Phenomenon Scale, Young Imposter Scale, Leary Imposter Scale, and the Perceived Fradulance Scale.

Laboratory, radiographic, and other diagnostic testing is subject to a case-by-case basis by the evaluating clinician; these evaluations will likely have no clinical significance unless another condition is present concurrently.

Informal evaluation involves individual self-assessment and peers/mentors assessing one another. A detailed physical examination can rule out physical conditions with psychiatric manifestations. Additionally, some individuals with imposter syndrome could have psychosomatic symptoms, and a physical exam can address these symptoms.
