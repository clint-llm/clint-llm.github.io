Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is characterized by the clinical triad of micrognathia (mandibular hypoplasia), glossoptosis (downward displacement of the tongue), and upper airway obstruction. Clinically, this results in a small, underdeveloped mandible that causes the base of the tongue to fall back into the throat and can ultimately lead to upper airway compromise. It is commonly associated with cleft palate.
