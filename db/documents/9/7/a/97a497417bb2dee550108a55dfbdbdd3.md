Sensory deficits such as poor visual acuity or visual field cut, or hearing impairment and motor deficits (e.g., ataxia) need to be taken into consideration when assessing any of the above populations, as tests require visual and verbal input and sometimes writing or manual manipulation of stimuli.

Another issue is that of cross-cultural competence. Although beyond the scope of this article, neuropsychologists must ensure that patients have fluency with the language they are being tested. For example, if the language of test administration is English, and the patient's native language is Chinese Mandarin, a high level of English fluency is required by the patient in order to consider completing the evaluation in English. Even so, fluency in the language of testing does not necessarily eliminate the need for the patient to receive a bilingual evaluation in both their native and second languages. In cases where the patient is not fluent in the target language, it is highly advisable to refer the patient to a bilingual neuropsychologist who speaks both languages fluently and has experience working with bilingual individuals.  The use of interpreters and/or technicians who are bilingual may also be necessary in order to obtain valid test results and appropriately communicate with the patient during the duration of the evaluation and when providing feedback of results.
