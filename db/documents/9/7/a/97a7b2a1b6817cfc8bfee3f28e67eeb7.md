There has been insufficient evidence on whether probiotics are safe or not. There have been rare occurrences where patients who took probiotics were subject to fungemia, bacteremia, and endocarditis. Research has revealed the most documented probiotics to cause fungemia to be Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces boulardii. Studies also show that bacteremia and sepsis resulted from various Lactobacillus strains, S. boulardii, S. cerevisiae, Bacillus subtilis, and Bifidobacterium breve. Endocarditis caused by probiotics is on record to be caused by Lactobacillus and Streptococcus.
