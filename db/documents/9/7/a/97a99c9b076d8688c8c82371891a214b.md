Ovarian cystic teratomas can be associated with a wide spectrum of complications. Timely and accurate diagnosis significantly reduces morbidity and mortality. Common complications of cystic teratomas are listed below;

- **Torsion:**One of the well-established complications of ovarian tumors is its rotation around the pedicle (supportive ligament), compromising its own blood flow leading to gangrenous or hemorrhagic infarction. The torsion incidence ranges from 3 to 21 %, most commonly occurring in the group 5 to 15 cm in size.

- **Rupture:**Although not a very common occurrence, the risk of rupture is 1 to 4% in ovarian teratomas. Leakage of contents of the cyst-like sebaceous fluid, desquamated epithelial cells, bone, or teeth into the peritoneal cavity can lead to acute or chronic peritonitis.

- **Infection:**The risk of infection in cystic teratoma is about 1 to 4%. The route of infection can be hematogenous, lymphomatous, or by direct extension from the adjacent structures like intestines. Infection can also predispose the cyst to form adhesions or even rupture in severe cases.

- **Adhesions:**Occasionally, the cyst may become dependant on the blood supply of the omentum or surrounding structures by forming contralateral circulation and completely get detached from its pedicle, hence called “parasitic dermoid.” Chronic inflammation can lead to a worsening of adhesions, increasing the risk of intestinal obstruction.

- **Malignant transformation:**Malignant transformation has been reported to occur in 1 to 3% of all cases of cystic teratoma between 30 and 70 years of age, with a higher incidence in patients between 40 to 60 years of age. Of those, squamous cell carcinoma was the most common (50%).

- **Gliomatosis peritonei:**Implantation of glial tissue on the visceral or peritoneal lining in a metastatic manner appear as grey or white nodules, 1 to 3 mm in diameter, and are scattered throughout the peritoneal cavity. Due to their indistinguishable appearance from peritoneal carcinomatosis and tuberculous peritonitis, histological evaluation is necessary for diagnosis.****

- **Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)encephalitis:**An infrequent auto-immune complication may occur with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Anti-NMDAR antibodies target NMDA receptors resulting in the progressive decline of synaptic functions. Early recognition and prompt treatment with surgery improve the clinical outcome.
