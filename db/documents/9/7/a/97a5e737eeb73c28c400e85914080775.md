It is essential to educate patients on the main contributing risk factors to tackle the periodontal abscess causes:

- Oral hygiene: brushing twice a day along the gingival margins and using interdental aids helps to reduce plaque accumulation and bacterial load.

- Diabetes mellitus: educating patients on the bi-directional relationship between periodontitis and diabetes helps promote the importance of better diabetic control. Liaising with general medical practitioners can be beneficial in addressing this situation.

- Smoking: offering smoking cessation advice can help reduce the patientâ€™s risk of periodontitis, oral cancer, and general well-being.Family history: although an unmodifiable risk, awareness of susceptibility can motivate patients to maintain good oral hygiene and seek care earlier and more frequently.
