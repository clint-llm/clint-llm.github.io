The facial nerve formation starts in the third week of development. It is a nerve from the second branchial or pharyngeal arch. The muscles of the face also derive from this arch. These muscles include but are not limited to the occipitofrontal, stylohyoid, posterior belly of the digastric, stapedius, and auricular muscles. The facial nerve innervates all of these muscles. The chorda tympani, a branch of the facial nerve, begins to formate in embryos around week 5 of development.
