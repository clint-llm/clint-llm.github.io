Management of patients with MG undergoing surgery is a team effort that should involve the surgeon, anesthesia provider, pharmacy, and nursing staff. A thorough understanding of the patient's current health and disease status should be discussed between team members. Management of the patient's disease should be optimized prior to undergoing any procedure, and this begins with the patient's primary care provider or neurologist.

Informed consent should include discussing the increased likelihood for postoperative mechanical ventilation and ICU admission with the patient. Postanesthesia care unit staff are crucial for monitoring for signs and symptoms of cholinergic or myasthenic crisis postoperatively. Additionally, active management of airway secretions is important to reduce aspiration events postoperatively. A collaborative model with timely and accurate communication will ensure the safest and best possible perioperative care for patients with MG.
