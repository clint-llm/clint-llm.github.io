Etiologies of this condition cover a broad range that may be infectious, non-infectious, autoimmune, drug-induced, or idiopathic. Hepatic granulomas may be incidental findings but are more likely to be associated with an underlying systemic disorder. This activity provides a review of granulomatous hepatitis, including its etiologies, pathology, evaluation, management and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of granulomatous hepatitis.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation process for granulomatous hepatitis.
- Outline the management options for granulomatous hepatitis.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients with granulomatous hepatitis.
