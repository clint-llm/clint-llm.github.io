Hematuria is usually caused by a genitourinary disease although systemic diseases can also manifest with blood in the urine. HematuriaÂ is divided into glomerular and non-glomerular hematuria to help in evaluation and management.

Some common glomerular causes are:

- Alport syndrome

- Thin basement membrane disease

- Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis

- IgA nephropathy

- Pauci immune glomerulonephritis

- Lupus nephritis

- Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis

- Goodpasture syndrome

- Nephrotic syndrome

- Polycystic kidney disease

Non-glomerular causes include:

- Febrile illness

- Exercise

- Menstruation

- Nephrolithiasis

- Cystitis, urethritis, prostatitis

- Malignancy: renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, prostate cancer

- Genitourinary mucosal injury by instrumentation

- Trauma

- Bleeding tendency: thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, use of blood thinners, hematological disorders like sickle cell anemia.
