Central toxic keratopathy (CTK) was initially described as a complication of LASIK surgery, and the vast majority of published reports are associated with excimer laser ablation. This activity discusses the etiology, pathophysiology, and debated management by an interprofessional team of central toxic keratopathy (CTK) and its relation to diffuse lamellar keratitis (DLK). Additionally, it reviews physical exam findings and the prognosis of patients with CTK.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical clinical picture associated with central toxic keratopathy (CTK).
- Summarize the underlying pathophysiologic changes in CTK.
- Explain the various treatment regimens for CTK. Summarize the differential diagnosis in a patient with CTK.
- Review the role of the interprofessional team in the care of central toxic keratopathy.
