Fetal acidemia is most commonly a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis. An initial respiratory acidosis arises when uteroplacental or fetal circulation is impaired. With the ongoing impairment of oxygen delivery to the placenta and fetal tissues, the metabolism shifts towards anaerobic glycolysis, with subsequent additional metabolic acidosis. It is at this stage that acidosis becomes clinically significant.

Some experts define pathological acidosis as the level at which the risk of adverse sequelae arises. Interestingly, a pH as low as 7.00 is usually tolerated by the fetus without any adverse outcome.

When a pH less than 7.00 and/or a base deficit of more than 12 meq/L are associated with other abnormal findings such as abnormal fetal heart tracings, 5-minutes Apgar scores equal to or less than 5, a requirement for intubation, they become strong predictors of poor neurological sequelae.

In conclusion, cord blood gas analysis is a recommended procedure in all high-risk deliveries. A pH less than 7.00 in non-vigorous newborns strongly correlates with the development of neonatal encephalopathy. Identifying infants at risk is important for the early initiation of neuroprotective therapies.
