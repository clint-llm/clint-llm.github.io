The pronator teres has a synergistic pronation effect with the pronator quadratus, a square-shaped muscle that originates on the anteromedial ulna and travels perpendicular to the direction of the forearm to insert on the anterolateral radius. The radius is pulled toward and over the ulna during contraction, causing the pronation movement.

The primary muscles exerting flexion of the forearm at the elbow are the biceps brachii, brachioradialis, and brachialis. The pronator teres has a synergistic effect with these muscles as it also provides a small amount of assistance with forearm flexion.

The primary antagonist is the supinator muscle which originates on parts of the humerus, ulna, radial collateral ligament, and annular ligament. It inserts on the proximal radial shaft and supinates the forearm. Another antagonist to pronation is the biceps brachii, which also supinates the forearm.
