A scheduled anatomical dissection of left infratemporal fossa in an autopsied Caucasian male dead body aged 89 years old showed two roots of a left-sided BN. The BN derived from the mandibular nerve's anterior division. The BN originated as one trunk from the mandibular nerve 's main trunk and then split into two branches. The BN 's anterior branch can send branches into the lateral pterygoid muscle's superior head. The posterior branch of the BN traveled between the lateral pterygoid muscle's superior and inferior heads, rejoining the anterior root to continue down its course. The BN ended at the skin above the buccinator muscle surface. The BN 's two roots were superficial to the maxillary artery's second part and posterior to the buccal artery.

Anatomists have described the formation of plexuses between the terminal branches of the buccal nerve and the infraorbital and mentalis (menton) nerves.

On its course, the buccal nerve can present anatomical variations relative to the lateral pterygoid muscle, even occasionally bifurcating to form a nerve cavity.

In some segments, the area innervated by the buccal nerve overlaps the innervation from the posterior superior and medial alveolar nerves.
