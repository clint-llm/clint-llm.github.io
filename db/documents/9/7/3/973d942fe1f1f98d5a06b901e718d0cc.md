The patient must be counseled on the importance of lifestyle modification in the reduction of cardiovascular disease. Implementation of aerobic exercise, hypertension management, and strict glycemic control will ultimately lower levels of cardiovascular burden. At moderate to severe elevation of fasting triglycerides levels, patients should be advised to reduce the consumption of dietary fats significantly. This is extrapolated from the total effect hyperlipidemia levels have in modifying cardiovascular burden, among other outcomes.
