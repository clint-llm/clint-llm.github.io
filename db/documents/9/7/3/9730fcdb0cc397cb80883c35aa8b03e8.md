Difelikefalin is a selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist. Alternative names for difelikefalin include 4-amino-1-(D-phenylalanyl-D-phenylalanyl-D-leucyl-D-lysyl) piperidine-4-carboxylic acid,  KORSUVA, CKD-943, MR13A9, FE202845, and CR 845.

Difelikefalin has no action at the mu-opioid receptor, which is responsible for the euphoric effects of traditional opioid medications. Without activity at the mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system, there is negligible abuse potential for this novel agent.

Difelikefalin selectively acts on kappa opioid receptors in peripheral tissues, which contribute to pruritis and nociception. The activation of opioid receptors in peripheral neurons and keratinocytes reduces afferent (sensory) impulses towards the central nervous system, decreasing pain signals. Activating kappa opioid receptors on immune cells, including monocytes and T lymphocytes, decreases the release of pro-inflammatory chemicals such as prostaglandins.
