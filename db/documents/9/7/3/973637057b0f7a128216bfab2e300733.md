Diphtheria must be differentiated from other infections of the upper respiratory tract with similar presentations. Other differentials that must be kept in mind while diagnosing diphtheria are as follows:

- **Epiglottitis**: It is an acute inflammation involving the supraglottic region of the oropharynx with inflammation of the epiglottis and surrounding structures.

- **Retropharyngeal Abscess**: It manifests with high spiking fevers and requires urgent drainage.

- **Angioedema**: It manifests as generalized swelling due to the involvement of lower dermis and subcutaneous/submucosal tissues.

- **Infectious Mononucleosis:**It manifests with fatigue, malaise, sore throat, fever, nausea, anorexia, cough. The classic triad is children who present with fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy.

- **Pharyngitis**: It presents with a sore throat that is usually sudden in onset, odynophagia, fever, and cough.

- **Oral Candidiasis:**Grayish pseudomembrane, in the case of diphtheria, must be differentiated from oral candidiasis.
