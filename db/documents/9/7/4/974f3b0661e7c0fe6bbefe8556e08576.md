Monitoring for empagliflozin includes a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reading every 3 to 6 months. Renal function, blood pressure, lipid profile, and pregnancy test need require verification before initiation. Empagliflozin should not be given during the second and third trimester of pregnancy due to potential fetal risk. Renal function and blood pressure require routine monitoring during the treatment course due to effects on intravascular contraction. Moreover, clinicians should ask patients whether they experience any urinary symptoms or issues to rule out mycotic and urinary tract infections. Geriatric patients are more prone to suffering adverse effects related to reduced renal function and volume depletion. Patients should be carefully monitoredÂ for hypoglycemia and hypotension if they are co-prescribed insulin, sulfonylureas, or diuretics.
