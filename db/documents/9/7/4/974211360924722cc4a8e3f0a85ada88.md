- The rate and amount of bleeding can be easily underestimated especially when the patient is in the supine position. Thus, clinicians should always perform a pelvic exam in a post-abortion patient to determine that there is no blood that has collected in the vagina or uterus. All patients should have 2 large-bore IVs and oxygen, even if they initially appear to be stable. Blood must be crossed and typed in cases of bleeding.

- If missed, uterine perforation can be life-threatening. If the patient has abdominal pain post-abortion, the gynecologist should be consulted as soon as possible and a CT scan ordered. Some patients may benefit from a diagnostic laparoscopy.

- In any post-abortion patient, clinicians should never assume that ectopic pregnancy is ruled out.

- If the patient appears septic, broad-spectrum antibiotics need to be started even before the diagnostic workup is complete.

- Always obtain a thorough gynecological and obstetric history.

- Consider the fact that the patient may have retained products of conception which may be the cause of complications.

- Finally, always rule out bowel injury post-abortion, because if missed, it carries a high mortality.
