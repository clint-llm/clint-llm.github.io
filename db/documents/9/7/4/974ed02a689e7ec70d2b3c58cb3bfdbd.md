Patients will present with arm pain after traumatic injury. Also, patients may have a deformity to the upper arm, shortening of the extremity, swelling, and/or bruising. On exam, it is important to evaluate for skin tenting, motor function distal to the injury, sensation distal to the injury, and pulse and/or capillary refill distal to the injury. One should also evaluate the skin integrity; if there is an overlying laceration, it is classified as an open fracture. As with any fracture, one must also confirm that the limb is neurovascularly intact distal to the injury due to the risk of radial nerve and brachial artery injury, as described above.
