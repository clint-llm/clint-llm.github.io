Several anesthetic agents can be used for a nerve block. Amino amides and amino esters differ by the chemical structure of an intermediate chain between aromatic and hydrophilic segments. Amines are metabolized in the liver and undergo hydrolysis, which produces para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) that makes amines more likely to produce an allergic reaction than an amino ester. Pseudocholinesterases metabolize esters in the plasma. The easiest way to remember which drugs belong to each group is by recalling that amino acids generally have two “I”s in the spelling. Common amines include lidocaine and bupivacaine. Common esters include tetracaine, benzocaine, procaine, and cocaine.

The two most common anesthetic agents for infraorbital nerve block are lidocaine and bupivacaine. Lidocaine is faster in onset and has a shorter duration than bupivacaine. Lidocaine starts to take effect 2 to 3 minutes after infiltration, whereas bupivacaine can take 10 to 20 minutes to take effect. Typically, only 1 to 3 mL of the agent is needed, so toxicity is rare. The total dose of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine should not exceed 7 mg/kg (0.7 mL/kg) and 4 mg/kg without epinephrine.

Equipment required includes a 27-gauge needle, blunt fill needle, gauze, 5 to 10 mL syringe, a syringe (Luer-lock if available for easier control and administration), anesthetic agent, and sterile and non-sterile gloves.
