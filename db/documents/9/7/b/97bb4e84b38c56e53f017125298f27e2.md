Small angiomyolipomas and those without aneurysms usually have a good prognosis as the risk of spontaneous bleeding are low, at only 2%.

Another important prognostic factor is the malignant potential, as some types of angiomyolipoma have a greater tendency for this transformation.

There is a need for updated clinical guidelines to help guide physicians to optimal management in each of these rare and unusual cases. Improved treatments or even a potential cure will require ongoing translational research in genomics, immunotherapy, and other new treatment technologies.
