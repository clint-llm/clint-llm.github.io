The causes of scleroderma are not fully known. There is some evidence that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the genesis of scleroderma. Silica and certain organic solvents are recognized as risk factors of occurrence of systemic scleroderma. The result is an activation of the immune system, causing blood vessel damage and injury to tissues that result in scar tissue formation and the accumulation of excess collagen.

Genetic factors play at least a limited role. According to three US cohorts, the prevalence of the disease was 13 times higher in first-degree relatives of scleroderma patients than in the general population. OX40L gene polymorphism correlates with systemic scleroderma. IRF5 gene was found to correlate with systemic scleroderma as well as with the occurrence of interstitial lung disease during scleroderma.
