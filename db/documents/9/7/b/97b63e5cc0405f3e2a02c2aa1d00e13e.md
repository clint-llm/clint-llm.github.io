Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) therapy can result in fluid overload, leading to the high levels of infant mortality observed in severe protein C deficiency. This is due to the volume of plasma that requires replacing during FFP. Furthermore, viral-inactivated FFP is not accessible in all settings. There is an additional risk of viral infections resulting from frequent transfusions. As with all transfusion therapies, there is a hazard of adverse immune reactions to donor molecules present in FFP. There is less risk of viral contamination and allergic reactions associated with the use of protein C concentrate. Long-term protein C replacement in neonates often necessitates the insertion of devices to access the central venous system, resulting in complications including thrombotic events and infections.

In adolescents and adults, long-term anticoagulation therapy increases the cumulative likelihood of severe bleeding complications such as ruptured ovarian cysts with resultant pelvic hemorrhage in female patients. Unless protein C deficiency is being sufficiently replaced, the use of traditional suppressive therapy with estrogens is contraindicated in these patients.
