The pathophysiology of Alport syndrome is impaired production and deposition of collagen 4 α345 network in the basement membranes of the glomerulus, cochlea (inner ear), and eye. ARAS transmission is due to mutations in both the alleles of COL4A3 and COL4A4, whereas ADAS is caused by heterozygous mutations. With the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS), it has been shown that ADAS accounts for a greater number of cases. Compared to XLAS, patients with ADAS have a slower rate of progression to ESRD and are less likely to have extra-renal manifestations.

The primary pathology in patients with Alport syndrome—causing abnormality in the basement membrane—is present in the noncollagenous (NC1) C-terminal of the alpha-5 chain in XLAS and that of alpha-3 or alpha-4 chains in ARAS and ADAS.

In the early development of the kidney, alpha-1 and alpha-2 chains are predominant in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). With maturation, alpha-3, alpha-4, and alpha-5 chains become dominant through isotype switching. Evidence suggests that alpha-3, alpha-4, and alpha-5 chains combine to produce a unique collagen network. Abnormalities in any of these chains, as seen in patients with Alport syndrome, impair the formation of the collagen network leading to aberrant incorporation of the other collagen chains.

Evidence shows that isoform switching of type IV collagen is developmentally arrested in XLAS.

Patients who develop anti-GBM nephritis have circulating anti-GBM antibodies. In patients with ARAS, antibodies bind to the alpha-3 and alpha-4 collagen chains, whereas in patients with XLAS, antibodies predominantly bind to the alpha-5 chain.

Posttransplant anti-GBM nephritis generally appears within the first year of transplant. Patients have rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with kidney biopsy revealing linear immune deposits along the GBM and crescentic glomerulonephritis. Contrary to de novo anti-GBM nephritis, lung hemorrhage is never seen in posttransplant anti-GBM nephritis in cases of Alport syndrome. Plasmapheresis and cyclophosphamide are generally unsuccessful, and most patients lose the allograft.
