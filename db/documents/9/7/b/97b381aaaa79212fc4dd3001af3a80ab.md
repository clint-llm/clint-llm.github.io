SLAP tears are typically defined as superior labrum fraying/tearing from the glenoid. If one were to liken the glenoid to a clock face, these occur in the 10 o’clock to 2 o’clock position. There are several different patterns of SLAP tears with varying degrees of instability and magnitude of labral damage.  In the acute setting, traumatic injury can occur in traction/torsion and compressive/subluxation mechanisms.
