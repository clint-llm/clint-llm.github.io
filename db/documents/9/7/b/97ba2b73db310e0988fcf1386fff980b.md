Nasotracheal intubation (NTI) involves passing an endotracheal tube through the naris, into the nasopharynx, and the trachea, most commonly after induction of general anesthesia in the operating room. The use of NTI permits the administration of anesthetic gases without limiting access to intraoral anatomy, and it is commonly used for procedures including dental, oropharyngeal, and maxillofacial operations. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and complications of NTI and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients who require nasotracheal intubation.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy of the upper airway, including the nasopharynx.
- Review the indications for nasotracheal intubation.
- Summarize the complications of nasotracheal intubation.
- Outline the importance of care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients who require nasotracheal intubation.
