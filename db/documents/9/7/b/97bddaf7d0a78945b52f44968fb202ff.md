The physical trauma from a human bite is rarely spectacular with relatively minor lacerations and occlusion bruising being the main initial findings.  Human oral flora and contagious disease spread to account for the greater amount of morbidity with human bites. Eikenella corrodens, as well as more common aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, are normal human flora.  Herpes, hepatitis, and human immunodeficiency viruses are all transmissible through bite injuries.  Closed-fist injuries show a predication for infection due to the injury overlying the joint capsule of the MCP and the extensor tendon sheath. Direct joint and tendon sheath inoculation after the fist is relaxed allow bacteria deep penetration to normally sterile anaerobic environments.  Local infection, disseminated infection, tenosynovitis, and septic arthritis are all possible complications from human bite wounds.
