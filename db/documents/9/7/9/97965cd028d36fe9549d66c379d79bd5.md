The optic nerve is mainly made up of the axons of the retinal ganglion cells from the retina. Nerve fibers travel from the optic nerve head through a sieve-like structure called the lamina cribrosa into the extraocular space. Just posterior to sclera optic nerve gets myelin sheath covering. From there, it traverses through the apex of orbit into intracranial space whereÂ right and left optic nerve crosses each other forming chiasm and finally ending its journey at the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. The optic nerve may be damaged by ischemia anywhere along its path, starting from its origin. It is mainly divided into anterior and posterior. A portion of the optic nerve between the retina and sclera is supplied by a network of 6 to 12 short posterior ciliary arteries at the back of the globe. These vessels form a circumferential network called the circle of Zinn-Haller. The perfusion of the optic nerve head is in a centripetal and segmental fashion, which explains the characteristic pattern of visual field loss. Branches from the pial plexus supply the retrolaminar portion of the optic nerve.
