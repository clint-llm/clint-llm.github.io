SMILE in hyperopia is a promising area to explore. Compared to LASIK, LASEK, CK, and PRK, SMILE can be a better option for high hyperopic cases with stable postoperative refraction. Newer technologies of wavefront analysis and correction of aberrations and treatment of associated astigmatism will give better optical satisfaction to the patient. Preparation and correction of aberrations in a customized manner with C-LASIK is also an upcoming procedure to deal with aberrations. Refractive lens exchange and phakic intraocular lenses are other options for the management of hyperopia.
