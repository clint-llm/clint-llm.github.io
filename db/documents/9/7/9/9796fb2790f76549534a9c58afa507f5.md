The sciatic nerve originates from the sacral plexus (L4-S3) and provides most of the motor and sensory innervation to the leg. The long course of the sciatic nerve, from the sciatic notch in the gluteal region to the popliteal fossa, allows for multiple possible sites for an anesthetic blockade. Positioning is an important consideration in sciatic nerve block, with sacral plexus and transgluteal approaches not available in the supine position. The only approach that routinely uses the supine position is the anterior sciatic approach, although both the popliteal and subgluteal approaches can be performed in the supine position also. Consideration must be given to factors such as tourniquet placement, site of surgery, availability of access, and postoperative motor impairment when choosing a sciatic nerve block approach.
