Three ketone molecules predominate in human physiology: beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), acetoacetate, and acetone.

Beta-hydroxybutyrate represents the most precise approach to measuring the severity of DKA, making up roughly 75% of ketones in DKA. Whole blood ketone test strips and serum laboratory tests quantify BHB. Most urine strips test for acetoacetate and acetone.

BHB can be confirmed in the blood up to 24 hours before acetone and acetoacetate appear in the urine, as BHB is converted into these molecules. Therefore, urine ketone testing can increase even after proper DKA treatment ceases the formation of BHB. Acetone, which is stored in adipose tissue, is slowly released in the blood and excreted in the urine.

**Serum Ketone Levels**

- Less than 0.6 mmol/L=normal

- Between 0.6 mmol/L to 1.5 mmol/L=low to moderate

- Between 1.6 mmol/L to 3.0 mmol/L=high with a risk of developing DKA

- Over 3.0 mmol/L: Likely DKA, requires immediate emergency treatment

**Urine Ketone Strip Levels**

- Having no ketones in the urine is normal.

- One plus (+) ketones in urine ketones strips are equal to low/moderate blood ketones levels.

- Two plus (++) ketones in urine are equal to a high blood level of ketones.

- Three plus (+++) ketones in urine are equal to severe blood ketones.

- False-positive ketones in urine can occur with the intake of some medications like captopril and valproate. False-negative ketones in urine can occur with expired urine strips or delayed urine testing. As mentioned above, blood ketone levels should be the first choice to monitor the treatment. If blood testing is unavailable, urine ketone levels can help make the diagnosis but are of low yield in monitoring response to treatment.
