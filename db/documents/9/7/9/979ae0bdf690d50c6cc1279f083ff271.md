Diphenhydramine toxicity can occur via oral, topical, or intravenous administration. However, it is likely that toxic diphenhydramine exposures are a result of oral ingestion, given the accessibility of oral diphenhydramine compared to other diphenhydramine formulations. Diphenhydramine overdose or intoxication can be either accidental or intentional.
