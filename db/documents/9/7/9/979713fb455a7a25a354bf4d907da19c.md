Fluoroscopy of the foot is vital to the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with foot and ankle pathology. There are patient positioning methods and techniques that provide the health care professional with more precise images that assist in diagnosis and treatment. Understanding these techniques and positioning tips can help locate an accurate location and treat the area of injury with an injection or other indicated treatment option. This activity reviews fluoroscopic imaging of the foot and explains how the interprofessional team can use fluoroscopic evaluation to treat patients with foot and ankle pathology.
