Advanced imaging modalities using cross-sectional imaging have completely supplanted traditional methods for evaluating the pituitary gland. Before the 1970s, plain radiographs were used to assess for osseous changes in the sella turcica. Expansion of the sella turcica suggests the presence of a mass lesion within the pituitary fossa. However, the presence of abnormalities on skull radiographs is neither sensitive nor specific for pituitary lesions. Air contrast was also previously used for pneumoencephalograms to evaluate the sellar and parasellar regions. These techniquesÂ were quickly replaced by modern cross-sectional imaging modalities and are presented for historical reference.
