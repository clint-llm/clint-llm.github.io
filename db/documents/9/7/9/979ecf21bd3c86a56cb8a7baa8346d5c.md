Histologically, new blood vessels are seen over the surface of the iris and rarely on the iris stroma. These blood vessels are formed due to the budding of endothelial cells from the capillaries. These vessels arise from the vessels over the root of the iris or from the major arterial circle. These vessels are devoid of a muscular layer and have little adventitial tissue.

The fibrovascular membrane is composed of myofibroblast and proliferating smooth muscle tissue and can extend over the surface of the iris and angle of the anterior chamber.
