Cases that are refractory to antifungal treatment or have a negative potassium hydroxide microscopic examination should warrant further investigation.Â  Also, the clinician must rule out other, more serious conditions if there is a severe disease such as extensive skin involvement.

Other common diseases that may present similarly include nummular eczema, erythema annulare centrifugum, tinea versicolor, cutaneous candidiasis, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, pityriasis rosea, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis.
