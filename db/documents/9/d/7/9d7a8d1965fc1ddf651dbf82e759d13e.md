Nebivolol is a medication used in the management and treatment of hypertension. It is in the beta-blocker class of drugs. This activity describes the indications, action, and contraindications for this medication as a valuable agent in managing hypertension and patients with vascular disease. Beta-blockers fall into two categories based on whether they block beta-1 receptors in cardiac muscles, beta-2 receptors in the lungs and smooth muscles, or both. Nebivolol is a beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist that works via beta-1 receptor blockade; hence, it classifies as a cardioselective beta-blocker. Beta-blockers are also classified as vasodilators and non-vasodilators based on their vasodilatory capabilities. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent to healthcare team members in treating patients with hypertension and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of nebivolol.
- Summarize the adverse effects of nebivolol.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for nebivolol.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance nebivolol use and improve outcomes.
