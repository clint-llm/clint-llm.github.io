Interprofessional team members including clinicians, cardiology specialists, primary care providers, pharmacists, internists, and nursing staff who work with patients taking nitroglycerin should be fully aware of the indications and contraindications of the drug, as well as the potential adverse effects. Overall, nitroglycerin is relatively safe, and monitoring of the levels is not required. In the event of overdose, monitoring vital signs may be necessary to monitor the hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation is recommended. Pharmacists can assist the team by monitoring for drug-drug interactions. Nitroglycerin is pregnancy category C, and its use requires caution in breastfeeding mothers. It is currently unknown whether nitroglycerin is excreted in breast milk. Interprofessional collaboration and information sharing will drive better outcomes with fewer adverse events with nitroglycerine therapy. [Level 5]
