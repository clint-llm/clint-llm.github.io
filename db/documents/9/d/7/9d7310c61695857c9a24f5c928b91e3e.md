The levator palpebrae superioris is a triangular-shaped muscle located in each upper eyelid. The primary function is elevation and retraction of the upper eyelid. It has an abundant blood supply, mainly provided by the ophthalmic and supraorbital arteries (from the internal carotid), anastomosing with branches of the external carotid via angular and superficial temporal arteries through the superior peripheral arcade.
