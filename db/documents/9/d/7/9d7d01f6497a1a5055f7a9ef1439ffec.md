**Review of peripheral blood smear.**Analysis of platelet size and morphology helps in identifying conditions that are associated with platelet destruction and increased platelet consumption.

- Clumping of platelets occurs when EDTA is used as anticoagulant causing pseudothrombocytopenia.

- Adhesion of platelets to polymorphonuclear cells is known as “platelet satellitism” can be identified by review of a peripheral blood smear.

- Giant platelets present in inherited conditions like Bernard-Soulier syndrome.

A review of WBC and RBC morphology may suggest a specific condition.

- Schistocytes are a feature in thrombotic microangiopathic conditions.

- Teardrop cells, nucleated RBCs, leukoerythroblastic findings suggest bone marrow infiltrative process.

- Immature WBCs suggest leukemia.

- Megaloblastic process characterized by hypersegmented neutrophils seen in nutritional deficiencies.
