The direct encounter with flies carrying larvae is the primary cause of ophthalmomyiasis externa. The flies drop the larvae over the ocular surface during this encounter. The most common cause of external ophthalmomyiasis globally is Oestrus ovis, and it reaches the human eye either by flies or by contaminated hands.

Even for ophthalmomyiasis interna, the mechanism of reaching the ocular surface largely remains the same; however, in ophthalmomyiasis interna, cephaloskeleton and proteolytic enzymes secreted by the larvae may play an important role in ocular penetration. It is said that there exists a symbiotic relationship between the larva and the bacteria it carries. The larvae produce toxins and kill the tissues around and make the proteins available for proteolytic digestion by the bacteria. The proteolytic degradation, in turn, provides nutrition to the larvae.

These facilitate penetration of the larvae intraocularly.****The larvae can also reach ocular tissues via the hematogenous route.
