Although not specifically reported, there are clinicians of the opinion that patients with ainhum or other constricting band syndromes would likely benefit from physical and occupational therapy. In patients with early disease, occupational therapy may improve mobility or even promote fine motor function after amputation has occurred. In patients with surgical or spontaneous amputation of the digits of the foot, physical therapy or custom, orthotics would likely benefit patients with locomotor dysfunction and balance.
