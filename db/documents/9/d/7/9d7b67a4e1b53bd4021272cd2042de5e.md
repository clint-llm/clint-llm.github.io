Three cardinal components are dysphagia, dysarthria, and emotional apathy.

They can be described in the stages of

- Shock (swallowing and speech defect)

- Loss of function (difficulty in breathing)-spirometric assessment showed reduced vital capacities and lung volumes, and

- Release of function (emotional incontinence).

Loss of cerebellar modulation (cortico-pontocerebellar pathways) causing emotional dysmetria and disinhibition owing to lesions of corticobulbar volitional pathways are the main pathogenesis explained for pseudobulbar apathy.
