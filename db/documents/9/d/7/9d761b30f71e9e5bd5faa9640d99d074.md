ART allows individuals and couples to achieve pregnancy in situations that might not otherwise be possible, such as those with infertility, a history of gonadotoxic therapies, or those with deleterious genetic conditions.

According to the Center for Disease Control, as of 2017, 1.9% of United States-born infants are conceived with ART. In 2017, approximatelyÂ 200,000 ART cycles with an embryo transfer were performed, with 78,052 live births in that year.
