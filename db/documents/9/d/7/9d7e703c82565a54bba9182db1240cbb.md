While ependymomas that arise from different regions of the CNS are histologically similar, their clinical course often varies. Histological classification alone has not provided consistent and reliable survival outcomes in retrospective studies, meaning that ependymomas with similar histological grades may follow a substantially different clinical course. Recent studies suggest that these tumors may be categorized based on different populations of progenitor cells, which would explain different clinical courses in tumors with the same histological grade.
