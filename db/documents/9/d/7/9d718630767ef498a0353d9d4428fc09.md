The urinary system, composed of the kidneys, ureters, and urethra, is responsible for filtration of waste, fluid balance, waste elimination, and production of the hormones erythropoietin, renin, and calcitriol necessary for red blood cell production, blood pressure regulation, and vitamin D regulation, respectively. Urine production begins at week 10 after the differentiation of glomerular capillaries. Urine production is necessary for the amniotic fluid volume to cushion the fetus and facilitate proper lung development.

The urinary bladder receives urine from the ureters from the kidneys and to store urine before micturition. The genital system functions to produce ova in females and sperm in males and transport them to come together during fertilization. A zygote will be carried through the fallopian (uterine) tubes for implantation in the uterine cavity. Production of sex hormones, estrogen, and progesterone from ovaries and testosterone from testes, is an essential component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.
