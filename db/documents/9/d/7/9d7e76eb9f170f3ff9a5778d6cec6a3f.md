Interpersonal communication is essential in the hospital setting to prevent the spread of the infection to other patients. All members of the healthcare team bear a responsibility to avoid the spread of infection to non-infected patients. Nurses closely monitor the patient's clinical condition and help to establish and maintain droplet precautions during the patient's stay. All members of the healthcare team should promote adherence to droplet precautions by wearing masks and hand hygiene before and after each visit. Pharmacists and physicians will work to optimize antimicrobial therapy.
