Behavior modification is a psychotherapeutic intervention primarily used to eliminate or reduce maladaptive behavior in children or adults. While some therapies focus on changing thought processes that can affect behavior, behavior modification focuses on changing specific behaviors with little consideration of a personâ€™s thoughts or feelings. The progress and outcome of the intervention can be measured and evaluated. First, a functional analysis of the antecedents and consequences of the problem behavior(s) must be identified. This allows for the determination of specific target behaviors that will become the focus of treatment. Then, certain variables can be manipulated via reinforcers and punishments to change problem behavior(s). The goal is to eliminate or reduce maladaptive behavior. This activity reviews the indications and contraindications for behavior modification and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with behavioral disorders.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for behavioral modification therapy.
- Describe the contraindications to behavior modification therapy.
- Outline the clinical utility of behavioral modification therapy.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the use of behavioral modification therapy and improve patient outcomes.
