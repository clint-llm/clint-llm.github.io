Tachycardia requires differentiation from normal sinus rhythm and tachydysrhythmias. Sinus tachycardia presents with a regular rhythm with normal electrographic features: 1) presence of P waves that are upright in leads I, II and aVL, and negative in lead aVR; 2) each P wave is followed by a QRS and T waves and 3) a heart rate of greater than 100 beats per minute.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia is a chronic nonparoxysmalÂ resting heart rate of more than 100 beats per minute that is not associated with any physiologic, pharmacologic, or pathologic etiology.

Following identification and confirmation of sinus tachycardia, the clinician must then determine the underlying cause starting by ruling out life-threatening cardiac and non-cardiac etiologies that require immediate evaluation and treatment.
