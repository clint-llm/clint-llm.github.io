Although genetic testing is confirmatory, such methods may not be practical or necessary for all patients, especially those with known family history and characteristic symptoms. Proposed spontaneous cases in which the diagnosis is more ambiguous may, however, benefit from genetic confirmation.

Evaluation of the eye differs on whether the patient is experiencing an acute attack, a phenomenon that may be difficult to assess in the clinic due to the short duration of symptoms. In an acute attack, there may be an increase in the corneal thickness (which may be associated with pseudoguttata formation).

Outside of an attack, imaging and testing can rule out other potential causes. Intraocular pressure is expected to be stable, even in acute disease. Since the pathology is primarily in the cornea, aqueous humor will be clear. Additionally, synechiae do not appear to develop.

Since specular photographic changes are evident even in between attacks, this imaging modality may be the most useful in determining patients who may have the disease when it is not an acute episode.
