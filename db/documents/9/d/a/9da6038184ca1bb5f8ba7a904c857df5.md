An electrocardiogram (abbreviated as EKG or ECG) represents a recording of the heart's electrical activity. Willem Einthoven first invented it in 1902. An EKG is an integral part of the initial evaluation of a patient suspected of having a cardiac-related problem. This activity reviews the basic anatomy and electrical conduction system of the heart, illustrates the indications of ECG, and outlines the preparation, technique, and clinical significance. The article also highlights inter-professional teamwork and collaboration to enhance the delivery of quality care to patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the indications for obtaining an ECG.
- Describe the procedure for obtaining an ECG.
- Review the clinical significance of ECG.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance ECG and improve patient outcomes.
