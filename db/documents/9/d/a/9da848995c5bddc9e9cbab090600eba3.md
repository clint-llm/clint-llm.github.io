Evaluating CSX should begin with a history and physical followed by noninvasive tests. Before invasive procedures, an exercise tolerance test (ETT) or dobutamine stress echocardiogram (DSE) should be conducted. Patients are reported to exhibit ST-segment depression on exercise stress tests and may also demonstrate transient ST depression on Holter monitoring.

Severe angina during DSE with the exhibition of ST-segment depressions and the lack of contractile anomalies of the left ventricle are distinctive of endothelial dysfunction and may indicate CSX. ETT can also be done again following administration of short-acting sublingual nitrates as they may reveal ST-segment changes in some patients. Although effective in alleviating symptoms in CAD patients, the short-acting sublingual nitrates have also been reported to be ineffective in relieving chest pain in CSX patients.

Coronary angiography can provide an accurate measure of obstruction to the coronary vessels. The conventional characterization of coronary artery disease is defined as 50% or more significant stenosis of the left coronary artery (LCA) or 70% or greater stenosis of a coronary artery greater than 2 mm on coronary angiography. CSX is primarily a diagnosis of occlusion. Patients present with typical or atypical anginal chest pain, ST depression, and no evidence of coronary vessel obstruction greater than 50% on angiography.

An invasive diagnostic modality to assess the endothelial function of coronary flow reserve (CFR) is accomplished by cardiac catheterization and Doppler guide-wire. This procedure measures the increases in the blood flow of the coronary arteries after administering adenosine and acetylcholine. Noninvasive modalities such as brachial artery reactivity and peripheral arterial tonometry may also be employed to evaluate endothelial function.
