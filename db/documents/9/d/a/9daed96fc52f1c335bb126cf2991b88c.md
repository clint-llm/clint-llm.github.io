The image shows an IVC filter in a patient with a common iliac vein injury from the use of a trocar during lap cholecystectomy. The right common iliac vein had to be ligated, and an IVC filter was placed via the RIJ. A crossover saphenous vein graft bypass is planned to help decompress the right leg.
