Asteroid hyalosis needs to be differentiated from similar appearing fundus pathology, e.g., synchysis scintillans, amyloidosis, vitritis, old vitreous hemorrhage, and malignancy, particularly lymphoma and masquerade syndromes. Synchysis scintillans or cholesterolosis bulbi occurs in end-stage eyes or with eyes with a degenerative disease and characterized by cholesterol crystal deposits freely floating and then settling in liquefied vitreous. Vitreous amyloidosis is mostly bilateral, visually symptomatic, and histopathology of vitreous samples is confirmatory in these cases. Vitritis patients have defective vision and other associated features like clinical history, pain, redness, etc. pointing towards inflammation. Vitreous hemorrhages should prompt to look for retinal vascular pathologies, retinal breaks, or associated features of trauma. Malignancies like lymphoma can be diagnosed by histopathology of the vitreous sample. However, AH mimicking vitreous seeds in a patient with retinoblastoma (RB) needs to be properly diagnosed, and protocol for the management of RB should be followed.
