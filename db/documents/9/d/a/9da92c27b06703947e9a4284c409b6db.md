Atypical mycobacteria are found in both natural and human-made environments. In nature, they are found in the highest concentrations in the soil and water. Geographically they have higher concentrations in pine forests and the swamp-like regions of the southern United States. They also inhabit plumbing and human-made water sources with higher concentrations in urban areas. They are resistant to water treatment chemicals and can be found in drinking water, showers, hot tubs, and saunas. Estimates of the rate of pulmonary disease are between 5 to 10 per 100,000 per year. Various studies have estimated the rate of all causes of atypical mycobacterial infection in children to be between 0.6 to 3.3 per 100,000. Estimates of the rate of all causes of infection in adults are between 20 to 47 per 100,000.

MAC/MAI pulmonary disease is most commonly found in adults and those with impaired host defense of the lung, such as Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), patients on TNF-alpha inhibitors, and cystic fibrosis. Adult pulmonary disease preferentially impacts White, middle-aged, or older men, who often have comorbid diagnoses of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alcohol use, or tobacco use. A less common presentation referred to as "hot tub lung" can be seen as part of a hypersensitivity syndrome following MAC exposure related to bathing or recreational water exposure. Disseminated MAC/MAI is primarily observed in patients with significantly immunocompromised states such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
