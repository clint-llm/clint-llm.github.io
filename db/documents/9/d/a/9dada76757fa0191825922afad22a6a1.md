The total, high cholesterol number consists of the LDL ("bad") cholesterol and also the HDL ("good") cholesterol.  However, it is the LDL, which is the one that causes atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). High cholesterol can be defined as LDL cholesterol greater than 190 mg/dL, greater than 160 mg/dL with one major risk factor, or greater than 130 mg/dL with two cardiovascular risk factors. The important risk factors include:

- Age; male 45 years or older, female 55 years or older

- A positive family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (younger than 55 years in a male and younger than 65yrs in a female)

- Hypertension

- Diabetes

- Smoking

- Low HDL-cholesterol levels (less than 40 mg/dl in male and less than 55 mg/dl in a female)

Modifiable high cholesterol causes include a diet high in saturated or trans fats, low fiber, physical inactivity, obesity, and smoking. [22]

There are genetic and acquired causes of hypercholesterolemia. The classical genetic disorder is familial hypercholesterolemia resulting in LDL-C greater than 190 mg/dl in heterozygotes and greater than 450 mg/dl in homozygotes. This defect in the LDL receptor accounts for at least 85% of familial hypercholesterolemia.****[4][5][6]
