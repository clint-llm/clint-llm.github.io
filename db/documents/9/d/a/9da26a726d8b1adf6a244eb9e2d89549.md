Radiation therapy (RT) to the primary site is recommended in the postoperative or adjuvant setting to improve locoregional control and survival, especially in high-grade histology, advanced stage of the disease, positive or close margins, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, cervical lymph node metastases, or extra-glandular extension.

Primary RT is advised only in selective scenarios, including unresectable disease, poor surgical candidacy, unacceptable functional and cosmetic comorbidities from surgery, and palliation.
