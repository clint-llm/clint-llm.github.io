Contraindications to raloxifene include past medical history of deep venous thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, malignancy, active smoking, or any thrombophilia (factor V Leiden deficiency, prothrombin gene mutation G20210A, antiphospholipid syndrome, deficiency of antithrombin, protein c and s deficiency).

Death due to stroke: Postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events are at increased risk of death due to stroke when treated with raloxifene. Perform risk-benefit analysis in women with a risk of strokes, such as women with a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke, cigarette smoking habit, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation.

Careful administration is recommended in hospitalized, immobilized, unable to walk, or post-surgical recovery patients, given the high risk of developing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

The safety of raloxifene in premenopausal women is not established, and its use in premenopausal women is not recommended.
