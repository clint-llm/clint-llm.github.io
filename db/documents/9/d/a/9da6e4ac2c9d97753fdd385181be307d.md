Acne fulminans is a rare skin disorder, and hence its etiology is not well understood. Acne fulminans may be triggered by the use of high doses of isotretinoin when initiating treatment in patients with severe acne. Also, elevated levels of testosterone may have a role in the pathogenesis. Anabolic steroids are known to increase levels of sebum and density of Propionibacterium acnes. Bodybuilders who use anabolic steroids develop acne fulminans within a very short time. The belief is that the density of P. acnes or related antigens triggers the immune system and leads to acne fulminans. Others believe the condition to be autoimmune-mediated because circulating immune complexes have appeared in some patients with acne fulminans.

Acne fulminans also has a genetic component, but the pattern of inheritance is not known. The skin disorder may be part of the synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis syndrome (SAPHO), pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne syndrome (PAPA), pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa syndrome (PASH), and pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa syndrome (PAPASH).
