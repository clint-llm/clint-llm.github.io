- The definition of lymphocytosis in adults is an ALC over 4000 cells/microL and can be due to elevation of different lymphocytes compartments

- Common causes of reactive lymphocytosis: infections (EBV, CMV, pertussis, cat-scratch disease, HIV, etc.), drug reactions (DRESS), stress, and asplenia.

- Common causes of lymphocytosis secondary to monoclonal expansion: CLL/SLL, MBL (ALC under 5000 cells/microL), NHL (MZL, FL, MCL), T-LGL, HCL, Scezary syndrome.

- Lymphocytosis is detected incidentally in the majority of the patients.

- The evaluation starts with an extensive history and physical and review of peripheral blood smear review, which may direct for the need for further testing (flow cytometry, karyotype, and FISH).

- Clues to the presence of clonal lymphoproliferative disorders include a highly elevated ALC, presence of abnormal lymphocyte forms on PBS, and the presence of other cytopenias.

- The underlying etiology determines management and prognosis.

- Communication between PCP and hematologists is essential to guide management and to implement interventions promptly.
