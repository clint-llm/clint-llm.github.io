The sphenopalatine foramen remains an important surgical landmark for a variety of procedures. For instance, knowledge of the sphenopalatine foramen’s location is useful when performing endoscopic sinus surgery, as the sphenopalatine foramen can be infiltrated with local anesthetics and vasoconstricting agents to provide better anesthesia and hemostasis, respectively. Knowledge of the sphenopalatine foramen’s location proves particularly important when performing a nasoseptal flap for nasal reconstruction or skull base repairs, as the sphenopalatine artery represents the major blood supply to this versatile flap. Also, knowledge of the sphenopalatine foramen and its contents proves useful when performing endoscopic ligations for posterior epistaxis control where the sphenopalatine artery is targeted.

Reliable landmarks for identifying the sphenopalatine foramen have been delineated above (see Endoscopic landmarks for sphenopalatine foramen localization), though landmarks often used during surgery include the posterior portion of the middle turbinate and the ethmoid crest (i.e., crista ethmoidalis). During endoscopic sinus surgery, an incision can be made 1 cm anterior to the posterior aspect of the middle turbinate, and a mucoperiosteal flap can be raised posteriorly to identify the ethmoid crest. The sphenopalatine foramen and its contents should be located posterior to this landmark in over 95% of cases, allowing for the safe identification and/or preservation of the contents of the sphenopalatine foramen.
