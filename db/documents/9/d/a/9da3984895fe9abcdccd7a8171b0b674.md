Assessment of a patient with a possible concussion should include gathering information on the mechanism of injury, the symptoms the patient is experiencing, the timing of symptom onset, and the severity and persistence of symptoms. The symptoms of a concussion can be wide-ranging but often fall into one of four main domains, which are listed below. Some of the most common symptoms seen with concussion within each domain include:

1. Affective/emotional function

- Irritability

- Changes in mood

2. Cognitive function

- Confusion/disorientation

- Amnesia

- Mental fogginess

- Difficulty concentrating

3. Physical/somatic symptoms

- Headache

- Dizziness

- Difficulties with balance

- Visual changes

4. Sleep

- Drowsiness

- Sleeping less than usual

- Sleeping more than usual

- Difficulty falling asleep

The Sideline Concussion Assessment Tool 5 (SCAT5) has a comprehensive inventory for possible symptoms of a concussion.

Most patients (greater than 90%) diagnosed with a concussion do not have an associated loss of consciousness

Of particular importance in a patient's history is whether the patient has a history of any prior concussions. "A greater number, severity, and duration of symptoms" with previous concussions can be predictive of longer recovery time.

A physical examination specific to concussions should include:

- Close examination of the head and neck area for any structural injuries

- A thorough neurologic exam, including an assessment of strength, sensation, and reflexes; ocular assessment (including saccades and nystagmus); and assessment of a patient's balance and vestibular system

- Evaluation of a patient's cognitive function, including formally assessing orientation and higher-level cognitive processing

- An assessment of the patient's emotional state, including a comparison of the patient's current emotional state to their baseline with the patient's family or friends if possible

Formal neuropsychological assessment by a trained neuropsychologist can supplement a clinician's assessment of the multiple domains impacted by concussions.
