Canaliculitis is inflammation of the lacrimal canaliculus. It is an uncommon condition which ophthalmologists frequently misdiagnose. The condition is challenging to eradicate. This activity describes the cause, pathophysiology, presentation and diagnosis of canaliculitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Traditionally, Actinomyces israelii was thought to be the organism responsible for canaliculitis. Recent studies, however, demonstrate an increased incidence of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Many other organisms like Eikenella, Lactococcus, Nocardia, and fungi also have been isolated from patients with canaliculitis. 
- Patients may present with watering, discharge, a pouting punctum, or a medial canthal swelling. Mattering on the eyelids, expression of yellowish granules, concretions, and stones by massage are other presentations. 
- Conservative medical management includes topical and systemic antibiotics, warm compresses, local massage, syringing, and irrigation. The different surgical options include punctual dilatation or punctoplasty with curettage, canaliculotomy, canaliculoplasty with intubation, and punctum-sparing canaliculotomy with monocanalicular intubation.
- Canaliculitis is a condition which is commonly misdiagnosed or diagnosed late. A high index of suspicion is required. An early diagnosis is vital for a complete cure, and chronic cases have more complications and a poorer prognosis.
