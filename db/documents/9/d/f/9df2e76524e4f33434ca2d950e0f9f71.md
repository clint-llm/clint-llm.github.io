Patient and parental health education is most important to prevent complications.

- Maternal smoking during pregnancy positively correlates with hyperopia in the child.

- Parental education and counseling are very important, not only to early diagnosis and treatment of hyperopia but also to prevent strabismus and amblyopia development.

- Proper use of glasses, along with patching and exercises for amblyopia treatment, requires the active involvement of the parents.

- Regular follow-ups with an eye examination and refraction testing are essential.
