Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma arises from small polypoid excrescences, denuded epithelium, and plaques commonly located at the mid-portion of the esophagus. The early lesion may be subtle, and tissue staining with Lugol’s iodine should be used to stain normal squamous epithelium containing glycogen from malignant squamous glycogen-deprived cells to facilitate diagnosis. Advance lesions are ulcerated, circumferential, infiltrate submucosa, and extend in a cephalad direction. Spread occurs via the lymphatic system to regional lymph nodes, but a third of patients will have distant metastases to the liver, lung, and bone, including invasion of malignant cells to the bone marrow.

Approximately 60% of adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus and, more typically, GEJ cases arise from Barrett esophagus metaplastic epithelium. The typical treatment for patients with Barrett's esophagus is surveillance using upper endoscopy and biopsy to examine tissue for evidence of dysplasia. The incidence rate for adenocarcinoma among patients without dysplasia is 1.0 case per 1000 person-years; on the other hand, the detection of low-grade dysplasia on the index endoscopy is associated with an adenocarcinoma incidence rate of 5.1 cases per 1000 person-years. The annual risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma is 0.12% (95% CI; 0.09, 0.15). High-grade dysplasia should be managed aggressively, including the possibility for surgical resection. Early metastases occur in adjacent or regional lymph nodes. Predictors, such as tumor markers (TP53), may indicate potential progression to malignant disease.

Assessment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene and protein expression has been implicated in tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis associated with poorer survival. HER2 is overexpressed more frequently in adenocarcinoma (30%) than in squamous cell carcinoma (13%). HER2 is recommended for all metastatic adenocarcinomas, first using immunohistochemistry score (negative for 0 or 1+ and positive 3+, with reflex FISH for 2+) to confirm.
