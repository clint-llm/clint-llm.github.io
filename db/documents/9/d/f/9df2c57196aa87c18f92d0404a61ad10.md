Electroencephalographers may misclassify benign variant EEG patterns as epileptiform discharges, resulting in unnecessary treatment or a delay in the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of other paroxysmal disorders. Cautious interpretation of EEG patterns, a careful review of clinical history, and demographic features usually help distinguish normal variant patterns from interictal epileptiform discharges or seizures. When nonspecific transients occur during an EEG finding, it may not be possible to determine whether a transient is an epileptiform discharge or a benign variant. It is best not to “overcall” a finding as being abnormal, and to place the possible finding in the context of the clinical history.
