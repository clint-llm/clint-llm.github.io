Patients may present with one of the causative histories listed, along with symptoms of ataxia, difficulty with upward gaze, and hyporeflexia. Not as common symptoms include muscle weakness and visual-field constriction. The most severe symptoms are blindness, dementia, and cardiac arrhythmias.

If vitamin E deficiency is expected, a full neurological exam is recommended as well as a standard physical exam. Patients presenting early may show hyporeflexia, decreased night vision, loss/decreased vibratory sense; however, they have normal cognition. A more moderate stage of this deficiency may show limb and truncal ataxia, profuse muscle weakness, and limited upward gaze. Late presentations may show cardiac arrhythmias and possible blindness with reduced cognition. Ataxia is the most common exam finding.

Patients that have abetalipoproteinemia have eye problems, often including pigmented retinopathy and visual field issues. However, patients suffering from cholestatic liver disease often have personality and behavioral disorders.
