Renal leiomyosarcoma is a rare, aggressive malignancy that carries an overall poor prognosis. Its clinical presentation is not different from that of the far more common renal cell carcinoma with hematuria, flank pain, and an abdominal mass. Radiologists play a crucial role in the diagnosis, not simply by identifying the renal mass, but by performing an image-guided percutaneous biopsy to obtain adequate and representative tissue for biopsy. Radiologists also select the imaging modalities appropriate for staging the disease. Histopathologists examine the biopsy tissue using routine microscopic and immunohistochemical techniques to make a specific diagnosis and assign a grade to the tumor. The grade is another important prognostic indicator. Surgeons perform radical nephrectomy, which is the recommended definitive treatment. Medical oncologists and radiation oncologists may offer additional therapy depending on the margin status as confirmed by the pathologist postoperatively and taking into account the clinical staging.[Level 5]
