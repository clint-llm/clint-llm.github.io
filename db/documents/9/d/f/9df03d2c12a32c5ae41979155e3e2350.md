Xeroderma is a common condition that can be identified by various members of a healthcare team, including nurses, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, podiatrists, primary care providers, and dermatologists. Each provider is important in diagnosing dry skin and educating patients on effective treatment strategies.

For example, pharmacists can verify if xeroderma is medication-related (i.e., adverse effect, inappropriate dosing). Pharmacists can also formulate creams containing active ingredients that optimize emollient and humectant qualities. Nursing staff can demonstrate proper cleansing and moisturization techniques, as well as the application of occlusive dressings. Primary care providers and specialists may collaborate when addressing patients' comorbidities and systemic diseases. Although xeroderma is generally a benign condition, interprofessional communication and care coordination are imperative for high-quality care and patient satisfaction. [Level 5]
