Pituitary cancer is rare, and improving outcomes requires coordinated interprofessional care and communication between healthcare team members. An interprofessional team approach is recommended, including primary care clinicians, endocrinology, ophthalmology, neurosurgery, otolaryngology, radiology, radiation oncology, and oncology. Surgical intervention is necessary, in addition to possibly adjuvant radiosurgery and/or chemotherapy, as well as emerging immunotherapies. Chemotherapy can benefit from a consultation with an oncology specialized pharmacist. Patients should have ongoing discussions with specialists to discuss the risks and benefits of the various treatment options. The interprofessional model will drive the best patient outcomes in pituitary cancer. [Level 5]
