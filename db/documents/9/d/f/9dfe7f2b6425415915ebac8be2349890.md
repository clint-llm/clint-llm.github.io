Textbooks classically describe the greater splanchnic nerve with roots from T5-9, but other roots often join the nerve. Anatomists have observed T4 as the most proximal root and T11 as the most distal root. Some specimens have shown that the contributing roots are not always continuous and can sometimes skip spinal levels.

Additionally, these nerves are generallyÂ not bilaterally symmetric. Many cadaveric studies find that the right GSN originates higher in the thorax than the left GSN.

The three pairs of thoracic splanchnic nerves pierce the diaphragm through one common foramen, but they may run separately in a minority of specimens.
