In patients with AAION, GCA should always be ruled out. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), are sensitive but not specific to GCA. Temporal artery biopsy is definitive to rule out GCA. A minimum of 2 cm length of the artery is needed as a specimen. Biopsy results show evidence of granulomatous inflammation with the involvement of internal elastic lamina. Biopsy results can give false-negative results; therefore, noninvasive techniques like MRI and Doppler ultrasound are used.

Vascular risk factors, including blood pressure determination, fasting lipid profile, and assessment of blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c should be excluded as many a time, patients are not aware of it. Screening questions for sleep apnea should be asked. The patient's medications, including PDE 5 inhibitors, should be reviewed to rule out nocturnal hypotension. In patients age less than 50, additional testing includes hyperhomocysteinemia in nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and is easily treated with vitamin B12.

Fluorescein angiography: Normally, the choroid fills up 3 to 5 seconds before retinal arteries. In AAION, there is delayed choroidal filling.

Visual fields are usually abnormal on confrontation tests (e.g., finger counting) and always abnormal with automated perimetry. Abnormal fields usually take the form of an altitudinal defect, which is more common inferiorly.
