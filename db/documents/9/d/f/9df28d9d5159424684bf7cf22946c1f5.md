- **Proximal accommodation errors**should not be used in young children with cycloplegic retinoscopic as proximal accommodation errors can occur, resulting in over minus refraction compared to subjective refraction.

- **Poor fixation**- The patient blinks excessively and doesn't fix the primary gaze.

- **High refractive errors**- The autorefractors may not be fairly accurate at high refractive errors.

- **Pupil dilatation-**Small and constricted pupil may interfere with autorefractor results.

- **Media opacity â€“**The results are unreliable, such as pterygium, adherent leucoma, corneal opacity, cataract, etc.

- **Involuntary eye movement-**Nystagmus, opsoclonus, myoclonus, ocular bobbing, etc., all interfere with autorefractor readings.

- **Other factors-**Pseudophakia, amblyopia, age-related macular degeneration, etc

- **Lack of assessment of media opacity**- Keratoconus, pterygium, cataract, etc

- **Cost**- They are relatively costly equipment's as compared to retinoscopy

- **Non-portable-**These instruments occupy more space compared to retinoscopy instruments

- **Breakdown-**The software or the electrical circuit can break down, sometimes interfering with the results.

**Early Optometers Limitations**

The limited acceptance of optometers in practice is due to alignment issues, irregular astigmatism, and accommodation.
