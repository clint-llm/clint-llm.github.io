Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes is a lifelong disorder with no definitive cure, but it is a treatable condition that responds well to insulin therapy. Individuals with cystic fibrosis with the additional diagnosis of CFRD have a higher risk of early death than those without CFRD. The mortality associated with CF and CFRD has significantly reduced with the addition of annual diabetes screening and early initiation of insulin therapy. The most common cause of death associated with CFRD is a pulmonary failure. While all of the links between CFRD and accelerated pulmonary decline have not been elucidated, chronic hyperglycemia is known to negatively affect lung function by impeding bacterial clearance and increasing oxidative stress in the lungs resulting in decreased pulmonary function and, ultimately, pulmonary failure.
