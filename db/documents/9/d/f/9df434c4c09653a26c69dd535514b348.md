Li-Fraumeni (LFS) is a rare syndrome, as over 500 families with LFS have been reported in the literature. There are likely over 1,000 multigenerational families worldwide with LFS. Children with a diagnosis of adrenocortical carcinoma have the highest occurrence of P53 mutations. The syndrome is also associated with childhood brain tumors, osteosarcomas, and rhabdomyosarcomas. Patients with multiple primary tumors have a high incidence of P53 mutations.

Mutations in the core binding protein of TP53 have an increased risk of cancer. TP53 mutations have a high penetrance. The lifetime risk for women is 90 percent by age 60 years while in men the estimated lifetime risk is about 73 percent.

The risk of developing multiple primary cancers is high in members of families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome compared to the general population. This excess risk mainly involves cancers characteristic of LFS, this risk is further increased in survivors of childhood cancers, and these patients require close monitoring for early cancer signs.

Patients with LFS are successfully treated during the initial cancer occurrence. However, radiation therapy should be avoided, when possible, due to several case reports and preclinical evidence showing an increased risk of radiation-induced cancers in these patients.
