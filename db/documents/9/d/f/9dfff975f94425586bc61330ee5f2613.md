A definitive diagnosis requires an adequate biopsy with histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations. It is followed by proper staging with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans to assess the extent of the disease and to guide therapy.

- Stage I: a single lymph node, a group of adjacent lymph nodes or single extranodal lesions without nodal involvement

- Stage II: two or more lymph node groups on the same side of the diaphragm or limited contiguous extranodal involvement

- Stage II bulky: stage II as above with a bulky feature defined as a single nodal mass of 10 centimeters or greater than a third of the transthoracic diameter

- Stage III: nodes on both sides of diaphragm or nodes above diaphragm with spleen involvement

- Stage IV: additional noncontiguous extralymphatic involvement

A useful prognostic model for patients with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is the prognostic index of natural killer lymphoma (PINK), which includes age above 60 years, stage III to IV disease, distant lymph node involvement, and non-nasal disease.
