RMSF is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an infectious disease board-certified pharmacist and an infectious disease nurse. The pharmacist can vet all antimicrobial therapy against the latest antibiogram data and verify dosing and duration in collaboration with the treating clinician. An infectious disease specialist may also be on the case as well. Nursing will administer these drugs, and monitor for treatment effectiveness and adverse reactions, reporting any concerns to the clinicians on the case. Following the diagnosis, treatment should start ASAP. Because there is no vaccine, patients need education on the prevention of tick bites. Interprofessional team strategies will yield optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
