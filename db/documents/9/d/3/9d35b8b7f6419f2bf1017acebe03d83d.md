Patients with CVID require an integrated interprofessional team approach to improve short-term and long-term patient outcomes. They need frequent specialized clinical provider evaluations, including an infectious disease specialist and immunologist. A dedicated nurse can assess and educate the patient as well as his family about potential complications and symptoms to monitor. A specialized pharmacist is required to ensure proper dosing of IVIG as well as appropriate dosing and duration of antibiotics for infection episodes. Above all, the clinical provider, the nursing staff, as well as the clinical pharmacist, need to provide an integrated interprofessional approach to patient education to minimize complications of the disease and to improve patient outcomes. Preventive care with appropriate vaccination (avoiding live vaccines such as oral polio, smallpox, influenza, yellow fever, oral typhoid), dental, auditive, and mental care requires attention, as mentioned previously. Close communication between the team members is vital to ensure good outcomes. [Level 5]
