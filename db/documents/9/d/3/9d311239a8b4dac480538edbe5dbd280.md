As the majority of gastric polyps are asymptomatic or found incidentally, evaluation most commonly begins with some complaint of dyspepsia or the finding of anemia on routine CBC. It is possible to see gastric polyps on noninvasive imaging, e.g., computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but only in the rare case of a very large polyp. The gold standard for evaluation for gastric polyps consists of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) performed by an experienced practitioner.
