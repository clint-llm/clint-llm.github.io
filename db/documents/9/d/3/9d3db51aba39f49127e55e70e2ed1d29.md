Although the condition is not universally fatal, the prognosis is still relatively poor. The 4-year survival rate is 77%.

The following findings were reported by Manning et al.

- Subacute or chronic symptoms at presentation have a better prognosis.

- Response to initial therapy correlates with a better prognosis.

- Cardiothoracic ratio below 55% by the end of 2 years of therapy is indicative of a good prognosis.

- Normalization of electrocardiogram findings between 2 to 5 years after the onset of therapy supports a positive prognosis as well.
