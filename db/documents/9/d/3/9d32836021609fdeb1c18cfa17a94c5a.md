The most common KSÂ karyotype is 47, XXY (greater than 90%). Mosaic karyotypes such as 46, XY/47, XXY, and other aneuploidies such as 48, XXXY, and 49, XXXXY have been described. The acquisition of the extra X-chromosome is random and usually due to meiotic nondisjunction or post-zygotic nondisjunction. Overall severity of the phenotype appears to be correlated with the amount of additional X chromosome material present.
