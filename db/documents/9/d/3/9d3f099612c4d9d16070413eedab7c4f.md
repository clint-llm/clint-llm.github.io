Preparing for utilization of ECMO in children requires experience, knowledgeability, proper stratification of who may be suitable candidates. ECMO needs to be executed in a center with a higher level of care since they are more adept at dealing with consequences. Specifically, if a patient needs ECMO management but is not at an ECMO center, there is a risk of managing them at their current hospital versus transferring to a specialized ECMO center. A cohesive critical care transfer team must be conveniently available.

Before administering ECMO, neonates or pediatric patients should undergo extensive evaluation, including thorough physical examination focusing on neurologic assessment, complete blood count, metabolic panel, lactate, arterial blood gas, chest x-ray, cranial ultrasound, or head CT scan, and echocardiography.

ECMO surfaces elicit a systemic inflammatory response when blood is exposed to the circuit, causing a hypercoagulable state. Frequent monitoring of platelet and coagulation studies is important. Therefore, anticoagulation plays a key role in ECMO therapy. Unfractionated heparin remains the gold standard way to manage the body’s pro-thrombotic state, although there is a trend towards using direct thrombin inhibitors as alternative agents.

From a nutrition standpoint, optimizing nutrition is especially paramount in pediatric ECMO. Not only is there a strong rationale to meet full growth potential and developmental needs, but underweight patients receiving ECMO have been found to have higher mortality than patients who were otherwise properly nourished. For ECMO in the neonatal setting, clinical guidelines proposed by the American Society for Parenteral Enteral Nutrition recommend starting nutritional support expeditiously and enteral nutrition as soon as the patient is clinically stable.
