Body diaphragms are conventionally considered to be those anatomical structures that occupy a horizontal space. In reality, considering the three-dimensionality of the human body, it is preferable to consider them as areas in close anatomical continuity, able to influence each other: tentorium cerebelli, tongue, thoracic outlet, diaphragm, and pelvic floor. This activity covers the osteopathic manual approach to the 5 diaphragms and describes how to evaluate and then treat the tentorium cerebelli, the tongue, the thoracic outlet, the respiratory diaphragm, and the pelvic floor, using a non-binding sequence.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomical and neurological connections of the 5 diaphragms in the osteopathic field.
- Identify the best treatment strategy with 5 diaphragms.
- Summarize the clinical picture associated with the 5 diaphragms to allow the clinician a practical reflection to identify the correct treatment strategies.
- Outline some interprofessional strategies that can improve patient outcomes when using the osteopathic 5 diaphragms procedure.
