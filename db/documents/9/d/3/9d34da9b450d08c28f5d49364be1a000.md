Dupixent has no black box warning, unlike the relatively newer topical and oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors used for treating AD.

No serious or frequent toxicity was reported. Clinicians must be careful when using dupilumab with substrates of CYP450, as it utilizes the same enzyme for its degradation. There have been rare instances of vasculitis and pneumonia in patients using dupilumab along with CYP450 substrates.
