Marked differences exist between centers in the reported frequency of the diagnosis of nonorganic functional hearing loss.

Nonorganic functional hearing loss incidence varies from 2% to 7%. Nonorganic functional hearing loss is more prevalent in children when compared to the general population.

In 1965, Berger et al. suggested that the increased prevalence of nonorganic functional hearing lossÂ in this group may be due to educational stress resulting from a transfer to secondary school.

This is especially true for children with below-average intelligence because they may manage primary school with few or no problems, but transfer to more challenging secondary school may serve as a trigger for nonorganic functional hearing loss.

In 2010, Holenweg et al. found that the age distribution of nonorganic functional hearing loss was greater even in adults between 19 and 57 years of age compared to children.
