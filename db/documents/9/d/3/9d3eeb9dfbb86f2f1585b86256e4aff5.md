No definitively effective treatment for EV exists. However, several possible treatments are recommended from excision to other therapies such as acitretin and imiquimod, interferons with retinoids, cimetidine (although there is debate as to the efficacy of this treatment), to topical calcipotriol. As EV lesions tend to occur in sun-exposed areas of skin, sun exposure protection counseling and adherence are also important to the management of this condition. Any suspiciously malignant lesions should be excised to evaluate histopathologically. Patients with EV will require annual or more frequent check-ups with dermatologists to evaluate for development of new worrisome lesions.
