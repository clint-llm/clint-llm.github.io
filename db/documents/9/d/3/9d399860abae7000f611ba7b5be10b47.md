With the advancing age of the population and improved survival from ischemic heart disease, the incidence, and prevalence of heart failure have increased significantly.

Despite the aforementioned medical therapy, a significant number of patients continue to suffer poor outcomes and require device-based therapy. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device provides a survival benefit to such patients. Other than the survival benefit, in appropriately selected patients with severe heart failure, CRT leads to improved functional class, quality of life scores, physiological measures such as peak VO, and reduced hospitalizations.
