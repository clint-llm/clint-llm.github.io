Acute and chronic symptoms due to effects on the central and peripheral nervous system characterize acute hepatic porphyrias. The most common presenting symptom is neuropathic abdominal discomfort. The motor, sensory, and autonomic nervous systems are often affected, resulting in autonomic changes (e.g., tachycardia, hypertension), muscle weakness; sensory loss; and pain in the back, chest, and extremities. Unfortunately, physical findings are often minimal, and even severe symptoms may be discounted as a result. Abdominal pain with a relatively unremarkable physical examination is the most common neurovisceral manifestation of acute hepatic porphyria, the most common of which is AIP, and should warrant further evaluation. Identical symptoms may be seen in the other acute hepatic porphyrias: VP, HCP, and ALAD. VP and HCP may also present with blistering skin lesions.

Three groups of symptoms, abdominal pain, central nervous system abnormalities, and peripheral neuropathy, are described as a "classic triad" that should suggest acute porphyria. However, because they are highly nonspecific, they are often viewed as unrelated and not indicative of a unifying diagnosis.
