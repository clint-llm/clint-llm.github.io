Infantile botulism is the most common form of botulism infection and predominates 70% of all new cases of botulism annually. Infants will ingest contaminated milk or food, and the neurotoxin will colonize and replicate in the large intestine. Infantile botulism is caused equally by Type A and Type B serotypes. Foodborne botulism is rarely a childhood illness and is often seen in clusters.
