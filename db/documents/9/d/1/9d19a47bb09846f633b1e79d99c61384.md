Patients should consult with a neurologist when they suffer from radicular pain and back pain. The interprofessional team should ensure that the patients are well informed about myxopapillary ependymoma. Patients should be informed about educational websites so as to help them better understand this benign neoplasm, its prognosis, and its treatment. Patient education plays a very important role in the deterrence of the processes that can cause a myxopapillary ependymoma. Specialty-trained nurses often play a crucial role.
