Chlordiazepoxide is a schedule IV controlled drug. There is a reported risk of dependence with long term use. Even though there is no established cause-effect relationship, patients on anticoagulation should require monitoring for possible blood coagulation. Patients with porphyria also need monitoring because of possible porphyria exacerbation. Per clinical data, there have been reports of paradoxical reactions such as acute rage, stimulation, and excitement in psychiatric and hyperactive aggressive pediatric patients on chlordiazepoxide therapy.
