There are not many variants of the infraspinatus muscle in current literature, although the muscle has been found fused with the teres minor in some individuals.

Subchondral cysts can be found at the insertion of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus on the humeral head. These can be confused with rotator cuff pathology or a degenerative change. When the cysts are found on the dorsal insertion sites are typically asymptomatic. When cystic changes are identified on the anterior aspect of the humerus, a potential subscapularis lesion needs to be assessed.
