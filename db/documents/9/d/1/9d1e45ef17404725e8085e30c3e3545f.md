- Elevated levels of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid are present in carcinoid tumors, carcinoid syndrome. For carcinoid tumors, 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid urine test has a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 73%.

- Urinary 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid levels over five times the upper limit of normal were found to be a weak prognostic indicator for patients with small intestine neuroendocrine tumors.

- Elevated levels of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid occur in patients of autism spectrum disorder.

- Lower levels have correlated with aggressive or violent behavior, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

- Diseases of malabsorption may present with increased urinary 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid.

- Increased 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid levels correlate with type 2 diabetes patients with microalbuminuria that developed renal insufficiency and impaired blood flow to their lower extremities.

- A shorter 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid DT in patients with small intestine or unknown primary neuroendocrine tumors correlated with a higher risk of disease progression.

- Altered levels of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid are present in IBS patients vs. controls.

- Levels of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid undergo alteration in various inborn errors of metabolism. Decreased levels of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid are present in aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylation deficiency, sepiapterin reductase deficiency.

- Cystic fibrosis patients were found to have higher blood serotonin levels and normal 5-HIAA urinary excretion levels in one study, but in other studies, CSF and urinary 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid levels were found to have increased in cystic fibrosis patients.

- 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid levels were found to be positively correlated with FEV1/FVC and negatively correlated with bronchial inflammatory marker, eNO.

- Urinary 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid levels were found to be lower in patients with multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, levels of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid were found to relate to the severity of disease symptoms in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients.
