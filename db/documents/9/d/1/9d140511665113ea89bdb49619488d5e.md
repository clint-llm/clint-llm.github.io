OFC results from parathyroid hormone (PTH) overproduction. PTH elevates the level of blood calcium via calcium release from the bones and calcium reabsorption in the kidney. OFC is due to increased production of PTH that can be the result of any of the following mechanisms:

**Parathyroid Adenoma**

Up to 85% of hyperparathyroidism cases are due to parathyroid adenomas, which are benign lesions but metabolically active.

**Hereditary Factors**

About 5 to 10% of hyperparathyroidism cases are from hereditary factors such as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 and 2A, hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, and familial isolated hyperparathyroidism which can result in OFC if left undiagnosed. [11794462] Â MEN Type 1 is the most common cause of hereditary hyperparathyroidism and is accounting for up to 95% of hereditary cases of OFC.

**Parathyroid Carcinoma**

Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare cause of OFC in about <1% of hyperparathyroidism cases. Diagnosis of OFC onset due to carcinoma is challenging and difficult.

**Renal Complications**

Renal osteodystrophy is a skeletal disorder resulting from end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which can commonly cause OFC (up to 50%). During the ESRD, kidneys are unable to make calcitriol, which promotes calcium delivery to the bones. In the shortage of calcitriol, PTH levels increase and promote calcium removal from the bones.
