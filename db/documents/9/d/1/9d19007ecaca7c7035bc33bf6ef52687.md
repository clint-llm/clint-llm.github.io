Both superficial and deep lymphangiomas can be difficult to treat. When feasible the treatment of choice for any type of lymphangioma, however, remains surgical excision. Wide local excision of the affected lymphatic channels is necessary as recurrence is common. Recurrence rates for surgical excision of lymphangioma circumscriptum have been reported to be as high 23% in follow-up periods up to 81 months. Surgical success rates are higher for small, superficial lymphangiomas.

Destructive treatments with carbon dioxide (CO2) laser, long-pulsed Nd-YAG laser, and electrosurgery have been reported to improve symptoms. Cryotherapy, superficial radiotherapy, and sclerotherapy with 23.4% hypertonic saline are less commonly used modalities. Direct injection of a sclerosing agent, including 1% or 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate, doxycycline or ethanol, can be made into lymphatic malformations. Compression may reduce swelling caused by lymphedema. Infection prevention is crucial.
