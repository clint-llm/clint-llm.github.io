Management of Dyspareunia is a typical example for healthcare providers to ensure patient-centered care. The symptoms, physical findings, and concerns related to dyspareunia are managed by collaborative efforts of a team consisting of gynecologists, urologists, psychiatrists, pain specialists, and paramedical staff. To standardize treatment, a Pelvic Floor Disorder Consortium (PFDC) came into existence, which also provides guidance to treat several other conditions. It reviews multiple symptoms, function, and quality of life questionnaires. The PFDC is comprised of urogynecologists, urologists, gynecologists, physiotherapists, and other advanced care physicians that deal with complex concerns of sexual dysfunctions.

A multidisciplinary treatment approach has shown to be beneficial in dyspareunia. The general care physician usually initiates the connection with the patient and develop a rapport. Adequate education regarding the course of the disease should be provided to the patients. A psychiatrist should be involved to relieve the patient's distress. Sexual pain specialists should also offer consultation when needed. Pelvic floor rehabilitation has shown promising results in dyspareunia treatment.
