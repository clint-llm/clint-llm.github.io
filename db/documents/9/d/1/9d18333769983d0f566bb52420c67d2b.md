Innervation of the pelvis includes mainly the sacral and coccygeal plexuses.

The sacral plexus derives from the L4-S4 nerve roots, and it sits on the internal surface of the piriformis muscleâ€”most of the sacral nerves stemming from the sacral plexus exit through the greater sciatic notch. The sciatic nerve forms out of the sacral plexus and can be compressed by the muscle, causing radicular pain down the leg. This form of entrapment neuropathy by the compression from the piriformis muscle is called piriformis muscle syndrome.

The coccygeal plexus forms from the S4-S5 nerve roots and lies along the pelvic surface of the coccygeus muscle.

The autonomic system also provides innervation to the pelvis, which mainly courses via the inferior hypogastric plexus. This plexus is made of the nerve fibers from the sympathetic splanchnic nerves, parasympathetic splanchnic nerves, and hypogastric nerves. The autonomic nerves travel to the organs via their corresponding splanchnic nerve group.
