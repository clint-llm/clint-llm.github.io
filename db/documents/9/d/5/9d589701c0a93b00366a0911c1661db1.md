Hydrops is associated with a broad spectrum of disorders. There are two main categories of hydrops fetalis:

Immune hydrops fetalis: Isoimmunization such as Rh isoimmunization and ABO incompatibility, anti-c, C, e, E, Duffy antibodies, and Kell alloimmunization are the causes of immune hydrops fetalis. A detailed discussion of the immune hydrops is beyond the scope of this activity.

Non-immune hydrops (NIHF): This type of hydrops fetalis accounts for approximately 80 to 90 percent of all cases of the condition. It occurs when an underlying disease, genetic disorder, or birth defect interferes with the fetal body's ability to manage fluid. NIHF can result from many various underlying conditions, such as:

- Cardiac causes: Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, hypoplastic left heart, endocardial cushion defects, and congenital pulmonary airway malformation

- Chromosomal anomalies: Turner syndrome, Down syndrome, and Edward syndrome

- Lymphatic causes: Congenital lymphatic dysplasia

- Infections: Parvovirus B19 (fifth disease), cytomegalovirus, and syphilis infections in pregnant women

- Metabolic diseases: Niemann-Pick disease type-C (NPC), Gaucher disease type 2, and beta-glucuronidase enzyme deficiency

- Tumors: Teratoma (sacrococcygeal teratoma), hepatic tumors, and neuroblastoma

- Maternal diseases: Diabetes mellitus and hyperthyroidism

- Urinary causes: Congenital nephrosis and prune belly syndrome

- Digestive causes: Volvulus and meconium peritonitis

- Hematologic causes: Alpha-thalassemia, twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) in monochorionic twin pregnancies, and leukemias

- Disorders of red blood cell (RBC) metabolism: Glucose phosphate isomerase deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency

- Disorders of RBC production: Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, Diamond-Blackfan syndrome, and Fanconi anemia

- Disorders of RBC membrane: Hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary pyropoikilocytosis, and hereditary stomatocytosis syndromes
