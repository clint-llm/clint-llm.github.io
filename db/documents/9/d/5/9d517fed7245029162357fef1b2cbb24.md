Mortality rates from stroke have declined in recent years due to better medical care. The mortality rate following the first ischemic stroke and within the first month of onset is 16% to 23%. This also is proportionally associated with increased morbidity rates. Stroke is the most common neurological cause of lost disability-adjusted life years in developing and developed countries.

Disability caused by an embolic stroke after 6 months may be severe especially because of cortical functional deficits such as aphasia, hemianopia, and cognitive impairment, in addition to the sensory and motor deficits with impaired gait. Speech and swallow evaluations are mandatory for all stroke patients to screen for dysphagias and therefore avoid the risk of aspiration pneumonia which may be fatal. We should also consider screening for depression, in addition to infections secondary to bedsores and urinary tract infections.

Early clinical deterioration in the course of acute stroke is associated with poor prognosis and increased morbidity and mortality.
