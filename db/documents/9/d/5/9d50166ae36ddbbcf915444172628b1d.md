Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent in COVID-19, has created a global pandemic and overwhelmed hospital systems globally. Monoclonal antibody therapy has been suggested as an option for preventing the progression of acute COVID-19 infections to severe COVID-19 disease in high-risk individuals. Many monoclonal antibodies received emergency use authorizations for this purpose; however, as the virus evolved, many antibodies became ineffective. This activity outlines the indications, actions, contraindications, and adverse events for monoclonal antibody therapy used as a valuable treatment for outpatient COVID-19 infections. The latest guidelines regarding this therapy in light of emerging variants and subvariants are discussed.

**Objectives:**
- Assess the risks and benefits of monoclonal antibody therapy in managing outpatient COVID-19 infections. 
- Recognize the indications and contraindications for monoclonal antibody therapy in managing outpatient COVID-19 infections.
- Identify the potential adverse reactions to monoclonal antibody therapy in managing outpatient COVID-19.
- Apply effective interprofessional team processes when administering monoclonal antibodies and monitoring for adverse events such as transfusion reactions and anaphylaxis.
