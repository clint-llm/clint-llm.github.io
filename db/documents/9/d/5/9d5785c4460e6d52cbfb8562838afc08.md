Kernicterus: Unconjugated bilirubin is fat-soluble and can cross the cell membranes. At high serum levels, probably above 25 mg/dL, unconjugated bilirubin can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause neurotoxicity. It is more commonly seen in Crigler-Najjar type I syndrome. Still, patients with Crigler-Najjar type II syndrome are not spared, as in a few cases where serum bilirubin level may rise to 40 mg/dL. The most commonly affected areas of the brain include the hippocampus, geniculate bodies, basal ganglia, and nerve nuclei.

Chronic jaundice: Persistence of disease and delays in diagnosis leads to chronic jaundice. The serum level of bilirubin increases progressively due to the limited excretion of bilirubin. At the later stages, a wide range of tissues have involvement, with significant deposition of bilirubin all over the body.

Cholelithiasis: Increased concentration of unconjugated bilirubin can lead to gallstone formation. As this process takes time, it usually appears later in life.

Liver cirrhosis: Liver cirrhosis develops over a long time. A child born with Crigler-Najjar syndrome has a healthy liver in most cases. The exact mechanism of liver cirrhosis is still unknown. However, it may result from chronic biliary obstruction secondary to cholelithiasis, toxicity from drugs primarily metabolized in the liver, toxicity from phototherapy, and heme degradation products.
