Otitis media is a multifactorial disease. Infectious, allergic, and environmental factors contribute to otitis media.

These causes and risk factors include:

- Decreased immunity due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), diabetes, and other immuno-deficiencies

- Genetic predisposition

- Mucins that include abnormalities of this gene expression, especially upregulation of MUC5B

- Anatomic abnormalities of the palate and tensor veli palatini

- Ciliary dysfunction

- Cochlear implants

- Vitamin A deficiency

- Bacterial pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis are responsible for more than 95%

- Viral pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus

- Allergies

- Lack of breastfeeding

- Passive smoke exposure

- Daycare attendance

- Lower socioeconomic status

- Family history of recurrent AOM in parents or siblings
