**Macroscopy**

Grossly, myxopapillary ependymomas are sausage-shaped and often encapsulated. They are reddish to purplish in color and soft in consistency.

**Microscopy**

Histologically, myxopapillary ependymomas are characterized by a papillary architecture. In the center of the papillae, there are blood vessels that are surrounded by cuboidal to spindled glial cells. The stroma is myxoid and alcian blue–positive.

**Immunohistochemistry**

An immunohistochemical study is frequently required to distinguish myxopapillary ependymoma from chondrosarcoma or chordoma. The tumor cells are often positive for S-100, GFAP, CD99, COX-2. However, they are negative for endomysial antibody (EMA).
