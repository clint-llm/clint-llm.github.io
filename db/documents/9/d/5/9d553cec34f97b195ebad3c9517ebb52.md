Initial treatment should begin with simple first aid. Elevate the extremity above the heart or at least in a neutral position. The activity of sphingomyelinase D is temperature dependent so an ice pack to the area should help halt the necrosis process.

There is scant evidence for the use of dapsone or antivenom.

Management for systemic symptoms is different than for local effects; hospital admission is the recommendation for patients with hemolytic anemia, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation or end-stage organ failure.  Treatment of these conditions is not different in this scenario than it would be for any other cause.

In children, systemic loxoscelism may preclude skin findings and should be considered as a differential in pediatric patients with undifferentiated acute hemolytic anemia especially in regions known to have the brown recluse spider. Hemolysis has been reported up to 7 days after spider bite so adequate follow up instructions should be given to parents of children even if there are no systemic findings during the ED visit.
