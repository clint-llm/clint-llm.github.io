As Addison crisis is life-threatening, treatment should be initiated immediately when the diagnosis is suspected. However, blood samples should be saved for subsequent measurement of ACTH and cortisol levels. It is important to remember that a random measurement of plasma cortisol cannot confirm or exclude the diagnosis unless cortisol is unequivocally elevated. Elevation of ACTH with low cortisol is diagnostic of a primary adrenal problem. Measurement of cortisol in the ACTH stimulation test may be performed in equivocal cases where baseline lab evaluation cannot confirm the diagnosis. PRA is often elevated and is indicative of mineralocorticoid deficiency along with low aldosterone levels.

Patients with adrenal crisis require the following:

- Fluid resuscitation with intravenous (IV) normal saline (to correct volume depletion)

- Dextrose (to correct hypoglycemia)

- Hormone replacement to correct a lack of circulating glucocorticoid

The first-line hormonal treatment is hydrocortisone. As stress dose hydrocortisone has significant mineralocorticoid activity, fludrocortisone (synthetic mineralocorticoid) is usually not required in the acute phase. Stress dosing of hydrocortisone for acute adrenal crisis is 50 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2, which can be given as a continuous infusion. The typical replacement fluid after a normal saline bolus is D5 normal saline. Beware that if left untreated, adrenal crisis can be fatal.

The typical replacement oral dose of hydrocortisone is 10 to 15 mg/m2/day divided into two to three doses in adults. If compliance with frequent dosing is an issue, more potent glucocorticoids can be given less frequently, for example, prednisone QD-bid and dexamethasone QD; however, prednisone and dexamethasone do not have mineralocorticoid activity.

Also, mineralocorticoids should be replaced in the form of fludrocortisone at 50 micrograms/day to 200 micrograms/day (0.05 to 0.2 mg/day). In the presence of fever, infection, or other illnesses, the hydrocortisone dose should be doubled to account for stress response. This should be tailored according to the degree to stress. Identification and treatment of underlying causes such as sepsis are critical for an optimal outcome.

During replacement treatment, the following should be monitored to assess the adequacy of replacement therapy:

- Signs and symptoms suggestive of adrenal insufficiency

- Measurement of serum electrolytes, cortisol, and ACTH

- Measurement of plasma renin activity.

Patients who are non-stressed can be treated with either hydrocortisone or prednisone with or without fludrocortisone.
