Complications related to neuronal and glioneuronal brain tumors are variable based upon different treatment modalities. Adverse effects from anti-epileptic medications are common and include irritability, dizziness, drowsiness, blurred vision, difficulty with coordination, generalized fatigue, and weight gain.

More serious side-effects are also possible, including severe skin reactions and congenital disabilities in children if taken during pregnancy. Other complications are related to surgical intervention, including infection, intracranial and extracranial bleeding, postoperative hydrocephalus, new neurological deficit, lack of seizure control, injury to structures surrounding the tumor such as cranial nerves or blood vessels, cerebral edema and brain swelling, and death.
