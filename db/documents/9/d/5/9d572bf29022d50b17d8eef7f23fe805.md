Maternal blood is collected through a standard blood draw. Maternal serum levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP), pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG), inhibin A, and unconjugated estriol are measured. Cell-free fetal DNA is isolated and purified from maternal plasma.Â Maternal carrier screening involves collecting a sample of blood, saliva, or buccal tissue.
