The stylohyoid muscle consists of a single belly that runs anteroinferior from the styloid process to the hyoid bone.

Ozgur et al. studied 56 specimens of stylohyoid muscles. They found that the point of insertion on the hyoid bone corresponded to the junction of the body and greater horn in 60.7% of cases, and in 39.3% of cases, the insertion point differed.

The stylohyoid muscle connects to the posterior belly of the digastric muscle in its path. It lies anteromedial to the superior margin of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. The styloglossus muscle lies medially and anterior to the stylohyoid muscle. The stylopharyngeal muscle is located between the stylohyoid and the styloglossus muscle. The stylohyoid and the styloglossus muscles form a space that gives passage to the external carotid artery superiorly and the facial artery inferiorly as it courses from the retrostyloid area to the prestyloid area.

**The Styloid Process**

The styloid process is a long needle-like structure that extends from the inferior surface of the petrous temporal bone.

The styloid process' average length is 2 to 3 cm, and it tapers from its base to the apex.

The styloid process locates in between the external and internal carotid arteries.

**Function**

The stylohyoid muscle connects the hyoid bone to the base of the skull, and it pulls the hyoid bone upward and backward, resulting in elevation of the base of the tongue and elongation of the floor of the mouth. This movement helps in deglutition and this muscle functions in association with other suprahyoid muscles. When the infrahyoid muscles stabilize the hyoid bone, the suprahyoid muscles depress the mandible and open the mouth widely. They also play an active role in improving the flexion movement of the neck and producing treble sounds.
