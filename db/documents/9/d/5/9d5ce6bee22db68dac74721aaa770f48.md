Events like massive hemoptysis, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary venous air embolism, and a large hemothorax cause mortality from PTLB. Pneumothorax (most common complication), pulmonary hemorrhage, hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, and seeding along with the needle tract cause morbidity.

In a transbronchial biopsy, reaction to the topical anesthetic, ET tube induced trauma, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, hypoventilation, pneumothorax, and hemorrhage are some of the potentially severe complications. Owing to its safety profile, a faster recovery period, and lesser complications, VATS has largely replaced open thoracotomies worldwide. However, potential complications following VATS include post-op pain and air leak, hypoxemia, atelectasis, bleeding, and wound infection.
