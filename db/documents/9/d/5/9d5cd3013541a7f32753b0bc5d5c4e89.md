Surgery to the iris sphincter is done for functional or cosmetics issues. In general, surgery is warranted if the patient is having photophobia or blurry vision that cannot be controlled with drops. Patients can use pilocarpine drops to decrease the size of their pupils if some function of the sphincter remains. Reading glasses may also be necessary if the patient cannot accommodate. If inflammation is present after a trauma, the patient should be treated with steroid drops until resolved and re-assessed for sphincter function.
