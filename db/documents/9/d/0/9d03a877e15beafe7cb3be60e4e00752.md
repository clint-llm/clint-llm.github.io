Prognosis is good if acute intermittent porphyria is recognized early and treated at the time. The mortality has decreased through the past decades to 5% to 20% (on acute attacks) thanks to new methods of diagnosis and treatment. But if the disease is resistant to heme therapy and is recurrent, the only currently approved way to reduce mortality is with an orthotopic liver transplant.

With ongoing trials exploring the efficacy and safety of ERT and liver gene therapy, the prognosis of AIP is expected to become better very soon.

Complications of acute intermittent porphyria (vide infra); arterial hypertension, chronic kidney disease, neurologic deficits, and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma must remain in check by ensuring close observation and review of the patient.
