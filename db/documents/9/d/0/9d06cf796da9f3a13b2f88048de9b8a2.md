The diaphragm is composed of the pleuroperitoneal membranes, a septum transversum, the dorsal mesentery of the esophagus, and muscular ingrowths from lateral body walls. The septum transversum is formed in the cervical region, adjacent to the third, fourth, and fifth somites. The myoblasts from these somites mature into the phrenic nerve and migrate caudally with the diaphragm to provide motor efferent and sensory afferent innervations.

Many postulates make assumptions regarding the origination of the Harrison groove. It is most likely due to abnormal contractions of the diaphragm during infancy.
