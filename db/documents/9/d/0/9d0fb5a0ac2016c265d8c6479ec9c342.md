Lung transplantation remains the ultimate treatment for end-stage lung disease. With the increasing number of patients with chronic lung diseases as well as the continuous rise in the patients with long-term sequelae of covid-19 induced lung damage, the donor organ shortage will only get enhanced in the coming years leading to an increasing number of deaths of patients waiting for a lung transplant. Ex vivo lung perfusion remains a promising and developing modality to assess and recondition marginal donor lungs prior to transplantation.
