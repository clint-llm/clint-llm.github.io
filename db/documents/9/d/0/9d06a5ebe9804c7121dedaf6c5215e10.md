For patients that have developed perioperative AKI, there are several things they should be advised of in order to preserve renal function, including avoiding nephrotoxic agents. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to cause interstitial nephritis, which can lead to the development of AKI or the worsening of existing AKI. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are known to affect renal autoregulation, although the avoidance of these mediations in the perioperative period is currently a topic of debate.
