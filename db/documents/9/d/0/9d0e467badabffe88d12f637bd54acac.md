As stated above, the anal triangle contains the anal canal and two ischiorectal fossae.

**Anal Canal**

The anal canal is the hindmost part of the gastrointestinal system.

The anal canal divides into the upper two-thirds and lower one-third by the pectinate line. Simple columnar epithelium is present above the pectinate line, and the stratified squamous epithelium appears below it.

**Ischiorectal Fossae**

The ischiorectal fossae contain the inferior rectal vessels and nerve and ischioanal fat, which supports the anal canal and allows for the anal canal to expand during defecation. The pudendal (Alcockâ€™s) canals lie on the lateral wall of the ischiorectal fossae and contain the pudendal nerve and internal pudendal vessels.

Boundaries of the ischiorectal fossae

- Anterior- sphincter urethrae and deep transverse perineal muscles

- Posterior- gluteus maximus muscle and sacrotuberous ligament

- Superomedial- external anal sphincter and levator ani muscle

- Lateral- fascia covering the obturator internus muscle

- Floor- skin
