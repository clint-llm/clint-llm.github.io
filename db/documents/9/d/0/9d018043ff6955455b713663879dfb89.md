Myelosuppression is the most dreaded adverse effect of cytarabine and can present as acute and severe pancytopenia with striking megaloblastic changes.

Cytarabine might affect the cardiovascular system also, causing angina pectoris and even pericarditis. Cytarabine syndrome is a rare illness produced shortly after administration of cytarabine, characterized by non-specific symptoms like fever, malaise, rash, joint pain, and muscle pain, and is manageable with corticosteroids. Severe symptoms tend to occur more commonly in patients with renal impairment as the renal clearance of the drug decreases.
