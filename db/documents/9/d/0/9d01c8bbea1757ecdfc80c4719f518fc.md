Surgeons use the femoral artery for arterial access in many procedures, including aortic aneurysm repairs.****It is essential to identify the femoral nerve before doing such a procedure, as damage to the nerve can result in loss of function of any of the muscles innervated by the femoral nerve.

Researchers have found the branches to the rectus femoris to range between 1 and 4 branches, with the most common innervation pattern being two branches. As a result, it is important to be aware and identify the possible variants and landmarks of the different possible branches.

When the great saphenous nerve is removed for use in cardiac bypass procedures, the saphenous nerve is also commonly removed, resulting in anesthesia over the medial leg as far distally as the medial malleolus. One should forewarn the patient, so they do not become frightened by the sudden appearance of loss of feeling in the distribution of the saphenous nerve.
