Adverse effects for immediate release oxybutynin include dry mouth (71.4%), dizziness (16.6%), constipation (15.1%), somnolence (14.0%), and nausea (11.6%). Less common side effects include blurred vision (9.6%), urinary hesitation (8.5%), urinary retention (6.0%), and dyspepsia (6.0%). Of note, dry mouth was a dose-related side effect.

The side effects of extended-release oxybutynin are similar, but rates have been reported as lower than the immediate-release form. These include dry mouth (29% to 61%), constipation (7% to 13%). somnolence (2% to 12%), headache (6% to 10%), diarrhea (7% to 9%), nausea (2% to 9%), blurred vision (1% to 8%), dry eyes (3% to 6%). Again, dry mouth was a dose-related side effect. Adverse events led to the discontinuation of medicine in 6.8% of patients.

Application site reactions were reported in 5.4% of patients for oxybutynin gel and 16.8% for oxybutynin transdermal system (versus 6.1% of patients in the placebo group). Dry mouth was much less common in patients receiving transdermal oxybutynin than the oral forms, reported as 7.5% for the gel and 9.6% for the patch. Adverse effects are often dose-related.
