Diagnosis of this condition is based on a thorough clinical examination and measurement of urinary GAG levels which is a useful screening test. A positive test is suggestive of an MPS, but false-negative results are common.[18] Positive family history is often present.

Enzyme activity assays based on cultured fibroblasts, leukocytes, plasma, and serum are confirmatory and are considered the gold standard. By using an enzyme assay or DNA analysis, it is sometimes possible to distinguish Hurler syndrome from the other closely related MPH I subtypes, along with symptom severity and age of onset should be considered, establishing a specific diagnosis.

Prenatal diagnosis: Measurement of enzyme activity in cultivated chorionic villus or amniocytes can be used for the prenatal diagnosis.

Gene sequencing can be done to identify the mutations in families at risk so that patients can be offered genetic counseling and carrier testing to allow for more informed family planning.
