Many patients present without any specific signs or symptoms.

When patients are symptomatic, the most common presentation include abdominal pain and/or a palpable mass in the upper abdomen.Â Less commonly, patients with advanced cystic lesions present similar to those with pancreatic ductal carcinoma, with abdominal pain, weight loss, early satiety secondary to compression of the stomach wall by the adjacent pancreatic mass (gastric outlet obstruction), obstructive jaundice due to obstruction of the biliary tree (may lead to acute cholangitis) and pancreatic duct obstruction causing pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and recurrent pancreatitis.

True cystic lesions may be confused with pseudocysts leading to similarities in the presentations and the characteristics of imaging studies.
