Eliciting the clonus reaction can be done in the same manner as eliciting a muscle stretch reflex, which involves tapping the tendon of the joint when it is in a relaxed position often at ninety degrees of flexion (see MSR Statpearls article for a more detailed description of these techniques).

For the ankle this involves allowing the patient to relax with a passively flexed ankle to about ninety degrees and a passively flexed knee if possible; this usually involves the examiner supporting the leg with the hand not performing clonus. Next, at the ankle, the examiner places their hand on the dorsum of the patient’s forefoot and briskly dorsiflexes it, after which the examiner continues to maintain dorsiflexion pressure. It is against this pressure that the clonus beats will be felt, and the rhythm and number of beats can be appreciated. Each beat will be felt as a plantarflexion followed by a relaxation. The initial beat is the longest, with decreasing duration of beats until the fourth beat, after which the beat frequency becomes equivalent from one to the next.

At the knee, the process is somewhat similar, but the positioning is different. The knee should be completely extended (passively) with the thigh and leg muscles completely relaxed. Then the patella is briskly moved distally using the examiner’s fingers, and a light pressure is maintained in the distal direction. Each beat of clonus will be felt as a proximal movement of the patella followed by relaxation.
