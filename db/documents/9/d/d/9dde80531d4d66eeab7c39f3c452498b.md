Prolactin levels need to be taken at least once in the evaluation of hyperprolactinemia. Prolactin levels are measured using a sandwich ELISA assay where a prolactin molecule needs to bind to a capture as well as a detection antibody to be measured. Rarely the “hook effect” may be seen in large prolactinomas with an extremely high prolactin level. Due to the extremely high prolactin levels, the number of prolactin molecules binding to both the capture and detection antibody is actually low. Dilution of the sample to a 1:100 concentration and remeasuring shows a paradoxical increase in the prolactin level. The “hook effect” needs to be considered in large pituitary adenomas which present with galactorrhea, hypogonadism but only mildly elevated levels of prolactin.

Hormonal assessment of other pituitary hormones should be taken as indicated by the clinical history and exam. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary gland may reveal lesions of the pituitary gland responsible for hyperprolactinemia. Visual field assessment needs to be performed when the tumor is in contact with the optic chiasma on MRI.
