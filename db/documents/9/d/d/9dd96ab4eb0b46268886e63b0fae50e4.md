Patients will classically present with acute onset of bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramping, usually without fever. Diarrhea initially may not be bloody, often being watery in consistency. Most patients will not manifest a temperature during the initial presentation and evaluation. As a result of nausea, vomiting, and profuse diarrhea, patients will often note dehydration, asthenia, and decreased urine output. Patient history should include assessment of risk factors including (1) consumption of raw or undercooked meats or dairy products, especially unpasteurized milk, (2) exposure to ruminant animals or petting zoos, and (3) exposure to other farm scenarios.

Abdominal tenderness on physical examination reflects E. coli 0157: H7 Shiga toxin-induced intestinal vasculitis and inflammation. The abdominal discomfort from enterohemorrhagic E. coli generally manifests more severely than other forms of enteritis as a result of the hemorrhagic vasculitis. Systemic signs of dehydration such as dry mucous membranes, tachycardia, decreased skin turgor, slow capillary refill, cold extremities, and delirium, presage worsened morbidity, particularly in children.
