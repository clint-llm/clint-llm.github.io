Sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) neuralgia is a complex disease characterized by chronic head and neck pain, often accompanied by autonomic features. Although symptoms are highly variable, patients typically experience dull headaches associated with pain in the maxillary arch and teeth. The onset of intense pain can be accompanied by profuse sweating and vasomotor changes. The SPG has been a target for numerous procedures to ease symptoms of myofascial pain, post-herpetic neuralgia, post-traumatic headache, cluster headache, and pain originating from the temporomandibular joint and various head and neck cancers. This activity reviews the role of radiofrequency ablation of the SPG, its indications and contraindications, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with facial and neurological pain syndromes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for radiofrequency ablation of the SPG.
- Explain the technique of radiofrequency ablation of the SPG.
- Review the contraindications for radiofrequency ablation of the SPG.
- Summarize the clinically significant factors that make SPG a viable procedure for patients where the procedure can provide therapeutic benefit.
