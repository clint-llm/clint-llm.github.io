Dupilumab is an injectable prescription medication administered subcutaneously to treat severe and refractory forms of atopic dermatitis (AD). It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2017 to treat moderate-to-severe, resistant, atopic dermatitis (AD) that is unresponsive to conventional therapy, including topical corticosteroids. Dupilumab is also used as maintenance treatment for asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis in both adults and children, in conjunction with other medications. Non-FDA-approved indications include allergic contact dermatitis, hand dermatitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, prurigo nodularis, and alopecia areata. Extensive literature suggests the efficacy of dupilumab in treating conditions characterized by Th2-mediated inflammation. Clinical trials are currently in the pipeline to explore the potential of dupilumab in treating autoimmune blistering diseases, such as bullous pemphigoid. This activity describes dupilumab, including its mechanism of action, adverse event and safety profiles, eligible patient populations, and contraindications. It also highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing patients on dupilumab treatment.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the therapeutic mechanism of action of dupilumab.
- Identify the indications, both approved and off-label, for dupilumab.
- Review the adverse event and accompanying monitoring for dupilumab.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes, treatment efficacy, and follow-up coordination for patients receiving dupilumab.
