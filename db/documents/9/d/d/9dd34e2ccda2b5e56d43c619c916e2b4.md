Endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) is primarily a disease of infants and children, but can rarely present in adulthood as well.

The endocardium is normally a thin layer of endothelial cells lining the inner side of the heart chambers.Â The presentation is versatile and is often overlapping with other cardiac anomalies. It is frequently noticed with other congenital heart conditions like hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
