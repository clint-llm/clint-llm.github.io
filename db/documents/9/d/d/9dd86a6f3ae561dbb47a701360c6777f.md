Indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is the first-line treatment for chronic paroxysmal hemicrania. Indomethacin dosed either 25 mg or 50 mg orally three times a day is typically effective for preventing attacks in CPH. Indomethacin is effective for preventing headaches in paroxysmal hemicrania, hemicrania continua, primary cough headache, and primary stabbing headache. Prolonged indomethacin use can predispose to peptic ulcers; for this reason, gastrointestinal prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor is recommended while taking indomethacin, and limiting treatment with indomethacin to as short a duration as possible is ideal for preventing side effects. Indomethacin should be avoided in patients with renal insufficiency, prior stroke, or myocardial infarction. Calcium channel blockers, acetazolamide, topiramate, melatonin, and corticosteroids can also be used for preventing CPH, although they are less effective than indomethacin. Pericranial nerve blocks do not appear to be effective in treating chronic paroxysmal hemicrania.
