Myocarditis refers to the inflammation of the myocardium, resulting in tissue degeneration or necrosis. Previously known as inflammatory myocarditis, it typically affects younger people. Myocarditis is classified as acute, fulminant, chronic active, or chronic persistent.

The clinical presentation is variable and includes febrile illness, mild chest pain, arrhythmias, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or death. The clinical diagnosis is often challenging, and the management is usually supportive.
