The etiologies of urge incontinence often involve the detrusor muscle of the urinary bladder, which is the specialized smooth muscle in the bladder wall. These include detrusor muscle overactivity, poor compliance of the detrusor, and bladder hypersensitivity.

- Detrusor overactivity is believed to be the uninhibited (involuntary) contractions of the smooth muscle during bladder filling. Significant causes leading to this overactivity could be neurologic disorders (spinal cord injury), abnormalities in the urinary bladder, and an increase or alteration in the bladder microbiome.

- Poor detrusor compliance results in the failure of the bladder to stretch and thereby increase in intravesicular pressure. It also involvesÂ discomfort during filling and limited capacity. Pelvic radiotherapy or prolonged periods of catheterization can often lead to this.

- Bladder hypersensitivity and the sensory role of the urothelium are believed to be intertwined. It has recently been established that as the urothelium acts as a pivotal mediator of bladder function, the role of urothelial inflammation and infection can lead to the overactive bladder with or without urgency.
