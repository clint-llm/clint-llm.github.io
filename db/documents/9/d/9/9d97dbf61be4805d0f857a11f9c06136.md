Toxicity is common with mexiletine and can manifest in several organ systems. Cardiovascular, CNS, and GI-related symptoms most commonly occur. Cardiovascular toxicity can present as varying degrees of heart block, heart failure, exacerbation of cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.

Management of mexiletine toxicity is by symptomatic treatment. Without question, discontinue mexiletine when toxicity presents. Depending on the severity of the toxicity, patients may require invasive therapy to clear the drug, such as hemodialysis or hemoperfusion. Denaro published a paper in 1989 stating that such interventions may play a role, in addition to extracorporeal circulatory assistance where available.
