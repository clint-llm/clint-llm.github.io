Standard Ceruloplasmin measurement is via a blood test, which often occurs by analyzing a serum sample with immunoassays, immunoturbidimetry, or immunonephelometry. The sample must be spun and separated as soon as the laboratory receives it and assays it promptly. The samples may be stored at 4 degrees Celsius for up to three days or longer at -70 degrees Celsius. The serum test is often part of the workup when there is suspicion of Wilson disease and is commonly ordered along with urine copper levels. Several factors, including diet, hormone levels, and other genetic disorders, may influence the resulting ceruloplasmin levels in the urine and serum.

**Deficiency States**

Low ceruloplasmin levels may indicate the following pathological conditions: Wilson disease, Menke disease, copper deficiency, aceruloplasminemia, or in states of low protein energy intake (e.g., malnutrition.)

**Excess**

High ceruloplasmin levels may suggest or be present in physiological and pathological circumstances, including pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, copper toxicity/zinc deficiency, lymphoma, lung cancer, acute and chronic inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, angina, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

- Adult: 300 to 1200 (pregnant)

Wilson disease is diagnosed based on clinical presentation, biochemical tests, and ATP7B mutation analysis. Regarding serum ceruloplasmin testing, only those with low serum ceruloplasmin, low serum copper, and high urine copper meet the criteria for Wilson disease. However, some patients diagnosed with Wilson disease exhibit normal ceruloplasmin levels. When urine and serum concentrations of copper and ceruloplasmin are low, the patient suffers from a copper deficiency. Factors interfering with the body's ability to metabolize copper, such as chelator medications, diet, and iron restriction, may also affect serum ceruloplasmin levels.
