Typically, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease includes four phases:

- Necrosis: Disruption of the blood supply leads to infarction of the femoral capital epiphysis, particularly the subchondral cortical bone. Subsequently, this leads to a cessation of the growth of the ossific nucleus. The infarcted bone softens and dies.

- Fragmentation: The body reabsorbs the infarcted bone.

- Reossification: Osteoblastic activity takes over, and the femoral epiphysis reestablishes.

- Remodeling: The new femoral head may be enlarged or flattened. It reshapes during growth. Those that respond to conservative treatment will usually show healing in 2 to 4 years.
