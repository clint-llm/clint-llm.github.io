There are various mechanisms described for the development of hypertension which includes increased salt absorption resulting in volume expansion, an impaired response of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system.  These changes lead to the development of increased total peripheral resistance and increased afterload which in turn leads to the development of hypertension.
