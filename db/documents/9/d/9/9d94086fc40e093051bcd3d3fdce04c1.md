Patients should be encouraged to go to an emergency department if they develop sudden or worsening airway obstruction symptoms; this is particularly important in the postoperative period. Education and training are vital in airway stenosis patients and their carers. Pediatric basic life support and tracheostomy management are essential skills for parents of children with congenital glottic stenosis. Patients should receive information regarding the recurrent nature of glottic stenosis and the need for repeated procedures. However, patients should be encouraged that good long-term outcomes are achievable, but it requires time and regular follow-up visits.
