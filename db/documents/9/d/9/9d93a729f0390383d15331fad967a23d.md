Left ventricular false aneurysm is a rare complication of myocardial rupture contained by non-myocardial tissue. The most common cause of a false aneurysm is a transmural myocardial infarction, but it can also develop following cardiac surgery, endocarditis, or trauma. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of left ventricular false aneurysm and reviews the role of the healthcare team in diagnosing and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of left ventricular false aneurysms.
- Outline the evaluation of a patient with a left ventricular false aneurysm.
- Describe the treatment and management options available for a patient with a left ventricular false aneurysm. 
- Review the importance of improving coordination among the healthcare team members to improve outcomes for patients diagnosed with a left ventricular false aneurysm.
