Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs that can present within the ovary and are most commonly benign functional cysts that regress spontaneously. They are commonly found incidentally on examination or imaging. In certain instances, they may become so enlarged that the increased weight may cause the ovary to rotate on itself, cutting off the blood supply and resulting in a gynecologic emergency known as ovarian torsion, which requires surgical management.

Ovarian cysts can also rupture and cause life-threatening hemorrhage. Large cysts should be removed to prevent complications. If one may experience a sudden onset of unilateral moderate to severe sharp lower abdominal pain, associated with or without nausea and vomiting and strenuous activity such as sexual intercourse or exercise, prompt evaluation is mandatory.
