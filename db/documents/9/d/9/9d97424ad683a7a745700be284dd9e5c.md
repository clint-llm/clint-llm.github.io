The various intraocular conditions leading to complicated cataracts are:

- Inflammatory conditions include inflammations of the uveal tract (iridocyclitis, pars planitis, posterior uveitis), hypopyon corneal ulcer, and endophthalmitis. The cataract begins as a posterior subcapsular cataract mainly.

- Degenerative conditions include essential iris atrophy, Retinitis Pigmentosa, myopic chorioretinal degenerations, and other pigmentary retinal dystrophies. The development of cataracts is the most common complication of retinitis pigmentosa in the anterior segment.

- Retinal detachment â€“ longstanding cases of retinal detachment can lead to complicated cataracts.

- Glaucoma- primary or secondary glaucoma. Glaucomfleckens are grey-white epithelial and anterior cortical lens opacities following an episode of highly raised intraocular pressure.

- Intraocular tumors- retinoblastoma, melanoma, metastatic tumors involving the choroid or the anterior segment, can lead to complicated cataracts.

Clinically, most complicated cataracts occur secondary to chronic intraocular inflammation due to the various causes mentioned above and the use of corticosteroids in treating the inflammation. Hence, detailed knowledge of the primary intraocular condition is required to manage the condition skillfully.
