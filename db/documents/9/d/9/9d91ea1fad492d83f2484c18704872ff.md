When AEF is suspected in the hemodynamically unstable patient, one should proceed immediately to surgery without further diagnostic studies; however, if no history of AAA or prior surgical repair of the aorta is known, initial assessment of the abdomen by ultrasonography (US) for aneurysmal disease in an unstable patient with ongoing resuscitation prior to proceeding to the operation room (OR) may be performed. Bedside US is useful in determining if a AAA is present, but due to bowel gas and the enteral distention commonly associated with AEF, it is a poor diagnostic tool for diagnosing AEFs.

In a hemodynamically stable patient with ongoing GI bleeding, upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has reasonably been reported as being completed first; unfortunately, EGD is a poor investigatory tool for the diagnosis of AEF with a sensitivity of only approximately 50%.

CTA is also the preferred imaging modality when compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA). In one head to head study, CTA was demonstrated to better identify both lesions with the potential to bleed as well as lesions that were actively bleeding when compared with DSA.

Despite correct imaging, the identification of AEFs remains difficult, and many diagnoses are not made until autopsy.
