Evaluation of the patient with skin injury due to radiation treatment should include all relevant tests necessary for initiation of a specific treatment modality such as hyperbaric oxygen treatment; these tests would include a chest x-ray, a hemoglobin A1C, a sedimentation rate, and a complete blood count (CBC) if infection might be present.

Other tests may be ordered as applicable depending on the presentation of the patient at the time of the initial visit or if any complications were to arise during treatment.
