All the extra-ocular muscles receive supply from the oculomotor nerve except the lateral rectus that is supplied by the abducens nerve and the superior oblique that is supplied by the trochlear nerve. The oculomotor nerve also innervates levator palpebrae superioris.

- The lateral rectus helps in the abduction of the eyeball.

- The medial rectus is responsible for the adduction of the eyeball.

- Superior oblique and superior rectus primarily help in the intorsion of the eyeball.

- Inferior oblique and inferior rectus cause extortion of the eyeball.

- Levator palpebrae superioris elevates the eyelids.

Intrinsic muscles of the eye are present in the iris, a radial group called the dilator pupillae, and a circular group called the sphincter pupillae. They control dilation and constriction of the pupil, respectively.

Sphincter pupillae receive supply from the short ciliary nerve and helps in pupillary constriction. Innervation of the dilator pupillae is by the sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical ganglion and helps in the dilation of the pupil.
