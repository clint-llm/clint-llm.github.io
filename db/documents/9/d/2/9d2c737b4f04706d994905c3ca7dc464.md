Prognosis depends on the cause of the herniation, the level of elevation in the intracranial pressure, the presence and duration of resultant cerebral ischemia, and the intracranial structures affected. While some patients make a full recovery, many are left with temporary as well as permanent neurological deficits and disabilities. Reports suggest mortality rates as high as 33% in children with severe nonpenetrating traumatic brain injuriesÂ and 60% among patients developing transtentorial herniation.

Overall, morbidity and mortality rates from traumatic brain injury have decreased in recent years. A 2017 CDC surveillance report noted that 73% of patients discharged following traumatic brain injury had a good functional recovery.
