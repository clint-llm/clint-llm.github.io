Carbon dioxide (CO2) angiography is an alternative to conventionial iodinated contrast angiography, particularly in situations where there are contraindications to iodinated contrast or where a less viscous or cheaper imaging contrast can be used to the operator's advantage. This activity educates the participant on indications, contraindications, and techniques for performing CO2 angiography.

**Objectives:**
- Identify indications and contraindications for CO2 angiography.
- Recognize complications of CO2 angiography.
- Describe techniques for performing CO2 angiography.

- Explain advantages and disadvantages of CO2 angiography compared to iodinated contrast angiography and how an interprofessional team can use CO2 angiography to provide better patient care.
