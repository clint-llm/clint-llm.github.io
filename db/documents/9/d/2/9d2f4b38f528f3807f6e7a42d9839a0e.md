The pudendal nerve is a sensory and motor nerve arising from the sacral plexus and forms from the ventral spinal nerve roots S2-S4.

Trauma and disorders that affect the pudendal nerve disproportionately affect the sensory portion of the nerve.

The four common locations of pudendal nerve entrapment include:

- Type 1: Inferior to the piriformis muscle, where the pudendal nerve leaves the greater sciatic notch.

- Type 2: Between the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments (the most common site of entrapment).

- Type 3: Inside Alcock's canal.

- Type 4: Terminal branches only (superficial and deep perineal nerves, inferior rectal nerves, and the penile or clitoral dorsal nerve.)

The most common cause of pudendal neuralgia is repetitive activities and overuse of the pelvic floor muscles, typically microtrauma from prolonged sitting. It can also be caused by repetitive sports activities (primarily cycling), motor vehicle accidents, falls, pelvic surgeries (especially pelvic prolapse procedures that utilize mesh), radiation therapy, ischial spinal fractures, tumors (benign and malignant), and obstetrical injuries.
