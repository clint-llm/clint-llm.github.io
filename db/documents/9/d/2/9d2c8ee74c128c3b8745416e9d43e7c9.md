There are over 1000 mutations resulting in PKU, the most common replaces arginine (Arg) with tryptophan (Trp) at position 408 (i.e., Arg408Trp). Mutations in PAH causing PKU are generally due to a reduced PAH activity or a reduced PAH expression resulting in increased blood levels of Phe and decreased Tyr levels. Most PKU-causing PAH variants result from PAH misfolding and/or instability.

Most PKU patients have 2 different PKU variants, i.e., they are compound heterozygotes.
