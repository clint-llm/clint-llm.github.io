Hands can perform a wide variety of functions; they provide us with agility, dexterity, and skills to perform both gross and fine motor movements. The ability to apply the precise amount of pressure necessary to hold an object comes from the stability and mobility supplied by the skeleton, muscles, and nerves.

Hand function plays a key role in occupational performance. The impairment of intrinsic muscles leads to a decreased strength of handgrip and characteristic deformities affecting the quality of life by impairing the skills that allow for independence and participation in various physical activities.
