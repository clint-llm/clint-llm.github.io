Most cases of Lambl excrescences remain asymptomatic. These only get complicated when they break off and embolize to distal organs like the brain, heart, and lungs. Embolic ischemic strokes, coronary embolisms causing acute coronary syndromes, and pulmonary embolisms if large enough are all complications associated with Lambl excrescences. Sometimes when they grow into giant excrescences, even without embolization, they can cause local mechanical valvular obstruction.
