The TPVB is indicated to provide anesthesia and analgesia of any hemithorax surgical procedure and when the associated pain is mainly unilateral of the chest and abdomen. Perioperative bilateral TPVB uses have also been described during the thoracic phase of major abdominal surgeries.

It is often used as an adjunct to multimodal postoperative analgesia in thoracic surgery, breast surgery, renal surgery, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery,  minimally invasive cardiac surgery, and more frequently indicated recently in breast reconstruction surgery in combination with general anesthesia.

The TPVB can be used as an alternative anesthesia technique for breast surgery in patients who may have a high risk of perioperative and postoperative complications after general anesthesia, especially elderly patients with low vital capacity and low lung reserve or patients with cardiac morbidity.

For major breast surgeries, recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of TPVB with minimal complications and a low conversion rate to general anesthesia, considerably improving the quality of postoperative recovery.
