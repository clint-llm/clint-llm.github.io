Active infection and patients with occluded central veins are considered absolute contraindications for TPVI. It is also important to evaluate all potential patients for unfavorable coronary anatomy that could result in coronary compression with valve placement, as coronary compression with valve dilation is an absolute contraindication. At this time, an RVOT diameter larger than the largest valve is considered a contraindication, as this would not allow secure valve placement. Recurrent infective endocarditis (IE) and active intravenous drug abuse are also considered higher long term risk for infection and are often considered contraindications.
