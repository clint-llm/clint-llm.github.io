The brachial plexus originates in the cervical spine, from the anterior divisions of spinal nerves C5 to T1. It divides into roots, trunks, divisions, cords, and branches. The medial brachial cutaneous nerve arises from the medial cord of the brachial plexus, originating from the nerve roots of C8 and T1, the lower trunk, and the anterior division of the plexus.
