Propofol is an intravenous anesthetic used for procedural sedation, during monitored anesthesia care, or as an induction agent for general anesthesia. It may be administered as a bolus or an infusion, or some combination of the two. Propofol is prepared in a lipid emulsion which gives it the characteristic milky white appearance and the colloquial name "milk of amnesia." The formula contains soybean oil, glycerol, egg lecithin, and a small amount of the preservative EDTA. Strict aseptic technique must be used when drawing up propofol as the emulsion can support microbial growth.
