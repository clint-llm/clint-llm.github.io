No controlled studies or guidelines exist for the treatment of acquired perforating dermatosis. AllÂ proposed treatments have their basis in previously published case reports or small series.

The goal of treatment should include the management of underlying disease and the relieve of the pruritus.

First-line treatment strategies include systemic or topical corticosteroids, retinoids, and keratolytic agents such as urea or salicylic acid. Emollients and oral antihistamines are frequently prescribed to relieve pruritus.

Tetracyclines have anti-inflammatory properties and are potent inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases.

Phototherapy in the form of NB-UVB and PUVA have shown some improvement in the management of pruritus and skin lesions.

Finally, combination treatment, rather than monotherapy, may be more successful.
