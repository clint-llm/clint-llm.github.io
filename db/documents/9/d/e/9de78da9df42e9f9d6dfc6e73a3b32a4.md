It is imperative to exclude donor sites with past traumatic injury or surgery in the pre-operative evaluation consultation. The Allen test should also be done in the pre-operative consultation and repeated in pre-operative holding on the day of surgery. The refill of the entire hand in six seconds or less will verify the necessary collateral flow. The communication between the surgical team, anesthesia, and nursing is crucial for the understanding that the donor forearm must not have any IVs or arterial lines. It is necessary to mark the forearm to say "no IVs" and/or "no lines".

Once the patient is brought into the operative suite, and they undergo general anesthesia, the OR table is turned 180 degrees. The donor's arm is placed on an arm board positioned 90 degrees from the body. The arm is then prepped with povidone-iodine or chlorohexidine from the axilla proximally to the distal digits. Sterile towels should be placed against the axilla to separate the flap arm from the rest of the body. The skin graft donor site should also be prepped with povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine and sterile towels placed in all four quadrants.

After the appropriate prepping and draping, a tourniquet is placed around the donor arm superior to the antecubital fossa, and the desired skin paddle pedicle vessels are marked on the forearm. The donor arm is exsanguinated using an Esmarch wrap, and the tourniquet is inflated to the ideal 250 mmHg just before the harvest of the flap.
