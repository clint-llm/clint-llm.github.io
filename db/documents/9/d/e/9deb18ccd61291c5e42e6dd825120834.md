Ophthalmic administration of fluorescein starts with a paper strip with one tip stained with fluorescein. The paper strip is moistened with saline water, then placed on the conjunctiva or inferior fornix. The patient may blink a few times to spread the dye across the eye.

For ocular foreign body removal, the clinician should instill 1 or 2 drops in the eyes pre-procedural.

Fluorescein solution may be administered orally and requires 10Â to 15 minutes before appearing. Although the solution is bitter, combining it with sugar or a beverage can increase palatability.

Intravenous injection of fluorescein sodium occurs at the antecubital vein. The dye appears almost immediately in the retina and choroidal vessels (in 7 to 14 seconds). In the case of anaphylaxis, IV access is still necessary for epinephrine.

After the administration of fluorescein, the examiner can extinguish the room light to view the fluorescence of the dye under cobalt blue light.
