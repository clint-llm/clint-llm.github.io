Management of pterygium still remains an enigma. Literature is full of a variety of surgical procedures with variable success rates. However, the recurrence of pterygium still remains the most inexplicable complication. 90% recurrences occur between the first and the third month. Recurrent pterygium cases are more difficult to handle than the primary pterygium, and it is of great importance to determine the treatment method with the lowest recurrence rate. Prompt referral by primary care providers to ophthalmologists is needed. A coordinated effort between physicians, optometrists, nurses, and pharmacists can benefit patients. [Leve 5]
