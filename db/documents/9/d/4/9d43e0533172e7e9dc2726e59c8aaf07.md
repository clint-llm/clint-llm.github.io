The diagnosis, treatment, and management of Bochdalek hernia is an interprofessional approach involving the coordination of care between obstetrics, pediatricians and/or primary care provider, radiology, thoracic surgery, and specialty-trained nurse. The care and monitoring of these patients are by ICU nurses who work with the team to evaluate the progression of improvement and identify untoward changes as quickly as possible. The nurse should also assist with the education of the family and keeping them apprised of the patient's condition. If the patient is suffering from a severe diaphragmatic defect, appropriate planning at a tertiary care facility is necessary to facilitate early intervention and support. Appropriate surveillance, follow-up and possibly postsurgical care are imperative for the management of this condition. an interprofessional team approach will lead to the best outcomes.
