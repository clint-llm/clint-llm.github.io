As previously mentioned, there are three proposed theories for the pathogenesis of atrophic papulosis: vasculitis, coagulopathy, and a primary dysfunction of the endothelial cells. Su et al. described a “lymphocyte-associated necrotic vasculitis” as the dominating cutaneous feature of the skin lesions.

Other authors have observed fibrinolytic dysfunction in select patients, with the main inciting event being a thrombus in the deep, reticular dermis.

Lastly, Tribble et al. suggested an abnormal swelling and proliferation of the vascular endothelium triggers cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system thrombosis.
