OG is the third most common glial neoplasm, and although it is a low-grade tumor, it can present significant morbidity depending on its location relative to the eloquent cortex and its preponderance for producing seizures. An interprofessional team working together to coordinate the care of these patients is vital. OG is a slow-growing, infiltrative lesion that is most commonly seen in older adults in their 4th and 5th decades. Early diagnosis and complete surgical resection lead to improved outcomes, and the chemo- and radiosensitive nature of OG results in the tumor often responding well to therapy and have a much better prognosis compared to other astrocytomas.
