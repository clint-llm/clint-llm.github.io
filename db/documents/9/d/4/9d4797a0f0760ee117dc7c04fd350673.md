The patients should be educated about compliance with medication as well as the complications that can arise. The patients should be told regarding the importance of close follow up with the provider for monitoring and the relapse of acquired hemophilia. Due to the risk of relapse, patients should promptly consult a provider in case of bleeding so that disease recurrence can be detected as early as possible. Patients should be provided with written instructions about the procedures that predispose the patient to a risk of bleeding like shaving, brushing teeth, etc. to achieve better patient outcomes.
