The primary reason for screening patients for Lp(a) is to help further identify those at high risk for heart disease, especially in the absence of other major risk factors. It also helps identify those patients who may require more intensive lipid therapy.

Patients with significantly elevated Lp(a) should generally be treated to a target of <50mg/dl. One treatment option is daily niacin, which may lower Lp(a) by 20% to 30%. However, niacin has not been associated with improved cardiac outcomes despite its known beneficial effect on all lipid markers as well as Lp(a).

Less commonly used options include lipid apheresis and the investigational therapy called antisense therapy. Generally, lipid apheresis may be reserved for the most severe refractory casesÂ and have a very limited role in treating elevated Lp(a). Apheresis will also cause transient declines in the levels of Lp(a), and serum levels can generally begin to climb back up.

Hormonal drugs may improve Lp(a) levels but are not necessarily associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes. Estrogen can improve Lp(a) levels and has been discussed in the context of improving potentially cardiac risk profiles but is not currently used as a therapy to improve lipid markers. Estrogen also does carry other potential risks for certain patient populations and hence is unlikely to become established as a treatment modality.
