Any case of suspected OSSN presenting to the general ophthalmologist in the outpatient department must be dealt with with a high index of clinical suspicion. The patient must be referred to a cornea and ocular surface expert who plays a critical role in early diagnosis, meticulous management, and regular follow-up with these patients. Microbiologists and pathologists are instrumental in histopathological tumor diagnosis. The nursing team also plays a critical role in explaining the drug schedule to the patient, side effects, and the prognosis of the disease. They also play an important role in uplifting the emotional and psychological well-being of the patient. Therefore, an interprofessional approach is mandated for an optimal outcome.
