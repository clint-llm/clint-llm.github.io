Most orthopedic literature on hip arthrography focuses on Legg-Calve-Perthes disease and developmental dysplasia of the hip. In Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, hip arthrography is used to analyze the cartilaginous aspects of the femoral head and acetabulum.

Hip arthrography is the standard of care for assessing developmental dysplasia of the hip.

Hip arthrography may also be considered with other conditions affecting the pediatric hip joint. Arthrography can be used to assess fracture reduction of pediatric femoral neck fractures. Additionally, arthrography can be used to visualize the articular surface and assess for hardware breach into the joint during managing femoral neck fractures and slipped capital femoral epiphyses after hardware placement. Arthrography can also be used for treatment planning of any type of pediatric femoral head deformity, specifically regarding proper femoral head placement and required osteotomies.
