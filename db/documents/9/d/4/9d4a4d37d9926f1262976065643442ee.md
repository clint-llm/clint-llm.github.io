Initial management of button battery ingestion should include an assessment of the patient's age, type, and size of the battery when ingestion occurred, and where it is currently located. Low-risk, asymptomatic patients with batteries that have passed through the esophagus have a low risk of significant morbidity or mortality.Â  The current national guidelines (NBIH and Button Battery Taskforce) support observation and serial radiographs in 10-14 days. For higher-risk patients (less than age six or with button batteries 15 mm or greater), repeat films should be obtained in 4 days, with endoscopic removal for batteries that have not passed through the stomach.
