Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid agonist, which acts primarily at the Î¼-opioid receptor. It is 100 times more potent than morphine resulting in an estimated conversion ratio of 1 to 100 to provide an equal degree of analgesia. Its low molecular weight, high potency, and lipid solubility make it ideal for delivery via the transdermal route. After absorption and entrance into circulation, fentanyl can exert potent effects on areas of the brain that are highly responsible for analgesia. Fentanyl is a 4-anilidopiperidine compound. Like other opiates, this synthetic form exerts its effect by acting as a high-affinity agonist on selective Mu-opioid receptors in the brain. Also, it can exercise its effects on delta and kappa receptors to a lesser degree. The activation of Mu-opioid receptors causes analgesia and stimulating areas of the brain responsible for addictive potential.

The transdermal route eliminates the first-pass metabolism of fentanyl by the liver, increasing bioavailability to 90%, making it possible to use lower doses of the drug, thus reducing the incidence of adverse effects. Fentanyl metabolism occurs via cytochrome P450 (CYP34A) enzymes into inactive metabolites; hence drugs that enhance or inhibit cytochrome P450 will affect its metabolism.
