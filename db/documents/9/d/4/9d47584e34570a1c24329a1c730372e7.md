Hamartomas result from abnormal normal tissue formation and sometimes occur sporadically and a few times as a part of a syndrome. Hamartoma is most likely due to a developmental error and may appear in several sites. It grows at the same rate as the original tissue. Some genes are also involved in the pathogenesis of hamartoma development, including SMAD4, PTEN, STK1, and BMPR1A.

There are many hereditary syndromes associated with hamartomatous formation, including:

- Tuberous sclerosis

- Cowden syndrome

- PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome

- Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, etc.
