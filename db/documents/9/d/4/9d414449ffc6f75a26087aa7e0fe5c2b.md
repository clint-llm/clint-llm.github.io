All patients diagnosed with pulmonary artery sling (PAS) should undergo work-up for surgical repair.

Congenital tracheal stenosis with complete cartilage tracheal rings will also require concomitant tracheal repair.

Patients with mild tracheal narrowing and absence of complete tracheal cartilaginous rings can have only pulmonary artery sling reimplantation without tracheal reconstruction.
