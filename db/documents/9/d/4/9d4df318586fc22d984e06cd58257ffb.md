**Radial Artery Laceration: Repair vs. Ligation**

In 2015 Janice et al. compared operative to nonoperative approaches to forearm lacerations discovering that penetrating injury to the forearm must address limb-threatening ischemia. In this setting, the restoration of blood flow via surgical management is necessary.

**Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)**

Leonard et al. compared the efficiency of the radial artery and saphenous vein placement in the setting of CABG. Surgeons can use the radial artery as a conduit for CABG with excellent clinical outcomes.

**Arteriovenous (AV) Fistulas**

The radial artery has long been used as a site for creating an arteriovenous fistula for dialysis. A paper by Jennings et al. reported that the proximal radial artery provided an excellent site for low-risk of dialysis-related steal syndrome.

**Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**

Carpal tunnel syndrome is commonly due to an abnormality of the transverse carpal ligament, leading to median nerve compression. Other causes include diabetes mellitus, tumors, and ganglia. With an incidence of less than 3%, an aberrant radial artery may lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.
