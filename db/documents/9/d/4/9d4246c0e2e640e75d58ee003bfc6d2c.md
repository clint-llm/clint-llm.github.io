The TFL is a skeletal muscle. The paraxial mesoderm, which creates somitomeres in the head and composes somites from the occipital to the sacral areas, leads to the formation of skeletal muscles.

SCLERAXIS, a type of transcription factor, regulates the development of tendons. Lateral plate mesodermal fibroblast growth factors and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), working in coordination with WNT proteins from adjacent ectoderm, signal the dermomyotome VLL cells to express the muscle-specific gene MyoD. BMP4 induces the production of WNT proteins via the dorsal neural tube. Meanwhile, the low osmolarity of sonic hedgehog (SHH) proteins, secreted by the floor plate of the neural tube and the notochord, reach the dermomyotome DML cells. These expressions lead to the endocellular induction of MYF5 and MyoD. Both MyoD and MYF5 are in the family of myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), which are transcription factors that activate TFL and other muscular development pathways.
