Thoracic trauma accounts for up to 35% of trauma-related deaths in the United States and encompasses a broad range of injuries that can cause significant morbidity and mortality.

Morbidity and mortality associated with thoracic trauma are due to the disruption of respiration, circulation, or both. Respiratory compromise can occur due to direct injury to the airway or lungs, as is the case with pulmonary contusions, or from interference in the mechanics of breathing, as with rib fractures. The common outcome is the development of ventilation-perfusion mismatch and decreased pulmonary compliance leading to respiratory failure.

Evaluation of patients who sustain thoracic trauma begins with ATLS and then employs various imaging techniques based on initial symptomatology. Life-threatening injuries diagnosed during the initial trauma evaluation require prompt intervention. The most common findings are injuries to the chest wall with associated hemothorax or pneumothorax, the majority of which can be definitively managed with a chest tube. Certain patients require urgent or emergent operative intervention. As minimally invasive techniques have become more popular, VATS has been increasingly used in the acute trauma setting for the management of a variety of injuries.
