One of the chief difficulties in treating multiresistant gram-negative infections is the excessive use of antibiotics, not only those agents acquiredÂ in the community but also in hospitals. As the MDRs became epidemic, it became apparent that overuse of these antimicrobials was one of the causes that urgently required attention. Thus, measures aimed at changing the use of these drugs, with educational campaigns, as well as the fight against self-medication with practices such as monitoring drug consumption and their registration in pharmacies, are necessary to change the habits of the population and also health professionals.
