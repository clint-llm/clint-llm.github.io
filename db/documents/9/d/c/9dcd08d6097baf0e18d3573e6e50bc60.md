Actinic purpura is an incredibly popular finding among elderly people, especially those with fair skin who are more sensitive to sun exposure. Its prevalence increases with age and years of exposure to ultraviolet light. It is estimated to be present in about 12% of individuals after the age of 50 years and up to 30% after the age of 75.

Actinic purpura usually affects both genders equally.
