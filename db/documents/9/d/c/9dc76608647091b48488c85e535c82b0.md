Conjoined twinning is the result of cleavage or axis duplication that occurs after day 13 of fertilization. They are described according to the site of fusion.

The following are the types of conjoined twins along with their frequency:

- Thoraco-omphalopagus (joined at thorax and abdomen) 28%

- Thoracopagus (joined at the thorax) 18.5%

- Omphalopagus (joined at the abdomen) 10%

- Heteropagus (parasitic twins) 10%

- Craniopagus (joined at the level of the cranium) 6%

Less commonly observed conjoined twins include:

- Pyopagus (joined at sacrum and perineum)

- Rachipagus (joined at vertebral column)

- Ischiopagus (joined at lower abdomen and pelvis)

- Cephalopagus (joined from head to umbilicus)

The site of fusion and organs involved are a primary consideration for separation surgery. Typically, 25% of live births live long enough to be candidates for surgery.
