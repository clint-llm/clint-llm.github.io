Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a state of hyperinflammatory response that usually occurs in the first six months of treatment of HIV/AIDS patients. It is a potential complication of the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The overall incidence of IRIS is still unknown. However, some studies report that up to 25 to 30% of HIV patients who are on antiretroviral therapy have IRIS. This activity outlines the risk factors, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and the role of the interprofessional team in the management of immune reconstitution syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the prevalence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in HIV/AIDS patients that are initiated on HAART.
- Review the risk factors that have been associated with an increased risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome while being treated with HAART. 
- Identify the common clinical presentation associated with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies that can be used to improve patient outcomes for individuals who present with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.
