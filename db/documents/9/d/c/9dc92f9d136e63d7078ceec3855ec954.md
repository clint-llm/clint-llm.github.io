Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the most important tools in the care of patients with epilepsy. EEG plays a significant role in the diagnosisÂ of seizures and psychogenic non-epileptic spells. One of the most important aspects of interpreting EEGs is distinguishing between pathologic activity and similar-appearing normal physiologic findings. Various terminologies are used, such as: "normal variants," "benign variants," "pseudo-epileptiform patterns," or "epileptiform patterns without proven relation to seizures."
