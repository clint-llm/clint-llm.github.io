**Toxicokinetics**

- Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists: alpha-2 receptors mediate the transmission of neurotransmitters (acetylcholine & norepinephrine) across the synapse, effectively antagonizing them

- Sulfonylureas: stimulates the pancreas to increase insulin production

- Calcium channel blockers: decrease cardiac inotropy and increase vasodilation; can also block insulin secretion in the setting of overdose, which can directly affect the heart and thereby worsening shock

- Beta-blockers: direct action on the heart causing bradycardia (less severe in children); blockage of gluconeogenesis leading to hypoglycemia; central nervous system (CNS) depression (crosses blood-brain barrier due to high lipid solubility)

- Tricyclic antidepressants: block fast sodium channels, leading to intraventricular conduction delay; wide QRS and right axis deviation on EKG

- Opioids: direct suppression of CNS respiratory center leading to hypoxic respiratory failure

- Anti-diarrheals: biphasic toxicity - first anticholinergic effects and then a longer-lasting opioid effect

- Salicylates/Methyl salicylates: direct stimulation of CNS respiratory center (respiratory alkalosis) then metabolic acidosis

- Antipsychotics: block post-synaptic dopamine receptors and the reticular activating system (also some serotonin antagonism)

- Antimalarials: sodium channel blockade; QRS widening

- Antiarrhythmics: sodium channel blockade; QRS widening

- Terpenoid (camphor): topical rubefacient induces local hyperemia and warmth

- Non-alkaloid toxic lignans: interrupt cell mitosis by binding to tubulin and disrupting the microtubular network, thereby disturbing cellular protein assembly and leading to sepsis and multisystem organ failure

- Plant toxins/secondary metabolites: same as the lignan. Interrupt cell mitosis by binding to tubulin and disrupting the microtubular network, thereby disturbing cellular protein assembly and leading to sepsis and multisystem organ failure

- Oral acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: act on nicotinic and muscarinic receptors; cholinergic toxidrome

- Methylxanthines: inhibit phosphodiesterase enzymes which increase cAMP and cGMP to cause bronchodilation

- Partial opioid agonist/synthetics: direct suppression of CNS respiratory center (one lick can be enough to be toxic in a child)

- Toxic alcohols: metabolized into toxic chemicals like aldehyde, organic acids, acetone

- Caustics/household products: direct mucosal and pulmonary damage (toxicity related to pH < 3 and > 13), methemoglobinemia (methacrylic acid), cyanide (a metabolite of acrylonitrile)

**Symptoms/Physical Findings/Labs/EKG**

- Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists: opioid toxidrome, altered mental status

- Sulfonylureas: anorexia, weakness, prolonged hypoglycemia up to 18 to 24 hours, lethargy, seizure, coma, headache, confusion, irritability
