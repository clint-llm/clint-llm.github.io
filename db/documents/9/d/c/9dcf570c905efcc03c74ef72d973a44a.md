The musculoskeletal system relies on the motor pathway to command it. At the neuromuscular junction, the lower motor neuron synapses with the muscle fiber. After the action potential reaches the axon terminal of the lower motor neuron, voltage-gated calcium channels open to increase intracellular calcium ion concentrations, which allows vesicles of acetylcholine to fuse with the membrane and be released into the synaptic cleft to produce muscle contractions.
