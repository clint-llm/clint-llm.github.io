There are no present curative treatments for vascular dementia. Treatment of vascular dementia includes two approaches: (1) management of progression and behaviors and (2) prevention by modifying risk factors. Cholinesterase inhibitors have been shown to slow the progression of cognitive decline.

Medication management includes the elimination of medications that are unnecessary or have the potential to exacerbate symptoms (e.g., anticholinergics). Identification and optimization of comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, will assist in lowering patient vascular risk factors but have not demonstrated an impact on cognitive function.

**Prevention**

Vascular dementia is preventable by modifying the risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and hyperlipidemia. The one crucial risk factor that should be modified is hypertension. Countless studies show that the use of antihypertensive medications can reduce the risk of vascular dementia. The patient’s coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and ischemic heart disease must be appropriately managed.

In patients who show early impairment in cognition or have MRI or CT evidence of stroke or carotid artery disease, data show that secondary prevention with stroke preventive treatments like carotid endarterectomy, antiplatelet agents, warfarin, or physical exercise can slow down the progression of the disease.
