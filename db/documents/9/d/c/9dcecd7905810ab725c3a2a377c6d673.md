During normal renal development, the metanephros starts at 5 to 6 weeks after conception. The metanephros would be within the caudal pelvis and migrates from this position to the lumbar region by week 8. If the kidney does not enter the retroperitoneal fossa, it is termed ectopic, and if it remains within the pelvis, it is deemed a pelvic kidney.

Even in asymptomatic patients, the ectopic kidney often has reduced function relative to the contralateral kidney.

Pancake kidneys are often associated with other congenital defects such as vaginal agenesis, undescended testes, tetralogy of Fallot, spina bifida, sacral agenesis, and strabismus. They are more likely to develop hydronephrosis, renal trauma reflux, and stones than normal kidneys.
