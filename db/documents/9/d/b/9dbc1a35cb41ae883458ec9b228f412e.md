Benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer, and prostatitis are the three most noteworthy clinical conditions that can arise.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is primarily a urological condition that can narrow the urethra, or protrude into the bladder, causing obstruction to urine flow.  It results from nodular enlargement of the gland, rather than diffuse enlargement.

Prostate cancer usually occurs as an adenocarcinoma.  Although not well understood, the occurrence of prostate cancer can be related to several things.  These include family history, increased BMI, smoking history, and ionizing/UV radiation.

Prostatitis is the result of bacteria that commonly cause urinary tract infections.  This condition primarily presents as pain, as well as an array of urinary tract symptoms.

Most of the carcinomas (75%) develop in the peripheral zone, and BPH tends to appear in the transitional zone.
