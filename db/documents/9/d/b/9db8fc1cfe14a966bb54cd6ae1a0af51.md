For suspected NPD type A pr B, a blood sample is drawn, and the activity of ASM is measured in leukocytes. In the case of low enzyme activity, additional gene testing can further evaluate the disease.

For NPD type C, a skin biopsy is taken and stained with a special stain, 'filipin,' to measure the enzyme activity. DNA testing can be done to look for genes that cause type C disease.

Once the diagnosis is confirmed, special attention should be paid to look for disease spread and manifestations in the following systems.

- **Liver**
- Liver enzymes should be measured periodically. Liver elastography or liver biopsy should be done in case of severe liver disease.

- **Pulmonary**
- Spirometry should be done periodically. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is done for interstitial lung disease (ILD).

- **Hematologic**
- Measure platelet counts and spleen volume.

- **Cardiovascular**
- Measure HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol.

- **Neurological**
- A complete neurological exam should be performed at every visit.

- **Eye**
- Fundoscopy to look for the cherry-red spot on the macula.

- **Exercise Intolerance**
- Spirometry and exercise intolerance test.

- **Pain and Fatigue**
- A questionnaire should be used for grading.

- **Severity of Disease**
- Measure the quantity of SM and its derivatives, macrophage markers, and oxysterols.
