Cells are differentiated from the surrounding tissue by using a cluster of differentiation (CD) markers or the cell's surface molecules. There is no specific CD marker for alveolar macrophages. The cell recognition depends on the tissue in which macrophages need to be detected, and the antibody can be tailored accordingly. CD11b and CD68 are associated with macrophages in the literature
