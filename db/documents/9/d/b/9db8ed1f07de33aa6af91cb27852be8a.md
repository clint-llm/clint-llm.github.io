Polymyositis is treated with a combination of different pharmacological and non-pharmacological modalities. Pharmacological treatment mainly includes corticosteroids. Prednisone and methylprednisolone are the most common corticosteroids used for polymyositis with a starting dose of 1mg/kg of prednisone a day. The steroids are tapered off gradually and not withdrawn suddenly. The second-line treatment option includes the use of immune-modulators (methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine) in those patients who either do not respond to steroids or develop severe adverse effects due to steroids usage. Cyclophosphamide, an immune-modulator, works efficiently, especially in patients with the involvement of the pulmonary interstitium.

IVIG also shows significant improvement in patients having dysphagia due to esophageal involvement.

Patients with different systems involved must be evaluated by the concerned specialty e.g. cardiologist for cardiomyopathy, pulmonologist for ILD, a speech therapist for voice change, etc. Non-pharmacological treatment includes physical therapy of the affected muscles to prevent disuse atrophy. These patients must be advised to have supervised resistive strength training activities.
