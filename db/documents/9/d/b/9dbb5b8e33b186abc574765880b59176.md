The management of hypothalamic hamartomas is best done with an interprofessional team chiefly because of its rarity and vague symptoms. Clinicians need to be aware that besides seizures, these lesions can present with psychiatric symptoms in the form of rage behaviors, mood disorders, and aggression.

Early seizure onset is also associated with cognitive impairment. The neurobiology of rage and aggression is poorly understood but is mostly under the influence of hormonal dynamics such as cortisol and testosterone.

Psychiatric outcomes improve after surgery in patients with hypothalamic hamartoma with epilepsy. There is no current available pharmacotherapy for psychiatric symptoms recommended at this time, needing further clinical trials to explore this possibility.

Despite the absence of a pharmaceutical standard of treatment, when pharmaceutical therapy is the initial treatment option, the pharmacist must have involvement and verify dosing and assist the team by performing medication reconciliation. Nursing can monitor the effectiveness of treatment, and report any concerns to the treating clinician. Nurses are also in the best position to observe for adverse medication effects and will assist in helping if a surgical option is chosen. All providers are responsible for educating and counseling the patient's family regarding gelastic seizures. Only with a full, interprofessional team approach can outcomes be directed optimally.
