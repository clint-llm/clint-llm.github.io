The prognosis for patients with retinitis pigmentosa is dependent on the age of onset and pattern of inheritance. Early-onset symptoms and severe vision loss, and night blindness are expected with the autosomal recessive form of RP. The autosomal dominant expression is the least severe and is associated with the more gradual onset of symptoms later in adult life. The most severe vision loss occurs with X-linked recessive RP. Tunnel vision is expected late in the course of all forms of RP, and almost all RP patients will be legally blind at some point in the progression of their disease. Total loss of vision is fortunately uncommon, as the macular function will generally allow light perception, even after acuity is lost.
