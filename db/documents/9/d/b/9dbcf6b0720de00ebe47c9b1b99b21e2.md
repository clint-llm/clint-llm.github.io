A strong clinical diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy can be made with a thorough history and physical exam; however, findings are confirmed definitively by electrodiagnostic studies, including nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography. This activity describes the electrodiagnostic findings in both nerve conduction tests and needle electromyography in cervical radiculopathy and discusses the importance of an interprofessional team's role in managing care for treatment options.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for electrodiagnostic testing for cervical radiculopathy.
- Describe the nerve conduction study findings in a patient with cervical radiculopathy.
- Review the electromyographic findings in a patient with cervical radiculopathy.
- Outline the importance of communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care and electrodiagnostic evaluation for patients with cervical radiculopathy.
