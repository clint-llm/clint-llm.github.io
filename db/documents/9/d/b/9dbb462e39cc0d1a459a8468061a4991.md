Morbidity and mortality of splanchnic vein thrombosis have improved over the years with treatment. This is mainly due to earlier diagnosis and treatment of the condition.

In a study that followed 136 patients with chronic portal vein thrombosis for 5 years, fewer than 5 percent of patients died of complications of thrombosis, such as gastrointestinal bleeding. However, the mortality rate is higher in patients who have mesenteric vein thrombosis in addition to portal vein thrombosis.

In a study of 3700 patients with mesenteric vein thrombosis, the mortality rate was 44 percent, compared to 66 percent mortality rate in arterial mesenteric thrombosis.
