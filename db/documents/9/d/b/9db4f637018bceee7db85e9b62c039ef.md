Patients with AWE present with decreased visual acuity, which chronically progresses or relapses and with periods of remission over months to years. Patients also complain of foreign body sensation, tearing, redness, or irritation, although some may be asymptomatic if the lesion is small and outside the visual axis. History of ocular surgery or trauma, topical ocular medications, atopic dermatitis, or acne rosacea have all been associated with the disease process.

The slit-lamp exam with fluorescein staining along with confocal microscopy are tools for diagnosis and show specific findings as described below.
