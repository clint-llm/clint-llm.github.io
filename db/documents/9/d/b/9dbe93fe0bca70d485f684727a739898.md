In cases of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or unstable angina, recent studies have failed to show any significant difference in treatment with revascularization versus optimal medical therapy.

The FAME1 trial found patients with multivessel disease who underwent routine measurement of fractional flow reserve (FFR) during PCI were found to have reduced primary endpoint rates of death, MI, and repeat revascularization at 1 year when compared to PCI guided by conventional angiography.

A pooled analysis of 7812 patients from ten randomized trials was performed where patients were assigned to one of two arms: PCI with balloon angioplasty and or bare-metal stent (BMS) placement versus CABG.

The SYNTAX trial compared patients who underwent CABG versus PCI  in patients with left main coronary disease or three-vessel disease.
