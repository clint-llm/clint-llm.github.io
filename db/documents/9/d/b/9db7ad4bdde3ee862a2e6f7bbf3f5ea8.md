It is important to note that testosterone can be converted peripherally to estradiol via aromatase from adipose tissue. Estradiol can go on to be converted to estrogen peripherally. Estradiol/estrogen can play a role in bone resorption, epiphyseal closure, gynecomastia, and vascular effects, and exert an inhibitory effect on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary similar to testosterone. When levels of estradiol increase in males, this can lead to pathological changes such as weak bones, development of breasts and loss of libido or infertility.
