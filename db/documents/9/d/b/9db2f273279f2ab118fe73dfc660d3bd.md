Slit-lamp biomicroscopy will be undertaken of the ocular surface, including dry eye evaluation, intraocular pressure, cornea assessment, determination of cataract status, and dilated fundoscopic examination. During the preoperative workup, any contact lenses should be discontinued 1 to 2 weeks before corneal imaging to give more accurate measurements.
