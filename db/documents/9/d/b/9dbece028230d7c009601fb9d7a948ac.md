The management of a trauma patient is done with an interprofessional team that includes a surgeon, emergency department physician, nurse, anesthesiologist, and intensivist. The team must know how to resuscitate patients and the priorities of a primary survey. The key is first to identify all life-threatening injuries and consult with the appropriate specialist.
