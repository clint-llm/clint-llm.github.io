Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is a rare and aggressive variant of chronic pyelonephritisÂ resulting in a non-functioning kidney. It is most often associated with chronic obstruction and stones with ongoing infection.

Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is often confused with a true neoplasm, most commonly renal cell carcinoma due to its similarity in clinical and radiographic features, as well as the ability to involve the adjacent structures or organs. Therefore, early identification and treatment are required to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. Although antibiotics can be given in acute infection, the treatment of choice for XGP is nephrectomy.

Classification:

- Diffuse: Kidney involvement is diffuse.

- Segmental: Kidney involvement is segmental.

- Focal: Involvement within the cortex of the kidney.
