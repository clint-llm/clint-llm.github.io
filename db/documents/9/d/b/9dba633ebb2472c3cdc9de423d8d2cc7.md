The iris is a circular, pigmented diaphragm that lies anterior to the lens in a coronal plane. It is attached peripherally to the ciliary body, with its unbound central border forming an aperture known as the pupil. The iris divides the space between the cornea and the lens into two chambers: anterior and posterior. The anterior chamber is bound by the cornea and iris. The anterior chamber communicates through the pupil with the posterior chamber, which is bound by the iris, ciliary processes, zonules, and lens. A fluid substance known as aqueous humor fills both chambers.

The iris, via the sphincter pupillae, is a part of the accommodative reflex. The accommodative reflex of the eye is an involuntary response when the visual focus switches from an object at a distance to one that is closer. The reflex is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system and involves three actions - alteration of pupil aperture, lens shape, and convergence. The sphincter pupillae causes narrowing of the pupil in order to prevent diverging light rays from the corneal periphery creating a blurred image.
