Viloxazine intoxication cases are rare and happen mostly in the psychiatric patient population, and the cases could be either accidental or intentional. Given that the demographic of patients prescribed anti-depressants is at high risk for overdose suicide, improved communication is needed between healthcare providers and family members to provide the appropriate dosage and monitoring information to patients. Also, patients should always consult with their primary doctor before taking viloxazine.

Viloxazine is a generally safe medication that can be obtained by prescription. Primary care clinicians and psychiatrists may act as frontline resources and provide patients with proper dosage and safety information. Other specialists and health care professionals, including nurses and pharmacists, can monitor and report any adverse medication events to the prescriber. Appropriate cooperation between all interprofessional team members is essential to ensure the patient receives the most effective care and optimal benefits from viloxazine, resulting in optimal outcomes with fewer adverse events.
