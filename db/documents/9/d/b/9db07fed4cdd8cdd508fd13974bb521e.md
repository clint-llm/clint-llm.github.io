Normally, arteries and veins are connected by an intermediary capillary system. AVMs and telangiectasias lack this intermediary, with a direct connection between the artery and the vein.Â Telangiectasias occur on mucocutaneous surfaces, while AVMs are found within internal organs. Histological evaluation of AVMs shows irregular endothelium, increased collagen and actin deposition in the basement membrane, and a disorganized basement membrane.
