**Symptoms**

Chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis patients typically present with the complaint of a spontaneously appearing, painful nodule on the helix or antihelix of the pinna. CNH primarily occurs on the ear of the usual sleeping side, more often the right one. CNH classically presents unilaterally; nevertheless, bilateral ear involvement is also observed. Prominauris, the wearing of headgear or hearing aids, frequent talking on the telephone, and an autoimmune predisposition often precipitate onset. The nodule grows rapidly and then typically plateaus in size. Nocturnal pain is the most frequent symptom; only a few cases have been reported with daytime pain, usually worsened by touching the ear.

**Physical Examination**

Physical examination reveals a well-circumscribed, rounded nodule with raised edges and a crust in its center, often overlying an ulcer which may occasionally have exposed cartilage at the bottom. The lesion has a diameter of 4 mm to 6 mm and is typically surrounded by an erythematous area. The most common site is the apex of the helix. The nodule tends to be firm, tender, and usually fixed to the underlying auricular cartilage. Other associated features include bleeding and exudate accumulation after removal of the crust. The development of CNH on the antihelix is more common among females than males. Rarely, appearance at other sites, such as the external auditory canal and posterior part of the pinna, has been reported.
