Before the procedure, the practitioner should set patient expectations. Potential risks of the procedure include bleeding, infection, permanent nail dystrophy, the possibility that the biopsy does not yield a diagnosis, post-operative pain, and temporary functional handicap of the digit. A strict sterile technique is essential to avoid osteomyelitis because most biopsies are taken down to the periosteum of the underlying phalanx.

- Bleeding

- Postoperative pain

- Infection

- Nail regrowth defects (split nail deformity, erythronychia, dystrophic nail plates)

- Hypersensitivity reaction to lidocaine

- Vasovagal response (due to anesthetic injection)

The patient should receive instruction to elevate the digit for 48 hours post-surgery to prevent edema that can create a tourniquet from the bandage compromising digital perfusion.
