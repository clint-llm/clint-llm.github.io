Providers should obtain a comprehensive history, including whether the patient has had a prior food allergic reaction to wheat or had a respiratory allergy to wheat flour.

Symptoms consistent with a wheat allergy would include urticaria, angioedema, asthma, allergic rhinitis, abdominal pain, vomiting, acute exacerbation of atopic dermatitis, or exercise-induced anaphylaxis.

Patients with wheat dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA) usually have symptoms that include pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, flushing, shortness of breath, dysphagia, chest tightness, profuse sweating, syncope, headache, diarrhea, nausea, throat closing, abdominal pain, and hoarseness that occurs during intense physical exercise following wheat intake in the prior four hours before symptom onset.

Those with celiac disease will present with diarrhea, constipation, bloating, abdominal pain, anorexia, flatulence, weight loss, poor growth in childhood, anemia, dermatitis herpetiformis, fatigue, and even osteoporosis.
