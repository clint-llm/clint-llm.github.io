As stated above, the function of the bladder is to store the urine and then aid in its expulsion at a time deemed advantageous by the organism.  The long-held belief has been that upon delivery to the bladder, urine will be excreted essentially unchanged in composition.  However, new research is challenging this traditional view, and now there is evidence that the bladder epithelium can modulate the amount of both water and solutes that are ultimately present upon urination.

Bladder capacity changes throughout one's life.  In children, an approximation of bladder volume can be calculated with the formula: (years of age + 2) x 30 mL.  By adulthood, the average volume that a functional bladder can comfortably hold is between 300 and 400 mL.
