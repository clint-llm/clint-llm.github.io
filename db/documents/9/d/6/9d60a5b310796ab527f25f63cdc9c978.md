In patients where renal and pulmonary involvement raises suspicion of Goodpasture syndrome, renal biopsy should be considered, which has a better yield than lung biopsy. Light microscopy will show crescentic glomerulonephritis. Over time, the crescents turn fibrotic, and frank glomerulosclerosis with interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy may be appreciated. Immunofluorescence will show the linear deposition of IgG and complement (C3) along the basement membrane. Predominantly, subclass IgG-1 is present.

A kidney biopsy is not only crucial for diagnosis, but the percentage of crescents identified on biopsy confers renal survival prognosis. Lung tissue is typically not sought due to the invasiveness of the procedureÂ and a more difficult immunofixation process for lung tissue. Lung biopsy, when performed, shows extensive hemorrhage with deposition of hemosiderin-laden macrophages within alveolar spaces.
