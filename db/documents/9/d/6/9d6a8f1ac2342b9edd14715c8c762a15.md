At 2 weeks of development, the structures which make up the knee begin to develop from the mesoderm. Around the sixth week of development, chondrocytes have developed the cartilage form of the femur and tibia. Primary ossification centers are present in all long bones by twelve weeks of development. The ligaments, menisci, and other connective tissue develop from mesenchyme and become distinct from one another by week ten of development. The muscles and neurovascular components which contribute to the knee begin to develop from the mesoderm around week 4.
