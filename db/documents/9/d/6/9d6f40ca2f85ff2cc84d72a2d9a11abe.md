In animal primary neuronal cell cultures, excess nitric oxide is partially responsible for glutamate neurotoxicity. These glutamate derangements affect neurodegenerative disorders, including stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. However, it is more likely that these neurotoxic mechanisms are subject to mediation through peroxynitrite, the product of an NO and superoxide anion reaction. Peroxynitrite and excess oxygen free radicals can be generated from severe cellular damage and cross the blood-brain barrier as lipid-soluble products accumulate within neuronal tissue.
