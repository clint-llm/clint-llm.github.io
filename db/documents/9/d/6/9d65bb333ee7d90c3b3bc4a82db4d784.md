Ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is an invaluable tool to assist in diagnosing certain cardiac conditions. There are a variety of ambulatory ECG monitors, including Holter monitors, event monitors, and implantable loop recorders. Holter monitors are used to record 24 to 48 hours of activity. Event monitors are used to record 2 to 4 hours of activity. Implantable loop recorders can record activity for up to 3 years. The choice among these technologies is usually based on the anticipated duration of monitoring required to capture a spontaneous event. This activity describes the indications, contraindications and clinical significance of the implantable loop recorder. In addition, this activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with arrhythmias.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for an implantable loop recorder.
- Describe the technique involved in implanting a loop recorder.
- Summarize the clinical benefits of implantable loop recordings.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for optimizing care coordination and communication to advance arrhythmia monitoring via implantable loop recordings to improve patient outcomes.
