HP is a rare entity of acute alimentary tract hemorrhage. Estimates to occur in about 1/1,500 GI bleeding cases have a strong male predilection (about 7:1). Because it is rare, it is missed easily. The mean age of onset is between 50-60 years old. It is highly correlated with alcohol exposure and other risk factors that are attributed to chronic pancreatitis development. No study or research shows any race or ethnicity superior to each other in terms of prevalence and incidence.
