Various trigeminal nerve branches follow a path through the chewing muscles, and the buccal nerve is one of themâ€”the muscle bundles crossed by the buccal nerve. If the muscle is hyperactive, then it can compress the nerve fibers. Due to the compression of the buccal nerve, patients may suffer from orofacial neurological symptoms like swelling and pain.
