Emphysematous cholecystitis is a surgical emergency that carries a high morbidity and mortality. Thus, it is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an endocrinologist, general surgeon, emergency department physician, ICU nurses, and an intensivist. As soon as the diagnosis is made the general surgeon should be consulted as the patient needs an emergency cholecystectomy.

In unstable patients, percutaneous drainage by the radiologist may be life-saving.  The cholecystostomy can be followed by removal of the gallbladder at a later date once the patient's condition improves.

The outcomes for most patients with emphysematous cholecystitis are guarded, even after successful surgery.
