The thyroid gland functions to produce the thyroid hormone, which is needed by the body to carry out different metabolism. Follicles comprise the thyroid and are the functional and structural units of the gland. Thyroid cancer is one of the most common endocrine tumors and is classified as differentiated or undifferentiated. Differentiated cancers include papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma, and undifferentiated types include medullary thyroid and anaplastic cancer. This activity reviews follicular thyroid cancer, describing the etiology, epidemiology, histology, evaluation, staging, and complications of follicular thyroid cancer and the role of interprofessional teams in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with follicular cancer.
- Describe the typical evaluation findings associated with follicular cancer.
- Explain the treatment options for patients with follicular cancer.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with follicular cancer.
