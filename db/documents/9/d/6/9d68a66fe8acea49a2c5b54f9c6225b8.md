Cardiovascular Disease: The biosynthesis of TxA2 and isoprostanes is elevated in numerous cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases, as is the expression of the receptor itself.

**Myocardial Infarction**

Myocardial infarction occurs when there is complete occlusion of blood flow to an area of the heart. Thrombus formation mediated by TxA2-induced platelet aggregation and vascular constriction sometimes causes myocardial infarction (as well as infarctions of other organs).

**Atherosclerosis**

Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease of the vasculature that is influenced by multiple factors that involve a complex interplay between components of the blood and the arterial wall. TxA2 and isoprostanes, as well as PGI2, are known to promote the initiation and progression of atherogenesis through control of platelet activation and leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction.

**Variant (Prinzmetal) Angina**

Studies have also indicated that increased TxA2 in circulating plasma is closely correlated with the hypersensitivity of coronary arteries to ergonovine maleate in patients with variant angina, suggesting a possible role of augmented TxA2 production in the enhancement of coronary vascular spasticity.

**Treatment in Cardiovascular Disease**

Irreversible inhibition of COX-1-derived TxA2 with low-dose aspirin affords prophylaxis against both primary and secondary vascular thrombotic events, which underscores the central role of TxA2 as a platelet agonist in cardiovascular disease. However, COX-1 inhibitors have correlations with adverse effects such as GI toxicity and bleeding.

**Lung**

TxA2-induced contraction of bronchial smooth muscles may contribute to asthma, which has been improved by TP antagonists.

**Kidney**

TxA2 is involved in nephritis and nephrotic syndrome of the kidney.

**Liver**

Hepatic injury after hepatic stress results from several mechanisms, including inflammation and microcirculatory disturbance. Levels of thromboxane have been shown to increase in the systemic circulation after different types of hepatic stress such as endotoxemia, hepatic ischemia-reperfusion, hepatectomy, liver transplantation, hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation, hepatic cirrhosis, and alcoholic liver injury. The production of thromboxane from the liver also becomes enhanced under these stresses. Thromboxane induces hepatic damage through vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, induction of leukocyte adhesion, up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, and release of other vasoconstrictors.

**Allergy and Inflammation**

Research shows that TxA2 contributes to the pathogenesis of asthma, rhinitis and atopic dermatitis. Allergic inflammation is the fundamental pathophysiology of allergic diseases and closely correlates with disease progression and exacerbation.

**Angiogenesis and Metastasis of Cancer Cells**

TxA2 is implicated in modulating angiogenesis during tumor growth and chronic inflammation and is involved in angiotensin II-induced neovascularization.
