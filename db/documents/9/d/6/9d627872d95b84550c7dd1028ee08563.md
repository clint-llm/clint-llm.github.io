Surgical exploration is the only method for accurately and reliably diagnosing and treating biliary atresia

**Peri-Operative Cholangiogram**

Peri-operative cholangiogram will definitively diagnose biliary atresia by the failure of passage of dye into the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary system.

**Porto-Enterostomy**

The standard surgical technique is the creation of a Roux-en-Y hepatic porto-enterostomy (Kasai procedure) in which excision of the fibrotic biliary remnant, transaction of the fibrous portal plate with dissection extending up to the bifurcation of the portal vein is done. The Roux-en-Y loop reestablishes biliary-enteric continuity and allows bile drainage.

In rare instances where the gallbladder and common bile duct are patent, a surgeon might consider a porto-cholecystostomy.

Some drugs are used as adjuncts after surgery to promote biliary drainage, among them, steroids and ursodeoxycholic acid have been extensively described.

**Liver Transplantation**

Liver transplantation is an option offered if liver cirrhosis is far advanced or if a Kasai porto-enterostomy has failed.
