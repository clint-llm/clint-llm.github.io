Eighty-one percent of patients with MIRM experience a full recovery.  The most commonly reported complications (approximately 11%) involve mucosal sequelae. Ocular mucosal damage occurs in 8.9% and includes conjunctival shrinkage, corneal ulcerations, blindness, ocular synechiae, and loss of eyelashes. Oral (0.8%) and genital (0.8%) mucosal synechiae were also reported. The other commonly reported complication was post-inflammatory pigmentary changes (5.6%). Rare complications include persistent cutaneous lesions, B-cell lymphopenia, restrictive lung disease, and chronic obliterative bronchitis. However, while the mortality of MIRM is 3% (reported in the 1940s), experts suspect that the vast majority of mild cases are underreported in the literature, and the true rate of morbidity and mortality is actually far lower.
