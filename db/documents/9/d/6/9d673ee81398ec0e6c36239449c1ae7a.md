An interprofessional team, including the orthopedic nurse, is most effective in appropriately managing fifth metatarsal fractures. Generally, the patient will present to their primary care physician or the emergency department complaining of typical signs and symptoms. Proper diagnosis directs the treatment and triage of these patients. Prompt referral to an orthopedic surgeon is paramount as appropriate treatment can lead to union rates as high as 97%.

With proper identification of fracture and interprofessional communication with an orthopedic referral, outcomes of this difficult-to-treat fracture can stand a better chance of full recovery, but this requires an interprofessional team approach, including clinicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, physical and occupational therapists, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results.
