Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the live attenuated vaccine form of Mycobacterium bovis used to prevent tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections. The vaccine was developed by Calmette and Guerin and was first administered to human beings in 1921. BCG is the only vaccine against tuberculosis. It is the most widely administered vaccine and usually a part of the routine newborn immunization schedule. BCG vaccine also offers protection against non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections like leprosy and Buruli ulcer. This activity reviews the mode of action of the BCG vaccine and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in educating patients about tuberculosis prevention.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mode of action of the BCG vaccine.
- Review the indications for the BCG vaccine.
- Summarize the clinical relevance of the BCG vaccine.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes in patients receiving the BCG vaccine.
