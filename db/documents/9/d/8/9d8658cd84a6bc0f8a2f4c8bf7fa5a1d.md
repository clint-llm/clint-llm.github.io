Post craniotomy is quite common after surgery, but making the diagnosis is difficult as there are many serious causes of headaches post craniotomy, which first needs to be ruled out. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a neurosurgeon, neurologist, internist, pharmacist, and a mental health nurse. Once the severe causes have been ruled out, it is best to use non-pharmacological therapy to relieve the headaches. The use of narcotics in post craniotomy patients is not recommended. Psychotherapy or some cognitive-behavioral therapy may be useful.
