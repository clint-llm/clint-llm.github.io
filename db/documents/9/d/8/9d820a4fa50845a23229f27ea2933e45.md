For tibial shaft fractures that are treated non-operatively, the patient should remain non-weight bearing for 6 weeks while in a long leg case. Patients treated in an external fixation, especially for length unstable fractures should remain non-weight bearing for 6 weeks for extra-articular fractures and up to 12 weeks for intraarticular fractures. For length-stable fractures, some surgeons choose to allow patients to bear weight as tolerated when they have transverse tibial shaft fractures that are stable. For operative fixation, whether it be IMN or plating the same applies as for external fixation. Weight-bearing as tolerated length stable, extra-articular, transverse shaft fractures, and non-weight bearing for unstable, oblique, or comminuted fractures for 6 weeks in the extra-articular setting and 12 weeks when the joint surface is involved.

Maintaining active knee and ankle range of motion is important during the recovery period.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis should be administered to non-weight bearing, lower extremity fractures.
