GABA usually causes inhibition of action potentials by hyperpolarizing postsynaptic neurons and reducing the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic neurons. The resulting inhibition decreases the activity of the affected cell, which manifests in effects ranging from decreased motor stimulation in motor neurons to decreased cortical activity in regions including the amygdala.

**GABA as an excitatory neurotransmitter in the developing CNS.**In immature neurons found in the embryonic CNS, GABA is excitatory and depolarizes these cells because of an elevated intracellular chloride ion concentration.
