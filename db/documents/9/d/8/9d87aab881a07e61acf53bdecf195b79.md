Neonates with bacteremia can be asymptomatic and have a normal physical examination. Thus laboratory testing plays an important role in diagnosis. In a neonate with suspected sepsis, blood culture should be immediately drawn. It is recommended to draw at least 1 ml of blood as low-level bacteremia may not be detected with smaller aliquotes

CSF analysis may reveal:

- Elevated protein level

- Elevated WBC

- Positive cultures

- Decreased glucose concentration

- Positive PCR

Complete blood count (CBC) with differential and C-reactive protein (CRP) are also important lab tests to obtain and are often collected on a serial basis. These indices are poor at identifying neonatal sepsis but are better used for ruling it out

CRP levels start rising within 6 to 8 hours during an infectious episode in neonates and peak at about 24 hours
