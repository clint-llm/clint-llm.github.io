The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification system came about to offer perioperative clinicians a simple categorization of a patient's physiological status to help predict operative risk. The ASAPS originated in 1941 and has seen someÂ revisions since that time.

As it was neither developed nor intended to be used to predict risk with anesthesia or surgery, it is difficult to utilize it in the individual management of any patient beyond very general concepts.
