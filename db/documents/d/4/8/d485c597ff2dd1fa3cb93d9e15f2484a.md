Ossicular chain dislocation occurs following trauma. It usually results in conductive hearing loss, which persists for more than 6 months. Management is usually surgical, but there is often a significant delay between the initial injury and surgical reconstruction. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of ossicular chain dislocation and highlights the role of the healthcare team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of ossicular chain dislocation. 
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with ossicular chain dislocation.
- Identify the treatment considerations for patients with ossicular chain dislocation.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance delivery of care for patients affected by ossicular chain dislocation.
