Before the administration of intravenous PCA, the patient needs pre-procedure assessments across a variety of domains, including cognitive, opioid naivety, pain, sedation, and respiratory assessments. A pre-procedure cognitive assessment ensures the patient has the mental capacity to participate in PCA and can understand the concepts of dosing, interval, lockout, and expected pain relief. Whether the patient is opioid na√Øve will determine the initial dosing, titration, and expected pain relief and side effects. Periodic pain assessments using the numerical pain rating scale are necessary to create a baseline before PCA begins and to track its efficacy throughout treatment. A sedation assessment should also take place before the procedure begins and periodically throughout. Finally, a respiration assessment of the rate, depth, effort, and sound of breaths should be performed to establish a patient baseline and to monitor the effects of the medications during treatment. These assessments allow for adjustments to be made during administration to meet desired outcomes.

Before the administration of PCA through a peripheral nerve catheter or an epidural catheter, a neurological exam assessing for pain sensation, light touch sensation, and motor function over the targeted dermatomes and myotomes require assessment, allowing for the establishment of a baseline function and sensation to be tracked throughout PCA administration.
