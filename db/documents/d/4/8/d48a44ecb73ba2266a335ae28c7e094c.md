There is no specific antidote for atazanavir toxicity. Healthcare staff should provide symptomatic and supportive care. Patient monitoring for signs of respiratory distress and other vital signs is necessary. Electrocardiogram monitoring of the patient is recommended as the atazanavir may worsen AV block due to PR interval prolongation. If the simultaneous overdose with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors is suspected, clinicians should monitor patients for symptomsÂ of lactic acidosis.
