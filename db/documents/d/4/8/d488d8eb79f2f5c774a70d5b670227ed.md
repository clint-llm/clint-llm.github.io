**The Need**

In World War II, the mortality rate of combat wounds was up to 30% but dropped to 24% in the Vietnam war.

In 1999, the Army focused on providing better medical care downrange and increased training for combat medics. This expanded training included simulation as a core element.

Despite the improvements in training, a report in 2005 noted no significant change in the number of soldiers dying from preventable deaths, and the U.S. Army Medical Command released an Operational Needs Statement noting a significant gap in battle-focused skills for Combat Medics. The concern was that medics all over the country were receiving different training on different equipment, and therefore, there was no standardization and no sustainment of skills.
