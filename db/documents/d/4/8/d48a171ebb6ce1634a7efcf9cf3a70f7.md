Data on the epidemiology of cholinergic crisis is very scant. Nevertheless, it is a known fact that cholinergic crisis is commonly seen in the pediatric population and patients with myasthenia gravis. In the pediatric age group, this crisis is usually as a result of accidental contact or ingestion of organophosphates. Children living in rural areas are at a very high risk. Since 2013, there are stricter federal regulations in the United States for the sale of organophosphates.

Globally, about three million people have been exposed to organophosphate poisoning annually with approximately 300,000 deaths. Poisoning is from either accidental or intentional ingestion of agricultural insecticides or pesticides. In cholinergic crisis related to organophosphates, poisoning can be sourced to food products like wheat, flour, cooking oil, fruits, and vegetables.

Since World War II, production of nerve gases like sarin and tabun has been limited. Manufacturing nerve gasses has been considered a war crime since theÂ Geneva Convention in 1925
