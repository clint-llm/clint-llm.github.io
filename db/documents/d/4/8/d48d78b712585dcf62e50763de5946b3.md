Host protection from bacterial invasion mainly depends on two things: polymorphonuclear granulocytes, which phagocytose the bacteria, and serum complement proteins, which are bactericidal. The alternate pathway of complement activation is more active in Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. Neutrophil myeloperoxidase and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein facilitate in defense against Klebsiella pneumoniae infection.

Bacteria have a polysaccharide capsule made up of complex acidic polysaccharides and determine their pathogenicity. The capsule protects bacteria from phagocytosis and serum bactericidal proteins. It adheres to host cells with many fimbrial and non-fimbrial adhesions, which is critical to the infectious process.
