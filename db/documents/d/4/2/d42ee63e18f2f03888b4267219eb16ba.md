Patients will typically present with a secondary complaint, such as ear pain, hearing loss, or a sensation of fullness. These symptoms can be a result of otitis externa, cerumen impaction, tympanic membrane rupture, or a foreign body. All of these diagnoses have the potential to be a downstream effect of external auditory exostoses. The history and physical exam are typically all that is needed to diagnose external auditory exostoses. The most important component of the physical exam is otoscopy. External auditory exostoses have a firm, bony, and nodular appearance at the tympanic ring within the external auditory meatus. They are usually multiple and bilateral. While their position within the ear canal can vary, the first lesions most commonly are medial and anterosuperior.

The degree of ear canal obstruction caused by the exostoses is usually proportional to the severity of symptoms.
