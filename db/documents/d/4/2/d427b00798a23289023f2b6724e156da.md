Rectus abdominis diastasisÂ physiology directly relates to the anatomy of the abdominal wall.

The rectus abdominis muscles are a pair of bilateral muscles that run along the anterior midline of the abdomen from the costal cartilages of the fifth through seventh ribs to the pubic symphysis.

There is debate about the exact pathophysiology of rectus abdominis diastasis. However, it appears to relate to the weakness of both the linea alba itself and the anterior abdominal musculature as a whole.
