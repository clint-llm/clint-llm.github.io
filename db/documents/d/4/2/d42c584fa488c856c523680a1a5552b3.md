A crystalloid fluid is an aqueous solution of mineral salts and other small, water-soluble molecules. Most commercially available crystalloid solutions are isotonic to human plasma. These fluids approximate concentrations of various solutes found in plasma and do not exert an osmotic effect in vivo. Crystalloid fluids function to expand intravascular volume without disturbing ion concentration or causing significant fluid shifts between intracellular, intravascular, and interstitial spaces.

Hypertonic solutions such as 3% saline solutions contain higher concentrations of solutes than those found in human serum. Because of this discrepancy in concentration, these fluids are osmotically active and will cause fluid shifts. Their primary indication is for emergent replacement of serum solutes, such as in hyponatremia with neurologic symptoms.

Buffered solutions contain molecules that metabolize in vivo to bicarbonate. These solutions were designed to sustain a normal physiologic plasma pH. The three commonly used molecules are lactate, acetate, and gluconate. Lactate and gluconate are hepatically metabolized to bicarbonate, while acetate is predominantly metabolized peripherally by skeletal muscle.
