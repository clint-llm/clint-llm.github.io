Specific physical examination of SLAP tears is difficult as they typically present with other pathology in the shoulder. A standard detailed history is required, as with all patients presenting to the clinic. Determining the onset of symptoms and mechanism (trauma, dislocation, or exacerbating maneuvers with overhead activity) can clue an examiner into labral pathology. Some SLAP tears present in the degenerative setting with no definitive onset of symptoms or discrete mechanisms. In these situations, evaluating the patient’s history of repetitive overhead activity or general functional history will help isolate suspicion towards the superior labrum.

It is important to discuss the patients’ activities such as athletics, profession, and baseline activity level. Ascertaining patients’ goals is also paramount as post-intervention physical demands and expectations of a high-level athlete are likely different than the aging population. Patients often complain of vague, deep shoulder pain and mechanical clicking with exacerbating activities. They may complain of night pain, which is a common complaint with several shoulder pathologies. SLAP tear patients typically admit to resolution or reduction of symptoms at rest.

Initial physical examination includes visual inspection for gross asymmetry and muscle atrophy. The skin should also be evaluated for prior surgical incisions or injuries attributed to an acute mechanism. A detailed neurovascular examination is performed and documented, complete with muscle strength testing. Active and passive motion needs to be assessed and compared to the contralateral side. Specific attention should be paid to scapulothoracic motion, as altered mechanics of the global shoulder complex can be the result of or a contributing factor to SLAP tears. As several types of SLAP tears can also be associated with instability, the general stability of the shoulder should be evaluated. The possibility of generalized hyperlaxity of tissues in all patients with instability should also be considered, and a Beighton score can easily be obtained.

There is no gold standard physical exam test that specifically identifies SLAP tears. Multiple exam maneuvers point to either labral involvement via impingement or compression mechanisms. Some tests isolate the tension placed on the superior labrum by the biceps via provocative maneuvers in active and passive forms. Additionally, specific biceps testing can be used; however, they are not reliable for SLAP tears as they can be positive with other pathologies. Below is a list of tests used to evaluate the labrum and the biceps.

**Biceps Tests**

- Speed’s

- Uppercut

- Yergason’s

- Bicipital groove tenderness

**Labral Tests**

- Anterior slide

- Biceps load I and II

- Crank

- Forced shoulder abduction and elbow flexion

- Jobes relocation

- Labral tension

- Mimori pain provocation

- Dynamic labral shear (O’Driscoll’s)

- O’Brien (active compression)

- Pronated load

- Resisted supination external rotation
