Stroke is the most common cause of morbidity and the fifth leading cause of mortality in the United States.

Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, dyslipidemia, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, kidney disease, sleep apnea, and heavy alcohol intake. AF may cause embolic strokes, and the risk increases with age. AF is the most common identifiable cause of embolic stroke.

In the United States, about 25 % of strokes are cryptogenic, and one-sixth are considered Embolic Strokes of Undetermined Source (ESUS). ESUS was first defined in 2014 as a stroke that appears non-lacunar in NeuroimagingÂ with no evidence of underlying atrial fibrillation, carotid stenosis, or dissection.
