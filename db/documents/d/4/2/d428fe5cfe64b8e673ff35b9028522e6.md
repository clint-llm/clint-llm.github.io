Histopathology of biopsies in GCA show mononuclear cell infiltrate dominated by T lymphocytes and macrophages, with the inflammatory infiltrate penetrating all layers of the arterial wall. The infiltrates can be granulomatous with the accumulation of histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells (MGCs). Granuloma formation with multinucleated giant cells can be present in infiltrates & presence of MGCs correlates with increased risk for ischemic complications. Remodeling of the arterial wall leads to vascular complications associated with GCA, whereas fibrinoid necrosis is the hallmark of ANCA-associated vasculitis. Renal biopsies in the AAVs show focal, segmental lysis of glomerular tufts, disruption of the basement membrane, and accumulation of fibrinoid material. Churg-Strauss syndrome usually shows a granulomatous vasculitis of small arteries and veins associated with eosinophilic infiltration.
