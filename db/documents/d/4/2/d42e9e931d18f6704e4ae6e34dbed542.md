Evidence-based practice is “integrating the best available evidence with the healthcare educator’s expertise and the client’s needs while considering the practice environment.

There is often confusion between quality improvement, evidence-based practice, and research. A seminal article by Shirey and colleagues.

The EBP process, as defined by Melnyk and Fineout-Overholt, includes seven steps:

- Encouraging and supporting a spirit of inquiry

- Asking questions

- Searching for evidence

- Appraising the evidence

- Integrating evidence into practice

- Evaluating outcomes

- Sharing results

Implementing EBP in practice has been shown to lead to a higher quality of care and better patient outcomes, but nurses encounter many barriers when implementing EBP. NPD practitioners can facilitate the implementation of EBP by ensuring a supportive environment for EBP, providing educational sessions to nurses about the EBP process, being role models, and mentoring nurses.
