CTX is considered a rare disease as there are only several hundred cases reported worldwide. Due to the variety of symptoms and delay in diagnosis, it is not surprising that CTX likely has a higher prevalence than reported. Older studies have suggested the prevalence of CTX in the USA among European ancestry is estimated to be 3 to 5 to 100,000 individuals.
