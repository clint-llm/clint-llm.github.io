Smooth muscle of the peroneal artery and all large arteries derive from lateral plate mesoderm and neural crest cells.Â  In general blood vessels are formed by two basic methods: 1) by vasculogenesis, where blood vessels form by the combination/ uniting of angioblasts and 2) by angiogenesis, where new vessels are formed by branching off from parent (proximal) blood vessels.
