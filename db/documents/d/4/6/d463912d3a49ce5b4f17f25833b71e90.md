The gross appearance of the spleen can be slight to moderately enlarged size and weight, with a cross-section showing widened splenic trabeculae and more commonly multifocal than a solitary nodule. The histological examination shows sinus-like anastomosing channels with an irregular lumen that resemble splenic sinusoidal architecture. These channels can have a papillary pattern as well as a cyst-like space that is lined by tall, plump endothelial cells. These endothelial cells can have hemophagocytosis and lack features of nuclear atypia or mitotic activity.
