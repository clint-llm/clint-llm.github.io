Vasculitis of the mesenteric vessels can lead to varying degrees of intestinal ischemia, leading to infarction. The most common underlying etiology is thrombosis of the superior mesenteric artery. Less common but serious complications include significant gastrointestinal bleeding, obstruction from strictures, and intussusception due to submucosal small-bowel edema. Occlusion from a thrombus in the mesenteric circulation can result in acute mesenteric ischemia.  Less common but potentially fatal complications include bowel infarction, perforation, peritonitis, and sepsis from bacterial translocation. Ischemic hepatitis resulting from vasculitis is often asymptomatic and usually manifests in the form of abnormal liver function tests.
