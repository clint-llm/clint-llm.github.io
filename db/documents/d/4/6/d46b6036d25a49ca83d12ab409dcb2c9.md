The diagnosis and management of blastomycosis are complex and best done with an interprofessional team that includes the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, dermatologist, infectious disease expert, and a pulmonologist. The key is deciding on the treatment of patients with a mild disease because spontaneous remissions can occur. However, it is recommended that all patients with the mild or moderate disease be treated to avoid dissemination and recurrence. Itraconazole is the treatment of choice for all forms of the disease, except in severe, life-threatening cases. It is recommended that 600 mg be given orally daily for three days, followed by 200 to 400 mg per day for 6 to 12 months.

The outlook for healthy patients with blastomycosis is good, but the recovery may be prolonged. In immunocompromised individuals, the outcomes are guarded.
