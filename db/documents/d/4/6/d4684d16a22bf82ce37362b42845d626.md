The result of LTP is the strengthening of neuronal synapses through increased receptor density on the post-synaptic cell and the expression of growth genes. One of the most studied signaling pathways related to long-term potentiation and memory consolidation is the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. Continuous or repetitive stimulation to specific neural connections (mediated by realizing repeated stimuli, using certain activities or rewards), activates NMDA receptors that allow the influx of calcium ions. This influx initiates second messenger pathways that are mediated by PKA and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). These pathways result in changes to protein synthesis and cell growth, mediated by the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor that binds to cAMP response elements (CRE). The binding promotes gene transcription; this has been routinely demonstrated using Aplysia, Drosophila, and rodent animal models. Cell growth and protein synthesis enhance neuronal plasticity and strengthen communication between cells.
