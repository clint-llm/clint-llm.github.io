Vitals should be monitored continuously, including heart rate, oxygen saturation, and intracranial pressure if transduced. Each pass should be less than 15 seconds in duration, and the patient should be allowed to recover between suction passes. Routine use of saline down the endotracheal tube is not recommended while suctioning.
