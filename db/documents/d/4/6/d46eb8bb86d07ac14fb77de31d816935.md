Most patients with dextrocardia are asymptomatic and lead a normal life.

The management of dextrocardia varies depending on the presence of other congenital anomalies. In patients who have other associated cardiac malformations such as defects of the walls of the heart, malposition of blood vessels, Tetralogy of Fallot, septal defects, severe valvular abnormalities, surgical reconstruction might need to be considered.

- Patients with heart blocks and abnormalities of the cardiac electrical system need to be evaluated for pacemaker placement.

- Although there is no cure for PCD available at the moment, management for these patients should involve mucolytics and expectorants to clear the secretions.

- Antibiotics might be required to fight off respiratory illness due to bacterial infections, especially in patients with accompanying asplenia.

- In patients with severe bronchiectasis affecting the quality of life, lung resection surgery should be considered.

- Neonates may present with intestinal obstruction requiring surgical management to prevent life-threatening complications.

- Patients with dextrocardia and complex congenital heart malformations might require heart transplantation with the reconstruction of the venous pathways to accommodate a normal donor heart.
