Whether histopathologic features unique to MIRM exist remains unclear. EM, SJS, and MIRM have similar histopathologic features. These include apoptotic keratinocytes and sparse perivascular dermal infiltrates. The existence of distinct biopsy features enabling histopathologic distinction between these diseases remains controversial. Rzany et al. examined specimens from erythema multiforme, SJS, and TEN, and did not find significant, consistent histologic differences; whereas, Wetter and Camilleri identified histopathologic features in drug-induced SJS that were not present in MIRM or immunization-induced SJS in some specimens examined.
