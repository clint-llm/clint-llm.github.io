Both changes and limitations in vision are of concern to the patient, and these issues span all stages of life. A significant amount of visual learning occurs in infants and young children.

Sudden loss of vision or visual disturbances may indicate serious conditions, such as cerebral vascular accident (CVA). The loss of or a deficiency in visual discrimination specifically may have more subtle clinical connotations, such as increasing difficulty in discerning and describing the correct shape of a circular clock, over time. Any condition that affects vision as a whole may also affect visual discrimination. Essentially, a patient cannot visually categorize objects that they are unable to see.
