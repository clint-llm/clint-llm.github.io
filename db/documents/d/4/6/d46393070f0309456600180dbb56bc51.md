The hand consists of five digits. These are numbered one through five, starting with the thumb as digit one and the little finger digit five. The metacarpals articulate with the wrist bones and are numbered in a similar fashion to the digits. Digits two through four have three phalanges: proximal phalanx, intermediate phalanx, and distal phalanx. The first digit has a proximal and distal phalange. The metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP) is the articulation between the metacarpal bone and the proximal phalanx. The proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) is the articulation between the proximal phalanx and the intermediate phalanx. The distal interphalangeal joint (DIP) is the articulation between the intermediate phalanx and the distal phalanx. The flexor tendons are on the volar aspect of the hand. The flexor digitorum profundus inserts on the distal phalanx. The flexor digitorum superficialis inserts on the intermediate phalanx. The extensor tendons run on the dorsal aspect of the hand. The extensor digitorum has a median band that attaches to the intermediate phalanx, and two lateral bands that attach to the distal phalanx.
