Epidural steroid injections require:

- Fluoroscopic C-arm x-ray device

- Epidural spinal needles

- Local anesthetic (lidocaine or bupivacaine)

- Steroids (methylprednisolone acetate, triamcinolone acetate, betamethasone acetate, and phosphate or dexamethasone phosphate)

- Loss of resistance syringe

- Contrast solution

- Sterile gloves and drapes

- Betadine

Epidural steroid injection may be completed with only topical local anesthesia or under intravenous (IV) sedation. In either case, it is necessary to have blood pressure cuffs, cardiac monitors, and pulse oximeters to monitor vital signs.
