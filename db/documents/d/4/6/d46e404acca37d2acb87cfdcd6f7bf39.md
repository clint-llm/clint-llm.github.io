Laboratory evaluation of thrombocytopenia starts with a review of peripheral smear. Pseudothrombocytopenia, defined as clumping of platelets on peripheral smear, can happen in up to 1% of all pregnancies.

A complete blood count with differential helps in realizing the degree of thrombocytopenia and provides a clue about the etiology.

- Thrombocytopenia along with changes in other cell lines

- Thrombocytopenia, along with hemolytic anemia: TMA should be the first consideration in a pregnant woman presenting with anemia and thrombocytopenia.

- Hemolysis labs include lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin levels, total and direct bilirubin, and reticulocyte count, and the clinician should obtain an index in patients suspected with hemolytic anemia.
- The diagnosis of TMA usually involves the triad of thrombocytopenia, along with hemolysis and renal failure/injury.
- Specific test to rule out TTP includes testing for ADAMTS-13. A level of ADAMTS-13 above 5 to 10% usually rules out TTP.
- In patients suspected of atypical HUS, a genetic test must be pursued to identify mutations that prevent the expression or function of proteins involved in the regulation of the alternate C3 pathway.


- Thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding: A coagulation panel should always be done to identify any coagulopathy which may complicate thrombocytopenia with bleeding. As mentioned above, DIC can occur in association with TMA or secondary to obstetric causes.
- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH): The diagnosis of PNH is via flow cytometric analysis of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-AP) along with a decreased expression of both CD55 and CD59. CD55 and CD59 are still tested to exclude rare, inherited deficiency of single GPI-AP.

- Isolated thrombocytopenia:

- Immune thrombocytopenia: ITP usually presents as isolated thrombocytopenia with petechiae or bleeding manifestations.Helicobacter Pylori testing should take place in areas with high prevalence.
- Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): Although rare, HIT can cause thrombocytopenia in pregnancy.

Gestational thrombocytopenia is a diagnosis of exclusion which is based on a thorough history and physical exam and ruling out of conflicting diagnosis with lab support. With sufficient exclusion of other etiologies, then no further laboratory evaluation is needed to confirm a diagnosis of gestational thrombocytopenia.
