Contraindications to NIPPV include:

- The need for intubation

- Encephalopathy or altered mental status

- Hemodynamic instability

- Facial trauma or facial defects

- Airway obstruction secondary to a mass

- Anticipated need for prolonged mechanical ventilation

- Gastrointestinal bleeding

Contraindications to invasive positive pressure ventilation include:

- The patientâ€™s wishes are clearly against ventilatory support

- Situations in which NIPPV is a reasonable alternative to provide respiratory support as there are fewer possible complications associated with its use compared to classic invasive mechanical ventilation (excessive sedation, ventilator-associated pneumonia, barotrauma, and volutrauma).
