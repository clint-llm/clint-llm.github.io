Arterial pressure monitors provide continuous information on a patient's hemodynamics. This information is invaluableÂ to assist in timely clinical decision-making and intervention in the care of critically ill patients. Analysis of the arterial pressure wave can allow the clinician to better understand the patient's heart function as the arterial pressure wave corresponds with the cardiac cycle. During systole, the aortic valve opens, and there is a rapid ejection of blood from the left ventricle into the aorta. The arterial waveform will show an upswing followed by a downward turn. The closure of the aortic valve marks the beginning of diastole. The arterial waveform will show a notch on the downward stroke; this notch is called the dicrotic notch and is due to the closure of the aortic valve. The remainder of the downward stroke is the diastolic flow of blood into the arterial tree. A patient with abnormal heart rhythm or valvular abnormalities will have an abnormal arterial waveform.
