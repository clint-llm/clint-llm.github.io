Clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs) are responsible for correct and appropriate diagnoses to ensure their patients receive treatment for their condition(s). Rare conditions, known as orphan diseases, are a known source of potential misdiagnosis. In addition, once a correct diagnosis is reached, the physician and healthcare team must recommend an appropriate treatment plan.

The Orphan Drug Act (ODA) incentivizes pharmaceutical companies to develop drug treatments for rare diseases in the United States. However, these treatments may be costly and prohibitive to receiving treatment in some cases. Therefore, clinicians and healthcare team members should educate themselves about current rare diseases and available treatment options for these conditions. Healthcare professionals can also stay informed about current trials for rare diseases that may offer their patients an early opportunity to receive treatment. Improved communication among healthcare professionals, including MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs, and pharmacists, regarding managing rare diseases can improve patient outcomes with these conditions. [Level 5]
