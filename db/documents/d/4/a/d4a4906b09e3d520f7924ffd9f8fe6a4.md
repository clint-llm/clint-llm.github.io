Most patients with coronary artery anomalies (CAAs) either die suddenly or have no characteristic presentation and are asymptomatic for a large portion of their lives. An atypical chest pain syndrome is the most common reason they are referred for coronary angiography, where CAAs are usually diagnosed.

Other non-invasive tests include coronary computed tomographic angiography (coronary CT angiography) and cardiac magnetic resonance angiography (CMRA). Reports regarding the use of these modalities to diagnose CAAs have been encouraging, especially since three-dimensional reconstructions of the coronary anatomy can be now done. Currently, coronary CT angiography is the gold standard in diagnosing CAAs.

For those with identified CAAs, nuclear stress test should be done to evaluate for effort-induced ischemia, scars and, most importantly, to establish a baseline for follow-up in case intervention is needed in the future.
