Tissue samples for histopathological examination of the bladder are collected via cystoscopy biopsy or radical cystectomy resections. Diagnosticians can use image-guided percutaneous bladder biopsy if there are contraindications to cystoscopy or surgery. Formalin-fixed tissue embedded in paraffin wax or frozen sections is helpful for routine hematoxylin and eosin histopathology examination of the urinary bladder.
