Unfortunately, PAM tends to have a grave prognosis and only 3 cases of survival have been reported in the United States as mentioned above. All 3 survivors were young and healthy at baseline. Even though the mortality associated with PAM is high, the incidence is low.

**Prevention**

Some practices recommended by the CDC include avoidance of nasal introduction of water. This includes keeping the head above water or using nose clips when swimming. Avoidance of recreational activities in freshwater during periods of high water temperatures is also recommended. In cases where nasal irrigation is required like using a neti pot or religious practices, like ablution, sterile, distilled, filtered, or boiled water should be used. Adequately disinfecting water bodies like pools and public water system with chlorine can also prevent infection.
