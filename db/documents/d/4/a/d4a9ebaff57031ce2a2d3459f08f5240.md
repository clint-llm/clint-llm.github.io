A difficult airway is a clinical situation wherein a healthcare provider who is skilled at airway management experiences difficulty with one or more recognised techniques. Various algorithms have been outlined by expert international bodies to provide a basic pathway for managing difficult airways. It is vital that all practitioners who attempt advanced airway management be familiar with the equipment and techniques necessary for successful airway management. This activity reviews how to identify a difficult airway and highlights the role of the inter-professional team in the management of these patients.
