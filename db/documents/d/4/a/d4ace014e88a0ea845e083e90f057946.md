Ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) is an important pathological entity for clinicians since it closely mimics common conjunctival and corneal surface pathologies like pinguecula, pterygium, conjunctival granulomas, and cysts.

Since then, OSSN has been extensively studied with the evolution of new treatment modalities. OSSN can have purely conjunctival involvement, purely corneal involvement, or conjunctival tumors extending over the cornea. The malignancies can range from conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) to squamous cell carcinoma.

The squamous neoplasms have further been classified as non-invasive and invasive types.

- Benign OSSN- pseudotheliomatous hyperplasia, benign hereditary intraepithelial dyskeratosis and, papilloma

- Preinvasive OSSN - conjunctival/corneal intraepithelial neoplasms grades Iâ€“III

- Invasive OSSN- squamous carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma
