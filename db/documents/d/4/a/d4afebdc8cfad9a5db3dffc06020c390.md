# Definition/Introduction

One significant component of patient care is determining a patient’s disability level and impairment rating to determine what disability services they can receive. The first step to creating an accurate patient evaluation is ensuring that health care professionals understand the difference between “impairment” and “disability.” An impairment can be understood as any deviation or loss of any body function or body structure

# Issues of Concern

In order for individuals to receive aid from disability services, they must establish their impairment or disability through medical evidence. This means that without the evaluation and assessment of a health care provider, individuals may not qualify for disability aid

Though many disability service providers use the guidelines established by the American Medical Association’s Guide to Permanent Injury, some disability providers choose not to use them because of concerns about the accuracy of these guidelines

# Clinical Significance

Though the qualifications for different disability services vary, there are similarities in the assessment process. An impairment rating is likely to include a physical/psychological examination, an assessment of causation, and a credibility assessment. It is important to mention that the credibility assessment is not a character judgment about the patient, but rather an assessment of the consistency of the allegations to determine an accurate depiction of the patient’s condition.

Some organizations use Functional Capacity evaluations, though there is mixed evidence about the effectiveness of these evaluations

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

Disability service providers determine from which agents they will accept an impairment rating. Many systems require providers with a physician-level license, though some will accept third-party evidence from physical therapists, occupational therapists, and similar providers. Regardless of who is conducting the evaluation or assisting with providing evidence, health care professionals need to understand the difference between impairment and disability. Evidence shows that disability and impairment are distinctly separate factors. Evidence also suggests that considering disability as a separate factor to impairment may lead to a better understanding of the individual cases for disability determination
