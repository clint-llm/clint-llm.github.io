Causes of pediatric cataracts are diverse and can range from being idiopathic to being associated with systemic disorders. They can be unilateral or bilateral based on etiology. A majority of unilateral and some bilateral cases are idiopathic.

- Idiopathic

- Intrauterine infection (TORCH infections- toxoplasma, CMV retinitis, rubella, HSV)

- Drug-induced

- Corticosteroids

- Metabolic disorders
- Galactosemia
- Galactokinase deficiency
- Hypocalcemia
- Hypoglycemia

- Trauma

- Accidental
- Non-accidental
- Radiation
- Laser photocoagulation

- Other associated ocular diseases

- Microphthalmia, Microcornea
- Aniridia
- Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV)
- Peter anomaly
- Corneal guttae
- Coloboma

- Inherited without systemic abnormalities
- Autosomal dominant (most common)
- Autosomal recessive (mostly seen in families with a history of consanguinity)
- X-linked

- Associated with systemic abnormalities
- Chromosomal abnormalities

- Trisomy 21
- Turner syndrome
- Trisomy 13
- Trisomy 18
- Cri-du-chat syndrome


- Cerebro-oculofacial-skeletal syndrome (COFS)
- Mitochondrial abnormalities

- Complex I deficiency


- Renal disease

- Lowe syndrome


- Skeletal disease

- Smith-Lemli-Opitz
- Conradi syndrome
- Weill-Marchesani syndrome


- Syndactyly, polydactyly, or digital abnormalities

- Bardet-Biedl syndrome
- Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome


- Central nervous system abnormalities

- Zellweger syndrome
- Meckel-Gruber syndrome


- Cardiac disease

- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy


- Dermatological

- Cockayne syndrome
- Rothmund-Thomson
- Atopic dermatitis
- Incontinentia pigmenti
- Progeria
- Ichthyosis
- Ectodermal dysplasia


- Dental Anomalies

- Nance-Horan syndrome
- Lenz syndrome

Causes of bilateral congenital cataracts:

- Idiopathic

- Intrauterine infection (TORCH infections- toxoplasma, CMV retinitis, rubella, HSV)

- Multisystem genetic disorder

- Inborn errors of metabolism

- Endocrinopathies

- Trauma

- Uveitic cataract
