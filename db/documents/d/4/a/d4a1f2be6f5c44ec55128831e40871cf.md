Overall, vascular ring anomalies are a broad category of embryologic vascular anatomic variants that can be associated with respiratory and feeding problems. Symptomatic children with pulmonary artery sling (PAS) and associated tracheal stenosis have increased mortality if no surgery is performed.

The variety of tracheal surgical repair techniques and PAS repair techniques has led to improved overall mortality after surgery, especially over the past 20 years. Left pulmonary artery transaction with reimplantation, slide tracheoplasty, median sternotomy, and cardiopulmonary bypass is recommended for the repair of both defects.

The 15-year survival for patients who had PAS repair alone was 100% in a retrospective study across two institutions of 33 patients.Â However, PAS and tracheal repair survival were decreased to 76% (+/- 10%). Late survival is good, with the majority remaining asymptomatic.

Outcomes for PAS appear to be associated with the complexity of commonly associated anomalies, including complex cardiac and tracheal lesions.

The exact indicators for surgical intervention of congenital tracheal stenosis are still being explored since the range of tracheal stenosis, and symptoms are variable.
