Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a rare neuromuscular disorder,Â  which is 46 times less prevalent than Myasthenia Gravis (MG). However, the annual incidence of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome was only 10 to 14 times lower than MG. The increased prevalence of MG compared to Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome speaks to the poor prognosis and survival of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome specifically when associated with SCLC.

Sixty percent to 75% of the patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome were male compared to the female predilection seen in MG. The mean age of presentation associated with paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome was 58 years. In Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome that was not associated with malignancy. The age and sex distribution were similar to that of MG, with a peak age of onset of 35 years and a second larger peak at 60 years. The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome without malignancy has a near-normal survival rate.
