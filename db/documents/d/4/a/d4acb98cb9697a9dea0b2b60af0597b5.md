A lesion suspicious clinically for dysplastic nevus should be excised completely, whether by shave, punch, or excisional biopsy. The complete removal of the lesion is so the dermatopathologist may evaluate the entire lesion for symmetry and appreciate the shoulder sign, which is characteristic of dysplastic nevi. For this reason, an incisional biopsy is not recommended.

Dermoscopy is a tool used by dermatologists to evaluate pigment patterns and secondary features such as vascularity in suspicious skin lesions. There are clear and well-studied dermoscopic features that are characteristic for certain neoplasms such as basal cell carcinoma, seborrheic keratosis, and melanoma. However, there are currently no dermoscopic criteria that distinguish dysplastic nevi from melanoma in situ.
