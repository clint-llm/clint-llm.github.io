While some congenital arteriovenous fistulas can be fatal, leading to failure to survive, the overall prognosis is good. Peripheral arteriovenous fistula does not typically incur systemic hemodynamic effects, and around 15% of all AVFs do.

The Schobinger Classification is a clinical staging system that serves to predict the success of treatment. Stage 1 is of quiescence and is described as cutaneous blush and skin warmth at the site of the fistula. The second stage demonstrates darkened skin, a pulsatile lesion with a bruit on auscultation, or palpable thrill. This stage is called expansion. Stage 3, the destruction phase, is essentially steal syndrome and is characterized by skin changes, ulceration, and distal ischemia. Stage 4 is the decompensated phase, characterized by high output heart failure. While it has been shown that decompensated heart failure can be completely reversed after a high-flow AVF is closed, the prognosis is much better in patients who present earlier.

Prompt recognition is crucial for favorable outcomes. Brinjikji et al observed spinal dural AVFs which are either easily missed on imaging or misdiagnosed. These cases were diagnosed at their institution.They stated that delays in establishing a diagnosis in these cases led to an increased incidence of additional irreversible disability that frequently could not be corrected surgically or otherwise.
