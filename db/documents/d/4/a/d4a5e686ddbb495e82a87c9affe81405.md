Familial combined hyperlipidemia can present with varying laboratory findings in different individuals and members of the same family. The laboratory results may reveal elevated levels of serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, mixed triglycerides, increased very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), increased low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), raised levels of apolipoprotein B (apo-B), or reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL).

Several studies have reported an association between FCH and increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. Therefore, a carotid ultrasound may be performed to assess the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with FCH.
