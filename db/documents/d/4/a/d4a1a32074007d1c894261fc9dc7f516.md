Aeromedical transportation involves the use of fixed-wing (airplane) or rotor-wing (helicopter) aircraft to move patients from one location to another. Using aircraft for this purpose began in World War I, with the goal of moving wounded soldiers from the battlefield to hospitals in a more rapid manner. Today, the civilian and military sectors depend on helicopters and airplanes to respond to medical and trauma emergencies that may not be well served by ground ambulances. Approximately 3% of all ambulance transports in the United States are performed by aeromedical assets, with over 300 air ambulance services, 1000 bases, and 1400 registered aircraft according to the 2017 Atlas and Database of Air Medical Services (ADAMS). The care emergency medical service (EMS) providers offer has changed drastically over the past 60 years. Advancements in technology and field care now allow EMS to provide critical medical and trauma care while moving the patient toward definitive care.

This activity reviews basic information regarding comparisons between air and ground transportation, medical care provided in aircraft, different mission profiles, safety and cost considerations, preparing patients for transport, and the potential clinical impact of air medical services.
