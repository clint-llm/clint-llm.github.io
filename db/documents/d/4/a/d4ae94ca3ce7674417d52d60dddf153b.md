Recognizing individuals with a history of alcohol abuse can help prevent the progression of withdrawal symptoms. The US Preventative Services Task Force recommends screening individuals age of 18 or older involved with risky drinking and engaging these individuals with behavior therapy and interventions to decrease alcohol misuse. There is a lack of consensus in the prophylactic treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Variations in hospital-wide policies in treating alcohol withdrawal exist and the medications used includeÂ benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide (Librium), and even gabapentin (Neurontin).
