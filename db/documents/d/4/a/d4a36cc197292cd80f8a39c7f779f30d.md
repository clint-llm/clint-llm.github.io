Urticaria and angioedema result from the activation of mast cells and basophils. Mast cell degranulation leads to the release of immune mediators. The primary mediator is histamine, which binds to H-receptors located on endothelial cells and sensory nerves. However, prostaglandin, leukotrienes, and a variety of cytokines and chemokines are also involved. Ultimately, this induces vasodilatation - increased permeability of vessels - and in turn, dermal edema and recruitment of inflammatory cells.

Activation of mast cells can be divided into immunological and non-immunological processes.

- Immunological activation is mediated by effectors of adaptive immunity binding receptors on mast cells. In type 1 hypersensitivity, crosslinking of allergen with IgE on sensitized mast cells leads to acute urticaria and anaphylaxis. In CSU, however, immunological activation of mast cells is thought to occur independently of allergen-IgE complexes and may involve IgG (type 2 hypersensitivity), circulating immune complexes (type 3 hypersensitivity), and T-cells (type 4 hypersensitivity).

- Non-immunological activation can be mediated by physical factors, as in CIndU, as well as food and drug molecules independent of adaptive immunity. In CSU, it may be that the threshold for activation by external stimuli is reduced.
