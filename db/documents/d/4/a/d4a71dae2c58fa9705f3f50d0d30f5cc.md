The venous drainage of the foot involves several vessels, including the plantar and dorsal venous arches, the great saphenous vein, and the small saphenous vein. Similarly to what takes place in the hand, the plantar and dorsal venous arches of the foot have digital veins that extend between each toe and drain into the arches. The foot also contains large medial and lateral plantar veins that eventually join posteriorly to form the deep tibial veins and anteriorly form the anterior tibial veins. These veins contribute to the plantar pump, a physiological mechanism to propel blood back toward the heart.
