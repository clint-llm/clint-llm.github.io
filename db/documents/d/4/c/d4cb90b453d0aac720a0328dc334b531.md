Subacute combined degeneration is treated with vitamin B12 supplementation, which can be administered by intramuscular, deep subcutaneous, oral, or sublingual routes. The most commonly used preparations are cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin. The dose of vitamin B12, route of administration, and duration of treatment depends on the presenting symptoms, the urgency of treatment, the underlying etiology, and the patient's preference.

Generally, cobalamin deficiency is treated with doses of 1000 mcg orally once daily. Patients with malabsorption require higher oral daily dosing of 1000 to 2000 mcg. Parenterally, cyanocobalamin is administered at a dose of 1000 mcg once a week for one month, followed by 1000 mcg once every month. Patients with subacute combined degeneration require more aggressive and rapid treatment to prevent irreversible neurological deficits. Such patients are best treated by parenteral therapy, at least initially, and can be transitioned to oral therapy once the deficiency is corrected. A suggested dosing regimen for patients with neurological symptoms is 1000 mcg every alternate day for two weeks, followed by once every month administration of cyanocobalamin.

Response to therapy is assessed by monitoring hematological markers and improvement in symptoms. Generally, markers of hemolysis decrease in one to two days, and reticulocytosis occur within three to four days. This is followed by the improvement of anemia and the disappearance of hyper segmented neutrophils, which takes approximately two weeks. Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia take three to four weeks to resolve. Vitamin B12 levels should also be monitored at regular intervals. Monitoring is conducted more frequently in patients with subacute combined degeneration and should be continued until a complete response has been elicited. While laboratory markers show rapid improvement, clinical improvement for neurological symptoms takes at least 3 to 12 months.
