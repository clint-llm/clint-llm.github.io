Ischemic back pain, such as symptomatic peripheral vascular disease and refractory angina, are possible indications for spinal cord stimulation implantation in inoperable cases. Spinal cord stimulators can improve New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification and enhance the quality of life.

Separately, failed back surgery syndrome is the most common indication for spinal cord stimulator implant. Spinal cord stimulation is an effective analgesic. Implantation is used for persistent radicular pain following surgery.

Implantation of a stimulator is more effective than medical treatment for greater than fifty percent pain reduction for a multitude of chronic pain disorders, including diabetic neuropathy, chronic back pain, peripheral vascular pain (ischemic pain), failed back surgery syndrome, complex regional pain.
