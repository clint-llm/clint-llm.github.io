Generally, the prognosis for patients who have minimal to no external signs and with unremarkable radiologic workups is favorable. In terms of traumatic sequelae delayed vascular findings are of importance, however with current imaging technology these cases are rare. The prognosis for these patients then becomes a matter of the psychosocial reasons that may have resulted in the injury, and depend on mitigation of exposure.

Severely injured patients, and those with particularly devastating signs of neurological injury, tend to do much worse. Prognosis depends heavily on the extent and duration of anoxic brain injury, and long term recovery depends upon the specific areas of the brain involved. While patients with a low Glasgow Coma Scale tend to do worse, initial neurological conditions do not exclude a favorable recovery. Patients presenting in cardiac arrest tend to have a very grave prognosis.
