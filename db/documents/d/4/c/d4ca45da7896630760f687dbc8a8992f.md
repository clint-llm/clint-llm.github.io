The differential diagnosis for shoulder dystocia includes but is not limited to umbilical cord prolapse, breech delivery, or other elements consistent with an emergent delivery and/or perimortem cesarean section (c-section) delivery.

A clear understanding of the anatomy of the brachial plexus will help diagnosticians to distinguish the common brachial plexopathies from one another correctly. Upper lesions cause Erb's palsy, with weakness in the axillary, suprascapular, musculocutaneous, and radial nerve distributions. Lower lesions cause Klumpke palsy, with a claw hand deformity. And total plexus palsies result in a flaccid arm with both sensory and motor deficits. Practitioners must also consider the possibility of spinal pathology and peripheral nerve injury as well. Careful physical examination and observation are the most important tools for correct diagnosis and management.
