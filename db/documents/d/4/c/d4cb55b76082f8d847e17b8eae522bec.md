The FTY720 (fingolimod) is a novel immunosuppressive agent that has been investigated in the last few decades. FTY is highly effective in prolonging graft survival in preclinical models of transplantation and multiple sclerosis. FTY720 is an immunomodulator. Its mode of action differs completely from traditional immunosuppressants. It is a new class of drugs named sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P-R) modulators.

ASP0028, an S1P1/S1P5-selective agonist, with comparable efficacy to FTY720 and wider safety margins than FTY720, showed the efficacy and safety when it was co-administered with suboptimal-dose of tacrolimus in a monkey renal transplantation model. ASP0028 administration remarkably reduced peripheral lymphocytes, including subsets of CD4+/ or CD8+/naive and memory cells, CD4+/Treg cells, and B cells, but not CD4+/ or CD8+/effector memory cells and natural killer (NK) cells. These data support the finding that ASP0028 and tacrolimus prolong renal allograft survival in primates.
