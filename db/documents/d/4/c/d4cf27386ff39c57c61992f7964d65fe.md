**Vertebral artery anatomy**

- Segment 1 takes off at the first branch of the subclavian artery until it reaches the foramina of C5-C6.

- Segment 2 runs within the transverse foramina from C5/C6 until C2.

- Segment 3 is the tortuous segment that starts at the transverse foramina of C2 and runs in the posterolateral part, looping around C1 and then passing between the atlas and the occiput. This segment of the artery is encased with nerves, muscles, and the atlanto-occipital membrane.

- Segment 4 is the intracranial segment; it pierces the dura at the foramen magnum runs until the junction of the medulla and pons; here it merges with the basilar artery.

The majority of spontaneous dissections occur in segment 3, which may extend and involve segment 4.

The arterial anatomy consists of three layers named theÂ intimal (innermost), the media (middle), and the adventitia (outermost layer). Dissection occurs when the structural integrity of the arterial wall is compromised. Intimal tears lead to arterial blood dissecting between the layers of the arterial wall. The blood within the arterial wall precipitates hematoma and clot formation.
