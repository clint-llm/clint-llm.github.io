Although the formation of cerebral saccular aneurysms is not completely understood, it isÂ thought to be primarily associated with hemodynamically induced degenerative vascular changes. Inflammatory changes also play a role in their formation. Most saccular aneurysms are acquired, but they can be inherited.

Acquired risk factors of saccular aneurysm formation may include the following:

- Advanced age

- Hypertension

- Excessive alcohol consumption

- Cigarette smoking

- Atherosclerosis of the cerebral arteries

- Trauma to the head

- Use of illicit drugs such as cocaine

- Estrogen deficiency

Inherited risk factors of saccular aneurysm formation may include the following:

- Polycystic kidney disease

- Arteriovenous malformation

- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome

- Marfan syndrome

- Loeys-Dietz syndrome

- Fibromuscular dysplasia

- Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia

- Tuberous sclerosis

- Family history of aneurysms

- Alpha-glucosidase deficiency

- Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency

- Coarctation of the aorta

- Klinefelter syndrome

- Noonan syndrome

- Female gender

Family history is the strongest indicator of rupture among non-modifiable risk factors. Compared to the general population, first-degree relatives of persons with cerebral aneurysms or previous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) have a risk of 3 to 7 times higher.

The etiology of saccular aortic aneurysms is almost similar to that of saccular cerebral aneurysms. The most common risk factor of saccular aortic aneurysms is atherosclerotic disease; other less common risk factors include aortic infections, trauma, chronic inflammatory/autoimmune conditions (Behcet disease, giant cell arteritis, rheumatoid arthritis, Takayasu arteritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis), presence of bicuspid aortic valve or previous aortic surgeries.****In addition to the above genetic conditions listed under cerebral aneurysms, saccular aortic aneurysms can be associated with Turner syndrome.
