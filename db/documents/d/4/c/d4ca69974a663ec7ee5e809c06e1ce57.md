**PSA Testing: The Controversy**

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a protein produced by the prostate and is abundant in semen. Its natural function is to divide seminogelin in the semen, which helps in liquefaction. The expression of PSA is androgen-regulated.

It was originally used as a prostatic tissue stain to help determine the etiology of tumors of unknown origin. Later, serum levels of PSA were used as a prostate cancer screening tool because serum PSA levels start to increase significantly about seven to nine years before the clinical diagnosis of malignancy.  While a good indicator of prostatic disorders, PSA elevation is not specific for cancer as it is also elevated in benign prostatic hyperplasia, infection, infarction, inflammation (prostatitis), and after sex or prostatic manipulation. It also cannot reliably distinguish between low-risk/low-grade disease and high-risk/high-grade cancers.

About 80% of the patients currently diagnosed with prostate cancer are initially investigated due to an elevated serum PSA.

While it unquestionably increases prostate cancer detection rates, the value of PSA testing is less clear in avoiding overtreatment, improving quality of life, and lengthening overall survival, which is why routine PSA screening for prostate cancer remains quite controversial.

PSA testing became widely available in the United States in 1992. Since then, according to the American Cancer Society, prostate cancer detection rates have increased substantially, by 58%, while the prostate cancer-specific death rate has declined by about 15% and the total number of yearly deaths from prostate cancer has remained about the same despite the US male population increasing by 28.6% (from 126 million to 162 million).

**More impressively, according to the National Cancer Institute, since 1992, the death rate from prostate cancer in the United States has dropped by an amazing 44% which is substantially due to PSA screenings resulting in earlier prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment.**

The current controversy is whether PSA screening provides sufficient benefits to offset the complications and side effects of "unnecessary" biopsies and curative therapies since most men with prostate cancer will have slow-growing, low-grade cancers for whom definitive, curative therapy often causes considerable harm with little or no survival benefit.

- In 2012, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against all routine screening PSA tests due primarily to the risks of overtreatment without proof of any substantial survival benefit. This initially seemed reasonable as most prostate cancers are low-grade and remain asymptomatic. They concluded the potential benefits of PSA testing and earlier definitive cancer therapy did not outweigh the increased risks of side effects and complications from overtreatment.

- This conclusion was made before the current, widespread use of active surveillance for low-grade, localized disease, advanced PSA test biomarker analogs such as PCA3, SelectMDx, ExosomeDx, MyProstateScore (MPS), and the "4K" test, MRI prostate imaging, and MRI-TRUS fusion guided biopsies, genomic marker analysis of low and intermediate-risk cancers, all of which mitigate in favor of PSA cancer screening as long as reasonable steps are taken to avoid overtreatment.

- The original 2012 USPSTF recommendation was also inconsistent with numerous studies showing a 50% or more cancer-specific survival benefit in PSA screened populations compared to their unscreened cohorts if followed for more than ten years.

**The Current USPSTF Recommendation**

**For men 55 to 69 years of age, the decision regarding whether to be screened for prostate cancer by PSA should be an individual one after a full discussion about the benefits, harms, and limitations of such screening.**

Routine PSA screenings are not recommended in men 75 years or over, based on the conclusion that definitive treatment of localized cancers for most older men has minimal effect on overall survival while adding significant treatment side effects and morbidities to many. It is also not recommended in men who realistically have <10 years of life expectancy.

Many professional organizations now have guidelines and recommendations regarding PSA screening for prostate cancer. Most include a recommendation for an informed discussion with patients about the benefits and potential risks of screenings, biopsies, definitive therapy, and possible overtreatment. Some guidelines lower the age to stop routine screening at age 70 depending on health status and family history. Regardless, this is an individual decision best made by patients and family members after a thorough discussion of the pros and cons of continuing screening.

**Prostate Cancer Screening: The Pros and Cons**

Screening options include a digital rectal exam and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. Such screenings may lead to a biopsy with some associated risks. Transrectal ultrasound has no role in prostate cancer screenings.

Routine screening with a DRE, and particularly PSA testing, has become very controversial. Here are some of the arguments for and against:

**Against PSA Screenings**

- There was no real change in overall survival for most patients for at least the first ten years after the initial diagnosis.

- Many patients (about three-quarters) are getting negative biopsies or show only low-risk disease, which is often overtreated.

- Screenings are only likely to catch relatively slow-growing tumors and will miss the rapidly growing, aggressive tumors that are the most lethal.

- Increased patient anxiety from low-risk, low-grade prostate cancer will ultimately not affect survival.

- "Unnecessary" biopsies contribute to patient anxiety, are uncomfortable, add cost, and may have complications like infections and bleeding.

- Several recent large studies show little or no survival benefit to large-scale screenings.

- As suggested by some recent studies (PIVOT), there is little point in doing prostate cancer screenings if treatment offers little or no survival benefit.

- Foreign countries with good healthcare systems which do not perform widespread PSA testing have noted similar reductions in prostate cancer-specific survival compared to countries like the United States with extensive PSA screenings.

**In Favor of PSA Screenings**

- Prostate cancer is still the second leading cause of cancer death in men, and the incidence is increasing.

- Ignoring our best diagnostic screening test for prostate cancer will not reduce its mortality.

- We now have active surveillance, MRI imaging, and MRI-TRUS fusion biopsies, as well as genomic testing so that we can avoid overtreating patients.

- Eliminating routine PSA screenings, as recommended by the earlier USPSTF report of 2012, has already caused a significant reduction of about 30% in prostate cancer diagnoses. At least some of these cancers will ultimately be high-grade and will undoubtedly increase prostate cancer mortality.

- A review of the SEER data indicated that the incidence of metastatic prostate cancer increased significantly immediately after the USPSTF recommendations against PSA testing were released. This increase was noted in all age groups and ethnicities.

- Many of the larger studies suggesting a lack of survival benefit to large-scale PSA screenings have been shown to be poorly done, significantly biased, severely contaminated, and full of major statistical errors.

- Well-done studies comparing PSA screened and unscreened populations clearly show a cancer-specific survival advantage consistently at or above 50% for the screened groups if followed for more than ten years.

- According to the NIH, prostate cancer mortality has dropped over 44% since 1992, when PSA testing became widely available in the United States. This is almost double the benefit in foreign countries that do not perform extensive PSA testing.

- The prostate cancer death rate in Sweden, where PSA testing is minimal, is higher than lung cancer and more than double the mortality rate for prostate cancer in the United States.

- Long-term studies from Scandinavia and elsewhere prove that definitive treatment works, but it may take more than 10 to 15 years to become evident.

- It has been estimated by the NIH that in 10 years, an additional 25,000 to 30,000 men could die each year from preventable, potentially curable prostate cancer if we completely stopped all PSA screenings.

- Only 9% of all new prostate cancer cases present with advanced disease, compared with 32% before the PSA era. This represents a 72% reduction.

- Less than 4% of all new cases initially present with metastatic disease compared to 21% before widespread PSA screenings. This is an 80% reduction in the incidence of metastatic prostate cancer at the time of initial diagnosis that can only be explained by the benefits of PSA screenings.

- We are constantly improving diagnostic testing and treatment options to lower costs and minimize side effects while increasing survival and improving quality of life, but without early PSA screening, these new minimally invasive technologies cannot be used.

**Recommended General Guide to PSA Testing**

- An initial PSA test at 40 to 45 years of age is recommended because it is highly predictive of future prostate cancer risk, it provides a baseline, and it can help identify the rare but aggressive malignancies that appear prior to age 50.

- We recommend routine PSA screenings only in reasonably healthy men from 45 to 75 years of age who wish it after a frank discussion of the benefits, limitations, and potential risks of screening.

- We do not recommend screening in patients who would not accept treatment even if cancer were found.

- We do not recommend routine screening in healthy men over age 75 with normal PSA levels up to that point, as they are not likely to benefit from treatment.

- We encourage screening only in men who are reasonably expected to have at least a 10-year life expectancy from the time of diagnosis. (For most newly discovered localized prostate cancers, the survival benefit from treatment does not begin until at least ten years after therapy.)

- We encourage screening in men at high risk due to ethnicity, family history, or proven germline mutations.

- We recommend PSA testing in men with an abnormal digital rectal examination suggestive of cancer regardless of age.

- Finally, regardless of the above, we recommend doing PSA testing in all men who request it as long as they are fully aware of the risks, benefits, and limitations of screening, even if they fall outside the usual guidelines.

**Summary of Genomic Prostate Cancer Tests (Beyond PSA)**

**Pre-biopsy**

Initial basic screening would include total PSA, free and total PSA, and PSA density levels. At least two separate PSA levels should be done before proceeding with more advanced testing. Some experts suggest using 4 to 6 weeks of a prostate-specific antibiotic (such as doxycycline, a fluoroquinolone, or sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) between the two tests.

Improved pre-biopsy "liquid biopsy" screening tests would include PCA3, the Prostate Health Index (PHI), MyProstateScore (MPS), the "4K" blood test, ExoDx or Exosome test, and SelectMDx. Overall, these tests have over 90% negative predictive value and can safely exclude about 25% of patients with persistently elevated PSA levels from further testing and unnecessary biopsies. They are best utilized prior to MRI imaging or a biopsy in men with persistently elevated PSA levels or as a confirmation after a negative MRI examination in borderline cases.

**Post-Biopsy**

- A patient with a negative initial tissue biopsy being considered for a repeat prostatic biopsy can best be further analyzed and risk-stratified by tissue-based genomic bioassay such as ConfirmMDx.

- Men on active surveillance can be tracked and followed with genomic testing or serial PCA3 testing in addition to standard PSA levels.

- Patients with low-grade or intermediate-grade disease being considered for either active surveillance or definitive therapy would benefit most from the Prolaris test.

- Patients with low-grade or intermediate-grade disease considering radical prostatectomy can be evaluated with either the Decipher, Oncotype Dx Prostate, Prolaris, or ProMark test.

- Patients who are post-radiation therapy or diagnosed with prostate cancer after TURP surgery can best be tracked with the Prolaris genomic biomarker test.

- Overall prognosis, cancer-specific survival, and risk of metastases are best assessed in post-radical prostatectomy patients with a genomic test that serves as a prognostic marker of cancer control outcomes such as either Decipher or Prolaris.

**Clinical Trials**

Patients should be encouraged to consider participation in prostate cancer clinical trials whenever possible. These can be found at several locations.

- Cancer.org will present clinical trials in prostate cancer sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Health.

- The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium (PCCTC) is a clinical research group jointly sponsored by the Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Research Program and the Prostate Cancer Foundation. The coordinating center is located at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. There are 43 participating or affiliated clinical research sites. Information on the clinical trials available there can be found at pcf.org or pcctc.org.
