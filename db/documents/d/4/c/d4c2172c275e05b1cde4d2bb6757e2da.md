- Other Stenotrophomonas species typically do not cause infections in humans.

- Other gram-negative non-fermenters like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, and Burkholderia cepacia-complex, can be misidentified as, co-exist with, or be responsible for similar infections to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.

- Other more common organisms should be considered first with each infection according to the clinical picture.
