Early diagnosis made by geneticists and neonatologists can prevent irreversible damage and complications in the child. In addition, biochemical metabolite studies can confirm the diagnosis of biotinidase deficiency, and these measures are conducted on the newborn screen within the United States. A coordinated effort by an interprofessional team consisting of clinicians, specialists, nursing staff, and pharmacists is the optimal approach to this condition.

With the guidance of a medical geneticist, treatment should be implemented immediately and communicated to the primary care provider or a pediatrician so that they are aware of the disorder and treatment plan. Radiologists may detect early brain changes in the child to help guide diagnosis when missed and differentiate it from similar brain and spinal cord diseases. When neurologic damage occurs, physiotherapists can provide therapies to help treat hypotonia and developmental disability.

Given the significant complications that can occur and the significantly improved outcomes with effective treatment, it is vital to understand that departments can work as an interprofessional team toÂ optimize the clinical outcome and quality of life of an affected child.
