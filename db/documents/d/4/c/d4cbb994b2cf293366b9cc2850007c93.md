The human cornea is often referred to as one of the most potent pain generators in the human body.

Corneal nerves detect mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. Input is perceivable as pain or a range of dysesthesias (unpleasant abnormal sensations)

- Photoallodynia (pain sensation in response to a non-painful stimulus, light)

- Burning

- Irritation

- Dryness

- Grittiness

Pain protects tissue from injury. Detection of painful stimuli by nociceptors transmits via action potentials to higher order centers where the pain is perceived.
