The unwillingness of the patient or family to provide consent is always an absolute contraindication of any elective procedure. Other contraindications include hemodynamic instability, sepsis, serious coagulation disorder that cannot be corrected, severe ascites, peritonitis, abdominal wall infection near the site of planned insertion, and peritoneal carcinomatosis.

If a patient has a gastric outlet obstruction, severe gastroparesis, or history of altered anatomy such as a previous roux-en-y or gastrectomy, the surgeon should consider postpyloric enteral access as gastrostomy would be contraindicated.
