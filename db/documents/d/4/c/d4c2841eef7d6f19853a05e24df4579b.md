The diagnosis and management of HFCS are not easy and require an interprofessional team that ideally includes a gynecologist, radiologist, emergency department physician, specialty nurse, infectious disease expert, and laboratory professionals. Treatment of HFCS coincides with the management of PID. The goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms, eradicate the infection, and minimize risks of long-term sequelae (infertility or ectopic pregnancy). As the diagnosis of PID may be challenging and the potential for serious complications is great, the CDC advises that physicians maintain a low threshold for aggressive treatment. Antibiotics are successful in up to 75% of cases, and most patients with PID can be managed as outpatients. Antibiotic therapy should be geared at covering the most common organisms, C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhea, as well as gram-negative organisms, anaerobes, and streptococci.

The primary care provider and nurse practitioner need to treat the partner and educate the patient on safe sex practices. It is important to follow these patients until all symptoms have subsided and the cultures are negative.
