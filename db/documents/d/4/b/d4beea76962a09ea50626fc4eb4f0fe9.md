Poor diabetic foot care increases the risk of ulceration, infection, and limb loss. Armstrong D.G. and Harkless L.B. found that noncompliant patients, defined as missing greater than 50% of scheduled appointments in 1 year, are 54 times more likely to develop pedal ulcerations and 20 times more likely to have amputations compared to compliant patients.
