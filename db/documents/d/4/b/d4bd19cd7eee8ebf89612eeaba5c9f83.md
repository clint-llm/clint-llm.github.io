The etiology behind atrial flutter is the presence of a re-entry mechanism for initiation of the tachycardia.

To have this electrical circuit, one must have the following elements

1. Areas with fast and slow velocities of conduction

2. Different refractory periods

3. A functional core where the circuit exists

These elements are present in a typical atrial flutter in the CTI. The initiation of atrial flutter is due to an ectopic beat that depolarizes one segment of the pathway of the circuits that become refractory and starts the tachycardia from a no-refractory segment.
