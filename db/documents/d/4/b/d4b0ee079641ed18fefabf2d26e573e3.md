Glioma is the most common form of central nervous system (CNS) neoplasm that originates from glial cells. In the United States, there are six cases of gliomas diagnosed per 100,000 people every year. Gliomas are very diffusely infiltrative tumors that affect the surrounding brain tissue. Glioblastoma is the most malignant type while pilocytic astrocytomas are the least malignant brain tumors. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of gliomas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the different types of gliomas.
- Review the pathophysiology of gliomas.
- Summarize the treatment of gliomas.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by gliomas.
