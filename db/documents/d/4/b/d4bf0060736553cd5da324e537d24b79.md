The pitfalls related to the diagnosis of TFCC injury largely relate to MRI misread. Some examples of common mistakes when reading MRI include:

- The prestyloid recess is a normal structure in the wrist near the ulnar styloid filled with fluid and can frequently be mistaken as an indication of injury or mass.

- Cartilaginous tissue at the ulnar styloid can have a signal intensity that can be misread as a partial tear.

- The ligamentum subcruentum is a normal structure at the ulnar insertion of the triangular fibrocartilage disc that often has high signal intensity.

- Similarly, the radial attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage disc is a normal structure that appears with high signal intensity on MRI. Neither of these should be confused as an injury.

- Another complication regarding reading MRI includes if there is wrist rotation during the timing of the imaging. If this is the case, the central disk can appear thin in the coronal plane. As long as there is no significant signal in addition to the thin-appearing disk, this is non-pathologic.

- An intermediate signal in the central disk may represent intrinsic degeneration instead of a tear. Chondrocalcinosis can also appear similar to Palmer Class 2 lesions. If this is suspected, CT imaging prior to making the diagnosis of TFCC tear is in order.
