Migraine treatment involves abortive and prophylactic therapy. Abortive treatment is to stop a headache that has already started from progressing further. Prophylactic therapy aims to reduce the frequency or severity of headaches, thereby improving patients' quality of life.

**Abortive Therapy**

- Acute treatment aims to stop the progression of a headache. It has to be treated quickly and with a large single dose. Oral agents can be ineffective in patients with migraine-induced gastric stasis. Therefore, parenteral medication could be the rule for some patients, especially those with nausea or vomiting.
- **NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs):**ibuprofen (400 to 600 mg), naproxen (275 to 825 mg), diclofenac (65 mg), aspirin (900 to 1000 mg), or acetaminophen (1000 mg).
- **Triptans (the first line in patients with allodynia):**sumatriptan (administered as a subcutaneous injection of 6 mg, a nasal spray of 20 to 40 mg over 24 hours, a nasal powder of 10 to 30 mg over 24 hours, or orally 50 to 100 mg once), zolmitriptan 10 mg per 24 hours (nasal 2.5 to 5 mg as a single dose and oral 2.5 mg as a single dose), eletriptan, rizatriptan, almotriptan. With or without naproxen for moderate to severe attacks. Unlike NSAIDs, patients who do not respond well to one triptan may respond to another; therefore, therapy may be individualized.
- To avoid medication overuse, triptans should be limited to less than ten days of use within a month.
- Because of the activation of the 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors on coronary arteries and cerebral vessels, there are recommendations against its use in patients with ischemic stroke, ischemic heart disease, poor-controlled hypertension, angina, pregnancy, hemiplegic or basilar migraine. In these patients with cardiovascular risks, the best-suited medication is a selective serotonin 1F receptor agonist that does not produce vasoconstriction; lasmiditan.
- It is recommended to monitor therapy if the patient takes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or selective serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors because of the risk of serotonin syndrome.
- The combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) with triptan appears more effective than using either drug class alone. Sumatriptan succinate 85 mg and naproxen sodium 500 mg in a single tablet may be prescribed as initial therapy.
- The use of triptans should be limited to no more than ten days of use per month to avoid medication overuse headaches.


- **Antiemetics:**metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, prochlorperazine. They are generally used as adjunctive therapy with NSAIDs or triptans to decrease nausea and vomiting, especially in the emergency department. Diphenhydramine can also be added to prevent dystonic reactions (mostly with metoclopramide).
- **Calcitonin-gene-related peptide antagonists:**These include rimegepant (75 mg as a single dose) and ubrogepant. It could be considered in patients who don't respond to conventional treatment or those with coronary artery disease.
- **Selective serotonin 1F receptor agonist:**US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved lasmiditan oral tablets in October 2019 for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. The initial dose of lasmiditan is 50 or 100 mg, particularly effective for patients who cannot use triptans due to cardiovascular risks. The dose may be increased to 100 or 200 mg per requirement, but no more than one dose should be taken over 24 hours. However, one significant side effect is dizziness. So patients should not engage in potentially hazardous activities or drive a motor vehicle for at least eight hours after each dose of lasmiditan. Some other adverse effects are nausea, fatigue, and paresthesia.
- **Ergots:**ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous, and intranasal use), recommended for acute attacks as a parenteral administration and effective as bridge therapy for medication overuse headache and status migrainosus. Ergotamine has not demonstrated particular effectiveness yet, and it can present significant side effects, including cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, and peripheral ischemic complications.
- **Dexamethasone**can reduce the recurrence of early headaches but does not provide immediate relief of headaches.
- **Transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation**can reduce intensity.
- **Transcranial magnetic stimulation**is proved effective as a second-line treatment, with no serious side effects. It can also be offered as an option to treat chronic migraines. It is contraindicated in patients with epilepsy.
- **Nonpainful remote electric neurostimulation**could be considered a first-line treatment in some patients.
- **Peripheral nerve blocking**(occipital plexus and sphenopalatine ganglion).

**Migraine Treatment in the Emergency Setting**

Patients presenting to an emergency room with severe migraine headaches associated with nausea and vomiting can be managed with:

-  Sumatriptan

-  Antiemetics/dopamine receptor blockers like metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, or chlorpromazine

-  Dihydroergotamine with metoclopramide

-  Ketorolac

It is recommended to add dexamethasone in patients treated with the above therapies to reduce the risk of early headache recurrence.

**Prophylactic Therapy**

- Prophylactic therapy is indicated in patients with frequent or long-lasting migraine headaches, headaches causing significant disability and affecting the quality of life, or when acute therapies are contraindicated.

- The drugs for prophylactic therapy are usually started at a low dose and gradually titrated up until the patient gets the therapeutic benefit.

- Some of the agents used in prophylactic therapy are:
- Beta-blockers like metoprolol or propranolol
- Antidepressants like amitriptyline or venlafaxine
- Anticonvulsants like valproate or topiramate
- Calcium channel blockers like verapamil or flunarizine

Certain noninvasive neuromodulatory approaches, such as supraorbital or vagal nerve stimulation, are emerging as a part of prophylactic methods for migraines.

**Lifestyle Measures**

Lifestyle measures to control migraine headaches include routine meal schedules, regular exercise, good sleep hygiene, and managing migraine triggers.
