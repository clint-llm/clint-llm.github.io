There are numerous causes of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, including transient tachypnea of the newborn, pulmonary air leak disorders (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum), neonatal pneumonia, meconium aspiration, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, and the broad categories of cyanotic congenital heart disease and interstitial lung disease.

- Infants with transient tachypnea of the newborn have impaired resorption of the fetal lung fluid and have marked tachypnea soon after birth, but symptoms generally improve after 24 hours. Chest radiograph shows perihilar streaking, representing perihilar interstitial edema, without the diffuse reticulo-granular ground glass appearance of RDS.

- Pulmonary air leak syndromes such as pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum may also present as respiratory distress, but the onset of symptoms may be more acute. Other clinical clues include chest rise asymmetry, and diminished breath sounds on one side of the chest. Hyperlucent areas on chest radiography can be appreciated if the air leak is significant. Pulmonary interstitial emphysema affects infants who are mechanically ventilated; symptoms of respiratory distress often occur later than expected with RDS, and the trapped air within the perivascular tissues has a characteristic appearance of cystic lucencies on chest radiography.

- Bacterial pneumonia, especially related to Group B Streptococcus in a newborn is often clinically and radiographically indistinguishable from RDS. The preferred treatment includes empirical antibiotics in addition to respiratory management.

- Infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease may have similar symptoms clinically, but will not have the diffuse reticulo-granular ground glass appearance on chest radiography. The radiological findings depend on the underlying anatomic abnormality.
