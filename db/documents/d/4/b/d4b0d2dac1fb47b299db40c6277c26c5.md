The development of the gastrointestinal system results from a series of highly regulated biochemical processes and folding patterns. Gut and, more specifically, esophageal development are most easily understood, starting at week four. At this stage, the early embryo consists of three distinct layers, in what is known as a trilaminar disc, connected to the yolk sac. The trilaminar disc comprises the outer ectoderm, middle mesoderm, and an inner layer known as the endoderm.

Initially, this inner tube is blind-ended at both poles and is the precursor to the final digestive tract.

After esophageal specification occurs, several notable changes are visible in the developing embryo. At approximately week 6 of development, the circular and longitudinal muscular layers begin to form, and ganglion cells of the myenteric plexus first present. Moving into week 7, cells of mesodermal origin proliferate into the submucosal layer forming the eventual blood supply to the esophagus. The muscular layers, which began in week 6, are completed by the 9th week.

Co-innervation of muscle cells is hypothesized to allow for early peristalsis after birth, while the nervous system is not fully mature. The process of esophageal innervation occurs throughout the development of the embryo and requires proliferation and migration of neural crest cells that migrate rostrally-caudally through the gut tube starting during the 4th week and ending their migration around the 9th week of development.
