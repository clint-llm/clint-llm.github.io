The detailed structure of the RER can't be effectively studied through light microscopy. However, there is an abundance of membrane-bound ribosomes within the RER, making those specific areas extremely basophilic and visible. Visibility of the RER increases in cells that are highly secretory such as Nissl substance in neurons and exocrine pancreatic acinar cells.
