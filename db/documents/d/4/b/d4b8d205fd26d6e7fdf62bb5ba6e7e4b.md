Mandible dislocation can occur anterior, posterior, superior, or lateral to the articular eminence. Dislocations can also be classified as acute, chronic, or recurrent.

Anterior dislocations are the most common type of dislocation. The condyle of the mandible is displaced anterior to the temporal bone articular eminence; this can occur by elevation of the mandible by the temporalis and masseter muscles before relaxation occurs by the lateral pterygoid. Anterior temporal mandibular joint (TMJ) dislocations often result following atraumatic causes that result in over-opening of the mandible or interruption of normal mouth opening. Anterior dislocation may increase the risk of recurrent dislocation.

A posterior dislocation often occurs as a result of a direct blow to the jaw, pushing the mandibular condyle posterior in the direction of the mastoid. Patients can have an injury to the external auditory canal from this type of injury, including temporary or permanent canal narrowing.

Lateral dislocations often present in the setting of a mandibular fracture.

Superior dislocation or central dislocation results from a direct blow to a partially open mouth causing upward migration of the condyle of the mandible. This mechanism can cause fracture of the glenoid fossa and dislocation of the mandibular condyle into the middle skull base, particularly in extremely high-velocity traumas such as motor vehicle accidents, but can be seen in assaults with blunt weapons also. Other injuries can occur, including injuries to the facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve), vestibulocochlear nerve (eighth cranial nerve), intracranial hematoma, leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and cerebral contusion. Superior dislocation has correlations with deafness, facial nerve palsy, meningitis, and cerebral contusion.

Acute dislocation is usually an isolated event and often occurs due to facial trauma, or over-opening of the mouth. Examples include yawning, laughing, singing, vomiting or seizures, or iatrogenic causes such as intubation, endoscopic procedures, or dental procedures. This can often be treated with closed reduction, though may require anesthesia or muscle relaxants.

Generally, chronic dislocation is dislocation lasting longer than 72 hours, but no definitive consensus exists. This type of injury occurs resulting from untreated mandible dislocation and typically requires open reduction.

Recurrent dislocations are repeated, acute, or chronic dislocation, which typically occurs due to hypermobility of the joint secondary to hypermobility syndromes, shallow mandibular fossa, or joint capsule laxity.

Common findings when assessing the patient's history and physical exam include symptoms such as inability to close the mouth, drooling, difficulty with speech and chewing, severe preauricular pain, and signs including garbled speech, palpable preauricular depression.
