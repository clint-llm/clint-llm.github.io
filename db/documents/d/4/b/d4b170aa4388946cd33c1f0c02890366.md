Treatment of altered mental status is targeted at the underlying cause, including symptomatic management, like intubation or external pacing for abnormal respiration or cardiac output, antibiotics and volume resuscitation for sepsis or septic shock, glucose for hypoglycemia, or neurosurgical intervention for intracranial hemorrhage.

In the delirious patient, consider environmental manipulation, such as lightning, psychosocial support, minimization of unnecessary noise, and mobilization to prevent worsening of sundowning behavior. If acute sedation is needed, consider haloperidol (5 mg to 10 mg by mouth, intramuscularly, or intravenously, but consider reduced dosing in the elderly). Most sources recommend against the chronic use of benzodiazepines in the elderly, as it can often worsen sundowning behavior due to the amnesiac and disinhibitory effects, but in the acute setting, treatment with benzodiazepines (typically lorazepam 1 mg to 2 mg by mouth, intramuscularly, or intravenously) can be useful.

For chronic maintenance of a patient with dementia with elements of sundowning, consider donepezil (5 mg/day) or atypical antipsychotics (mostly commonly risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine)
