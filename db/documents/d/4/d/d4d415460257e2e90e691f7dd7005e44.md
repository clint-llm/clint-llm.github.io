Blood transfusion begins with collecting whole blood from a donor using a preservative-anticoagulant combination (typically citrate phosphate dextrose or citrate phosphate dextrose adenine-1). The blood is then tested for transfusion-transmitted diseases, separated it into its specific components, and then transfused as clinically indicated. This process is known to have both risks and benefits to the patient, and the decision to transfuse must be based on many variables so that the benefits outweigh the risk.

Subsequently, the process of patient blood management (PBM) was developed to incorporate an evidence-based, interprofessional approach to blood product administration. This process considers the patient's entire (projected) course and aids the clinician in determining if transfusion is indicated versus the use of alternative care pathways to ensure the best possible outcome for the patient.
