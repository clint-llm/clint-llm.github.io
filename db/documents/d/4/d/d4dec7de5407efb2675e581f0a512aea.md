Classical conditioning concepts are integrated into the design of health-related interventions (i.e. modeling, reinforcement, expectancies, and cues to action). Cohesiveness and consistency of the patient/ interprofessional team implementing these types of interventions are important factors for success. The interprofessional healthcare team consists of diagnosticians, medication experts, prescribers, and other members who tend to the everyday needs of the patient. Cohesiveness and communication becomeÂ especially important for the extinguishing of addictive behaviors such as drug use, smoking, or drinking alcohol. Since relapse is always a possibility, proper protocols should be in place to help re-extinguish the behavior if necessary. However, these protocols mainly depend on the patient's honesty and willingness to seek out help. Additionally, the interprofessional team can increase conditioning success by involving the patient's friends and family. They not only provide emotional support for the patient but can also provide updates to the interprofessional team when needed.
