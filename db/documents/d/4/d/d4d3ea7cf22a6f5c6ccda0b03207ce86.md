The personnel involved in the proper evaluation and ongoing treatment of patients receiving a fluoroscopic-guided nasogastric tube includes a collaborative team of healthcare professionals. Speech and language therapists assist in the initial assessment of the patient. They evaluate the physical and mental capacity of the individual and determine the necessity and safety of the procedure. They will continue to monitor each patient's progress and determine when or if an enteric tube is no longer needed. Insertion of the tube with fluoroscopy is performed by a radiologist, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner.

Additional members in the healthcare team include hospitalists, subspecialists, pharmacists, nurses, technicians, community health workers, and emotional, social, and spiritual support providers.
