# Introduction

The Edinger-Westphal (EW) nucleus, which is part of the oculomotor nuclear complex (ONC), was first described in the literature in the 17th century.****– and, in fact, it subdivides into the EW preganglionic (EWpg) population and the EW nucleus centrally projecting (EWcp) population. However, the accepted nomenclature for these two groups varies.

The EWpg is what is thought of as the classic ONC—sending parasympathetic nerve fibers toward the eye. It is located in the midbrain immediately dorsal to the oculomotor nucleus near the level of the superior colliculus, which is why it is often included in the overarching term oculomotor complex.

# Structure and Function

The EWpg nucleus houses choline acetyltransferase-positive cell bodies responsible for the parasympathetic innervation of the eye.

In response to the signal from the EWpg, the postganglionic ciliary bodies relay the signal along their axons by way of the ciliary nerves towards the eye. This relay leads to the innervation of the sphincter pupillae (causing miosis) and ciliary muscles (ocular accommodation). The constriction of the pupil moderates the amount of light the retina is exposed to, which is the efferent limb of the pupillary light reflex. Additionally, the contraction of the ciliary muscles leads to the relaxation of the zonular fibers, allowing for increased convexity of the lens and, subsequently, an increase in refractive power and accommodation.

Since the discovery of the two cell populations of the EW nucleus, the function of the EWcp has been a subject of ongoing research. The EWcp is located medial and dorsal to the OCN in the midbrain and is comprised of a collection of peptidergic neuron cell bodies.

# Embryology

Nucleogenesis in the brain during embryologic development is a subject of ongoing research. The thought is that brain nuclei develop as part of neuromeres and arcs (distinct columns of cells in the brain with high levels of acetylcholinesterase).

# Blood Supply and Lymphatics

While there is not a single blood supply to the EW nucleus, it receives its blood supply via vessels that feed the midbrain and brainstem. These blood vessels are part of the vertebrobasilar circulation and include the basilar artery, superior cerebellar artery, and posterior cerebral artery

The second segment (P2) is characterized by an anterior and posterior part (P2A and P2P). The P2A begins at the end of the P1 and extends to the most lateral aspect of the cerebral peduncle. The P2P then continues onwards to the posterior edge of the lateral midbrain. The P3 part of the artery extends until the origin of the parieto-occipital sulcus, and the P4 parts are the branches that occupy this sulcus and the calcarine sulcus.

The lymphatic drainage of the brain consists of the perivascular pathway (basement-membrane drainage system), glymphatic pathway, cerebrospinal fluid drainage via meningeal lymphatic vessels, and cervical lymph drainage routes.

# Nerves

The EWpg nucleus projects parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, which synapse on the postganglionic ciliary bodies.

While the oculomotor nucleus is a separate complex, the preganglionic projections to and postganglionic projections from the ciliary ganglion do course along CN III.

# Muscles

As discussed above, the short ciliary nerves innervate the sphincter pupillae (miosis) and the ciliary muscles (lens accommodation secondary to zonular fiber relaxation).

# Physiologic Variants

Much of the information we know today about the EW nucleus was originally studied in monkeys, mice, and birds. For instance, cellular morphology in pigeons differs from mice and human morphology, which have similar patterns of distribution of urocortin-1 positive neurons of the EWcp.

# Surgical Considerations

Brainstem and midbrain surgery are technically highly challenging procedures, and careful avoidance of damage to the numerous critical structure in this region is paramount to ensure as patients have as good as the possible quality of life following surgery.

In adults, gliomas (malignant primary central nervous system tumors) are rare, constituting only 2% of brain malignancy in this population. The mean age of onset is in the sixth decade, and surgical treatment is often challenging and without the possibility of achieving total resection of the tumor. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy are often employed, which has improved survival rates, but the overall median survival is still poor at 13.5 months.

# Clinical Significance

**Alzheimer Disease**

One clinical implication of the EW nucleus is its association with Alzheimer disease. Being that there are more than 5.4 million Americans estimated to be affected by Alzheimer disease and that this neurodegenerative disease is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, this relationship could prove to be an important finding in the understanding of the disease.

**Weber Syndrome**

Weber syndrome is a rare brainstem infarct syndrome characterized by occlusion of one of the paramedian branches of the basilar artery or posterior cerebral artery. The resulting infarction affects the oculomotor nucleus and the cerebral peduncle.

**Benedikt Syndrome**

Benedikt syndrome (otherwise known as paramedian midbrain syndrome) is the name given to the rare clinical syndrome resulting from the infarction of branches from the posterior cerebral artery that supplies oculomotor nerve fascicles and the red nucleus.**.**

Other clinical considerations would include the presence of structural lesions that could lead to the compression of the nucleus. These lesions include tumors, aneurysms, and impaired CSF outflow leading to cerebral aqueduct enlargement.

# Other Issues

Many of the issues regarding the understanding of the EW nucleus involve the discovery of the EWcp, which changed the classic definition of the EW nucleus, as it was solely associated with parasympathetic control of the eye for decades. With time and more research, the terminology of the EWpg and EWcp will gain recognition and acceptance throughout the scientific community.
