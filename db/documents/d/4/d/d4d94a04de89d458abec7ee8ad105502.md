Currently, most rickettsial infections are diagnosed based on serologic response, such as IgG and IgM to R. rickettsiae, in conjunction with a high degree of clinical suspicion. While rickettsia can be cultured in a microbiology laboratory, this approach is not often used for clinical diagnosis because the technique is difficult and requires a high level of biosafety containment due to the risk of exposure. Other diagnostic options include molecular tests, such as PCR, in some centers and skin biopsy.
