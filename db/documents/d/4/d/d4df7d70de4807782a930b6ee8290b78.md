As per NHANES, 20% of 12 to 19-year-olds have lipid disorders. In children with obesity, mixed dyslipidemia occurs in up to 42%.

- Decreased HDL (less than or equal to 40 gm/dl) - 12.1%

- Elevated TG (greater than or equal to 130 mg/dl) - 10.2%

- Elevated TC (greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl) - 7.1%

- Elevated LDL-C (greater than or equal to 130 MG/DL )- 6.4%

- Elevated non HDL-C (greater than or equal to 145 mg/dl) - 6.4%

Multiple factors can contribute to dyslipidemia, including diet, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, genetic predisposition, medications, and coexisting medical conditions. As per NHANES data, increased BMI was associated with an increase in the prevalence of dyslipidemia. The prevalence of dyslipidemia was 14% in the normal weight category, 22% in the overweight category (BMI above 85%), and 43% in children with obesity (BMI above 95%).
