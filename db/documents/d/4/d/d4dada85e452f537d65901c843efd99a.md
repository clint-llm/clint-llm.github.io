Pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (PBK) is characterized by the development of irreversible corneal edema after cataract surgery. The initial insult occurs at the corneal endothelium, following which there is progressive stromal edema. This edema can progress to the subepithelial and epithelial layers and results in bullae formation, hence the name bullous keratopathy.

PBK has also been reported after excessive and improper use of ultrasound energy during phacoemulsification, complicated cataract surgery, anterior vitrectomy close to the endothelium, nucleus rub to the endothelium while nucleus delivery in manual small incision cataract surgery, Fuchâ€™s endothelial dystrophy, and other endothelial dystrophy cases.
