For performing CXL, a combined effort of a team of Ophthalmic surgeons, an assistant OT nurse, mid-level ophthalmic personnel (MLOP), and a dedicated counselor is needed. The surgeon performs the surgery, the assistant nurse helps in patient preparation and provides instruments for the surgery, the MLOP helps in patient movement, and the counselor helps in guiding the patient pre-operative and postoperatively.
