Most meningiomas are benign and asymptomatic. Hence, many of them require close observation along with serial radiological imaging. However, complicated or symptomatic meningiomas should require immediate intervention. Accordingly, to enhance patients’ outcomes, multidisciplinary healthcare management from different specialties other than neurosurgery may be required, depending on the type and the complexity of the tumor.

Usually, multidisciplinary management is involved in complex meningiomas. The neurosurgery team often manages benign symptomatic and asymptomatic meningiomas. Atypical and malignant meningiomas necessitate comprehensive healthcare management from different specialties. With multidisciplinary management, medical treatments can be provided according to the patient’s needs and demands. Consequently, it is essential to address the medical problems that can occur in those patients to improve their prognosis. Meningiomas involving the paranasal sinuses or the temporal bone may require an otorhinolaryngologist or a craniomaxillofacial surgeon.
