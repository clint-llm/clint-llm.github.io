Henoch-Schönlein purpura is typically a self-limited illness that demonstrates an excellent prognosis in patients without renal involvement. The majority of patients fully recover in four weeks.

The long-term morbidity of Henoch-Schönlein purpura is dependent on the extent of renal involvement. Approximately 1% of patients with Henoch-Schönlein purpura will develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and require renal transplantation.
