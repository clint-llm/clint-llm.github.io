The epidermal layer of skin contains much of our normal flora and the microbiome of the epidermis varies based on the body region. The microorganisms that inhabit our skin surface is nonpathogenic and can be commensal or mutualistic in nature. The bacteria that tend to predominate are staphylococci epidermidis, aureus, cutibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, candida and clostridium perfringens. When the protective skin barrier is altered, an infection can occur.
