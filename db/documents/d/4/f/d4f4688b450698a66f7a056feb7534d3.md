An interprofessional team approach is strongly advocated in managing children with this condition, particularly for larger lesions. Pediatricians and family medicine clinicians should be able to diagnose CMNs and refer the patient to dermatology. Regular assessments involve dermatology examinations, with input from plastic surgery as required. Monitoring for progression with serial photographs and for malignant progression with input from pathologists for tissue diagnosis as required is also important.

Pediatric psychologists and psychiatrists also play an integral role in managing the psychosocial burden.
