The main causative agent of typhoid fever is Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi, both are members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. Salmonella is a genusSalmonella
enterica
serovar and enteritidis classified through extensive analysis by multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi (A, B, C) are Salmonella
enterica serotypes. Nontyphoidal salmonella (NTS) is more typical in children and is mostly limited to gastroenteritis.

Salmonella is transmitted by the fecal-oral route through contaminated water, undercooked foods, fomites of infected patients, and is more common in areas with overcrowding, social chaos, and poor sanitation. It is only transmitted from an infected person to another person, as humans are its only host. Major sources of salmonella are poultry, eggs, and rarely turtles. In one study done on the distribution of salmonella isolates by whole-genome sequencing in chicken slaughterhouses in China, 57% of samples were positive.

Normal flora of the gut is protective against the infection. The use of antibiotics such as streptomycin destroys the normal flora, which heightens its invasion. Malnutrition decreases normal gut flora and thus increases the susceptibility to this infection as well.
