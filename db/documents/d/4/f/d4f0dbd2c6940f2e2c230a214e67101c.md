An overdose of esmolol can result in a myriad of symptoms and effects. Cardiac signs of toxicity include but are not limited to bradycardia, AV block of any degree, complete AV dissociation, decrease contractility, cardiogenic shock, asystole, and pulseless electrical activity.

Since Esmolol has a very short half-life (9 minutes), toxicity should be treated by discontinuing the esmolol infusion. Acute toxicity is often self-limited and is treated supportively. Toxicity that results in bradycardia should be treated by atropine, pacing, and other anticholinergic agents. Cardiogenic shock can be treated with inotropic agents like dobutamine, dopamine, and isoproterenol. Bronchospasms, even though rare, should be treated with a beta-2 agonist, such as albuterol.

The Advanced Cardiac Life Support protocols should treat pulseless electrical activity and cardiac arrest. As with other beta-blocker overdoses, calcium chloride can be given to mitigate the effects of esmolol while it is being metabolized. High-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are associated with a reduction in mortality.
