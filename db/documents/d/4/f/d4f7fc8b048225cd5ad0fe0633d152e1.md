The normal function of the amyloid beta peptide is not known. Mechanisms exist in the human brain to degrade the amyloid beta peptide. Despite this, a faction of this may remain in the brain, which is transported out of the human brain across the blood-brain barrier. An imbalance in these pathways appears to lead to the accumulation of the peptide. Recent research suggests that amyloid beta oligomers are more important in the pathogenesis than the plaques. These oligomers are thought to induce synaptic dysfunction, disrupt neural connectivity, and neuronal death.
