The diagnosis of SON can be challenging due to limited knowledge of the disease amongst clinicians. Often knee pain is explained and dismissed as referred pain from known ipsilateral hip disease. If it is investigated, the pathology of an intra-articular nature is scrutinized first. Furthermore, as there is often concurrent hip disease in patients with SON, knee pain should be a red flag triggering further investigation rather than a reason to dismiss the presentation as a symptom of pre-existing hip disease. Secondary osteonecrosis can be easily confused with several other differential diagnoses:

- Postraumatic osteonecrosis

- Osteochondritis dissecans

- SPONK

- Infection

- Fracture

- Meniscal injury

As discussed in this article, the differences between the three types of osteonecrosis can be clearly defined, with few overlapping features, and therefore there is now no excuse to confuse these clinical entities.
