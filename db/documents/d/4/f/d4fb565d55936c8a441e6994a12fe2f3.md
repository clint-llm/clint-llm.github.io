Procaine belongs to a class of analgesic medications known as local anesthetics. All local anesthetics consist of three constituents: a lipophilic aromatic ring, a terminal amine, and an intermediate ester or amide group. The aromatic ring serves to improve the anesthetic's lipid solubility and promote diffusion through epineural and neural membranes, thus correlating to the anesthetic's potency.

- Lipid solubility: Potency

- Dissociation constant: Onset

- Intermediate linkage: Metabolism

- Plasma-protein binding affinity: Duration

The fundamental mechanism of analgesia underlying all local anesthetics is the blockade of neurotransmission via inhibition of sodium channels along nerve fibers. The progression of anesthesia, referred to as differential blockage, is predicated on nerve caliber and myelination and generally blocks nerve fibers in the following order from first to last

- Type B fibers (sympathetic tone)

- Type C (dull pain, warm temperature)

- Type A-delta (sharp pain, cold temperature)

- Type A-gamma (proprioception)

- Type A-beta (touch, pressure)

- Type A-alpha (motor)

After epineural and neural diffusion, procaine reversibly and preferentially binds to active sites on the cytoplasmic aspect of neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels. This binding occurs preferentially during activated states and causes selective inhibition of the open configuration of the sodium channel, thereby preventing sodium influx. The interruption of this influx prevents depolarization needed to initiate and propagate action potentials along the nerve fiber resulting in suppression of neurotransmission of nerve fibers mentioned above, with type C and A-delta fiber suppression mediating the primarily desired analgesic effects of procaine.
