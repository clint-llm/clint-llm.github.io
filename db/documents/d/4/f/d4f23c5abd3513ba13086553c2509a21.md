A large number of commercially available products utilize different technologies such as sandwiched enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunonephelometry, chemiluminometric immunoassay (CLIA), immunomagnetic reduction (IMR), etc. CEA levels can fluctuate based on the type of testing procedure utilized. Therefore,Â discordant serial CEA levels need to be carefully correlated with differences in testing procedures. Using monoclonal antibodies directed against the six reactive isotopes of CEA in specific assays could result in erroneous findings amongst those patients who have been previously treated with monoclonal antibodies.
