Patients typically present in the first or second decade of life with intermittent bouts of weakness or paralysis in the hips, shoulders, and back triggered by diet, stress, or exercise. Attacks are generally intermittent and last 15 minutes to 1 hour. Affected individuals may also present with paratonia (muscle stiffness or inability to relax muscles). Approximately 50% of affected individuals will present with weakness or paralysis before age 10. The attacks initially are uncommon; however, they increase in intensity and frequency until the fifth decade of life, at which point there is a steep decline. Common triggers are potassium-rich foods, a cold environment, and rest after physical activity. Attacks may last from 15 minutes to 1 hour. Individuals over 40 years of age commonly report permanent muscle weakness, with a third of individuals developing chronic progressive myopathy.
