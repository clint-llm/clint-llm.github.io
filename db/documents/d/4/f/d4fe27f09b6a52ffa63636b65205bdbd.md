A position statement from the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT) in 2005 lists the following as contraindications and relative contraindications for activated charcoal use:

- Patients with an unprotected airway (in other words,Â a depressed level of consciousness) without endotracheal intubation

- If activated charcoal use is likely to increase the risk and severity of aspiration of a toxin (hydrocarbons with high aspiration potentials)

- When the threat of GI perforation or hemorrhage is high secondary to medical conditions or recent surgery

- When endoscopy is likely to be attempted as activated charcoal may obscure endoscopic visualization

- In the presence of an intestinal obstruction

- When activated charcoal is known to not meaningfully adsorb the ingested toxin such as metals, acids, alkalis, electrolytes, or alcohols

MDAC is relatively contraindicated if decreased peristalsis is likely to occur from the substance ingested (opioids or anticholinergics). If these patients receive MDAC, they should be monitored closely for the development of obstruction or potential aspiration.
