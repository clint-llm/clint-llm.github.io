Dust mite allergy is an allergic condition that occurs as a reaction to the dust mite allergens that commonly live in household dust. It is also known as house dust allergy. It is sensitization and an allergic reaction to the droppings of the dust mites. The droppings are an indoor aeroallergen, which on inhalation triggers the allergic reaction. The prevalence of atopic diseases like allergic rhinitis and asthma with house dust mite being the allergen has been increasing. House dust allergy was first identified as an allergen around 1920. In 1967, Voorhorst et al. identified  Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus as the causative allergen for house dust allergy.Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus allergen I, or Der p 1 in 1980, followed by Der p 2, and homologous Dermatophagoides farinae 1 and 2.

The house dust mite (HDM or DM) is a predominant source of indoor aeroallergens. Some of the allergic diseases that have been associated with the HDM are allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, allergic asthma, and atopic eczema. The best treatment strategy for allergic rhinitis consists of allergen avoidance first, in junction with pharmacotherapy and allergen immunotherapy (AIT).
