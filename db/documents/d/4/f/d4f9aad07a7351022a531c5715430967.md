Digeorge syndrome is due to a small deletion on chromosome 22, resulting in poor development in several organ systems. One of the problems commonly present in someone with DiGeorge is thymus gland dysfunction. The thymus gland is where T cells mature and help fight infection; thus, thymus gland dysfunction will result in T-cell deficiency. T-cell deficiency will result in the paracortex of lymph nodes not being well developed.
