After the indium-labeled white blood cells are injected into the patient, the patient undergoes nuclear imaging.  The patient must be able to cooperate for roughly 60 minutes to obtain the imaging scans.

Depending on the clinical situation, imaging is obtained at varying time intervals after administering the tagged white blood cells. It is most common to obtain imaging 1 to 4 hours after administration or 16 to 30 hours after, depending on the clinical situation.
