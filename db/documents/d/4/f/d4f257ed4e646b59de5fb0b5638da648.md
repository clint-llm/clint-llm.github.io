# Continuing Education Activity

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic imaging technique useful for the detailed characterization of the soft tissues without ionizing radiation. MRI imaging is noninvasive, and in some cases, eliminates the need for surgical intervention or invasive procedures when used correctly. This activity outlines the appropriate clinical use of MRI to evaluate for common clinical questions (and is not all-encompassing) and briefly reviews contraindications that are important considerations for the interprofessional team contemplating this imaging modality.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the appropriate use of MRI imaging broadly organized by anatomy.
- Review the appropriate use of gadolinium-based contrast and risk factors for developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.
- Identify contraindications to MRI, specifically related to implanted hardware.

# Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic technique useful for noninvasive visualization of organs and soft tissue structures.

A major advantage of MRI is the ability to produce high-quality images with superior soft-tissue contrast without using ionizing radiation. The magnet generates images based on the specific and unique magnetic properties of the tissues driven by the spin properties of hydrogen molecules.

MRI does not exist without hazard – the magnetic field can be dangerous and strict parameters are in place to ensure patient safety. Pre- imaging screening protocols are in place to assess the patient’s risk factors ranging from occupational exposures to surgically implanted devices determined to be incompatible with the magnetic field. Though many of the newer generation implanted devices are MR compatible, it is crucial to consult with both the radiologist and MR technologists. The magnetic field can alter implanted devices and result in loss of function, positioning, and temperature changes. Additionally, while some prosthetic devices- like heart valves, stents, and artificial joints- are MR safe, they may cause signal artifacts that limit the diagnostic quality of the exam.

# Function

Traditionally MRI is an adjunct or complementary imaging exam following initial evaluation with more accessible and cost-effective modalities, like radiographs, ultrasound, or computed tomography (CT). The goal is to characterize a finding using the specific magnetic properties of the tissues and less commonly to guide biopsy.

**Neurological**: MRI is broadly useful to image the central nervous system. It serves as a beautiful addition to non-contrast CT to evaluate for acute and subacute infarcts, headache and seizure evaluation, as well as following a neoplastic process.

Considering the time-sensitive nature of stroke evaluation, a non-contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain is indicated for patients following a non-contrast CT of the head/brain to evaluate for ischemic stroke. Image sequences based on the diffusion coefficient of water in the brain parenchyma can demonstrate areas of hyperacute ischemia.

The gold standard of craniocervical vascular imaging to rule out obstruction, high-grade stenosis, or dissection is CT angiography. MR angiography could be considered in patients with diminished renal function. Time of flight (TOF) MR angiography is a multidimensional (2-D or 3-D) technique mapping the imaged vessels while subtracting the bony structures and brain parenchyma. TOF does not require contrast and instead uses flow-related enhancement properties during image acquisition.

When considering MRI to evaluate patients for headaches, seizures, demyelinating disease, and suspected mass, it is generally acceptable to request the use of an intravenous contrast agent. For example, post-contrast-enhancing lesions indicate active disease in a patient undergoing imaging evaluation for multiple sclerosis.

**Breast**: Breast MR is indicated in very select scenarios due to the use of a specialized breast coil, large field of view, and standardized sequences. It is important to inform the patient that the exam is performed in the prone position with the arms extended overhead. Dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI is an important tool to evaluate the extent of breast disease, therapy response, and surveillance of residual or recurrent disease.

**Chest/Cardiac**: MRI with IV contrast agents and customized fields of view are appropriate to evaluate chest wall abnormalities not definitively diagnosable with other modalities. MRI technologists are educated to mark the area of concern with an MRI visible Vitamin E capsule. While contrast-enhanced MR can define the extent of mediastinal soft tissue involvement, a review of the literature shows that the more costly MR was only superior to CT for preoperative planning of posterior mediastinal masses.

Cardiac MRI provides both structural and functional information. It requires the patient to tolerate upwards of 45 minutes of imaging and comply with breath-holding instructions. Non-contrast techniques are emerging, but current cardiac MR protocols typically include intravenous contrast agents; patterns of late gadolinium enhancement are critical to identifying scarred tissue.

**Abdomen/Pelvis**: Multiphase, post-contrast sequences are helpful to characterize abdominopelvic lesions and masses and follow responses to therapy. MR usually follows the more cost-effective and widely available initial imaging like ultrasound or CT, for example:

- Radiologists can confidently characterize a benign versus malignant liver lesion by MR enhancement patterns with liver and biliary specific contrast agents. Studies show that MRI with contrast is superior to ultrasound in diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-risk populations defined as higher rates of detection and decreased false positives.

- A small study of 81 female patients with sonographically indeterminate pelvic masses showed that even limited sequence MR could define uterine vs. extra-uterine origins of a mass, determining and guiding clinical management.

- MRI plays a critical role in diagnosing, staging, treatment, surgical planning, and surveillance of rectal cancer.

- The radiologist may make recommendations for follow up MRI in the appropriate clinical settings. A detailed history is critical when ordering these exams to ensure the acquisition of appropriate sequences. Of note, some institutions have established abdominal MR protocols to evaluate the appendix in pregnant women and small children if ultrasound is not diagnostic.

**Musculoskeletal**: Magnetic resonance imaging is useful to diagnose internal derangements of the support structures of the joints, occult fractures, bone marrow edema, infiltrative processes of the marrow space, and soft-tissue masses. Radiographs are first-line imaging of the musculoskeletal structures and are an important contribution to MRI interpretation. To highlight this point, consider that independent of radiographic findings, an MRI of the hip changed clinical management in as little as 7% of patients in a retrospective study performed at a single institution.

The aging population of the United States correlates with the increasing popularity and frequency of joint arthroplasties. The 2017 American Joint Replacement Registry reported more than 1 million total joint replacements annually, and that number is predicted to quadruple by 2030.

Traditionally gadolinium-based contrast is administered when evaluating for masses or bone lesions. The clinical benefits of MRI outweigh the cost when characterizing bone lesions or masses, supporting the role imaging plays in diagnosing neoplasms.

# Issues of Concern

Issues of concern pertaining to MRI revolve around the use of nonionizing radiation when imaging vulnerable patient populations, the use of contrast agents, and logistical concerns for the patients, some of which are addressed earlier in this article. When ordering an MRI, it is important to scrutinize the clinical question, patient’s clinical status, psychological factors, length of time required for the exam, and weigh the risks and benefits.

- There is abundant information published about gadolinium, paramagnetic contrast agents. A glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 is a contraindication to receiving gadolinium contrast. These patients are at increased risk of developing a systemic phenomenon called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis due to impaired clearance of contrast.

- The effect of MRI contrast on pregnancy is largely unknown and therefore avoided. Since gadolinium contrast is excreted quickly, nursing mothers can resume breastfeeding 36 to 48 hours after having an MRI. No deleterious effects have been documented from MRI during pregnancy, and for this reason, a medically-indicated MRI can be performed at any trimester. The risk of harming the pregnancy versus the benefit of the scan should be considered, and the MRI should wait until after pregnancy when appropriate.

- A common patient concern regarding the utilization of MRI imaging is claustrophobia and anxiety during the MRI exam. Anxiety attacks have been found to occur in as many as 2% of MRIs, with as many as 1% resulting in premature cessation of the study.

- Proximity to the magnetic field is a source of risk for the patient, and stepwise measures are in place to ensure that ferromagnetic materials do breach specific zones surrounding the magnet. All patients are screened before MR imaging is approved, but special attention should be paid to those with known exposure to shrapnel, bullets, or other metal fragments. Implanted medical devices are susceptible to the magnetic field with the potential for altered function, positioning of the hardware, and possible temperature changes. Many implanted devices, such as prosthetic heart valves, stents, and artificial joints, are safe for MRI but cause imaging artifacts.

# Clinical Significance

MRI in the clinical setting has improved patient care by offering a non-ionizing radiation alternative method of imaging. The value in not relying solely on standard X-ray based imaging techniques is best illustrated in cases requiring regular monitoring of disease progression, most notably multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. MRI also offers a lower-risk diagnostic evaluation for those who are at a high risk of long term radiation-related complications, such as children and pregnant women.

The alternative non-contrast techniques used in MRI are important for time-sensitive neurological imaging, for example, MR arteriography assists in the assessment of the craniocervical vasculature in suspected stroke patients with poor renal function or severe iodinated contrast allergies. In summary, the judicious use of MRI by ordering clinicians is critical for positive patient outcomes, timely diagnosis, and healthcare costs.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

As healthcare costs continue to soar, it is the responsibility of healthcare providers to order advanced imaging judiciously. Not all facilities have access to MRI, and, as mentioned, there are strong preliminary imaging modalities widely available that can guide care and treatment. The clinician can inquire if the clinical question was addressed on recent existing imaging. Conversation with your radiology colleagues can also answer if the exam being ordered is appropriate.

While MRI is our most technologically advanced modality, it is not appropriate in all situations. Medicare spends $10 billion annually on imaging, a good portion of which is repeat or unnecessary imaging.
