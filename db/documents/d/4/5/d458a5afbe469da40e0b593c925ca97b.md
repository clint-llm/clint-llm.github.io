The advent of second-generation drug-eluting stents has dramatically improved the outcome of PCI, with an ISR rate of approximatelyÂ 5 to 10%. Patients that follow exercise and diet cardiac rehabilitation programs are medically optimized and are compliant with appropriate dual antiplatelet therapy can help to minimize adverse events. The occurrence of clinical adverse events closely correlates with the final stent area, and maximizing the minimal stent area can help to mitigate adverse events.
