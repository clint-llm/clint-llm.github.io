In the acute setting, untreated upper airway obstruction causing respiratory distress can lead to respiratory failure, and ultimately cardiorespiratory arrest. Obstructive sleep apnea is the most common chronic cause of upper airway obstruction. In children, the possible consequences of untreated OSA include failure to thrive, behavioral problems such as hyperactivity, poor performance in school, and cardiovascular disease. In adults, untreated OSA can cause impaired daytime function, including somnolence, metabolic dysfunction, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
