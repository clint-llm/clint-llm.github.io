Described as a manifestation of severe RA; Felty syndrome usually occurs in patients with severe, long-standing, erosive, and seropositive arthritis. However, the diagnosis of Felty syndrome can precede arthritis symptoms in a few cases.

Patients usually present with an infection because Felty syndrome is otherwise asymptomatic.Â The most common type of infection is dermatological and respiratory. Many patients have other extra-articular manifestations. These have been reported as rheumatoid nodules (74%), hepatomegaly (68%), lymphadenopathy (42%), Sjogren syndrome (48%), pulmonary fibrosis (50%), pleuritis (22%), peripheral neuropathy (14%), leg ulcers (16%). Systemic symptoms, including fever and weight loss, may also be present.
