According to the current evidence, the most effective treatment for AAS is the discontinuation of AAS use, treatment of withdrawal symptoms, a combination of behavioral therapy, and symptomatic treatments. Treatment of AAS is based on the duration of use, the likelihood of withdrawal symptoms, treatment goals of the patient, and risk-benefit analysis of the treatments. Anawalt(2019) discusses four management strategies for AAS;1. Cessation with no medical therapy; 2. Cessation and initiation of clomiphene therapy; 3. Cessation and initiation of hCG therapy; 4. Conversion of nonprescription AASs to prescription testosterone

In AAS users with less than one year of use, testosterone levels normalize to baseline within 6 months of discontinuation
