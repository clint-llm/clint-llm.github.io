A herald patch is an erythematous, 2 to 10 centimeter, round to oval scaly patch or plaque with a depressed center and raised border that frequently presents days to weeks before an eruption of pityriasis rosea, a common, self-limiting papulosquamous disorder. This activity reviews the etiology and evaluation of pityriasis rosea and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with it.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of a herald patch.
- Explain the presentation of a patient with a herald patch.
- Identify the typical clinical course of a patient presenting with a herald patch. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the recognition of the herald patch and improve outcomes.
