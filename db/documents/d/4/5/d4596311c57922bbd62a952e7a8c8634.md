Polydactyly may present as an isolated trait or may occur in conjunction with other syndromes. Some patients may have a family history. Polydactyly may be associated with other diseases or syndromes such as Diamond-Blackfan anemia, Fanconi anemia, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, VACTERL (vertebral defects, anal atresia, cardiac defects, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal anomalies, and limb abnormalities), trisomy 13, and trisomy 21.

Advanced molecular techniques have identified multiple gene loci that are responsible for the development of polydactyly which includes GLI3 which is associated with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, the sonic hedgehog gene (SHH), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), homeobox protein aristaless-like 4 (ALX4), homeobox D (5’-HoxD), ZNF141, MIPOL1, IQCE, and PITX1.
