- Penicillin G and piperacillin are also associated with impaired hemostasis due to defective platelet aggregation.

- An IV injection of benzathine penicillin G has correlations with cardiorespiratory arrest and death.

- Cephalosporins carry associations with rare instances of bone marrow depression, including granulocytopenia.

- Some cephalosporins are potentially nephrotoxic and correlate with renal tubular necrosis. Ceftriaxone can cause jaundice in neonates by displacing bilirubin from albumin.

- It can also lead to biliary pseudolithiasis due to its high affinity for biliary calcium.

- Cefepime correlates with encephalopathy and nonconvulsive status epilepticus at high doses or in patients with renal dysfunction.

- Imipenem is associated with seizures when given in high doses to patients with CNS lesions or renal insufficiency.
