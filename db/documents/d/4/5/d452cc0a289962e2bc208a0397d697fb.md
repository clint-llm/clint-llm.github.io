The posterior auricular nerve is an extracranial branch of the facial nerve, cranial nerve VII, that supplies relatively small muscles of the head and neck.  It sometimes receives consideration during head and neck surgery as a potential source of iatrogenic injury, and it has been proposed to be a possible candidate for utilization as a nerve graft donor.
