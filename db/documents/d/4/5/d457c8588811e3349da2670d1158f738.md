Most common side effects reported by adults include insomnia, nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, dry mouth, headache, drowsiness, anxiety, nervousness, yawning, decreased libido, decreased arousal (seen as decreased lubrication in women and decreased erectile function in men), bruising, bleeding (rarely), hyperhidrosis, also keep in mind if this may be due to underlying mania/psychosis, seizures (rarely), induction of mania, rare activation of suicidal ideation and behavior (especially in teenagers), weight gain/loss, decreased orgasm (anorgasmia and ejaculation latency), muscle weakness, tremors, and pharyngitis.

The 5HT2C antagonism is thought to contribute to the anxiety, insomnia, and agitation patients perceive with fluoxetine. Patients may even have a panic attack with the administration of fluoxetine. Thus it is the clinician's responsibility to educate patients.

Most side effects are immediate and disappear with time. Thus, waiting for the side effects to subside is best before altering treatment. Most side effects are dose-dependent and time-dependent. It is important to exercise caution of the emergence of agitation or activation, which may indicate a bipolar state and require the addition of a mood stabilizer or an atypical antipsychotic. Fluoxetine can be activating; thus, if insomnia is present, consider dosing early in the morning. Additionally, one may reduce the dose if the side effects are too distressing for the patient. The patient should be cautioned about side effects; if they persist, switching to a different antidepressant may be indicated after a few weeks.

It is best to try another antidepressant before relying on augmentation strategies. This approach can minimize polypharmacy and encourage adherence to psychotropic medications. Trazodone, mirtazapine, or a hypnotic may be options for insomnia. Mirtazapine may also help with agitation or gastrointestinal side effects. Benzodiazepines may be used to treat anxiety. Bupropion or a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (i.e., sildenafil) may address sexual dysfunction. Bupropion may also be an option for potential cognitive slowing or apathy seen with fluoxetine.
