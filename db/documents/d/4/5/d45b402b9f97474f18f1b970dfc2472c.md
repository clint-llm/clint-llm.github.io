The prevalence of GHB use in the United States is not well known due to limited data. Mortality and morbidity data is also limited partly because GHB is easily mistaken for other drugs and not tested on routine drug screens. The available data reveals that the majority of GHB users are young adult white, middle-class males. User subgroups include recreational party drug users and homosexual males. Reports indicate that concurrent use of other drugs such as alcohol (76%), cocaine, marijuana, ketamine, MDMA (ecstasy) and methamphetamines is common in GHB-related emergency department visits.
