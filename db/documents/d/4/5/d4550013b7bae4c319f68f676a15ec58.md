Neurosyphilis is a complication of syphilis that can occur at any time post-exposure with syphilis. With the advent of penicillin, it had reached a nadir until the 2000s when it saw a resurgence, particularly in those with high-risk behavior including the MSM and HIV population. It can be asymptomatic or it may result in a range of diseases which include meningeal, meningovascular, general paresis, and tabes dorsalis. Confirmation is via history and CSF studies. Penicillin is the mainstay of treatment, and confirmatory CSF studies should be performed every six months until resolution. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is an expected response and treatment is supportive with acetaminophen.
