Due to a sudden hemodynamic decompensation, acute MR typically requires urgent surgical or percutaneous intervention.

or cardiogenic shock with a complex challenge of hemodynamic stabilization and eventual corrective intervention. An appropriate combination of inotropic and vasopressor agents and timely intervention of mechanical support devices such as intra-aortic balloon pumps or non-surgical heart pumps are essential cornerstones along with mechanical ventilation in critical conditions.

In cases of severe MR due to acute IE, both MV replacement as well as MV repair in properly preselected patients have shown similar clinical outcomes.

For primary chronic MR, surveillance and timely intervention are key factors for better outcomes. Early surgical intervention has shown better survival rates over conservative medical management in patients with a flail mitral leaflet.

Mitral valve repair remains the preferred method of surgical correction in degenerative MR with a high success rate and less chance of recurrence or a repeat intervention.

For functional MR, the role of surgery is still not very clear, as MR is just one part of the LV disease spectrum, and addressing MR without adequate attention to underlying myocardial disease has not provided therapeutic success.

For evaluation of patients being considered for MV replacement, several factors need to be considered for the choice of metallic versus bioprosthetic valves, such as age, MV anatomy, patients' preference, available surgical expertise, risk of bleeding on long term anticoagulation, access to healthcare, and monitoring of anticoagulation.

Several echocardiographic parameters have been described as predictors of recurrence of ischemic MR after MV repair.

While transcatheter repair has been established as a standard of treatment for severe MR, percutaneous replacement of mitral valve with a bioprosthetic valve for inoperable cases of MR is still under the process of rigorous research and trials with its inherent challenges.
