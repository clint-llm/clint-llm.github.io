Adolescents frequently experience recurrent subluxations. There is a higher amount of collagen type III (more elastic than type I collagen) in ligaments and tendons. With the increase in age, collagen-producing cells produce more collagen type I, which is less insoluble and more stable.

For the atraumatic cause, the cysteine contents, which are abundant in collagen type III, are higher in the shoulder joint capsule when compared with the normal population. In addition, the adaptation and remodeling of collagen in the joint capsules of unstable shoulders show higher stable and reducible collagen cross-links, collagen fibril diameters, and elastin content to provide strength for the shoulder capsule. The collagen study in the skin tissue shows smaller collagen fibril diameters correlate with increases in glenohumeral joint laxity.
