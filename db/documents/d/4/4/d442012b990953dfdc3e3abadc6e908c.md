**Governing Bodies**

While the original substances placed under each schedule were created by Congress, the legislation gave power to two federal agencies, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), to determine the substances added or removed from the classification schedules. The process to remove, add, or change the schedule of a controlled substance can be proposed by the DEA, the Department of HHS, or by petition from an interested party.

Once the DEA collects all relevant data, it requests a scientific and medical evaluation and recommendation, which is prepared by the FDA. Once the DEA receives this information, it evaluates all the data and makes a final proposal. The enforcement and regulation of the CSA also are under the purview of the DEA.

**Registration**

Through the CSA, Congress restricted those allowed to manufacture, import, export, distribute and dispense controlled substances by requiring registration. The US Attorney General provides this registration, which is mandatory for any person or company making or using any controlled substance, as defined by the CSA. Pharmacies can currently register for three years before needing to re-register.

There is a notable exemption in that while a pharmacy itself must register, the pharmacists employed by that pharmacy are exempt from registering as individuals under the CSA.
