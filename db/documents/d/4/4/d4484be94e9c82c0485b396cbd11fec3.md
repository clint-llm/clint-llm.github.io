Diphenhydramine is most often used for the treatment of nausea, vomiting, allergic rhinitis, mild to severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis), and as a mild sleep aid. However, due to easy access to this medication, it is often abused and can lead to acute intoxication. To avoid the potentially serious complications and mortality associated with diphenhydramine toxicity, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity describes the evaluation and management of diphenhydramine toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of diphenhydramine toxicity.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of diphenhydramine toxicity.
- Outline the management options available for diphenhydramine toxicity.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance diphenhydramine toxicity management and improve outcomes.
