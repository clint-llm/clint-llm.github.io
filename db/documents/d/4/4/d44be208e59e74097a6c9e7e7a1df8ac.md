Lasers are used in a multitude of medical fields and specialties. However, they have been an integral part of the treatment and diagnostic capabilities in ophthalmology. Lasers can be classified into distinct categories in ophthalmology based on their mechanism of action, including thermal interaction, photodisruption, photochemical interaction, photoablation, and plasma-induced ablation. This activity reviews the principles of lasers in ophthalmology while discussing the different types of laser mechanisms and examines the complications of laser therapy and safety steps to effectively use lasers in ophthalmology by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of laser in ophthalmology.
- Review the different types of lasers based on the mechanism of action.
- Summarize diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities of lasers in ophthalmology.
- Discuss complications with lasers and safety measures when using lasers and the role of interprofessional collaboration in improving patient care both diagnostically and therapeutically.
