Topography is essential to screen and plan for refractive procedures, especially photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), LASIK (Laser in situ keratomileusis), arcuate keratotomy, and intracorneal ring segments. It is important to advise patients to undergo serial topographies in suspected ectasias to monitor progression and to diagnose post-refractive regression and ectasia.

Cataract surgery in patients with prior LASIK, radial keratotomy, or PRK needs topography to calculate intra-ocular lens power accurately. Corneal astigmatism measurement in the case of toric IOL (intraocular lens) power calculation also needs corneal topography. Patients must be educated about corneal topography's importance in these situations.

The optometrists and technicians operating the topography machines must be trained to advise the patients about the procedure. They have to be educated regarding the need to discontinue contact lens wear well before undergoing topography. Tear film abnormalities also have to be identified. Otherwise, the maps may be inaccurate. Proper positioning of the patient's forehead and chin on the machine and reduced or no blinking and eye movements must be explained.

Topography and tomography are essentially safe procedures and can be repeated as often as required.
