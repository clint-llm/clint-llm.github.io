Bacterial (exudative) tracheitis is a potentially lethal infection of the subglottic trachea, which can occur in isolation or as a post-viral respiratory infection complication. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of bacterial tracheitis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of bacterial tracheitis.
- Explain the role that opportunistic bacteria play in damaging the tracheal mucosa and stimulating the inflammatory response in bacterial tracheitis.
- Identify the typical diagnostic findings with laboratory values, radiography, laryngoscopy, and tracheoscopy.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication in the early diagnosis of airway compromise among the interprofessional team members, providing airway protection for patients with bacterial tracheitis.
