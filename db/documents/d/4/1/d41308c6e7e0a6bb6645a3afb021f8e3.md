The gold standard test for the diagnosis of true optic disc edema or papilledema is intravenous fluorescein angiography (IVFA), which will show leakage from the nerve if true disc edema is present.

A variety of testing modalities can detect ODD that are buried too deep to be directly visualized on fundus examinations. CT scans are not routinely performed to diagnose ODD, but occasionally on CT scans performed for other indications, there will be an incidental hyperdensity at the optic nerve head corresponding to calcified drusen. Fundus autofluorescence, either via dedicated fundus photography or via pre-injection photos during an IVFA procedure, will highlight more superficial drusen which autofluoresce. B-scan ultrasonography can detect drusen as a hyperechoic signal at the nerve head that creates an acoustic shadow and a deep reduplication artifact.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used to document the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, but this measurement cannot reliably distinguish disc edema from pseudopapilledema. The development of enhanced depth imaging OCT (EDI-OCT) and swept-source OCT (SS-OCT) technologies allows for visualization of the deep structures of the optic nerve, including deep drusen.
