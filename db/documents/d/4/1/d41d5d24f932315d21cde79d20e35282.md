The neurological examination is an assessment tool to determine a patient's neurologic function. It is beneficial in a variety of ways as it allows the localization of neurologic diseases and helps in ruling in or ruling out differential diagnoses. Neurological diseases can present a myriad of ways, including cognitive/behavioral, visual, motor, and sensory symptoms. Certain red flags during examination allow early detection of life-threatening neurologic diseases and recognize disorders that may negatively impact the quality of life.

The neurologic examination is useful in both ambulatory and emergency settings. It provides the physician a tool to recognize neurologic involvement in certain disease states, and thereby allow proper work-up and treatment for these patients. It is also beneficial in intensive care units, particularly in monitoring neurologic sequelae of diseases like strokes, intracranial tumors, and traumatic brain injury.
