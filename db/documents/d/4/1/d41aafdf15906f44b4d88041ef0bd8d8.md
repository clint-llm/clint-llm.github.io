Radial artery access should be avoided in patients with CKD who may need ESRD in the foreseeable future to preserve the radial artery for future fistula placement for hemodialysis.

Radial artery: After palpation of the radial artery 2cm proximal to the radial styloid process, an arteriotomy incision is made. Next, a micropuncture needle is used to puncture the radial artery, and a hydrophilic sheath is introduced into the artery by the modified Selinger technique. Subsequently, a vasodilator is injected into the artery (usually nicardipine 500 Âµg or verapamil 5 mg along with nitroglycerine IV heparin 50 U/kg or Max 5000U is given to reduce the risk of radial artery thrombosis.

Femoral artery: After palpation of the common femoral artery, 2cm below the center of the inguinal ligament at the point of maximum palpable impulse, an arteriotomy incision is made. Fluoroscopy can be used for better localization of the femoral artery, seen in the middle of the femoral head. Subsequently, a micropuncture needle is used to enter the femoral artery, and a hydrophilic sheath is placed with a modified Selinger technique.

After obtaining access, a guidewire is inserted into the artery into the target vessel. A balloon-tipped catheter is then advanced over the guidewire to the target site. At this point, when the target artery is reached, contrast (usually iohexol) is injected into the system, followed by imaging to visualize the arterial system and obtain a pre-procedure angiogram. The catheter is then advanced through the stenotic segment of the artery and inflated in an attempt to dilate the target artery and compress the atherosclerotic plaque.

If an atherectomy is planned, then the atherectomy device is introduced through the guidewire, and the plaque is disrupted (mechanical) or ablated (laser) at this point.

If stenting is planned, after balloon dilation, the catheter is withdrawn, and a stent of appropriate size and diameter is advanced over the guidewire. Once the stent is in the desired artery, contrast material is injected, and the stent is positioned and deployed across the lesion, followed by another angiography.

Intravascular imaging tools like Intravascular ultrasonography or Optic coherence tomography are used for assessment of the adequacy of stent deployment, including stent expansion and apposition.

If post stent deployment angiograms are deemed adequate, the guidewire is withdrawn.

Hemostasis is achieved by direct manual compression or application of a compression band to the wrist (radial) or vascular closure devices (femoral).

There is increasing evidence to support the use of radial access over femoral in percutaneous coronary interventions due to a lower risk of local bleeding complications.
