Pressure support ventilation as a key weaning strategy is noted in comparison to modes such as intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV). Studies have shown that pressure support ventilation results in a decreased respiratory rate, increased tidal volume, reduced respiratory muscle activity, and decreased oxygen consumption than with IMV modes of ventilation.
