Pituitary lesions are common and incidentally discovered on many CTs performed for unrelated reasons. The use of traditional skull radiography and pneumoencephalography to assess pituitary lesions is only of historical significance. Contrast-enhanced CT imaging of the brain using a pituitary protocol offers limited diagnostic value compared to MRI when evaluating sellar and suprasellar lesions. However, calcifications and bony structures are optimally evaluated using CT and may be necessary for preoperative planning for surgical resection of pituitary masses. The initial recommended diagnostic test for pituitary lesions is a specialized MRI pituitary protocol, both with and without intravenous contrast. Few pituitary lesions demonstrate overlapping imaging findings on MRI and may require tissue biopsy for definitive diagnosis. Other advanced imaging modalities such as ultrasound play no role in evaluating the pituitary, but in select circumstances, radionuclide cisternography may prove to be a useful adjunct study in evaluating for occult CSF leaks.
