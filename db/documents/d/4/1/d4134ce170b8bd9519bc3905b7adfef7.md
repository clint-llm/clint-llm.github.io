Pegfilgrastim is a pegylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor that is FDA-approved to decrease the risk of patients developing febrile neutropenia when receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens. For primary prophylaxis, the risk of developing febrile neutropenia should be 20% or higher, and there should be no other safer regimen that is equally effective available to the patient. Definable risk factors, as listed here, determine a patient's chance for developing febrile neutropenia:

- 65-years-old or older

- Advanced disease

- Previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy

- Preexisting neutropenia or bone marrow involvement with a tumor

- Infection

- Open wounds or having undergone recent surgery

- Poor performance or nutritional status

- Impaired renal function

- Inadequate liver function, mainly indicated by elevated bilirubin

- Cardiovascular disease

- Multiple comorbid conditions

- HIV

It is important to note that the risk of developing febrile neutropenia is less than 20% in many readily used chemotherapy regimens. Therefore, it is essential to make individualized, patient-based decisions when deciding if the use of a granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor is required.

Pegfilgrastim is also FDA-approved to help increase the survival of patients exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation. Receiving acute myelosuppressive doses of radiation is a syndrome known as acute radiation syndrome, and pegfilgrastim's indication is for the hematopoietic sub-syndrome.
