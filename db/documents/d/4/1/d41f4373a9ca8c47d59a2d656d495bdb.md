There are currently no antidotes to varenicline. If there are serious adverse effects, including psychiatric conditions or skin hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue varenicline immediately. Varenicline therapy may stop abruptly with no side effects, and there is no need for a taper. Evaluation of prolonged exposure to varenicline in adults has not revealed any alteration of hematological, biochemical, and anatomicopathological parameters. Varenicline is removed by dialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease; however, there is no experience in dialysis following an overdose.
