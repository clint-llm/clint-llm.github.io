Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome refers to a range of symptoms that may occur during dialysis, especially in patients in whom dialysis is initially started or who have missed frequent sessions of dialysis. It is believed to occur due to the rapid clearance of substances such as urea that get accumulated in the blood. This can lead to an imbalance in the level of fluid inside the cells of the brain, causing swelling and symptoms such as headache, nausea, restlessness, confusion, or in severe cases, seizures, coma, and death. Although uncommon with increasing awareness, dialysis disequilibrium syndrome can be uncomfortable and distressful to patients. Patients should be advised to report any symptoms after dialysis is started to implement preventative measures. It is also important to educate patients and their families to maintain regular dialysis sessions to help minimize the risk of DDS.
