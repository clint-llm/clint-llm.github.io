Hereditary elliptocytosis (HE), also known as hereditary ovalocytosis, is an inherited heterogeneous red blood cell (RBC) disorder,Â characterized by elongated, oval, or elliptical-shaped red blood cells on the peripheral blood smear. Genetic alterations in alpha spectrin, beta spectrin, protein 4.1, band 3, and rarely glycophorin C result in failure of the elastic recoil property of normal RBCs in peripheral circulation resulting in an elliptical shape. These elliptocytes are trapped and removed by the spleen resulting in hemolytic anemia. Elliptocytosis was first described by Dresbach in 1904, and Hunter firmly established its heritability.

The subtypes of hereditary elliptocytosis include common hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP), Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO), and spherocytic elliptocytosis (SE). These subtypes differ in RBC morphology and the degree of hemolysis.

Most of the cases of hereditary elliptocytosis are asymptomatic and require no treatment. However, symptomatic patients should be managed with blood transfusion and splenectomy.
