Patients with palpitations may require a Holter monitor to confirm the presence of atrial arrhythmias. Many of these patients will need anticoagulation with warfarin. Hence, the pharmacist should ensure that monthly blood work is done to ensure therapeutic anticoagulation. A dietary consult is often important as failure to thrive is common. Finally, the patient should be educated on the type of prosthetic valves available and which may be best suited for them. Finally, the primary care provider, pharmacist, and nurses should discuss with the patient the possibility of developing an infection of the valve and the need for prophylaxis when undergoing any type of invasive procedure.
