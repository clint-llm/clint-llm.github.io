The cause of the patient’s LSCD may pose a risk of inducing LSCD in the donor eye, so it is essential to take a good history. Fluorescein staining will allow visualization of pathologic corneal epithelium that requires removal. Patients suffering from unilateral LSCD should have normal vision in their healthy eye. Patient counseling and informed consent are needed when proposing the idea of performing a biopsy on their only good eye.

Depending on the particular case and complications, patients should be informed of the possibility of requiring subsequent surgeries. Aesthetic results from simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) will never match a normal eye, so it is essential to set a patient’s expectations and focus on improvement from the eye’s preoperative state. Preoperative vasoconstriction with 2 to 3 drops of phenylephrine 5% and brimonidine tartrate 0.15% in both eyes is recommended to reduce intraoperative bleeding.

When planning to perform allogenic SLET using cadaveric tissue, the graft should ideally be fresh (less than 48 hrs from harvesting), have visible limbal palisades, have no observable epithelial sloughing, and be collected from a cadaver aged 60-years-old or less.
