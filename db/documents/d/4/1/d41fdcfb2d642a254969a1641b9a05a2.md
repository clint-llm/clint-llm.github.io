Methanol (CH3OH) is a toxic alcohol that is found in various household and industrial agents. Methanol exposure can be extremely dangerous, with significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated. Methanol poisoning is most often due to accidental or intentional ingestions, and accidental epidemic poisonings due to distilling and fermenting errors and beverage contamination. Products that contain methanol include windshield washer fluid, gas line antifreeze, carburetor cleaner, copy machine fluid, perfumes, food warming fuel, and other types of fuels. Exposures can cause varying degrees of toxicity and can require a range of treatments from close laboratory monitoring to antidotal therapy and dialysis. The primary treatments are either ethanol or fomepizole, and unlike ethylene glycol toxicity, dialysis is often recommended. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management/prevention of methanol toxicity, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the basic pathophysiology and toxicokinetics of methanol toxicity. 
- Review the examination and evaluation procedures for diagnosing methanol toxicity, including any applicable laboratory testing.
- Summarize the treatment and management strategy for methanol toxicity.
- Outline how an optimally functioning interprofessional team would coordinate care to enhance outcomes for patients with methanol toxicity.
