The prognosis is excellent for patients with minimal change pathology, with most patients going into remission following corticosteroid treatment.

Of patients with membranous nephropathy, around 30% undergo spontaneous remission. However, for patientsÂ with persistent nephrotic syndrome, 40% to 50% develop ESRD over a period of ten years.
