**Deep vein thrombosis (DVT):**The American Heart Association guidelines recommend avoiding compression of the extremity with known or suspected DVT due to concern for breaking and embolizing a thrombus.

**Severe leg pain:**Performing ABI measurement requires significant pressure to be applied to the leg. Whether related to leg ischemia, fracture/swelling, or wounds, this procedure can cause significant pain for the patient.
