The Colles fracture is defined as a distal radius fracture with dorsal comminution, dorsal angulation, dorsal displacement, radial shortening, and an associated ulnar styloid fracture. The term Colles fracture is often used eponymously for distal fractures with dorsal angulation. These distal radius fractures are often caused by falling on an outstretched hand with the wrist in dorsiflexion, causing tension on the volar aspect of the wrist, causing the fracture to extend dorsally. Colles fractures require medical management to ensure proper healing. Colles fractures require multiple aspects of the healthcare team for each patient to allow for optimal care of each patient. This activity outlines the evaluation, treatment, and management of Colles fractures and explains the interprofessional team's role in caring for this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of Colles fractures.
- Outline the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of a patient with a Colles fracture.
- Review the treatment and management options available for Colles fractures.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance Colles fracture management to improve patient outcomes.
