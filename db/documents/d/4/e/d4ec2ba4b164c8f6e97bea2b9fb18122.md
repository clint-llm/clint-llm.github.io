The pathophysiology of nail-patella syndrome centers around the LMX1B protein role in embryological development. LMX1B is involved in dorsal-ventral limb patterning and has a normal gradient of expression from distal to proximal and from anterior to posterior. This expression pattern likely explains nail and patellar (an epiphyseal equivalent) involvement with decreasing severity of findings going from anterior to posterior as well as going from distal to proximal.LMX1B.

In another example, the anterior structures of the eye to include the cornea, trabecular meshwork, and anterior chamber depth, are each influenced by LMX1B during development. It is an abnormal anterior chamber depth in patients with NPS that is most likely responsible for primary open-angle glaucoma, the most potentially serious and most frequent ocular complication of NPS.

LMX1B plays an important role in embryological renal development, particularly with the podocytes and glomeruli. The podocyte foot processes may be effaced and exhibit abnormal slit diaphragms, causing splitting of the glomerular basement membrane as well as decreased endothelial fenestrations.
