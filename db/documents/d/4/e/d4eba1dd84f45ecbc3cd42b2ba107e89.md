**History**

Patients with gender dysphoria (GD) can present to their primary care physician, endocrinologist, or mental health provider. Sometimes, it is a primary concern, whereas others might present with compound mental health problems. Also, due to greater exposure, social acceptance, and greater access to care, this population tends to present before puberty, whereas before, they might have presented in adulthood or late adolescence. Necessary referrals should be made according to the patient to provide them with a strong support system.

It is essential to obtain a good history from the patient, including psychiatric, substance use, social, family, and developmental, including any history of trauma. Past psychiatric history would include past suicide attempts, self-injurious behavior, and history of previous inpatient psychiatric condition if they currently have a psychiatrist or a psychotherapist, any past psychiatric treatment.

Social and developmental history includes their childhood, education status, academic performance, social support, history of trauma (mental, physical, sexual), legal history, and whether they are currently married or have children.

Family history includes any history of psychiatric illness, completed suicides, or substance use.

**Physical Examination**

At birth, a thorough genital exam should be carried out. Children born with congenital adrenal hyperplasia or androgen insensitivity syndrome can present with ambiguous genitalia.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia may present with early signs of dehydration, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. In the late-onset subtype, they might present with early signs of virilization and menstrual irregularities in young females. Classic salt-losing type individuals are sicker and need immediate management.

Androgen insensitivity syndrome is when genetic males are insensitive to androgens in the body. They are often raised as girls. They may have hormonal and surgical treatments in early adulthood/adolescence.

Careful and meticulous assessment and genetic testing should be performed on individuals born with ambiguous genitalia.
