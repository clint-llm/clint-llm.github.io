Bamlanivimab has been associated with decreasing the viral load and further spreading the disease (even as monotherapy), as shown in phase 1 of the BLAZE-1 trial. The other study by Ganesh et al. at Mayo clinic facilities from November 2020 and FebruaryÂ 2021 revealed that bamlanivimab reduced the rate of hospitalization at days 14 and 21, along with lower intensive care admission and all-cause mortality.

But with emerging new strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that are resistant to only bamlanivimab therapy, the use of bamlanivimab monotherapy was revoked by FDA in April 2021.

The data from phase 3 of the BLAZE-1 clinical trial revealed an accelerated decline in viral load in patients receiving the combination therapy and reduced the rate of hospitalization by 70%.

Primary care, Urgent and Immediate care physicians should triage patients meeting the criteria for receiving the monoclonal antibody therapy.

Pharmacists help in dose preparation and storage of the drug, and nurses assist in administering and monitoring the patient during and 1-hour post-infusion. Physicians and Nurses should coordinate to educate the patient regarding possible adverse effects and provide the patient with the fact sheet about the drug provided by FDA prior to the drug administration. The care team and the patient should follow the directions provided in the fact sheet to notify of any adverse event within seven calendar days.
