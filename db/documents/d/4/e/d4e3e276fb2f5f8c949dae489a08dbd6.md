Three distinct types of longitudinal melanonychia exist, including 1. lentigo, 2. nail matrix nevus, and 3. subungual melanoma. The first two conditions are benign lesions, while subungual melanoma is malignant. Subungual melanoma is a distinct subtype of cutaneous malignant melanoma arising from structures within the nail apparatus. Unlike cutaneous malignant melanoma, subungual melanoma does not appear to be related to sun exposure. It is ordinarily a variant of acral lentiginous melanoma, a malignant melanoma originating on palms and soles. This activity seeks to provide an up-to-date and accurate review of subungual melanoma and its interprofessional team management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of subungual melanoma.
- Review the presentation of subungual melanoma.
- Outline the management options available for subungual melanoma.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by subungual melanoma.
