Since the first step out of the marine world, the animals had to adapt to the lack of fluid and electrolytes found in abundance in seawater. Over time these creatures have developed a kidney capable of regulating salt and water retention. It is the most distal part of the nephron that is responsible for this regulation. When defective, the mechanisms that hold the maintenance of our effective plasma volume will cause electrolytes disturbance apparently unrelated but potentially dangerous; mainly hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis We will evaluate the function of the thick ascending limb and the distal convoluted tubule as well as the connecting tubule and their principal cells. This activity addresses the physiology of the distal part of the nephron and the etiology, pathophysiology, and management of hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis by interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Review the importance of the physiology of the distal part of the nephron.
- Explain the clear relationship between physiology and disease. 
- Summarize the diagnostic strategy to a common disorder. 
- Outline the different diuretics according to the knowledge of their mechanism of action.
