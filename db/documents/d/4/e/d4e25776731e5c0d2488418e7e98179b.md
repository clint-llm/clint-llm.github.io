Pelvic surgery may lead to bladder dysfunction. Some pelvic surgeries that have reported complications of bladder dysfunction include, but are not limited to, radical prostatectomy, perineal resection, radical hysterectomy, and proctocolectomy. Surgeons should take caution during pelvic surgery to avoid damage to any nerves, vessels, or structures of the bladder or urinary system.
