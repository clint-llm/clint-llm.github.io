The alteration and increased expression of GFAP induce the development ofÂ protein aggregates (Rosenthal fibers) in the astrocyte cytoplasm. In turn, reactive gliosis and astrocyte dysfunction induce a set of secondary changes in neurons and other types of glia.

In the pathogenesis of the disease, therefore, an important role is played by the overexpression of the mutant protein and, thus, filament accumulation. Indeed, experiments conducted on GFAP-null mice have shown that the reduction of GFAP expression is associated with a low morbidity phenotype.GFAP expression through single intracerebroventricular injections in a GFAP mutant mouse models of Alexander disease. They proved that this approach reduced the level of Rosenthal fibers and the activation of astrocytes and microglia.
