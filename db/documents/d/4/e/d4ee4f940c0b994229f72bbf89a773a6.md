It is important to be aware of the infectious complications related to arboviruses that can be transmitted via mosquitos and ticks. As no treatment options are available, educating patients on the geographical distribution of these viruses to practice infection prevention is important when traveling to endemic areas. Resources for such information can be found online through the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization. Using insect repellant, wearing long-sleeved clothing, and checking for ticks can help prevent diseases related to these viruses.
