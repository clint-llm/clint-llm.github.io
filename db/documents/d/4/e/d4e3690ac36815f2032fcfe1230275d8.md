- Cyclic neutropenia may have a similar presentation to several causes of recurrent fever, such as recurrent tonsillitis, infectious diseases, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Behçet's disease, and familial Mediterranean fever syndrome.

Rare disorders with a presentation similar to cyclic neutropenia are as follows:

- Marshall syndrome (MS) is a recurrent fever syndrome characterized by fever at 3-8 weeks intervals, cervical adenopathy, pharyngitis, and aphthous ulcers. MS is a diagnosis of exclusion.

- PFAPA syndrome (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis) is a non-hereditary autoinflammatory disease, presenting with recurrent fevers lasting for 3 to 6 days duration, accompanied by aphthous ulcers, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and cervical lymphadenitis.
