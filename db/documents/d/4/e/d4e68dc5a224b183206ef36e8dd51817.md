Successful reduction of a nurse maid's elbow in a child rarely will lead to long-term sequelae and the child is unlikely to experience a similar condition after the age of five when the annular ligament strengthens.

The posterior interosseous nerve is in proximity to the radial head. It is the nerve most commonly injured in radial head dislocation. Its motor function is most commonly affected.

Dislocations in the adult often require surgical correction; prompt surgical correction may lead to arthritis and reduced range of motion; however, delayed diagnosis and correction are more likely to lead to a greater degree of morbidity. If left undiagnosed or corrected for multiple years, the radial head deformity can develop necessitating a more complex corrective surgery.
