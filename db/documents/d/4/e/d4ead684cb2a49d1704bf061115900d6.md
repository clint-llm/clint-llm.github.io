# Introduction

Adult acquired flatfoot (AAFD), first described as posterior tibial tendon dysfunction (PTTD), is a complex pathology defined by the collapse of the medial longitudinal arch of the foot with continued progressive deformity of the foot and ankle.

The anatomy of the foot and ankle are complex, with multiple structures involved in the stability and function needed to walk and bear weight. A structure principally involved in the development of adult acquired flatfoot is the posterior tibial tendon. In addition to plantar flexion, the posterior tibial tendon is the primary inverter of the foot.  The posterior tibial tendon inserts principally on the navicular tuberosity, but also has lesser insertions on to other tarsal and metatarsal structures.

Acquired flatfoot grading is by the Johnson and Strom classification system, which has classification grades of I to III.

# Etiology

Acquired flatfoot was historically attributed to posterior tibial tendon deficiency, although now the understanding is that the ligamentous structures of the ankle play a role in adult-acquired flatfoot development.

# Epidemiology

Acquired flatfoot is a common orthopedic condition, although there is a relative paucity of literature on the epidemiology regarding adult acquired flatfoot. There are 5 million people in the United States affected with adult acquired flatfoot. In the UK, the estimated prevalence is estimated to be over 3% in women over 40 years old.

# Pathophysiology

The posterior tibial tendon is critical in maintaining the appropriate gait and function of the foot. Contraction of the tibialis posterior causes the inversion of the foot and locking of the transverse tarsal joints granting stability for push-off.

# History and Physical

It is essential to evaluate the patient with suspected adult acquired flatfoot during weight-bearing. There are specific hallmark findings of adult acquired flatfoot for which practitioners should look. While the patient is standing with the provider behind excessive abduction of the forefoot can be noted by the “too many toes” sign. This test is positive if the practitioner can see more than the fifth and part of the fourth toe. Inspection and palpation over the posterior tibial tendon at the area of the medial malleolus may demonstrate swelling or pain. On the lateral aspect of the foot pain may be elicited if there is impingement of ligamentous structures.

# Evaluation

The gold standard for the evaluation of adult acquired flatfoot is weight-bearing radiographs. Radiographs are necessary in the anteroposterior, lateral, and hindfoot views. These views will assess the degree of arch collapse, particularly by measuring the lateral first tarsometatarsal angle, and forefoot abduction at the talonavicular joint. Talar head uncoverage can also be measured in the setting of stage IV disease by the lateral talonavicular angle. Lateral views of the foot can also display naviculocuneiform and first tarsometatarsal collapse. Arthritis should be carefully assessed on all radiographic films as this may have implications on treatment options.

MRI is typically not needed for evaluation of adult acquired flatfoot; however, it may be beneficial for some patients with ligamentous involvement that may alter surgical treatment planning; this is particularly relevant for patients with medial peritalar instability, who have improved functional outcomes with deltoid-spring ligament reconstruction.

Several studies indicate that ultrasound may be a useful modality in assessing the posterior tibial tendon when compared to the more time consuming and costly MRI. Results from an ultrasonographic evaluation of the posterior tibial tendon were equivalent to MRI in 87% to 94% of patients.

# Treatment / Management

The treatment of adult acquired flatfoot is complex. There are multiple treatment options, and the treatment of adult-acquired flatfoot has been the focus of most recent research. However, first-line therapy for the condition remains nonoperative.

Treatment with orthotic devices, such as low-articulating ankle-foot orthosis, cast-boot walkers, and other ankle-foot orthoses in conjunction with NSAID therapy and physical therapy have a resolution of symptoms 87% of the time according to one study.  Other studies have success rates of 67 to 90% with conservative measures.

Surgical treatment is indicated in patients who have attempted conservative therapy and are not satisfied with their results. Surgical treatment depends on the stage of the disease, as well as other factors including medical comorbidities, functional status, and use of tobacco.

Surgical management of stage I disease is uncommon, but if required patients should undergo posterior tibial tendon tenosynovectomy, debridement, or flexor digitorum longus tendon autograft. There is a concern that repair of the posterior tibial tendon may experience complications with long-term failure; therefore, surgical treatment should be carefully considered prior to any intervention.

Stage II disease treatment has been successful by medializing calcaneal osteotomy in addition to a flexor digitorum longus transfer. One study showed 87% of patient satisfaction with this treatment after a mean follow-up of 15 years.

Stage III disease becomes more challenging to treat due to the fixed nature of the defect. Arthrodesis is the standard of care, with double and triple arthrodesis being common. Double arthrodesis entails a fusion of the subtalar and talonavicular joints. Triple arthrodesis involves the calcaneocuboid joint in addition to the two joints mentioned above. Double arthrodesis has the advantage of reduced arthritic complications and reduced joint stiffness associated with calcaneocuboid fusion. Unfortunately, joint fusion has an inherent loss of mobility, and patients may struggle on uneven ground. Risk of nonunion, deltoid insufficiency, and ankle valgus is also present.

Stage IV disease management depends on whether there is a rigid flatfoot. Some patients progress to stage IV disease without rigid disease due to the failure of the deltoid ligament. In this setting, patients may have treatment with a deltoid ligament repair. Patients with rigid stage IV disease will require an ankle fusion, which is associated with significant morbidity. Ankle replacement is an alternative to arthrodesis.

A recent meta-analysis of surgical treatments for adult acquired flatfoot was conducted to study the efficacy of different therapies further. This study analyzed different radiographic angles to measure the effectiveness of each procedure, including medial calcaneal osteotomies, lateral column lengthening, and double and triple arthrodesis. The conclusions of the study suggested that all treatment types result in significant improvements for the patient.

# Differential Diagnosis

While the diagnosis of adult acquired flatfoot is relatively straightforward, there are several diagnoses that a provider needs to rule out when acquired flatfoot is suspected. These include adult flexible flatfoot, tarsal coalition, Charcot foot, neuromuscular flatfoot, and arthritic, post-traumatic, and iatrogenic deformity. A careful history and physical can rule out most of these etiologies.

# Prognosis

The prognosis for most patients with adult acquired flatfoot is favorable. Most patients will not need surgery. The approximately 10% that do require surgery can expect favorable outcomes.

# Complications

Adult acquired flatfoot that is left untreated can progress to more severe stages that require more invasive treatments. Early diagnosis is critical and can even help avoid surgery in some patients. As the disease progresses into late stages, the need for the patient to get an ankle fusion increases. With an ankle fusion, the patient essentially has an immobile ankle joint, and many recreational activities are affected.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Acquired flatfoot appears to be associated with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and other disease processes that are treatable with a healthy lifestyle and weight reduction. Patients with adult acquired flatfoot may benefit from the treatment of their other medical comorbidities. Additionally, patients may prevent further disease progression once diagnosed with the use of an appropriate orthotic device. Most patients who use an orthotic device in conjunction with PT and or NSAID therapy will not need any surgical intervention.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Acquired flatfoot is a common disease that when recognized early, is highly treatable with excellent outcomes. All members of the healthcare team can play a role in the identification, treatment, and follow-up of care for patients with acquired flatfoot. This team may consist of family practitioners, specialty-trained nurses, orthopedic and foot and ankle surgeons, physical therapists, and radiologists. As with all orthopedic surgeries, a physical therapist must work closely with surgeons to assure adequate recovery and slow progression to full activity. Family practitioners may be the first physicians to see the patient and diagnose the disorder. They should be aware of the basic diagnostic criteria and treatment protocols so that patients can be referred to surgeons when non-operative management is futile.
