**Respiratory**

Chronic respiratory failure secondary to muscle weakness often leads to atelectasis, aspiration, and pneumonia secondary to mechanical ventilation.

**Cardiac**

Cardiomyopathy can be common comorbidity, and they can have chronic heart failure, which can require medical therapy.

**Musculoskeletal**

They can have scoliosis due to immobility, osteopenia, and increased risk of fractures. Pressure ulcers and joint contractures may also develop, even despite aggressive physical therapy.

**Endocrine**

Adrenal insufficiency is common in these patients, and they may require steroid supplementation in case of stress. Thyroid and vitamin D levels should also be assessed as a part of the comprehensive evaluation.

**Neurological**

Some of these patients can have seizures; the burden of psychological disorders like depression and anxiety is high in these patients due to underlying chronic disease.
