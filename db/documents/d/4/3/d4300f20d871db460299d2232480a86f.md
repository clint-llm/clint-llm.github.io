# Continuing Education Activity

Glatiramer is an immunomodulator used in the treatment and management of multiple sclerosis. Its mechanism is not clearly understood, but it appears to work by altering the immune processes responsible for MS. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, mechanism of action, adverse events, and other key elements of glatiramer therapy and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes for patients with multiple sclerosis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for glatiramer acetate. 
- Describe how to administer glatiramer acetate for patients with multiple sclerosis.
- Outline considerations regarding the use of glatiramer acetate in treating patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. 
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients receiving glatiramer acetate.

# Indications

Glatiramer acetate is an immune-modulating medication currently used to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).

Michael Sela, Ruth Arnon, and Dvora Teitelbaum at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, originally discovered the drug in the 1960s as they attempted to produce a synthetic antigen capable of inducing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is the animal model of autoimmune inflammatory CNS disorders used by researchers to advance understanding of such neurological conditions. Surprisingly they noted that the copolymer they created, Cop-1, actually reduced the incidence of encephalitis and severity of histological lesions. After testing Cop-1 on various species and achieving similar results, clinical evaluation of human subjects began in 1977.

In 1995, Johnson et al. performed the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 20 mg glatiramer acetate daily in the United States. The initial positive results obtained on 50 patients with RRMS led to a Phase III clinical trial expansion encompassing 251 patients with RRMS. During the two years of therapy, those patients receiving glatiramer demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the mean number of relapses compared to those in the placebo group (1.19 vs. 1.68, p=0.0007). In Canada and Europe, Comi et al. performed MRI evaluations on 239 RRMS patients. They looked at the reduction in the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions over nine months to assess treatment efficacy with glatiramer vs. placebo. A statistically significant reduction in the number of lesions was noted amongst the glatiramer receiving patients over those on placebo (26 vs. 36.7, p=0.003). These results led to the Federal Drug Administration’s clearance of the glatiramer acetate for the treatment of RRMS in 1996.

In 2009, a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 20 mg daily glatiramer acetate was performed on 481 patients with CIS by Comi et al. This trial, deemed “PreCISE,” gave rise to a statistically significant (p=0.0005) result indicating a 45% reduction in the risk of developing complete demyelinating multiple sclerosis in those patients receiving glatiramer acetate. PreCISe also resulted in a 115% prolongation of time from CIS conversion to chronic demyelinating multiple sclerosis. These results prompted same-year FDA approval of glatiramer acetate in the treatment of CIS.

# Mechanism of Action

Glatiramer acetate is a random-sized 40 to 100 amino acid polymer composed primarily of four amino acids, L-alanine, L-lysine, L-glutamic acid, and L-tyrosine, in a molar ratio of 4.2 to 3.4 to 1.4 to 1.0, respectively. The premise behind its mechanism of action lies in the construct that patients with multiple sclerosis have antibodies directed against myelin basic protein (MBP), a component of the myelin sheaths of neurons within the central nervous system. Glatiramer acetate’s chemical construct allows it to mimic MBP and thus a decoy for the antibodies in these patients, decreasing the inflammatory response. Otherwise, the inflammatory response allows for the vulnerability of the blood-brain barrier to demyelination and axonal injury.

The postulates from multiple clinical studies are that glatiramer acetate shifts the immune response from a pro-inflammatory state comprised of Th1 T-cells to regulatory, non-inflammatory Th2 T-Cells. The introduction of the polymer allows it to bind to major histone compatibility (MHC) complex class II molecules on MBP-specific antigen-presenting cells, preventing MBP from stimulating these cells. Instead of the usual pro-inflammatory cytokine release, such as IL-2 and IL-12, anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-4, and IL-10 are the cytokines dispersed.

While glatiramer acetate itself cannot penetrate the blood-brain barrier, its ability to induce the peripheral Th2 cells and their subsequent crossing of the blood barrier allows for the reduction of further inflammation within the CNS. This mechanism of action has been dubbed “bystander suppression.”

Additionally, in the preclinical levels thus far, it has been noted that glatiramer acetate induces a neuroprotective and/or neuro-regenerative effect. The drug increases neurotrophic factors like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which research has discovered to be vital to neuronal and glial cell survival. There is also some evidence suggestive of glatiramer’s ability to induce remyelination and enhance neurogenesis.

# Administration

Glatiramer acetate is to be administered by subcutaneous injection.

- Sites approved for injection include arms, abdomen, hips, and thighs

- Glatiramer acetate comes in two dosing schedules: 20 mg per mL per day or 40 mg per mL three times per week with doses given at least 48 hours apart

- Glatiramer acetate 20 mg per ml and 40 mg per ml are not interchangeable

- Recommended to rotate injection sites to minimize the occurrence of lipoatrophy

- Do not administer intravenously or intramuscularly

- It is recommended to allow the solution to warm to room temperature before administration

**Adult Dosing**

Glatiramer is indicated to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and/or active secondary progressive disease in adults. The dose for glatiramer acetate is 20 mg SQ once daily or 40 mg SQ three times a week (e.g., Mon, Wed, Fri) administered at least 48 hours apart.

Given the positive results in reducing relapse rates with the implementation of glatiramer acetate in multiple sclerosis patients, curiosity emerged regarding the effects of using the drug at a higher dosage. In 2007 researchers performed a phase II clinical trial comparing a high dosage of 40 mg glatiramer acetate to the standard dosage of 20 mg, encompassing 38 RRMS patients over nine months. The efficacy assessment was the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI. Results showed increased efficacy in the patients on the higher dosage of glatiramer acetate 40 mg as they demonstrated 2.26 lesions on MRI compared to 3.62 lesions seen on MRI in those patients on a standard dosage of 20 mg. In addition, safety profiles were comparable between the two groups.

The results prompted a phase III, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial that embodied over 1155 patients in over 136 sites across 20 different countries to compare daily administration of subQ 40 mg versus 20 mg glatiramer acetate in one year. Primary outcome efficacy was assessed by the relapse rate in the first year, while secondary outcome efficacy was deemed by MRI findings. At the end of one year, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups; The standard 20 mg group had a 0.28 mean relapse rate, and the higher dosed 40 mg group had a 0.27 mean relapse rate. Additionally, the mean number of new T2 lesions and percentage of brain volume changes were similar between the two groups.

In 2013, Khan et al. performed a phase III, randomized, double-blind study trial including over 1404 patients with RRMS in over 142 sites in 17 countries compared a high dose of 40 mg glatiramer acetate three times per week to placebo over one year. This study revealed a 34% reduction in risk of confirmed relapses in those receiving treatment compared to those receiving placebo, 0.331 vs. 0.501, p=0.0001.

**Specific Patient Population**

**Patients with Renal Impairment**

There is no information provided/studied on dose adjustments by the manufacturer.

**Patients with Hepatic Impairment**

There is no information provided/studied on dose adjustments by the manufacturer.

**Pregnancy Considerations**

The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommends against starting disease-modifying therapies for MS during pregnancy, and an exception is females at high risk of MS activity. Therefore, patients should be instructed if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant while using glatiramer, immediately they should consult their health care provider. It is considered Pregnancy Category B medicine.

**Breastfee****ding Considerations**

Most experts usually consider glatiramer acetate safe, and it appears to be one of the preferred disease-modifying agents to treat MS during breastfeeding.

# Adverse Effects

The number one reported side-effect of glatiramer acetate is injection site reaction, which manifests as a lump at the subcutaneous injection site. Approximately 10% of patients will report fever, chills, and aches. In addition, many patients note a transient episode of flushing, shortness of breath, and palpitations which self resolves within 30 minutes.

Less than 1% of patients will develop lipoatrophy, a visible dent at the injection site due to local necrosis of adipose tissue.

Serious but rare side effects to various organ systems, including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematopoietic, lymphatic, musculoskeletal, nervous, and urogenital systems, have been noted, as has Jessner lymphocytic infiltrate, a cutaneous condition characterized by a persistent papule or plaque eruption.

# Contraindications

- Known hypersensitivity to glatiramer acetate or mannitol

- Not approved for use for patients less than 18 years of age

- It is unknown if nursing mothers excrete glatiramer acetate in human breast milk.

**Warnings/Precautions**

- Rarely anaphylactoid (hypersensitivity) reactions are reported.

- Chest pain may precipitate as an immediate post-injection reaction and is usually transient pain, resolving in a few minutes. Episodes usually begin more than one month after starting treatment.

- Hepatic toxicity (cases of hepatitis and liver failure) has been reported, so advise the patient to watch for the signs/symptoms of liver dysfunction and consider discontinuation of glatiramer if warranted.

- Glatiramer administration might interfere with the patient’s immune function. Therefore, AAN recommends screening for infections/latent infections before initiating immunosuppressive/immunomodulating(ISIM) in a population with a high risk of infections. A specialist should treat patients who test positive for latent infections.

- AAN recommends against the administration of live-attenuated vaccines in patients with MS who receive ISIM treatment. It is recommended to delay vaccination of people with MS who are experiencing a relapse.

# Monitoring

A critical issue emerging regarding the use of immunomodulating drugs like glatiramer is the generation of antibodies to the drugs themselves. While some studies have had conflicting results, researchers conducted a sera analysis study consisting of 217 patients who participated in the treatment and placebo arms of several glatiramer acetate trials. The subjects were tested for antibodies to glatiramer acetate via the ELISA method. IgG antibodies, mainly IgG1, were found in the patients who received active treatment. The titers increased to a peak concentration within three months of initiating treatment but then slowly tapered off. The patients with higher antibody titers seem to be more likely to be relapse-free.

# Toxicity

There is no information available on an overdose of glatiramer acetate.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Glatiramer acetate is an immunomodulating medication used in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and a clinically isolated syndrome. The diagnosis of relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis may be challenging; however, it remains clear there are few medications proven to decrease exacerbations and may even offer neuroprotection. It is essential to consider an interprofessional approach with coordination with clinicians, mid-level practitioners, neurologists, pharmacists, insurance companies, and other health care professionals to have this medication approved and accessible to patients. Patient education is also crucial, explaining how the medication works and the expected clinical treatment course with outcomes. Nursing will be responsible for monitoring therapy as it progresses, noting any adverse events, and answering patient questions, while alerting the prescriber of any concerns. The prescriber should consult with a pharmacist, verifying dosing, interactions, and other pearls to make therapy more successful.

Glatiramer therapy is best when the administration and follow-up are through an interprofessional healthcare team that includes physicians, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all working collaboratively to monitor treatment and ensure optimal patient therapeutic outcomes. [Level 5]
