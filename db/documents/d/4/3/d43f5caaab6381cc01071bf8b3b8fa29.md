The mechanism of ranolazine's anti-anginal and anti-ischemic effects is not well understood. At the therapeutic level, it inhibits the late phase of inward sodium channels in ischemic cardiac myocytes, reducing the intracellular sodium concentration and thus reducing intracellular calcium influx via the Na-Ca channel. Decreased intracellular calcium reduces ventricular wall tension and thus reduces oxygen consumption. It does not affect blood pressure or heart rate. The Monotherapy Assessment of Ranolazine in Stable Angina (MARISA) trial randomized 191 patients with activity-limiting angina to 500 mg, 1000 mg, or 1500 mg twice daily or placebo for one week. Ranolazine significantly increased exercise duration compared to placebo and had negligible effects on heart rate and blood pressure.

At higher concentrations, ranolazine inhibits rapid delayed rectifier potassium current, thus delaying action potential and prolonging QT interval. Ranolazine also inhibits fatty acid oxidation, which enhances glucose oxidation, reduces lactic acid production, and improves heart function.
