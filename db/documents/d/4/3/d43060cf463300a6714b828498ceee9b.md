When the patient or family first notices dysarthria, they should immediately bring it to the attention of an appropriate medical practitioner. Acute onset might be a symptom of stroke; hence, rapid evaluation in the hospital is warranted. If symptoms are progressive, patients are typically assessed by a primary care clinician and referred to specialists. Patient and caregiver strategies help during rehabilitation.

Paying attention to the speaker, speaking in a quiet area with good lighting, repeating phrases that are not understood, and clarifying unclear statements by asking yes-or-no questions are some valuable strategies for caregivers. Patients should begin with one word or phrase before proceeding to complete sentences. Speaking slowly with frequent pauses helps ensure understanding. FrequentlyÂ ensuring listeners understand and using pictures and writing are also helpful strategies. When tired and frustrated, dysarthria worsens. When necessary, using alternative methods of communication is warranted. Educating the listener about dysarthria improves recognition of the condition and their attitude toward the patients.
