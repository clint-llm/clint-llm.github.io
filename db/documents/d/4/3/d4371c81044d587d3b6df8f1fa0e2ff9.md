Fast and accurate rhythm identification is an important skill for medical professionals in many different disciplines. ECGs are performed in the prehospital setting, physicians' offices, the emergency department, during surgery, and throughout the hospital. Emergency medical technicians (EMTs), nurses, and physicians are responsible for recognizing potentially dangerous rhythms to allow for proper patient care before it becomes a life-threatening issue. Quick and accurate rhythm identification by anybody in the healthcare team can improve morbidity and mortality in any of these patients. It is important to look at the patient as a whole when interpreting ECG rhythms since the knowledge of an individual patient on whom an ECG is ordered may result in a more critical rhythm assessment and might account for the higher accuracy of rhythm interpretation.
