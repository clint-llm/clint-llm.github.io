The heart is theÂ center of the body's circulation, the engine that drives oxygen received in the lungs to the tissues and organs as well as to exchange carbon dioxide. The oxygenated blood travels in the organism to organs and tissues through the aorta. This large artery brings nourishment to the whole body by dividing into various branches and capillaries, each smaller and smaller. Blood with carbon dioxide waste returns to the heart through the venous system.

The aortic valve is one of four heart valves and is the final one encountered by oxygenated blood as it leaves the heart. It is also called aortic semilunar due to its semilunar shape. It is between the left ventricle and the aorta to ensure that oxygen-rich blood does not flow back into the left ventricle. The aortic valve is typically made up of three membranes (cusps) made up mainly of collagen; the valve is placed on a muscle ring and connected to the heart wall.
