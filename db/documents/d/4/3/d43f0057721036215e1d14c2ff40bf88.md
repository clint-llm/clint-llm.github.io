Heart-lung transplant patients are at risk for a multitude of early complications, as would be expected after major thoracic transplant surgery. In particular, primary graft dysfunction of the lung from ischemic reperfusion injury results in increasingly severe hypercapnia and hypoxia, with an incidence of 15% to 20% after 48 to 72 hours.

Later complications arise from the transplant conundrum of balancing immune suppression, infections, and medication side effects against the risk of rejection. Chronic rejection of the lung graft manifested as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) occurs in 7% and 31% of patients at one and five years, respectively.

Immunosuppression protocols and rejection surveillance with echocardiography, endomyocardial biopsy, endobronchial biopsy, and spirometry all remain center-specific and patient dependent.

There has been some enthusiastic speculation that multiorgan transplants may have an increased tendency to promote recipient tolerance to the donor organs, in contrast with a single organ transplanted alone. However, this hypothesis does not seem to be supported in a heart-lung transplant at this time.

Several complications may arise from a particularly difficult surgical dissection. Injury or excess manipulation of the vagus nerves may lead to gastroparesis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and aspiration. These conditions can be quite adverse to the lung graft and are themselves risk factors for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Injury to the phrenic nerves may result in diaphragmatic paresis manifesting as acute to chronic dyspnea. Injury to the thoracic duct may lead to chylothorax.
