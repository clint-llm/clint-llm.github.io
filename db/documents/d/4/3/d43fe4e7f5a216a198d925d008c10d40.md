If orbital trauma is suspected, globe rupture and retrobulbar hematoma is a diagnosis that must be ruled out as this is sight-threatening and requires emergent ophthalmology consult. In the setting of trauma, one must also consider corneal abrasion, conjunctival laceration, ocular foreign body, traumatic iritis, traumatic hyphema. Differential for non-traumatic cases includes conjunctivitis, episcleritis, inflamed pterygium or pinguecula, corneal erosions, keratitis, anterior uveitis. One must also consider and rule out acute angle-closure glaucoma, corneal ulcer, endophthalmitis, and scleritis as these are ophthalmologic emergencies.

Most of the time a more dangerous etiology can be found just by simple observation. A patient in the setting of a globe rupture or retrobulbar hematoma could have some degree of proptosis, chemosis, decrease in visual acuity, or a tear-drop shaped pupil. The physical exam can also help to distinguish other eye disorders such as an afferent pupillary defect in the setting an optic neuropathy or consensual photophobia in the setting of iritis. The slit lamp exam with fluorescein staining can be a very useful adjunct in the exam to better investigate possible erosions, ulcers, dendrites. Many of these patients could have symptoms of grittiness or a foreign body sensation all of which should not be present in the case with a simple SCH.
