- Following implantation of the spinal cord stimulator, the healthcare team must be cognitive of lead migration over time, as well as the possible need for further adjustments of the settings of the stimulator to maximize pain relief.

- Complications following the procedure should be monitored closely, especially in the first few weeks postoperatively.

- For patients with a cardiac defibrillator or pacemaker, they should be monitored by cardiology following spinal cord stimulator implantation, in case of malfunction of the devices.

- If there is a concern for lead migration, such as a sudden reduction in pain relief following stimulator implantation. X-rays should be obtained to determine the stimulator lead location (AP and lateral views).

- Postoperative follow up after implantation usually occurs one week after the procedure. Close monitoring and adjustments of the stimulator settings following the procedure are routine.
