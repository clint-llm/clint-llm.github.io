Drowning is the leading cause of injury-related death in children. Drowning is defined as the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid. Drowning outcomes are defined as “death,” “no morbidity” or “morbidity.” It is important to note that the terms “wet,” “dry,” “active,” “passive,” “silent,” “secondary” drowning and near-drowning are no longer be used. More than half of the drowning deaths of children 0 to 4 years old occurred in swimming pools. There are risks involved whether it is a portable, inflatable, permanent in-ground, or personal home pool, or a hot tub or a public pool in a residential area or at a hotel.
