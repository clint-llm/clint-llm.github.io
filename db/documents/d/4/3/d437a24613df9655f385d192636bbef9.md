If untreated, cardiac sarcoidosis usually leads to dilated cardiomyopathy and an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. In addition, untreated or refractory pulmonary sarcoidosis that progresses to pulmonary fibrosis can lead to right heart failure.

Sudden cardiac death is the most feared complication of CS, which is why patients at high risk for the same should undergo evaluation for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.
