The human alkaline phosphatases (hALP) are found anchored on the cell membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol. They are released in the serum by the action of specific phospholipase.

The mechanism of the increase in alkaline phosphatase in hepatobiliary disorders has been a matter of debate. Research has convincingly shown that it is due to increased enzyme synthesis and not to reduced hepatobiliary excretion of the enzyme.
