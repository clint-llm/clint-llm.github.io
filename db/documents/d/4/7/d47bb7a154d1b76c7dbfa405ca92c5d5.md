The microscopic features of pityriasis alba are those of a mild, chronic, nonspecific dermatitis with decreased melanin production. Several nonspecific histopathologic features have been described. These include hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, acanthosis, spongiosis, and perivascular infiltrates. Although there are no specific diagnostic criteria, certain features in a biopsy specimen taken from a characteristic skin lesion are suggestive of the diagnosis. These include irregular or markedly reduced melanin in the basal layer, no significant decrease in melanocyte count, and reduced number of active melanocytes with a decreased number and size of melanosomes.
