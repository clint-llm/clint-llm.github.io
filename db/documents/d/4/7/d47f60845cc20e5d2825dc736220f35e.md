The early and less frequent adverse effects of ILE include allergic reaction, dyspnea, hyperlipidemia, hypercoagulability, and irritation. The delayed and less frequent adverse effects of ILE include transient elevation of liver function test values, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and thrombocytopenia.

As parenteral nutrition, adverse reactions of lipid emulsion treatment are infection, hyperlipidemia, acute pancreatitis, decreased immune response, interference with laboratory examinations using serum, and parenteral nutrition-associated hepatic diseases. In addition, hyperlipidemia and infection can be associated with impaired reticuloendothelial function, leading to impaired pulmonary gas exchange. However, the adverse effects induced by lipid emulsion infusion are mild and transient for a short-term infusion compared with the fatal complications, such as cardiovascular depression and cardiac arrest, induced by toxic doses of local anesthetic, which require immediate lipid emulsion treatment.

The complications are minor and few within the recommended doses of 12 mL/kg, and early administration of ILE therapy for LAST is encouraged.
