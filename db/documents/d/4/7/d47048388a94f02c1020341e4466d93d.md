- Ear BT occurs due to inadequate pressure equalization between the middle ear spaceÂ and the external environment.

- ETD and MEBT are the most common complication of diving and clinical HBOT.

- MEBT is commonly treated conservatively by the hyperbaric, emergency, or family practice team and often resolves without the requirement of further interventions.

- Any patient suspected of IEBT should be assessed and managed by otolaryngology.

- Significant BT may be associated with permanent complications such as hearing and balance deficits; thus it is important that clinicians, divers, and patients understand how to prevent BT.

- A patient with ear BT should not be exposed to a hyperbaric environment until symptoms have resolved and the otoscopic exam has normalized.

- There is no reliable tool to predict the development of ear BT.
