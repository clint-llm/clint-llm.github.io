Diagnosis of PTX keratoconjunctivitis has no confirmatory study or imaging and is a clinical diagnosis based on symptomatology with a clear history of preceding exposure to water likely containing PTX. Though the compound has been isolated through high-performance liquid chromatography in some public health cases, at present, there is no qualitative or quantitative test for human toxicity (i.e., PTX is not isolated in the patient for diagnosis).

In one case, the pH of the affected eye was elevated (8.5 OD and 7.5 OS), which decreased to 7.5 and 7.0 after rinsing with an aqueous solution containing amphoteric salts

Due to possible systemic effects from ocular inoculation, and the potential for lethality with systemic exposure, additional testing should be considered in patients complaining of a bitter or metallic taste, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramping, or shortness of breath. These may include an electrocardiogram and respiratory monitoring. One patient demonstrated elevated creatine kinase and a myoglobin positive urine sample indicative of possible rhabdomyolysis.
