Prognosis and risks are associated with various individual, family, social, environmental, and peer factors. According to DSM-5, genetic factors also play a crucial role directly and indirectly. Opioid users who have a strong support system, good impulse control, and are genetically favored are likely to have a better prognosis. Furthermore, patients whoÂ are likely to follow up with their outpatient care with a psychiatrist and/or detoxification program are also likely to have a favorable prognosis.
