Amphetamine is FDA-approved for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It has indications as a first-line agent for ADHD in adults and children six years of age and older. Amphetamine is also a second-line agent for the treatment of narcolepsy. Lisdexamfetamine, a long-acting amphetamine medication, is FDA-approved for the treatment of a binge-eating disorder.

The amphetamine molecule contains one chiral center and exists as two enantiomers: dextroamphetamine (d-amphetamine) and levoamphetamine (l-amphetamine). The term “amphetamine” properly refers to a racemic mixture of equal parts d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine. However, most currently used amphetamine medications contain the d-isomer predominantly or exclusively as it is more potent and more clinically effective than the l-isomer.

Common amphetamine medications that are currently in use in the United States include

- Dextroamphetamine/amphetamine, a 3 to 1 mixture of d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine salts, otherwise known as mixed amphetamine salts (MAS)

- Dextroamphetamine, a drug containing none of the l-isomer

- Lisdexamfetamine, an inactive prodrug that is converted into d-amphetamine in the bloodstream

Amphetamines are controlled substances in the USA with the C-II designation.
