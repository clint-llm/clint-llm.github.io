Given the risk for complications, patients should be educated regarding the signs and symptoms of hand infections and be encouraged to acquire an evaluation from a physician in the setting of any concerning findings. Prompt recognition and treatment of infections can prevent the progression of a more minor infection into one that requires surgical management. If appropriate, counseling for appropriate wound care, soaking, and dressings should be given once they are initiated.
