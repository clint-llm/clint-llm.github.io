Most ant bites require supportive care, so treatment is aimed at preventing secondary bacterial infections if a pustule is disrupted. The use of topical hydrocortisone or antihistamine cream is usually all that is needed. The sterile pustules should be left alone, however, if they are broken then they need to be cleaned with soap and water and an antibiotic cream placed on top. If the broken lesion gets infected, then a proper antimicrobial can be used. Those with large local reactions will benefit from a single dose of 20 mg prednisone. Localized pain and swelling may be improved with cold compresses. Anaphylactic reactions are treated the same as any other anaphylaxis, using epinephrine first followed by steroids, antihistamine, and H2 blocker. Fluid resuscitation and oxygen therapy should be included as part of supportive treatments.
