The systems paradigm of medical error, best described by James Reason, holds that healthcare is an inherently human process. As humans are subject to make mistakes, there should be an expectation of errors within any system.  A more reliable strategy to make the system more durable to potential error is to account for the underlying fallibility of humans. Reason states, “we cannot change the human condition; we can change the conditions under which humans work.”

As may be apparent by the name, "in situ simulation" is simulation-based learning that occurs within the actual care setting as opposed to a designated multi-purpose simulation center. In situ simulation often involves an interprofessional team of practitioners on-duty and has the benefit of offering learners the opportunity to contextualize the actual process of work within their normal workflow and physical plant.
