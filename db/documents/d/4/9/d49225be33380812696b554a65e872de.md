The development of decubitus ulcers is complex and multifactorial. Loss of sensory perception, locally and general impaired loss of consciousness, along with decreased mobility, are the most important causes that aid in the formation of these ulcers because patients are not aware of discomfort and hence do not relieve the pressure.

Immobility of as little as two hours in a bedridden patient or patient undergoing surgery is sufficient to create the basis of a decubitus ulcer.

The dysfunction of nervous regulatory mechanisms responsible for the regulation of local blood flow is somewhat culpable in the formation of these ulcers.

Patients with the following conditions exhibit a predisposition to decubitus ulcers:

- Neurologic disease

- Cardiovascular disease

- Prolonged anesthesia

- Dehydration

- Malnutrition

- Hypotension

- Surgical patients
