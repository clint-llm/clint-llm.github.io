The approach to typhoid patients should be clinical. Patients residing in areas with poor sanitation or impure drinking water or history of travel from endemic areas presenting with febrile illness for more than three days along with gastrointestinal manifestations (pain, constipation, or diarrhea) are highly suspicious. Diagnosis in the first week is difficult, but a variety of laboratory studies assist in making the diagnosis.

**Blood culture:**Blood culture remains the primary mechanism of confirmation of a typhoid fever diagnosis. It is widely available and the most commonly performed test, as it is not expensive or technically difficult. The efficacy of the blood culture is increased when high volume samples are taken. Blood cultures done during secondary bacteremia (i.e., clinical manifestations) are more reliable though 30% to 50% of cultures may be falsely negative depending on the technique and time series.

**Stool culture:**Stool culture is less effective in the bacteremic phase of the disease. Stool culture is diagnostic in the second and third weeks. It was estimated to yield a positive result in only 37% of patients with antibiotic therapy.

**Bone marrow:**Bone marrow culture is the gold standardÂ for typhoid diagnosis.

**Widal test:**The Widal test****is a serological test for enteric fever, which detects antibodies against O (surface) and H (flagellar) antigens. An antibody titer of greater than 1:160 and greater than 1:80 for anti-H antigen and anti-O antigen respectively are considered as cut off levels to predict recent infection of typhoid fever in an endemic area.

**Skin snip test:**Punch biopsies from characteristic rose spots may culture positive in up to 63% of the positive cases with prior therapeutic antibiotic treatment.

**Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Assay:**Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) can provide DNA-based gene identification of several serotypes such as the H antigen gene and O antigen gene.

**Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA):**ELISA identifies antibodies to the capsular polysaccharide Vi antigens that may be helpful in identifying carriers but is rarely useful in acute illness.

**Miscellaneous:**Urine cultures and duodenal content culture via string capsule are not regularly performed, but may identifySalmonella typhi. Leukopenia and neutropenia are detectable in 15% to 25% of cases though leukocytosis can be seen as well, particularly in children. Liver function testing may show a pattern of viral hepatitis, and though nonspecific C-reactive protein may be elevated. When obtained, cerebrospinal fluid studies may reveal mild pleocytosis (less than 35cells), though most are unremarkable.
