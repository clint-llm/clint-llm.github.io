Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157: H7, is an enterohemorrhagic bacterial strain that is an important food and a waterborne pathogen that causes diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans. Transmission is via the fecal-oral route after consumption of contaminated, undercooked liquids, foods, and by person-to-person through fecal shedding. The production of Shiga toxins is a key factor contributing to the development of a range of gastrointestinal illnesses, from watery diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis and HUS. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of E.coli O157: H7 infection and highlights the role of the healthcare team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summerize the epidemiology of Escherichia coli O157: H7 infection.
- Review the pathophysiology of Escherichia coli O157: H7 infection.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for Escherichia coli O157: H7 infection.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome as a complication of Escherichia coli O157: H7 infection.
