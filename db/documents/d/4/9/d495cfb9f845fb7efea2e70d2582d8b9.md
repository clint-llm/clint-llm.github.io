As mentioned earlier, chondrocytes maintain homeostasis between the creation and destruction of extracellular matrix components. Chondrocytes, influenced by external stimuli, polypeptide growth factors, and cytokines, create such components and the enzymes which break them down.

An increased anabolic and catabolic activity mark a patient with osteoarthritic cartilage. Compensatory mechanisms such as increased production of matrix molecules (collagen, hyaluronate, and proteoglycans) and the spread of chondrocytes in deep chondral layers manage the integrity of the articular cartilage. Chondrocyte loss, however, along with transformations in the extracellular matrix predominates, causing osteoarthritic conditions.

Thinning cartilage, degrading cartilage thickness, and fibrillation of superficial layers are all caused by the initial degradations. These changes get worst over time, and articular cartilage (AC) thins to the point of complete destruction. This condition exposes the underlying subchondral bone plate and characterizes these changes as chondropathy.
