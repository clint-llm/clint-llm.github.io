The interaction between the epithelium and the mesenchyme regulates transcription factors and signaling molecules necessary for developing the Müllerian ducts. Some transcription factors likely part of this human developmental process include EMX2, HOXA13, PAX2, LIM1, and WNT.
Lim1(Lhx1) and Pax2 are essential in specifying the Müllerian duct precursor cells in mouse studies. Specifically, Lim1 is necessary for forming the Müllerian duct epithelium, and without Lim1, agenesis of the Müllerian ducts occurs in mice. Also, from mouse studies, loss of Pax2 results in the absence of the kidneys and agenesis of the reproductive tract due to the loss of the Wolffian and Müllerian ducts. In studies of chickens, Bmp/PAX2 and Fdf/LIM1 signaling regulate the initiation phase of Müllerian duct formation and are also necessary for specification.

Bmp signaling occurs in the cranial mesonephros and begins the expression of PAX2 in the Müllerian duct mesenchyme. It appears that cells with PAX2 are pre-specified Müllerian duct precursor cells. Emx2 appears necessary for the formation of the Müllerian and Wolffian ducts in mouse studies.

WNT and HOX gene expression appear to be crucial for the development of the Müllerian ducts in humans. Animal studies have shown that a lack of Wnt7a leads to abnormal female reproductive tracts, as it is required for sexual dimorphic differentiation. Typical findings of Wnt7a dysfunction in animal studies include the development of a small, thin uterus that lacks typical uterine glands. In addition, the function of Wnt7a during embryonic development of the Müllerian ducts is to maintain the expression of Hoxa10 and Hoxa11. The expression of these two genes is critical for developing the Müllerian ducts in animal studies. Hoxa10 also contributes to the development of the Müllerian ducts as it determines the borders of tissues of the reproductive tract. Differentiation of the Müllerian ducts into structures of the female genitalia is also regulated by Hoxa genes in animal studies, specifically Hoxa9, Hoxa10, Hoxa11, and Hoxa13. Wnt4 and Wnt5a have also shown importance to the Müllerian ducts during later development. Moreover, the absence of Wnt4 causes abnormal uterine morphology, while the absence of Wnt5a causes disruptions in the differential of the Müllerian Ducts caudally.

The precursor cells of the Müllerian ducts express Lim1, a homeodomain transcription factor. Lim1 is essential for the formation and maintenance of the female reproductive tract. Missense mutations of Lim1 have been shown to result in agenesis of the Müllerian ducts in mouse studies. More recent specific studies have indicated that Lim1 is essential for elongating the Müllerian ducts, and loss of this gene leads to shortened fallopian tubes, aplasia of the uterus, and infertility.

The influence of Wolffian ducts significantly affects the later stage of development of the Müllerian ducts. The association of these two structures is required for the correct elongation of the Müllerian ducts, while specification and invagination are independent of these structures. The influence of the Wolffian ducts contributes to the elongation of the Müllerian ducts. This process occurs through the secretion of a local signaling molecule that induces Müllerian duct cell proliferation. WNT9B in humans is a Wolffian duct-derived factor considered necessary for the elongation of the Müllerian ducts. Further, researchers have observed the Müllerian duct to elongate through the proliferation and active migration of the Müllerian duct epithelium. These proliferating cells are located at the tip of the theMüllerian duct epithelium and have a high proliferation index. This elongation uses the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway, which is typically activated by tyrosine-kinase receptors.
