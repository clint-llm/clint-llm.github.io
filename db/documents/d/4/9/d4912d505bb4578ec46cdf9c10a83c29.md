Establishing the etiology of a patient's hypovolemia is of utmost importance to properly tailor management. Hypovolemia usually is the result of a primary disorder and clinical manifestations are closely related to the primary cause. Symptoms are usually non-specific and include weakness, fatigue, dizziness, muscle cramps, and thirst. Physical examination findings are dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, orthostatic tachycardia, and hypotension. Vital signs consistent with hypovolemia are hypotension and tachycardia. There is a risk of the patient's hypovolemia evolving into shock which would present with peripheral vasoconstriction, cyanosis, oliguria, and altered mental status.
