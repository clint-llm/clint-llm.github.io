The vagina is a female reproductive organ that changes over the lifespan of a woman. It serves a multitude of functions in response to hormonal changes as appreciated during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause. The vagina plays a vital role in the female reproductive system and female sexual pleasure.

**Anatomic Overview**

The vagina is an elastic muscular tube of 7 to 10 cm in length that extends from the vulva (female external genitalia) to the cervix of the uterus where it ends in an anterior and posterior fornix. The vaginal canal is positioned between the urethra and bladder anteriorly, and the rectum posteriorly. The vaginal opening is in the posterior portion of the vulvar vestibule, behind the urethral opening. It is surrounded on either side by the labia minora medially and labia majora laterally. A thin perforated layer of hymen partially forms the entrance of the vaginal opening. The vaginal canal has an outer fibrous adventitia, a middle layer of smooth muscle cells, and an inner layer of mucosa. The inner mucosal membrane has transverse folds called rugae, which can be appreciated grossly.
