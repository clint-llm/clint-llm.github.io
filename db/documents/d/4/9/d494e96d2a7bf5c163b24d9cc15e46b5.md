Anticholinesterases antagonize neuromuscular blockade action; therefore, the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine is useful to reverse rocuronium and vecuronium's effect on muscle paralysis. Anticholinergic agents such as glycopyrrolate are necessary to offset the bradycardic effects seen with anticholinesterase drugs. Furthermore, in bradycardic patients, the anticholinergic drug may be given first.

Sugammadex is a new selective relaxant-binding agent that forms a complex with vecuronium and rocuronium, reducing the amount of drug available to bind to nicotinic cholinergic receptors. Decreasing the amount of drug available at the neuromuscular junction successfully reverses muscle paralysis. Although vecuronium has more than five times the potency of rocuronium, studies have shown that the use of sugammadex results in significantly faster recovery from vecuronium-induced muscle paralysis when compared to neostigmine.

Vecuronium is a pregnancy category C drug. It is unknown if it is excreted in breast milk, and its effect on a nursing infant is unknown.
