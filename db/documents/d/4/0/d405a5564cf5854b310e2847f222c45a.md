Most patients with sliding hernias (type 1) are generally asymptomatic. However if symptoms are present, they are usually nonspecific and consist of epigastric abdominal pain, fullness, and usually, have a history of GERD. As mentioned earlier, this is a consequence of the inadequate length of the intraabdominal esophagus leading to reflux of gastric contents. Patients with PEHs can develop symptoms of obstruction. If the obstruction occurs at the level of the GE junction, then dysphagia is the most common symptom. If any contents remain in the distal esophagus, then regurgitation will occur. However, if the distal stomach becomes obstructed, the resulting proximal gastric distention will lead to nausea and vomiting and in some cases chest pain that radiates to the back. Patients that develop Cameron ulcers can show signs and symptoms of anemia such as pallor and fatigue if there is ongoing occult blood loss.
