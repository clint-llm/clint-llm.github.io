The prevalence of hypercalcemia in the general population is approximately 1% to 2%. Most of the cases (90%) of hypercalcemia are due to primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy-associated hypercalcemia. The prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism in the general population ranges from 0.2% to 0.8% and increases with age. Overall, 2% of all cancers are associated with hypercalcemia, but in the pediatric age group, the prevalence is about 0.4% to 1.3%.
