Patients with precocious puberty may encounter different complications, depending on the primary diagnosis:

- Short stature patients with precocious puberty initially have a growth spurt in adolescence due to rapid linear growth. However, if left untreated, this is followed by premature fusion of the epiphyseal plates, which leads to short stature in adulthood.

- Early development of breasts in girls and increased libido in boys can cause significant emotional distress.

- The changes associated with puberty may lead to long term psychosocial stress, behavioral issues, and psychiatric problems such as depression.

- Contrasexual precocious puberty in girls caused by excess androgens can lead to virilization in the form of clitoromegaly, which may require genital reconstructive surgery.

- Patients with McCune Albright syndrome can develop musculoskeletal complications (bone pain, deformities, pathological fractures, gait abnormalities) and endocrinopathies (acromegaly, hyperthyroidism, Cushing syndrome). They are also at risk of developing arrhythmias, intestinal polyps, and malignancies.

- Patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia may suffer from suboptimal fertility. They can also develop complications due to chronic glucocorticoid therapy, e.g., cushingoid features, poor growth, osteoporosis, secondary diabetes, and adrenal suppression. Women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia have a higher risk of requiring cesarian delivery due to underlying cephalopelvic disproportion.
