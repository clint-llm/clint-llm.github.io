Patients presenting with Jessner lymphocytic infiltration of the skin (JLIS) commonly report asymptomatic, non-scaly, erythematous solitary or numerous plaques or papules in sun-exposed areas (face, neck, and trunk)

On physical examination, the lesions are well-demarcated and can appear annular or seen to be expanding peripherally. The surface of the lesions is non-scaly without evidence of follicular plugging or atrophy. The lesions are arranged in crescents of rings ranging from 2 mm to 2 cm in diameter. A thorough skin examination should be performed as patients can have multiple lesions. The most frequent areas of occurrence are the malar area of the face and the upper back. However, lesions can be found in any area, including the forehead, neck, mastoid region, arms, legs, and trunk.
