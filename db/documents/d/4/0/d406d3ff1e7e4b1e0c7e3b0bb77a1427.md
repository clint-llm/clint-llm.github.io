Traditionally, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been the primary method of treating high-grade asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. A carotid endarterectomy involves exposure of the carotid artery and removal of plaque, most typically from the carotid bulb and the proximal internal carotid artery, via a neck incision. However, in vascular surgery, as in many other surgical specialties, minimally invasive techniques have evolved over the years. These techniques offer the advantages of smaller incisions, reduced postoperative pain, reduced potential for postoperative wound complications, and a shorter length of stay in the hospital. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is one such technique, which can be performed via a transfemoral approach or a transcarotid approach.
