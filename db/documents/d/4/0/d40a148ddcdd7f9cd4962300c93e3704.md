**Fundamental Properties of Alginates**

**Biocompatibility**

Various forms of alginate are approved by the FDA for use primarily as a thickening agent, and alginate is widely known to be biocompatible and biodegradable.

**Permeability**

Alginates are hydrophilic by nature, and crosslinked hydrogels contain a significant aqueous component. Due to the structural chemistry of alginate scaffolds, water and other small molecules diffuse freely throughout the hydrogel. Because of this, many therapeutic compounds diffuse out of alginate hydrogels at predictable and consistent rates, making them useful biomaterial carriers in drug delivery.vivoÂ conditions.

**Variability**

Alginates crosslink to form hydrogels under a generally flexible set of conditions, which allows for significant variability in the composition and characteristics of the resultant biomaterial. A wide variety of compounds can be combined with alginates without disrupting their ability to crosslink, including therapeutic molecules, extracellular matrix components, and other biomaterials like chitosan. Various crosslinking agents and methods can be employed to generate hydrogels with a range of stiffness and degradative characteristics. This compositional flexibility allows alginate to act as a versatile, modifiable, biologically compatible biomaterial construct.
