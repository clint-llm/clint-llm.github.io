Differential diagnoses of meningioma include those lesions which are dural-based, have a dural tail, and have a homogenous enhancement.

**Central Nervous System Solitary Fibrous Tumors**

They originate from the dural mesenchyme and can occur in any organ and at any age. They consist of spindle cells, collagen bands, and vascular channels, and most cells express CD34 on their membranes. On brain MRI, they mostly appear as well-circumscribed extra-axial dural-based lesions. On the head CT scan, they mostly appear as calcified hyperdense lesions.

**Intracranial Hemangiopericytoma**

One of the most aggressive tumors with high rates of recurrence and metastasis. They originate from the pericytes of the meninges and can occur at a young age. They mainly consist of angular pericytes and vascular channels with high cellularity, known as staghorn vascularity. On brain MRI, they mostly appear as heterogenous, isointense lesions with a narrow or broad-based dural enhancement that could show a dural tail sign. On head CT scans, they appear as dural-based, hyperdense lesions with heterogeneous enhancement. These tumors are not commonly associated with calcifications.

**Gliosarcoma**

It is one of the rarest tumors, mostly composed of anaplastic astrocytes or glial cells with sarcomatous elements. These tumors can metastasize and are usually considered to be a variant of glioblastoma multiform. On brain MRI, they typically appear as well-defined cystic or inhomogeneous lesions with vasogenic edema. On the head CT scan, they appear as isodense or hyperdense lesions with a ring or heterogenous enhancement usually located at the periphery.

**Leiomyosarcoma**

This is one of the rarest central nervous system tumors usually seen in immunocompromised individuals, such as patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.

**Dural Metastatic Tumors**

Most common metastatic tumors arise from the breast, prostate, lung adenocarcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. On brain MRI, they can appear as heterogeneous lesions with a dural tail sign.

**Intracranial Hodgkin Lymphoma**

This tumor can spread to the scalp, epidural space, and subcutaneous tissue. It can involve the skull bones but is usually seen at the late stage of the disease. It is described on a head CT scan as a hyperdense lesion. The bone window setting can view the presence of bone destruction or lytic lesions. On brain MRI with contrast, these tumors appear as homogenous dense lesions with dural tail enhancement and white matter edema.

**Plasmacytoma**

One of the extra-axial tumors that usually arise from the plasma cells and can be seen in patients with multiple myeloma. These tumors on head CT scan often appear as dense lesions. On contrast-enhanced brain MRI, they appear as intense homogeneous lesions with an enhanced dural tail sign.

**Rosai-Dorfman Disease or Sinus Histiocytosis**

A benign disease that originates from the proliferation of histocytes in the lymph nodes. Usually, the central nervous system Rosai-Dorfman disease affects the leptomeninges. On contrast-enhanced head CT scans or brain MRIs, they are described as homogenous, meningeal-based, extra-axial lesions occasionally associated with vasogenic edema.

**Neurosarcoidosis**

The incidence of neurosarcoidosis in patients with systemic sarcoidosis is approximately 5%. These tumors are dural-based lesions characterized by the presence of epithelioid granuloma. On contrast-enhanced brain MRI, they appear as enhanced homogenous parenchymal masses with leptomeningeal or cranial nerve involvement and vasogenic edema.

**Melanocytic Tumors**

They can be classified into malignant or benign lesions. They often have a leptomeningeal involvement and can be found in the posterior fossa or the spinal cord. On contrast-enhanced head CT scans, they appear as well-defined, extra-axial homogenously enhanced tumors.

**Plasma Cell Granuloma**

They are described as an inflammatory pseudotumor, with the cause of it still unknown. It might originate from the dura or the leptomeninges. On contrast-enhanced head CT scans, these tumors appear as markedly well-defined enhanced lesions. On brain MRI with contrast, they appear as heterogeneous enhanced lesions with or without parenchymal involvement. On T2 weighted imaging, they show low signal intensity, whereas, on T1, they show high signal intensity.
