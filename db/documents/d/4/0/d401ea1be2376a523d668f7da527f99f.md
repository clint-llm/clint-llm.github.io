Using previous trials like HAVEN, an efficacious range for emicizumab is 30Â to 70 microgram/milliliter.

Management of breakthrough bleeding is a potent concern.

**Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:**Studies in animals investigating the carcinogenic effects of emicizumab have not been conducted. However, emicizumab did not cause any toxicological changes in the reproductive organs in preclinical studies, with the dose of 30 mg/kg/week in subcutaneous toxicity studies of twenty-six weeks duration and a dose of 100 mg/kg/week for four-week intravenous toxicity study.
