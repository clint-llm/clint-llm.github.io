The Human Herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), also called Kaposi sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV), belongs to the family of DNA viruses Herpeseviridae. It causes Kaposi sarcoma (a vascular malignancy) and B cell lymphoproliferative diseases such as primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman disease (MCD). The likelihood of HHV-8-associated malignancies is significantly higher amongst individuals living with HIV. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of abdominal human herpesvirus-8 and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the disease conditions caused by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8).
- Describe the epidemiology of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8).
- Summarize the life cycle of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8).
- Explain the current treatment options for Kaposi sarcoma by an interprofessional team.
