The majority of the subthalamic nucleus receives its blood supply from the posteromedial branches of the posterior cerebral artery (P1 segment). The lateral portions of the subthalamic nucleus can receive vascular supply from the lenticulostriate arteries of the middle cerebral artery. The CNS lymphatic system is still poorly understood but contains lymphatic drainage within the meninges.
