The limb bud first appears in the proximal fetus around the fifth week of development. From this point, various HOX genes govern the growth of the limb. The stylopod, zeugopod, and autopod are the three growth zones of the limb bud corresponding to the humerus, ulna and radius, and the hand, respectively. Ectoderm differentiates into the apical ectodermal ridge, nonridge ectoderm, and zone of polarizing activity.  These zones carry essential roles in differentiation. For example, removal of the apical ectodermal ridge early in limb development will result in the presence of only stylopod development. Removal of the apical ectodermal ridge later in development will result in the development of the stylopod and zeugopod, but no autopod, leading to the fetus not developing a hand.

The HOXA and HOXD genes are responsible for the embryologic development of the hand in humans. HOXA is responsible for anteroposterior growth, while HOXD is responsible for proximodistal growth.

Research has demonstrated that the metacarpal bone length can contribute to the estimation of fetal development during the prenatal period, and this may help to evaluate any anomalies. Utilizing this in combination with foot lengths and other accepted estimates of development can provide a more comprehensive picture.

Due to the complexity of the structure of the hand, a myriad of morphologic anomalies may occur during development.
