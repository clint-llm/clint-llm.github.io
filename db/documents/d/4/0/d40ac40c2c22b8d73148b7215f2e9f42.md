Complete surgical excision is the most definitive therapy to align with the reported recurrence-free survival rates. Lobectomy has been the most followed approach, although, in clinical practice, patients with limited lung functions or multifocal synchronous disease pose a challengeÂ at times. Therefore, limited resection by segmentectomy or sublobar resection has been considered under less than ideal circumstances for lobectomy.

Radiologic pure solid adenocarcinoma is found to have intraoperative nodal involvement in 15% to 20% of cases and is not considered ideal candidates for sublobar resection. Hattori et al. retrospectively reviewed 200 radiologic stage 1a lung adenocarcinoma cases to identify clinical factors associated with histologic lepidic predominant adenocarcinomas. They found that SUV max level of less than 3.3 in PET scan correlated well with lepidic predominant growth even in pure solid stage 1a adenocarcinomas. Therefore, it opens up the scope for sublobar resection in the subgroup that would not tolerate lobectomy otherwise.
