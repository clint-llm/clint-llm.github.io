Regular follow-up and visual testing after high-risk ocular surgeries would lead to better outcomes. A diagnosis of infectious scleritis may be missed due to similarities with autoimmune scleritis. The health care team should document any unexpected or worsening of the clinical picture after ocular surgeries and refer immediately to the attending ophthalmologist or surgeon for immediate evaluation and further treatment.
