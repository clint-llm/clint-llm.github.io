Etiology is most commonly viral, with some cases caused by bacteria.

**Viral**

- Parainfluenza virus most commonly causes viral croup or acute laryngotracheitis, primarily types 1 and 2.

- Other causes include influenza A and B, measles, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

- Spasmodic croup is caused by viruses thatÂ also cause acute laryngotracheitis, but lack signs of infection.

**Bacterial**

- Bacterial croup is divided into laryngeal diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis.

- Laryngeal diphtheria is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis typically begin as viral infections, which worsen due to secondary bacterial growth.

- The common bacterial causes are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.
