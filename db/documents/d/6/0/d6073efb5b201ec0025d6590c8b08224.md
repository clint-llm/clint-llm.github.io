The indication for the use of an alpha-adrenergic receptor modifying medication depends on which receptor is the target: the alpha-1 receptor or the alpha-2 receptor. Alpha-1 receptors bind catecholamines including, both epinephrine and norepinephrine. In instances in which there is hypoperfusion secondary to decreased cardiac output or decreased systemic vasculature resistance, alpha-1 receptors become stimulated.  It is worth noting that these compounds are not purely selective for the alpha receptor, and often engage beta-adrenergic receptors as well. The use of alpha-1 agonists is common in all types of shock, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and heart failure decompensation.

Alpha-blockers have significant use in the setting of pre-operative pheochromocytoma care.
