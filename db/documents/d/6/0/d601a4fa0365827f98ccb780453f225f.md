Prolactin is responsible for the synthesis and secretion of milk. Prolactin is secreted by the lactotroph cells in the anterior pituitary. Dopamine secreted from the hypothalamus inhibits the secretion of prolactin. TRH and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide can stimulate prolactin secretion. Also, nipple stimulation, renal failure, chest wall lesions, and medications can cause hyperprolactinemia.

Estrogens cause hyperprolactinemia by inhibiting hypothalamic dopamine as well as stimulating lactotrophs directly. In pregnancy, the high levels of estrogen cause lactotroph hyperplasia and can even result in the growth of a preexisting prolactinoma. Excess secretion of estrogen from ovaries in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome has also been associated with hyperprolactinemia.
