Many testing options are available for the various developmental anomalies in utero. Antenatal ultrasound can detect polyhydramnios, an excess of amniotic fluid commonly associated with intestinal atresia. The "double-bubble" sign found on prenatal ultrasound gives specific evidence toward diagnosing duodenal atresia, which may be in the organ's foregut- or midgut-derived segment. This ultrasonographic sign is from discontinuous segments of the bowel due to the abnormal development of the intestine. Atresia in more distal parts of the midgut is diagnosable with fetal MRI.

Ultrasound is also the testing modality of choice for diagnosing gastroschisis and omphalocele, both conditions involving extraperitoneal abdominal organs. Ultrasound has proven very efficient in finding most omphaloceles within the first trimester. Prenatal serum studies in the mother will also show increased serum alpha-fetoprotein.
