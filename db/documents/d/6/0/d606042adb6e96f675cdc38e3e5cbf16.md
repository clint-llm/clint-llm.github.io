Nicotine is metabolized to cotinine and then to trans-3'-hydroxycotinine or nornicotine and other chemicals such as anabasine. Both of these metabolites can be detected in urine and blood. With a long half-life of 16 hours. These tests can be used to test compliance with withdrawal therapy or nicotine toxicity. Another method to assess nicotine is COa level. This method is related to cotinine. Some questionnaires can measure nicotine dependence such as the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence and Motives, and Smokeless Tobacco Dependence Scale.
