Venlafaxine is prescribed only for those 18 years and older and should not be used in children under 18. Venlafaxine should be taken with food, and patients should not take it with alcohol as combining alcohol and venlafaxine can lead to increased sedation.

Venlafaxine comes in an oral tablet and an oral capsule.Â The oral tablets come in immediate-release (25 mg, 37.5 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) and extended-release forms (37.5 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, and 225 mg.) The immediate-release tablet can be cut or crushed, but the extended-release tablet may not be. Treatment for depression for the immediate release oral table typically starts at 75 mg total per day, given in two or three divided doses.
