**Plain Radiographs**

Weight-bearing lateral radiographs of the feet are often sufficient for diagnosis. Simulated weight-bearing radiographs should be obtained if a patient can not bear weight. Additional radiographic views to assess for coalition can also be obtained as indicated.

On lateral weight-bearing radiographs, the following findings are often noted:

- A Meary's angle greater than 4 degrees convex downward suggests pes planus. This angle is also called the talus-first metatarsal angle and constitutes the angle obtained from lines drawn from the center longitudinal axes of the talus and metatarsal.

- A calcaneal inclination angle less than 18 degrees is indicative of pes planes. This angle is obtained from the calcaneal inclination axis and the horizontal surface on which the foot is placed.

**MRI**

MRI can be performed if posterior tibial tendon dysfunction or injury to the spring ligament or other supporting soft tissue structures is suspected.

**EMG/NCS**

EMG and nerve conduction studies can be performed to evaluate for sensory neuropathy.
