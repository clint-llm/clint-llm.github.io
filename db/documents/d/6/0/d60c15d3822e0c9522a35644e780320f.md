Cutaneous tuberculosis may present to the nurse practitioner or primary care provider. Since the skin features are not always obvious, the patient should be referred to an infectious disease consult, dermatologist or an internist. The management of cutaneous tuberculosis is the same as treatment of systemic tuberculosis. It also involves multidrug treatment. The drugs that are most commonly used are isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol or streptomycin. The treatment consists of 2 phases.

- An intensive phase that involves rapidly decreasing the burden of M. tuberculosis

- A continuation phase that is also called the sterilizing phase

Results of treatment depend on the immunity of a patient, their overall health, the stage of the disease, the type of cutaneous lesions, the patient’s compliance, duration of treatment, and any side effects experienced.
