Most cases ofÂ progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occur as a reactivation of latent JC virus infection. PML is symptomatic in patients who are severely immunocompromised, such as HIV-AIDS patients, particularly those with a CD4 count of less than 200, organ transplant recipients, those with hematological malignancies, and of late those who undergo treatment with monoclonal antibodies such as natalizumab. After the initiation of antiretroviral therapy, in contrast to the expected decline in the incidence of PML, a rise and a deterioration in existing cases have been noticed secondary to immune reconstitution after antiretroviral treatment.
