In most primates, nails are unique features consisting of compact, translucent, keratinized cells. They protect the distal dorsal area of digits and participate in multiple functions, including grip, fine motor movements, and scratching.

Nail abnormalities can result from local nail pathology or manifest underlying systemic disease.
