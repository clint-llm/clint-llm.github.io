Phalanx fractures displace according to the level at which the fracture occurs due to the eloquent soft tissue and tendon involvement of the phalanx.

**Distal Phalanx**

Distal phalanx fractures are usually nondisplaced or comminuted fractures. They classify into tuft (tip), shaft, or articular injuries.

- Tuft fractures usually result from a crushing mechanism such as hitting the tip of a finger with a hammer. A tuft fracture is frequently an open fracture due to its common association with injury to the surrounding soft tissues or nail bed. Even without surrounding soft tissue injury, the fracture is considered open in the presence of a nail bed injury.

- Shaft fractures

- Intra-articular fractures are associated with extensor tendon avulsion (Mallet finger) or flexor digitorum profundus tendon avulsion (Jersey finger).
- Mallet finger

- The traumatic loss of the terminal extension at the level of the DIPJ


- Jersey Finger

- Hyperextension injury with avulsion of flexor digitorum profundus

- Seymour fractures: this is a displaced epiphyseal injury of the distal phalanx associated with nail bed injury. Hyperflexion is usually the mechanism of injury and it presents as a mallet deformity with apex dorsal.

**Middle Phalanx**

Middle phalanx fractures occur in an apex dorsal or volar angulation depending on location. Apex dorsal angulation results from the fracture occurring proximal to the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) insertion so that the fragment becomes displaced by the pull of the central slip. Apex volar angulation occurs if the fracture is distal to the flexor digitorum superficialis insertion. A fracture through the middle third may angulate in either direction or not at all as a result of the inherent stability provided by an intact and prolonged flexor digitorum superficialis insertion.******Proximal Phalanx**

Proximal phalanx fractures occur in an apex volar angulation (dorsal angulation). The proximal fragment flexes due to interossei, and the distal phalanx extends due to the central slip.
