The neck muscles can be largely sub-categorized into anterior, lateral (prevertebral), and posterior neck muscles. Listed below are the sub-categories and the action of each muscle in neck movement.

**Anterior Neck Muscles**

**Superficial Muscles**

- Platysma: depression of mandible and angle of the mouth, the tension of skin of the lower face and anterior neck

- Sternocleidomastoid: head and neck extension at the atlanto-occipital joint and superior cervical spine; neck flexion at the inferior cervical vertebrae;  elevation of the clavicle and sternal manubrium at the sternoclavicular joint; ipsilateral flexion and contralateral rotation of the neck at the cervical spine

- Subclavius: anchoring and depression of the clavicle at the sternoclavicular joint

**Suprahyoid Muscles**

- Digastric: depression of the mandible, elevation of the hyoid bone during swallowing and speaking

- Mylohyoid: the muscular floor of the oral cavity, elevation of the hyoid bone and floor of the mouth, depression of the mandible

- Geniohyoid: elevation and drawing of hyoid bone anteriorly

- Stylohyoid: elevation and drawing of hyoid bone posteriorly

**Infrahyoid Muscles**

- Sternohyoid: depression of the larynx

- Sternothyroid: depression of the larynx

- Thyrohyoid: depression of hyoid bone, elevation of the larynx

- Omohyoid: depression of the hyoid bone

**Scalene Muscles**

- Anterior: neck flexion, lateral flexion of the neck (ipsilateral), neck rotation (contralateral), elevation of the first rib

- Middle: lateral flexion of the neck, elevation of the second rib

- Posterior: lateral flexion of the neck, elevation of the second rib

**Lateral Neck Muscles**

- Rectus capitis anterior: head flexion at the atlanto-occipital join

- Rectus capitis lateralis: lateral head flexion (ipsilateral) at the atlanto-occipital joint

- Longus capitis: head flexion by bilateral contraction, ipsilateral head rotation by unilateral contraction

- Longus colli: neck flexion and lateral neck flexion (ipsilateral) by bilateral contraction, contralateral rotation of the neck by unilateral neck contraction

**Posterior Neck Muscles**

**Superficial Muscles**

- Splenius capitis: extension of head and neck by bilateral contraction, ipsilateral lateral flexion and rotation of the head by unilateral contraction

- Splenius cervicis: extension of the neck by bilateral contraction, ipsilateral lateral flexion and rotation of the neck by unilateral contraction

**Suboccipital Muscles**

- Rectus capitis posterior major, rectus capitis posterior minor, obliquus capitis superior, and obliquus capitis inferior: all result in the same action - head extension at the atlanto-occipital joint by bilateral contraction, ipsilateral head rotation at the atlantoaxial joint by unilateral contraction

**Transversospinalis Muscles**

- Semispinalis capitis and cervicis: extension of the head, cervical, and thoracic spine by bilateral contraction; ipsilateral lateral flexion of the head, cervical, and thoracic spine by unilateral contraction; contralateral rotation of the head, cervical, and thoracic spine by unilateral contraction

- Rotatores cervicis: extension of the spine by bilateral contraction, lateral flexion of the spine by unilateral contraction

- Interspinales: extension of the cervical and lumbar spine

- Intertransversarii: assisting in lateral flexion of the spine, stabilization of the spine
