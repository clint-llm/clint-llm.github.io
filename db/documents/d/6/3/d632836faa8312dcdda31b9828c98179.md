Blepharoconjunctivitis is a clinical diagnosis based upon the history, signs, and symptoms of the patient. Investigations such as tear film break up time can be useful but is not necessary. In cases that are refractory to treatment, one should consider lid biopsy to rule out a malignancy. Examination with fluorescein drops and blue light can be useful to detect corneal erosions or ulcers, which are associated with chronic poorly controlled blepharoconjunctivitis.
