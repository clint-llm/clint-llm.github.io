Pediatricians or neonatologists can adequately manage neonatal sepsis. However, the following subspecialties and ancillary services can provide essential support in complicated cases:

- Pediatric surgery: to manage associated surgical complications ( gastrointestinal perforation, abscess, necrotizing fasciitis, omphalitis, and others)

- Pediatric infectious disease specialist if the infant is not responding to antibiotics, or if there is concern regarding adequate antimicrobial coverage

- Pediatric pharmacists can provide meaningful input and recommendations about monitoring trough levels to avoid toxic antibiotic levels
