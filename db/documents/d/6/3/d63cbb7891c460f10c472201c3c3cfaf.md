Primary tumors of the optic nerve are relatively rare. They include the following:

- Optic nerve glioma

- Malignant optic nerve glioma

- Optic nerve sheath meningioma

- Ganglioglioma

- Primary lymphoma

The last two (gangliogliomas and primary lymphoma of the optic nerve) are very rare. Optic nerve gliomas and optic nerve sheath meningiomas make up just under 4% of orbital tumors. Optic nerve gliomas and meningiomas continue to attract controversy as their natural course is still being established. Treatments for both of these conditions continue to evolve.

Optic nerve gliomas are benign tumors classified as pilocytic astrocytomas. They make up half of all primary optic nerve tumors and between 1.5 and 4% of all orbital tumors.
