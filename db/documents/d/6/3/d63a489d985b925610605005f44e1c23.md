McKenzie exercises are prescribed to patients who exhibit the centralization phenomenon of back pain. Centralization refers to the abortion of distal referred pain in a sequential fashion with the pain ultimately localizing at the midline of the body. Exercises areÂ indicated based on directional preference, and their indication is the same direction of directional preference. For example, if a patient exhibits a directional preference for spinal extension (most common), the exercises performed will be in spinal extension.
