Bivalirudin is typically available as a 250 mg powder available for reconstitution with 5ml of sterile water or ready to injection as a 5 mg/ml solution.

For Percutaneous Coronary Intervention

- Patients with no history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: A bolus dose, given intravenously of 0.75 mg/kg. Immediately following the bolus dose, an infusion of 1.75 mg/kg/h for the duration of the procedure. Five minutes following the bolus, an ACT should be drawn, and additional bolus doses of 0.3 mg/kg given as necessary to achieve a therapeutic ACT.

- For patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: In this patient population, an intravenous bolus of 0.75 mg/kg. The following infusion rate is the same as above, 1.75 mg/kg/h for the entire procedure.

- At the discretion of the prescribing clinician, the infusion may continue for up to four hours after the intervention. Vigilance is necessary, watching closely for signs of bleeding as outlined below (see Toxicity).

In patients undergoing revascularization therapy, who present with ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction, the recommendation is to continue the intraoperative infusion for four hours post-procedure to reduce the risk of in-stent thrombosis. Following this, the bivalirudin infusion may continue at a decreased rate of 0.2 mg/kg/h, for up to 20 hours, at the discretion of the prescribing physician.
