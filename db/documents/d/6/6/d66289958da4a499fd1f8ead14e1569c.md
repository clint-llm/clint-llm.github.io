Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is considered the most disabling of traumatic phenomenons, almost always encompassing lifelong emotional, behavioral, and permanent physical impairment.

Cerebral contusions cause permanent damage to tissues of the cerebrum. The severity of the damage is related to the primary injury that is started by the kinetic energy absorbed by the collision and the cascade of secondary injury responses that exacerbate the primary damage. The hemorrhagic lesion is produced in the immediate moments after the head impact.

Contusions can progress and expand, and in many cases, other hemorrhagic contusions are present. Hemorrhagic contusions overlie brain parenchyma with loss of function. It is known that blood is very toxic to healthy brain tissue; hence brain contusions are among the most devastating secondary injury forms seen in TBI's. Brain contusions have been attributed to bleeding from the continuous flow of injured microvessels during the initial traumatic episode. This concept has suggested that the formation of a contusion might be due to an underlying or overt coagulopathy.
