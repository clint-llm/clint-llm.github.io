Historically, indications for amniocentesis for fetal lung maturity included maternal comorbidities, uterine and placental complications, and obstetric concerns. Some of these conditions included diabetes, chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, placenta previa, preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, fetal heart rate abnormalities, and several other concerns. Based on new guidelines, these indications no longer warrant testing the L/S ratio or performing other fetal lung testing modalities. One possible exception relates to inaccurate dating of the gestational age. If there is poor dating of the pregnancy and the delivery is to be planned between 32 to 39 weeks gestation, the clinician may consider testing for fetal lung maturity.
