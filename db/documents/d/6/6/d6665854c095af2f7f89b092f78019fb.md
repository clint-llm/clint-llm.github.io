Substance P works through a G protein-coupled receptor, either through the IP3/DAG pathway or the cAMP pathway depending on cell type. In the dorsal horn, substance P assists in the transmission of pain signals to the central nervous system. In the gastrointestinal tract, substance P assists in potentiating smooth muscle contraction in response to acetylcholine and serotonin from post-synaptic neurons.
