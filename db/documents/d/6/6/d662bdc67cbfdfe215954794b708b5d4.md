The tibialis posterior is in the posterior compartment of the lower leg. The posterior compartment contains seven muscles: the gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris, popliteus, flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus, and the tibialis posterior. The muscles contained in the posterior compartment receive innervation by the tibial nerve and are primarily supplied by the posterior tibial artery. The gastrocnemius and the soleus are referred to as the triceps surae and are the primary plantar flexors. The plantaris is a secondary plantar flexor of the foot, while the flexor digitorum longus and the flexor hallucis longus are primary flexors of the lateral four toes and the great toe, respectively, with some plantar flexion.

The tibialis posterior acts to plantarflex the foot and invert the foot and support the medial arch.

The muscles of the anterior compartment primarily antagonize the posterior compartment muscles. Collectively, the anterior muscles dorsiflex the foot at the ankle joint. The lateral compartment muscles assist in the eversion of the foot and plantar flexion.
