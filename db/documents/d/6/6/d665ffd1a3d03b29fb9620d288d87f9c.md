A wrist sprain is a common injury, particularly in work and athletic environments. An acute wrist sprain is an injury to a ligament often due to an acute traumatic event or chronic repetitive movements. There are 20 ligaments of the wrist connecting eight carpal bones to each other as well as to the forearm and the hand, but not all are prone to injury. Two notable non-bony structures more prone to injury are triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and the scapholunate ligament complex due to their locations and the mechanisms of common injuries. Most injuries can be diagnosed clinically without requiring further imaging or arthroscopy and may receive non-operative treatment. In some cases, surgical interventions may be necessary. This activity reviews the anatomy of the ligaments of the wrist, presentations of injuries, and recent studies regarding wrist sprains.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomy of the ligaments of the wrist.

- Describe common presentations, including mechanisms of injury for wrist sprains.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for wrist sprains.
- Review the role of an interprofessional care involved in the treatment and recovery of wrist sprains.
