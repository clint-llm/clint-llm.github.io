All patients should be assessed before treatment for facial asymmetry and volume differences. It is also important to document any preexisting scars and inquire about a history of keloid formation. All patients should receive baseline photographs and return for assessment 2 to 4 weeks after injection. Patients should be advised to avoid any unnecessary herbal medications and supplements to decrease the risk of bruising. Anticoagulants should not be discontinued.
