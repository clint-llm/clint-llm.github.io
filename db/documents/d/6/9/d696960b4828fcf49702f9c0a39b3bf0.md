Patients undergoing cephalomedullary nailing can typically be weight-bearing as tolerated postoperatively. The decision must be made based on the quality of fixation and concomitant injuries. Additionally, the quality of opposition of the medial cortex at the fracture site has a part in the practitioner's decision making. Patients with extensive medial comminution may require a period of immobilization, even in the setting of cephalomedullary nailing, to prevent early varus collapse.

Patients undergoing submuscular plating should be non-weight-bearing postoperatively. Generally, repeat imaging is obtained 6 weeks postoperatively. Patients with appropriately aligned and healing fractures can begin to bear weight at this time. Patients with poor nutrition, diabetes, or severe medical comorbidities may require an additional period of non-weight-bearing up to twelve weeks.
