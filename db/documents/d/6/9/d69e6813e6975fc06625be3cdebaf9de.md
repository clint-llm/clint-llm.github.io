Skin findings usually appear within the first year of life, and 15% to 20% have manifestations at birth. In general, scaling and erythema are seen if at birth, but collodion baby has been described. Most others show the scaling with mild to no erythema in infancy. Typical clinical findings include mild, diffuse scaling that develops over time, mild desquamation with larger polygonal scales affecting mainly the scalp, anterior aspects of the lower extremities (shin), and other extensor surfaces. The flexures (popliteal and antecubital fossae), palms, and soles are spared, as are the hair and nails. The scales tend to increase throughout childhood and continue into adolescence. Pruritus usually is absent. Desquamation is typically mild during the summer months and is exacerbated by dry and cold weather. The differential diagnosis is ichthyosis vulgaris, which does not tend to have its onset during the first 3 months (although associated atopic dermatitis may occur early). Mild lamellar ichthyosis can appear similar. Asymptomatic corneal opacities are the most common eye finding (present in up to 50% of affected males and 25% of female carriers). Cryptorchidism has been reported to affect up to 20% of X-linked ichthyosis patients, but in practice, it is uncommonly found. There have not been adverse effects on sexual development, testosterone levels, or fertility.
