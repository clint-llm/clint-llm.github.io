The foramen ovale is an opening or shunt in the heart tissue allowing blood to flow from the right atrium to the left atrium during fetal development. Blood oxygenated at the placenta is shunted away from the pulmonic circulation via this structure as the lungsÂ are collapsed and not functioning and bathed in amniotic fluid.

Inability to correctly close the foramen ovale can lead to multiple conditions, ranging from a patent foramen ovale to atrial septal defects. The clinical significance varies depending mostly on the size of the opening and shunts from early congestive heart failure in the case of a significant atrial septal defect to asymptomatic in small and relatively common patent foramen ovale. Treatment options for atrial septal defects have been implemented to reconstruct the atrial septum.
