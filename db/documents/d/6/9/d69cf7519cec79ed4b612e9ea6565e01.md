IgA pemphigus is similar to pemphigus vulgaris in that is has painful blisters, but IgA pemphigus does not present with oral mucosa blisters. Direct and indirect immunofluorescence can both help to differentiate PV from IgA pemphigus.

Pemphigus foliaceus is similar to PV in the fact that it is an autoimmune blistering disease, however similarly to IgA pemphigus, pemphigus foliaceus does not affect the oral mucosa. Pemphigus foliaceus is less common than PV.

Paraneoplastic pemphigus also presents with mucocutaneous vesicles and bullae similar to PV. Paraneoplastic pemphigus can be differentiated from PV using indirect immunofluorescence and immunoblot.
