Lymphocytosis by itself is often a sign of an underlying disorder. Recognition of its presence, as defined by an ALC over 4000 cells/microL, is the first step. A second important issue is the recognition of the urgency or lack of it in referral to hematology. A detailed history, coupled with a complete physical examination and review of complete blood counts, provides a preliminary idea regarding the underlying etiology. Patients with no alarming features and typical history for a reactive cause of lymphocytosis can be reassured and monitored clinically. Patients with infectious mononucleosis should be instructed to refrain from contact sports during the acute phase of their illness that fatigue may continue after the resolution of other symptoms.

Any alarming features, like significant weight loss, anorexia, excessive night sweats, or an abnormal physical exam (lymphadenopathy or hepato-splenomegaly), should trigger a hematology referral and workup. Patients with suspicion or confirmation of leukemia should receive a prompt referral to academic centers specializing in the treatment of leukemia.
