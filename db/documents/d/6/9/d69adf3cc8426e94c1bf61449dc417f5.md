In the proper clinical context, Bartonella quintana can be diagnosed with culture, polymerase chain reaction, and histopathology. It is difficult to culture as it is a slow-growing fastidious bacterium.Bartonella species.

Finally, trench fever may be diagnosed by serology by measuring antibodies to B. quintana with either indirect fluorescence assay (IFA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Using serology, acute infections can be differentiated from chronic infections based on the higher elevations of anti-Bartonella antibodies in those with acute infections, with titers >1:256. Serology has been recorded to be most sensitive in cases with endocarditis.
