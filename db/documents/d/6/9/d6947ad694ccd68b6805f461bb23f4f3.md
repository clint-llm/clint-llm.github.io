Testicular cancers are classified based on their cell of origin: seminomatous, non-seminomatous, Leydig, Sertoli, choriocarcinoma, embryonal, teratoma, and yolk-sac derivatives. Seminoma and non-seminomatous lesions are frequently grouped as germ cell tumors and are notable for their responsiveness to chemotherapy compared to the other types. Seminoma accounts for about a third of all testicular germ cell malignancies and is one of the most treatable cancers, with a survival rate of 98% to 99% in early-stage disease.

While the overall incidence of testicular germ cell tumors is low, at only 1% to 2% of all male malignancies; it remains the most common cancer in the 15 to 35 year age group.
