A purulent discharge, edema, and erythema of the lids and hyperemia of the conjunctiva are suggestive of conjunctivitis. Discharge can be purulent in bacterial conjunctivitis and watery in viral etiology. Gonorrhea has profuse purulent discharge, Pseudomonas has greenish discharge, and chlamydia can be watery followed with purulent and bloody discharge.

Laterality, unilateral conjunctivitis most often is seen with S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Herpes simplex, and adenovirus. Bilateral conjunctivitis is seen with infection caused by N. gonorrhea or by use of ocular prophylaxis. Chlamydia usually develops in one eye but effects the other after 2 to 7 days.

The physical exam should include evaluation for red reflex, ulcerations (corneal and conjunctival), and adenopathy. One should also rule out signs of respiratory and systemic infection.

History of STI in the mother increases the risk of chlamydia and gonorrhea. Neonatal conjunctivitis is frequently diagnosed in neonates born to HIV-infected mothers.
