Thermal burns are the most common type of burn injuries, making up about 86% of the burned patients requiring burn center admission.Â Burns often result from hot liquids, steam, flame or flash, and electrical injury. Risk factors for thermal burns include:

- Young age - children often come into contact with hot liquids

- Male gender - males are also at high risk for burn injuries chiefly due to occupation-related injuries. Additionally, flame burns are also common during the summer, as many people use gasoline products for recreation or farming. Alcohol consumption is a common risk factor in adults who suffer burn injuries.

- Lack of smoke detectors in the home

When immersion scald burns are present, one should always suspect child abuse by the parent or caretaker.
