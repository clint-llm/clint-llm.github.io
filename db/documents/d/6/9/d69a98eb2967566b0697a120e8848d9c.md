Weight loss maintenance is of utmost importance. Monitoring patients closely for adherence to weight loss regimens can be done more efficiently with nursing, allied health, and interprofessional team monitoring. It is seen that combined pharmacotherapy and behavioral intervention provide greater weight loss maintenance and initial weight loss in 12 to 18 months.

Patients should be followed up often, at least in the first 12 to 18 months. Frequent physical exams and laboratory testing should be pursued to screen for comorbidities. Further research is required on at-risk subpopulations such as racial/ethnic groups, older adults, etc. More information is needed regarding patient-centered outcomes of current weight loss regimens. Emphasis should be placed on psychosocial factors and quality of life.
