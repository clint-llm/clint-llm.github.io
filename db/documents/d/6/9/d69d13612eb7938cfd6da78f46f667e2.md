The etiology of acute sympathomimetic toxicity is related to its effect on the inhibition of norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake at the preganglionic synapse. This leads to an excess of norepinephrine and dopamine at the postsynaptic terminal and synaptic space. This prolonged exposure is whatÂ causes most of the untoward effects of sympathomimetics due to the end organ being affected. Cardiac effects include tachycardia, hypertension, and vasoconstriction leading to cardiac ischemia and dysrhythmias. Neurologically it can cause vasoconstriction and stroke-like syndromes and intracranial hemorrhage.
