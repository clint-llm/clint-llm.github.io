Kupffer cells are specialized macrophages found in the hepatic sinusoid, along with sinusoidal endothelial cells, Ito cells, and pit cells.

Kupffer cells' function and structure differ depending on their location in the centrilobular or periportal regions of the liver. Kupffer cells in the periportal regions tend to be larger, have more lysosomal enzyme activities, and have more phagocytic activity, while those in the centrilobular regions produce more superoxide anion.
