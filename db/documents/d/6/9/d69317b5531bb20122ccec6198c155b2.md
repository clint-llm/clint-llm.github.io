The electroencephalogram is performed by the EEG technician/technologist, who is a trained professional with appropriate under-grad education and training. They undergo rigorous training and certification process. Once a study is completed, the recordings are reviewed, and a report is generated by the clinical neurophysiologist, who is typically a board-certified/eligible neurologist who undergoes additional subspecialty training in EEG/epilepsy.

The EEG performance in the ICU and the epilepsy monitoring units require the participation of additional trained staff (nurses, support staff, monitor techs. and others) in order to provide proper and safe evaluation and care of all patients.
