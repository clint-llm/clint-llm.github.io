The definition of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) has already shed light on the importance of a thorough evaluation of patients with apparently idiopathic ILD and the value of the interaction between medical specialties. IPAF and other CTD-ILD are essential to differentiate from IPF as the latter has a poor prognosis. Early diagnosis is crucial and multidisciplinary management with the involvement of a pulmonologist, radiologist, pathologist, rheumatologist and, a thoracic surgeon and is useful for the approach to IPAF, especially for consistent and accurate diagnosis and optimizing patient outcomes.
