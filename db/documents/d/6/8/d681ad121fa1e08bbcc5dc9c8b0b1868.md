Patients with facial nerve palsy have a unique set of challenges with which to cope. Patient education is vital to reduce the risk of complications through self-management regimes. These include issues such as dealing with dry eyes and mouth, how to tape an eye shut as to avoid corneal abrasion/ulceration, dealing with eating and drinking, a new development of facial expression, speech, and language adjustments (and development in children) to name a few. Providing patients with relevant guides and educational material on how to tackle these issues can be hugely beneficial to patient wellbeing and outcome.Â This information can also be beneficial to the patient's families and friends who may wish to learn further how best to help support an individual with facial nerve palsy. Additionally, some patients with facial nerve palsies find charities and support groups helpful to meet like-minded people to share ideas and collaborate on how best to manage the condition.
