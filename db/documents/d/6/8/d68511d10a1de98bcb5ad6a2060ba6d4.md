Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is a group of tumors defined by abnormal trophoblastic proliferation. Trophoblast cells produce human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GTD is divided into hydatidiform moles (contain villi) and other trophoblastic neoplasms (lack villi). The non-molar or malignant forms of GTD are called gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). They include the invasive mole, choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor, and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor. These malignancies can occur weeks or years following any pregnancy but occur most commonly after a molar pregnancy. This activity reviews the cause and pathophysiology of GTD and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of gestational trophoblastic disease.
- Describe the pathophysiology of gestational trophoblastic disease.
- Summarize the treatment options for gestational trophoblastic disease .
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by gestational trophoblastic disease.
