A presenting symptom of lateral foot pain and/or ankle instability elicits a broad range of possible etiologies, includingÂ peroneal tendinopathy or subluxation, lateral ankle ligamentous injury (including the anterior and posterior talofibular and the calcaneofibular ligaments), sinus tarsi syndrome, cuboid syndrome, osseous fractures, and peroneal neuropathy, among numerous other considerations.

As previously explained, an os peroneum fracture may be confused with a bipartite/multipartite os peroneum.
