The severity of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis is variable. Neonates with this disorder are at increased risk of sepsis, dehydration and ultimately, death. Due to the rarity of this disorder, statistics on mortality rate are lacking. For those that survive the neonatal period, episodes of blistering and skin infections occur intermittently throughout life. As a result, patients often have significant disfigurement and pungent body odors, causing severe psychological and social distress.
