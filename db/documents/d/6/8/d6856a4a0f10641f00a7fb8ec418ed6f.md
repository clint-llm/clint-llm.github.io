Overall outcomes can be expected to be poor in patients with basilar artery thrombosis. Advances in pharmacologic and mechanical thrombosis and endovascular therapy may reduce the subsequent mortality and disability rates. Catheter-directed thrombolysis and IV heparin also carry a risk of hemorrhage. Complications can include the following: aspiration, aspiration pneumonia, thromboembolic disease (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), myocardial infarction, and recurrent stroke. Patients with advanced functional debility secondary to stroke are increasingly prone to contractures, pressure ulcers, and sepsis. Many patients who survive basilar artery thrombosis require ongoing physical and occupational therapy to regain and maintain functionality.
