The thyroid gland is the first endocrine gland that develops during fetal embryology, which starts between the third and fourth gestational weeks. The primary origin of the thyroid gland is the endoderm, which gives rise to the median (the significant portion of each lateral lobe, isthmus and thyroglossal duct with pyramidal lobe), and the two lateral anlages which contain c-cells, solid nests cells and portions of the lateral thyroid. Failure of the thyroid fails to descend from the thyroid anlage region to its final location in front of the trachea is called an ectopic thyroid. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of ectopic thyroid gland and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the locations of an ectopic thyroid gland.
- Recall the presentation of a patient with an ectopic thyroid gland.
- Summarize the treatment options for ectopic thyroid.
- Explore strategies to optimize care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by ectopic thyroid.
