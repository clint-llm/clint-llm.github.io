Failed back surgery syndrome has proven to be both a difficult condition to experience for patients and a challenging condition to treat for clinicians. Compared to patients with other chronic pain syndromes, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia, FBSS patients have been shown to exhibit a lower quality of life scores and higher amounts of pain, unemployment, opioid use, and disability.

Unsurprisingly, treatment choice has been found to affect outcomes in patients with failed back surgery syndrome. Stronger evidence exists for favorable results in patients treated with SCS.
