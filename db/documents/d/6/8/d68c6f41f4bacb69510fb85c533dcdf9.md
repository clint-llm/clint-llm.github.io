Mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms have two distinct histologic components, which are the inner epithelial layer composed of tall mucin-secreting cells and dense cellular ovarian stroma. The latter was described in 1978 by Compagno and Oertel, and the disease was distinguished from other serous cystic tumors and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms

Conversely, most mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms lesions are benign and rarely metastasizes to lymph nodes or other organs.  It is believed that benign lesions can transform into malignant mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms due to the older age of presentation in patients with invasive cancer
