Stercoral colitis is a rare inflammatory colitis that occurs when impacted fecal material leads to distention of the colon and eventually fecaloma formation. Fecalomas can lead to focal pressure necrosis and perforation, while colonic distention and increased intraluminal pressure can lead to compromise of the vascular supply and ischemic colitis. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of stercoral colitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of stercoral colitis.
- Identify the pathophysiology leading to the development of stercoral colitis. 
- Summarize the management of patients with stercoral colitis.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by stercoral colitis.
