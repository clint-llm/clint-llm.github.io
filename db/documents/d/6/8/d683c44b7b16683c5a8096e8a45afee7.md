Stress-induced gastritis is commonly encountered in clinical practice by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, emergency department physician, pharmacist, and internist. The diagnosis is initially suspected based on the history and treated empirically with PPIs. If the symptoms resolve, the patient is urged to undertake stress-relieving measures, discontinue smoking, caffeinated beverages, alcohol, and NSAIDs.

Unfortunately, most patients remain non-compliant with preventive methods and have a recurrence of symptoms regularly. Some of these patients may benefit from upper endoscopy to rule out an organic disorder. Long-term PPI therapy for more than 12 months is not recommended. Instead, one may use antihistamines.
