The prognosis isÂ promising with trochanteric bursitis, as patients can expect complete resolution of symptoms with conservative management without any long-term sequelae. Resolution with NSAIDs and/or corticosteroid injection can be expected within just several days of initiation of treatment. Refractory bursitis is rare, although some patients do report a return of symptoms with re-irritation or repetitive trauma.
