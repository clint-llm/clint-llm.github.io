Chromium deficiency can be easily missed when evaluating patients with new-onset hyperglycemia. While it is difficult to tell whether chromium deficiency is common in situations other than malnutrition, it should be kept on the differential for certain patient populations. This activity will review the types and demographics of patients at risk for chromium deficiency, the signs and symptoms of chromium deficiency, and the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the management of chromium deficiency.
- Review the evaluation of chromium deficiency.
- Summarize the causes of chromium deficiency.
- Identify patients at risk for chromium deficiency.
