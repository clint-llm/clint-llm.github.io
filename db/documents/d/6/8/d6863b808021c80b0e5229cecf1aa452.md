Developmental disturbances in tooth development that result in structural changes are routine findings on clinical examinations. Patients that present with these conditions can be identified by any member of the healthcare team. With generalized developmental disturbances noted throughout the dentition, appropriate referrals should be made for genetic counseling and a dental healthcare provider for the subsequent management of any symptomatic orÂ esthetic cases.
