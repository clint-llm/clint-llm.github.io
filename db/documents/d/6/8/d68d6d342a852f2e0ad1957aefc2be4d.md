After establishing a link between the HLA B 5701 allele and abacavir, monitoring for the allele and hypersensitive response became routine in antiretroviral therapy, accomplished through genetic screening. Testing for HLA B 5701 most commonly uses a blood or saliva sample for sequence-based genotyping using a polymerase chain reaction.

For patients with the HLA B 5701 allele, safely and conclusively diagnosing hypersensitivity is another necessary step in determining drug efficacy. To confirm hypersensitivity, an epicutaneous patch test is administered after the patient has had exposure to abacavir. A skin patch must take place after the immune system has been exposed to the drugâ€™s effects because a rechallenge will produce a measurable response. Skin patch testing uses concentrations of 1% and 10% abacavir in petrolatum along with control without abacavir. These patches can then be read at 24 and 48 hours after application. A positive hypersensitive response is when there is a palpable cutaneous response on the skin surface where abacavir was introduced.
