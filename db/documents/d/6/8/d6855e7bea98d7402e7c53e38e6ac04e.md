The Parkland formula is an essential tool for calculating fluid resuscitation in patients with critical burns. This formula is indicated for those who have sustained large deep partial-thickness or full-thickness burns covering more than 20% of TBSA in adults and greater than 10% in children. The formula was first tested on large animals by Baxter and Shires before being utilized in human studies. The original version of the formula called for 3.8 mL ± 0.4 mL per weight in kilograms per TBSA burned, with only 12% of patients needing additional fluids for resuscitation. Years after their initial publication, the amount of crystalloid needed was rounded up to 4 mL, and the use of colloid was only recommended within 24 to 48 hours after resuscitation.
