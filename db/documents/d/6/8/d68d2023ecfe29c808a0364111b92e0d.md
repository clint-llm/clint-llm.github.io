Thromboembolism formation during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a common complication experienced for patients requiring prolonged respiratory or cardiorespiratory life support. This activity will explore the various anticoagulation methods used for the patient on ECMO and highlight the role of the interprofessional team in successful ECMO utilization.

**Objectives:**
- Review the different types of ECMO configurations and the indications for each setup.
- Describe the pathophysiology of thromboembolism formation in ECMO patients.
- Outline the various methods for monitoring the effects of anticoagulation.
- Summarize the pathophysiology of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and the constellation of the lab and physical exam findings you would expect in a patient with suspected HIT.
