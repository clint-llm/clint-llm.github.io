Chylomicronemia syndrome defined as a plasma TG greater than 1000 mg/dl,

Although familial chylomicronemia syndrome is a rare inherited hyperlipoproteinemia, it poses a burden on those that it affects.  The commonest cause is LPL deficiency, which can present in infancy and childhood. It may result in the presence of recurrent abdominal pain, acute pancreatitis, and hepatosplenomegaly. While the prevalence of the disease is unknown, there is an estimate of 1 to 2 individuals in every million who are diagnosed, with potentially more who are undiagnosed.

**Signs and Symptoms**

The high circulating levels of chylomicrons can accumulate in tissues and organs such as the liver and spleen (resulting in organomegaly), skin (eruptive xanthomas), retinal blood vessels (lipemia retinalis). The most sinister complication is acute pancreatitis. Patients with Type 5 can also have sensory neuropathy and memory loss.

**Treatment**

Unfortunately, the traditional triglyceride-lowering agents, including fibrates, niacin, statins, and fish oil, are not effective in the treatment of  Type1-familial chylomicronemia syndrome. However, management for familial chylomicronemia syndrome patients is with severely restricted low-fat diets of less than 15% of the calories (20g/day) coming from fat, medium-chain triglycerides, and alcohol avoidance.

For patients with adult chylomicronemia, weight loss, fibrates, fish oil (2 to 4g/d), niacin and avoidance of secondary factors are used to control the HTG.
