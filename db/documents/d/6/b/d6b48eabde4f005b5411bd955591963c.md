Unfortunately, no antidotes for celecoxib overdose are available. However, celecoxib is a relatively safe medication overall. There were no reported overdoses of celecoxib during FDA trials, and doses up to 2400 mg per day for ten days did not result in severe toxicity.

Symptoms of celecoxib overdose would likely be similar to overdoses of other NSAIDs, which include lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain. Activated charcoal may be administered for overdose treatment at the discretion of emergency medical providers if the patient presents within 4 hours of known or suspected ingestion of significant amounts of celecoxib. Due to high plasma protein binding, dialysis, urine alkalinization, or diureses are unlikely to have a significant therapeutic effect on celecoxib overdose.
