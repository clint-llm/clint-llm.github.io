Given the elusive nature of traumatic diaphragm injuries, a high index of suspicion is imperative during the initial workup. It is important in developing an appropriate level of suspicion to obtain the appropriate adjunctive studies where a TDI may be present.

In situations where the MOI involves a fall, the fall height and how the patient was found are important in providing clues to the degree and trajectory of energy at the time of impact.

For those patients who present in a delayed fashion, their diaphragmatic injury often includes herniation of abdominal viscera. Symptoms here depend on the size of the diaphragmatic defect, which tends to increase over time. The physical findings can vary based on the anatomical point of obstruction and the severity of the herniation. Incarcerated viscera may present with partial obstructing symptoms, whereas strangulated viscera presents with a more grave clinical picture, leading to ischemia and impending perforation with septic shock.

A history of prior trauma may elude to the potential for a delayed traumatic diaphragmatic hernia. Patients often have non-specific symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and pain. This may be mistaken for peptic ulcer disease or cholecystitis in the herniated viscera without incarceration, especially if the presentation is chronic.
