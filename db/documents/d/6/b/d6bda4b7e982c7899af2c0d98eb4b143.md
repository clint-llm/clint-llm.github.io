There are no preventable causes of intraventricular meningiomas. Many of them are found incidentally and can be observed. They usually attain large sizes before symptoms commence. The age distribution is between 30 and 60 years of age, with a mean age at diagnosis is 42.2 years old. This is lower than the meningiomas in other locations. Histopathological distribution of intraventricular meningiomas is similar to those in other locations. Recurrence and mortality rates are lower than in other locations.

Surgery for intraventricular meningiomas is challenging. Complete surgical removal is frequent, and minimal recurrence rate is the rule. Some patients develop neurologic deficits primarily in visual fields. The use of functional brain mapping, diffusion tensor imaging, and tractography of white matter fiber tracts can help to select the best appropriate approach.
