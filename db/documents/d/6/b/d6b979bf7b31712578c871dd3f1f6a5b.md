We will focus on the two most frequent pathologies of hereditary colorectal cancer according to the polyposis classification:

**HNPCC**-**Lynch syndrome (LS):**Characteristically presents with flat polyps located in the right colon, which generate CRC and other cancers (endometrium, stomach, ovary, pancreas, ureter and renal pelvis, cerebral glioblastoma, biliary tract, cancer of the small intestine, sebaceous carcinomas and keratoacanthomas). Endometrial cancer occurs in relatively young women.

**HPCC) -****Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP):**It is characterized by hundreds or thousands of precancerous adenomatous polyps, which generate CRC and other cancers, Also may occur extracolonic manifestations (desmoid tumor, osteomas, epidermoid cysts, papillary thyroid carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, gastric cancer, duodenal cancer, hepatobiliary and CNS tumors), this is due to mutations in the gene (APC), which controls cell proliferation and the regulation of a new long non-coding RNA (lncRNA).

- **Classic FAP:**Consists of the involvement of the entire colon with the appearance of 100 to 1000 adenomatous polyps, the age of onset of polyps comprises between 10 and 20 years of age; estimates are that the diagnosis of CRC corresponds to 30 to 40 years of age,Â It correlates with the majority of cancers described above, which increases comorbidity.

- **Attenuated FAP:**Frequently affects the right colon, with an appearance of 10 to 100 adenomatous polyps, the age of onset of polyps between 20 to 30 years of age; estimates are the diagnosis of CRC corresponds to 40 to 50 years of age. It commonly carries associations with gastric, duodenal, and thyroid cancer.
