Asbestosis and silicosis are the two major differentials for Caplan syndrome. An asbestosis is a form of pneumoconiosis that presents in patients with chronic inhalation of a cumulative dose of inhaled asbestos fibers. The asbestos fibers are fibrogenic to the lungs, causing lung nodules that may appear similar to the radiologic imaging for Caplan syndrome. The difference is these patients have known exposure to asbestos inhalation such as with products containing asbestos cement-like pipes, shingles, clapboard, sheets, vinyl-asbestos floor tiles, asbestos paper in filtering and insulating products, brake linings, clutch facings, textile products such as yarn, felt tape, cord, rope, and spray products used for acoustic, thermal, and fireproofing purposes. Silicosis is similar to the pathogenesis of asbestos and is usually associated with workers in the sandblasting industry.

**Other Differentials for Multiple Cavitary Pulmonary Nodules**

- Neoplasm

- Granulomatous infection with bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, Nocardia, or parasite

- Inflammatory such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, sarcoidosis

- Vascular such as pulmonary embolism with infarction

- Developmental such as congenital pulmonary airway malformation, pulmonary sequestration

- Drug toxicities with amiodarone, infliximab, bleomycin, carbamazepine

- Amyloidosis
