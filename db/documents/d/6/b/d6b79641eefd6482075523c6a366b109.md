A careful history and physical is necessary, as a labyrinthine fistula can easily be missed or misdiagnosed. A labyrinthine fistula should be suspected in patients that sustain a temporal bone fracture or membranous labyrinthine rupture from head trauma, which includes implosive (Valsalva, blowing nose) and explosive (increased intracranial pressure from sneezing, coughing, weight lifting, and blast injuries). The primary symptoms of a traumatic labyrinthine fistula are sensorineural hearing loss and dizziness following the trauma.

A labyrinthine fistula should also be suspected if a patient has vestibular disturbances and/or hearing loss after a stapedectomy. The artificial prosthesis can become dislodged, leading to perilymph leakage. Finally, a labyrinthine fistula should be suspected in those who have chronic otitis media. Cholesteatomas often form in these individuals, which can lead to erosion of the petrous bone that surrounds the labyrinth causing a fistula. Barotrauma is a possible cause, such as from diving or flying.

Important exam findings include the positive fistula test, where air is insufflated in the ear, causing nystagmus. A cholesteatoma may also be seen with the otoscopic evaluation.

Another important exam finding is Tullio’s phenomenon, where dizziness occurs after introduction to sound. The patient may have a hearing loss that may be sensorineural, conductive, or a combination of the two.

The Fukuda/Unterberger test determines postural instability from vestibular hypofunction.
