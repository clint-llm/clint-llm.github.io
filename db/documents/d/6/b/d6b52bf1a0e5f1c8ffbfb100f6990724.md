Like most healthcare procedures, interprofessional healthcare team members need to exercise consistent interpersonal communication. Gynecologists, anesthesiologists, radiology technicians, nurses, and additional health care teams all play an essential role in patient care. Research has shown that failure to collaborate between teams increases medical errors. Meticulous documentation and communication with other team membersÂ are required for optimal patient care and the ability of the team to react to status changes, including the results of diagnostic testing such as hysterosalpingogram. This interprofessional communication will drive improved diagnosis leading to improved and targeted treatment. [Level 5]
