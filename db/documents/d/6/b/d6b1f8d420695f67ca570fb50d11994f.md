The best means of obviating tardive dyskinesia is primary prevention. Primary prevention of tardive dyskinesia includes using the lowest effective dose of an antipsychotic agent for the shortest period possible. If tardive dyskinesia develops, it is recommended to decrease the dose or even discontinue the offending agent and switch to clozapine. Clozapine is recommended in patients with tardive dyskinesia who continue to require antipsychotics as the incidence of tardive dyskinesia with clozapine is significantly less than with other antipsychotics.
