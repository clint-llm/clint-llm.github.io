The pathophysiology of PRES remains unclear, but some proposed mechanisms center around the dysregulation of cerebral autoregulation, the brainâ€™s ability to maintain constant cerebral blood flow over a range of blood pressures via the constriction or dilation of the cerebral blood vessels.

One critique of the hypertensive-hyperperfusion hypothesis above is that there have been cases where individuals exhibited PRES. Still, their blood pressures were not high enough to surpass the autoregulative capability of the brain.

Not only can immunosuppressants affect the blood-brain barrier, but also neuroinflammation, such as in the context of sepsis and autoimmune disorders. Astrogliosis, microgliosis, and endothelial activation occurring in sepsis or endothelial injury in anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitides can enhance blood-brain barrier permeability, allowing for extravasation of intravascular fluid and potential for developing PRES.
