The 6MWT is primarily indicated for assessing the response to treatment in moderate-to-severe cardiac or pulmonary disease.

Other guideline-based indications for the 6MWT include its use to measure a patient's exercise tolerance and prognosis depending on the underlying condition.

Other conditions in which it can be helpful include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, and sarcoidosis.

Functional impairment resulting from conditions affecting the neurological and muscular systems, such as fibromyalgia, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinal muscular atrophy, can also be reliably evaluated with the 6MWT.
