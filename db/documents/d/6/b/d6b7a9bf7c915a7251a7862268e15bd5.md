On the lateral aspect of the frontal bone, just anterior to the parietal bone and superior to the sphenoid bone, the frontal bone forms the anterior portion of the temporal fossa.  The temporalis sits in the temporal fossa which is innervated by CN V and plays a vital role in closing the jaw.

The frontalis muscles are two large anterior bilateral anterior muscles that control the movement of the forehead in facial expression.  The procerus muscles are two muscles located superiorly and medially to the orbit, and lateral to the glabella.  The orbicularis oculi have concentric fibers that surround the eye.  These three muscles are essential for facial expression.
