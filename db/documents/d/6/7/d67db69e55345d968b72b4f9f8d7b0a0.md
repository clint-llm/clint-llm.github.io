As it has already been stated, most patients with pelvic kidneys have a good prognosis; however, the distorted anatomy of their ureters can impair urinary flow. This is associated with an increased incidence of vesicoureteric reflux and renal calculi formation. Vesicoureteric reflux, in turn, is associated with recurrent urinary tract infection and chronic kidney disease.

**Vesicoureteric Reflux**

Ectopic kidneys are associated with aberrant ureteric anatomy. The course of the ureter can be more tortuous and the point of insertion higher in the kidney, impairing the flow of urine through the urinary tract.

Calisti et al. (2008) published a series including 50 patients with a single ectopic kidney, none of whom had significant concomitant pathology.

**Renal Calculi**

The exact incidence of renal calculi in pelvic kidneys is unknown but is thought to be higher than the general population due to altered anatomy and impaired urinary flow rates. The altered anatomy does have significant implications in the operative management of renal calculi, and the risk of vascular injury is increased relative to the general population.

**Malignancy**

Malignancy in pelvic kidneys is rare, and the risk of malignancy is not generally thought to be significantly higher than anatomically normal kidneys.
