Ischemic cerebral stroke, acute coronary syndrome/myocardial infarction, traumatic limb injuries or organ lacerations, and organ transplants are the most commonly encountered situations associated with the possibility of ischemia and hypoxia. The first line of treatment is always thrombolytic therapy or an invasive revascularization procedure. Quite often, there are instances when post revascularization, greater damage is done to the already damaged cells and membranes. This is also sometimes called the “second hit” phenomenon. The main concern remains that early revascularization should be achieved in order to prevent initial extensive cellular damage.
