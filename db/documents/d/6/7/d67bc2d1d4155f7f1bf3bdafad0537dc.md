The orbits contain the globes, extraocular muscles, nerves, fat, and blood vessels. The orbits are relatively cone shaped, tapering from anterior to posterior. The average adult orbit is approximately 35mm in height, 45mm in width, 45mm in length with a volume of 30cm3. The bony orbit is made up of seven different bones

- The frontal bone and the lesser wing of the sphenoid form the orbital roof.

- The maxillary, palatine and zygomatic bones form the orbital floor.

- The ethmoid, lacrimal and greater wing of the sphenoidÂ form the medial orbital wall.

- The frontal process of zygomatic bone and greater wing of sphenoid form the lateral orbital wall.

Medical wall decompression can be done via a transcaruncular approach
