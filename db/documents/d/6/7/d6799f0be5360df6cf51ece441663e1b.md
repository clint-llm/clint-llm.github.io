Many causes of hearing loss exist, but it is generally increasing with the aging population. As a result, it is important to help those with hearing loss function in their environments. Hearing rehabilitation is most commonly achieved with traditional hearing aid amplification, utilizing devices that sit within the ear canal and over the helix. However, under certain circumstances, treatment options for hearing loss include implantable hearing devices such as bone-conducting hearing prostheses, middle ear implantable hearing prostheses, cochlear implants, and auditory brainstem implants.

This chapter provides an overview of these devices and an in-depth review of the background, indications, operative technique, complications, and outcomes of osseointegrated bone-conduction hearing prostheses and middle ear implantable hearing prostheses. For additional information regarding hearing aids, cochlear implants, and auditory brainstem implants, please reference the designated chapters for these topics.
