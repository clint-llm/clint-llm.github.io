Endometrial adenocarcinoma or endometrioid carcinoma is the most common subtype of endometrial cancer. Endometrial adenocarcinoma develops as a result of unopposed estrogen exposure. Estrogen has a proliferative effect on the endometrium, which leads to endometrial hyperplasia. Unmonitored proliferation leads to dysplasia and later carcinoma. Adipose tissue in the body converts androgens into estrogen and hence conditions like obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus type II that lead to increased estrogen levels and can increase the risk of endometrial carcinoma. More than 50% of endometrial cancers are attributable to obesity alone.

The incidence of endometrial cancer has increased over the years, as the incidence of obesity has increased. Early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity, infertility, and polycystic ovarian syndrome all lead to unopposed exposure to estrogen due to an increased number of ovulatory cycles over the lifespan of a patient. These are all considered important risk factors for endometrial cancer.

Tamoxifen, a drug used for the treatment of breast cancer, also increases the risk of endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen inhibits estrogen receptors in the breast tissue, but at the same time, it has a stimulatory effect on the estrogen receptors in the endometrium.
