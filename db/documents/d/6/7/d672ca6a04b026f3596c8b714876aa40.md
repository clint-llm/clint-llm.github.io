Most bowel obstructions will require hospital admission and surgical consultation. Prompt recognition and diagnosis are critical in improving morbidity and mortality. The most important step in the initial management of bowel obstruction is identifying the type, severity, and cause. Understanding the difference between emergent and non-emergent surgical intervention is essential in improving outcomes and preventing sequelae of complications, including bowel necrosis, perforation, and sepsis. Disposition ultimately depends on the type and etiology of the obstruction, as well as the patient's past medical history, current health status, and risk factors.
