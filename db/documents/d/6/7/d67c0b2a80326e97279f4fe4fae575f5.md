Treatment of VKDB mainly focuses on prompt administration of vitamin K to the infant and then further investigation for the cause of the disease.

In cases of severe life-threatening bleeding, immediate blood transfusions can be given along with fresh frozen plasma to reduce the bleeding.

Late VKDB can present with intracranial hemorrhage. The most common form being sub-dural hemorrhage may require surgical evacuation or intracranial shunting to relieve increased intracranial pressure and associated symptoms.

Late VKDB can also present with neurological abnormalities despite treatment that will require regular follow-up and continuous monitoring. Physiotherapy can be advised to retain/strengthen neural function. If unable to suck or swallow, babies may require nutritional assistance.

Nonetheless, a single intramuscular (IM) dose of 1 mg of vitamin K is known to improve the coagulation profile within 1 to 7 days.

Infants not protected from VKBD through prophylaxis may have unrecognized liver disease.
