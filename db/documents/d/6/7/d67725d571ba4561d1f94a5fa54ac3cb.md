- The typical FeNa values for each type of AKI: Pre-renal: Less than 1%; Intrinsic renal greater than 2%; Post-renal: Greater than 4%

- The typical BUN/creatinine ratios for each type of AKI: Pre-renal greater than 20:1; Intrinsic renal Less than 10:1; Post-renal or normal 10 to 20:1.

- Patients who get diuretics may have a higher urinary concentration of sodium due to the diuretic, falsely elevating the fractional excretion of sodium. In these patients, use the fractional excretion of urea (FeUrea) instead since it is relatively unaffected by diuretics.

- Serum creatinine used as a marker of kidney function is affected by muscle mass (lower muscle mass = falsely low serum creatinine).

- The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula includes age, gender, race, BUN, creatinine, and albumin. These are all important factors in measuring kidney function (GFR) and all automatically printed in lab reports.

- Prevention of AKI begins before hospitalization by obtaining a nephrology consultation appropriately in patients with CKD 3, CKD 4, and CKD 5

- Adjust doses of medications according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR)

- Watch for hyperkalemia while taking simultaneous ACEI or ARB/spironolactone in patients with CKD

- Check for bone mineral disorders in patients with CKD
