The hippocampus originates in the isocortex as part of the fifth limbic lobe of the brain in the cerebral hemisphere's medial surface. It is also considered part of the olfactory cortex.

- Rotation of the lateral parts of the developing telencephalon dorsocaudally, then ventrally and rostrally, forming the parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes.

- The hippocampal sulcus then invaginates into the medial wall of the temporal lobe

- Finally, the hippocampal sulcus rotates along a longitudinal axis of the hippocampus, forming a complex structure that is present in the medial aspect of the temporal lobe.
