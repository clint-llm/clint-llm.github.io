Before birth, the first evidence of GTOs is observable in the aponeurosis where Ib axons terminate within islets of collagen bundles and myotubules.

Muscle spindle differentiation starts around 11 weeks of gestation when the intrafusal and extrafusal fibers differentiate. The arrival of the Ia afferent axon to the spindle prompts the formation of the nuclear bag, a term given to intrafusal fibers with multiple equatorial nuclei.
