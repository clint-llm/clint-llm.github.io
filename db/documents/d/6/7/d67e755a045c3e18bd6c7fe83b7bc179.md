Managing liver disease during pregnancy is quite challenging and requires a multispecialty approach. Physiological and anatomical changes during pregnancy, the complex interaction between the mother and the fetus, and the rarity of liver disease in pregnancy itself are some of the many challenges that healthcare providers face while managing liver disease during pregnancy. Furthermore, potential implications on the fetus and the mother should be considered for various diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. This activity illustrates the management of liver disease in pregnancy. It highlights the importance of an interprofessional approach to liver disease in pregnant women.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the normal physiological changes in the liver during pregnancy.
- Explain the liver diseases that are unique during pregnancy and their management.
- Review the evaluation of common liver diseases (not unique to pregnancy) during pregnancy.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in the management of pregnant patients with liver disease.
