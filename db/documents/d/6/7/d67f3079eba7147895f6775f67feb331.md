The differential diagnosis of OAS is the other two orbital syndromes - the superior orbital fissure syndrome and the cavernous sinus syndrome.

The superior orbital fissure syndrome (SOF),Â also known as the Rochen- Duvigneaud syndrome, is characterized by the involvement of the III, IV, VI, and the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. Still, it differs from OAS with the sparing of the optic nerve.

The causative pathologies of these orbital apex syndromes are identical and are named individually to highlight the anatomical site of involvement and may represent a continuum of the same spectrum. One of the predominant features of OAS is total ophthalmoplegia; hence other muscular and neuromuscular causes of total ophthalmoplegia, like myasthenia gravis, congenital muscle fibrosis, and supranuclear palsy, should be ruled out.
