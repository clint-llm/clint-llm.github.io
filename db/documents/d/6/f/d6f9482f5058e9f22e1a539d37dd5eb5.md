The diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy can be made based on a thorough history and physical exam. Electrodiagnostic evaluation can be used to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude peripheral nerve diseases that mimic radiculopathy. Electrodiagnostic findings are useful for patients with atypical symptoms, those who present weakness secondary to pain, and those where the imaging findings do not show a focalizing lesion.

It is essential to inspect for muscle atrophy on physical exam, test for upper extremities' motor strength and sensation, and test bilateral deep tendon reflexes. Special tests such as the Spurling test, where the neck is extended, and side bent to apply pressure onto the exiting nerve root can also aid in diagnosis if it reproduces the neuropathic radiating symptoms.
