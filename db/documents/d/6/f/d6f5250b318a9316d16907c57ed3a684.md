The differential diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis includes diseases that share restrictive physiology and diffuse interstitial changes on computed tomography. Although a “crazy paving” pattern on computed tomography is suggestive of PAP, it can also be associated with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, alveolar hemorrhage, lipoid pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia, pneumocystis pneumonia, radiation pneumonitis, drug-induced pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, non-specific interstitial pneumonitis, or bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. Acute silicosis can present with the same clinical and pathologic findings as PAP. Acute silicosis can display radiographic “crazy paving,” milky BALF with foamy macrophages, and PAS-positive amorphous material within the alveolus on biopsy. The similarities between acute silicosis and PAP emphasize the importance of a thorough occupational history for recent silica exposure.
