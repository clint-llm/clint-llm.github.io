- Patients with impaired renal function have an increased risk of overdose due to decreased clearance.

- Neurological adverse reactions, including convulsions, may occur with attaining high CSF levels of ampicillin.

- In overdose, discontinuation of the ampicillin/sulbactam, symptomatic treatment, and supportive care are necessary.

- In severe overdose, initiate hemodialysis for removal of ampicillin from circulation. The molecular weight and degree of protein binding of sulbactam are also compatible with hemodialysis.

- Corticosteroids can be used to manage the allergic manifestations of immunoallergic hepatitis due to ampicillin.
