Dry eyes affect a significant number of people, but treatment remains unsatisfactory. Dry eyes, also known as dry eye disease (DED), dry eye syndrome, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), are among the most common reasons for a visit to an eye doctor. The cause of this condition is multifactorial, in which ocular, anatomical and systemic factors play crucial roles. It is vital to thoroughly assess patients with signs and symptoms because prompt treatment can significantly improve long-term quality of life, provide relief from dry eyes, and improve outcomes. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of dry eyes and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of dry eye syndrome.
- Describe the presentation, diagnosis, signs, and symptoms of a patient with dry eye syndrome.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for dry eye syndrome.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of dry eyes and improve outcomes.
