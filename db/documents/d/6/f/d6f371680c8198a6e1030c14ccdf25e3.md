Unruptured cerebral aneurysms are detected more than ever before, primarily because of the more frequent use of modern imaging tools. The biggest risk of cerebral aneurysm is the risk of rupture and severe consequences. The majority of patients have no idea that they have an intracranial aneurysm and most often present with a bleed in the brain. Because of the extremely high mortality, it is important to have a systemic approach to these aneurysms once they are detected.

**Screening**

There continue to be debates about screening for cerebral aneurysms because of the expense. Further, there is a significant debate on the ideal management of a small intracranial aneurysm. Most experts agree that once an aneurysm reaches 7 mm or more, treatment should be undertaken. [Level E]
