The vesicles are surrounded by phospholipid bilayer membrane similar to the one that surrounds the cells.

**Size**

Although the different types of vesicles have distinct size ranges, there is still overlap, making classification based solely on size not possible.

**Cargo**

EVs may contain any content found in their origin cell’s cytoplasm; this includes proteins, mRNA, miRNA, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA), circular RNAs (circRNA), metabolites, and lipids.
