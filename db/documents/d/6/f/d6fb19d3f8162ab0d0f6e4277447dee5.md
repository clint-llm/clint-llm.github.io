The prognosis for congenital infections will vary depending on the severity of the initial presentation. For toxoplasmosis, there may be findings at birth, such as intracranial calcifications and chorioretinitis, which may suggest a poor prognosis with seizures and developmental delay likely.

The prognosis of patients with congenital cytomegalovirus is variable. Some patients with a congenital infection have extremely good outcomes and are relatively asymptomatic. On the other hand, children with CNS disease at presentation are at high risk for sensorineural hearing loss and developmental delays. If valganciclovir can be administered to symptomatic newborns in a timely manner, it has shown value.

Patients with neonatal HSV infections will have an outcome that is dependent on the presentation as well. With the advent of the aggressive use of acyclovir in the neonatal period plus the use of suppressive acyclovir for six months, long-term outcomes have improved for neurologic outcomes.
