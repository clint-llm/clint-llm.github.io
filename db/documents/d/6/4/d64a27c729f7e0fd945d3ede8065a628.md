External fixation has been used for the treatment of fractures for 2000 years. The application and devises have changed, but the biomechanics remain the same. This activity outlines the relevant anatomy, techniques, and fixation goals and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who undergo external fixation.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications and contraindications of external fixation.
- Describe the equipment, biomechanics, and technique in regards to external fixation.
- Review appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of external fixation.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance external fixation treatment and improve outcomes.
