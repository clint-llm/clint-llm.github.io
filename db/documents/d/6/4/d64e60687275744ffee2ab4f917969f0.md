A thorough history is essential to the diagnosis of cluster headaches. Patients reveal that they experience ten out of ten unilateral pain, most often located intra or supraorbitally. The pain is nonfluctuating and explosive in quality. Patients must have at least one autonomic symptom ipsilateral to the side with pain. Patients feel restless and may be seen rocking back and forth due to the high pain intensity.

**Autonomic Symptoms**

- Conjunctival injection or lacrimation (90% of patients)

- Nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (84% of patients)

- Eyelid edema or forehead/facial swelling (59% of patients)

- Miosis or ptosis (unknown percentage)

Photophobia and phonophobia, when present, are more likely to be ipsilateral, as opposed to migraine, when they are always bilateral. This presentation is characteristic of TACs. Up to 33% of patients will also experience general allodynia; this is more common in women, patients with recent attacks, those with a younger age at the time of onset, and those with comorbid depression or migraines.

Unlike patients with migraines, these patients are unlikely to hold still. Many patients pace or rock in place; there are descriptions of patients even banging their heads to distract themselves from the headache. Attacks typically last anywhere from 15 minutes to 3 hours. They can occur up to eight times a day, although most commonly, patients experience attacks twice daily, usually at night. Most patients will have attacks for weeks to months and then have remission for months up to years. This pattern usually lasts up to fifteen years.Â Cluster headache is classified as chronic once a symptomatic period persists for a year without remission.
