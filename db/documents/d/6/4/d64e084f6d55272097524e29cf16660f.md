The manual test (30 degrees stress physical examination) does not require any instrumentation to diagnose an anterior cruciate ligament injury. Remember that the test can be subject to errors, depending on the strength of the operator and the patient's posture. A study showed through an arthrometer that the average force to be applied with the Lachman test is about 80 N (Newton).
