Indications for popliteal artery aneurysm repair include:

- All symptomatic popliteal aneurysms should be repaired. Lower extremity ischemia is the most common presenting symptom, occurring secondary to embolization or thrombosis of the popliteal artery aneurysm.

- Asymptomatic aneurysms that are more than 2 cm in diameter should be repaired in a healthy adult.
