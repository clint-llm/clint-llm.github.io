Occupational diseases can be difficult to identify as work-related, as a disease can have multiple causes, and it can be difficult to determine which specific factors "caused" the disease. In some instances, occupational diseases do not develop untilÂ years after exposure. Some occupational injuries occur as a result of extended exposure to a hazard. Examples of cumulative disorders include hearing loss, carpal tunnel syndrome, and chronic low back pain. For cases in which multiple causes are present, occupational and personal health, the legal standard is to review the preponderance of the evidence to determine work-relatedness or not. The preponderance of the evidence means that it is more likely than not that the illness was caused by, aggravated by, or hastened by workplace exposure.
