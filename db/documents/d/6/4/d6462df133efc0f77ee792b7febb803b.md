Some of the clinical variants of pyoderma gangrenosum include vesicular-bullous, pustular, ulcerative, and superficial granulomatous forms. The vesicular-bullous variant appears on the upper extremities and face and has overlap with another neutrophilic disorder, Sweet syndrome. There can be systemic symptoms including fever and joint pain. The pustular type of pyoderma gangrenosum features many small pustules. These pustules may either resolve or develop into ulcers. This variant is associated with inflammatory bowel disease. In addition to these variants, pyoderma gangrenosum can present as a vegetative form. Certain, less common, sites of involvement, such as the vulva and peristomal area, can be very resistant to treatment. Patients often experience pain associated with the lesions that may be out of proportion to the size of the ulcer. Lesions of pyoderma gangrenosum usually heal with a cribriform scar.

One of the most important features of the disease is a phenomenon known as pathergy. Pathergy is defined as an exaggerated response to a minor skin injury or worsening of an existing wound with minimal insult or trauma. This has a wide array of implications for the patient including debridement and simple wound care. This also makes the decision to perform certain surgeries and procedures much more difficult. Lastly, insults to the skin that would be nearly meaningless for most people can be devastating for some patients with pyoderma gangrenosum.
