The diagnosis is frequently suspected by the patient’s history associated with trigeminal impairment, pres­ence of persistent epithelial defects or ulcers, and decreased corneal sensitivity.

Assessment of the cornea includes a quantitative evaluation of decreased corneal sensation using a Cochet-Bonnet or no-contact gas esthesiometer.

Slit lamp examination can be of great help for identifying the characteristic corneal lesions and for sector iris atrophy, which is characteristic of herpetic infections. An ulcer, if seen, requires microbiological examination to rule out an infection.

Dilated fundus examination may reveal pale or swollen optic disc in cases of intracranial tumors with trigeminal compression. Tear film function should be evaluated because decreased corneal sensitivity may alter the tear film and trigger a vicious circle in which tear film dysfunction worsens the prognosis of neurotrophic keratitis. The eyelids need to be examined, both for diagnostic and prognostic reasons. Lagophthalmos would exacerbate the changes see
