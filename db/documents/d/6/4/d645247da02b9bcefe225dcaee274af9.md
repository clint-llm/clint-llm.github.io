The lateral and medial menisci are crescent-shaped fibrocartilaginous structures that collectively cover approximately 70% of the articular surface of the tibial plateau and primarily function in load transmission and shock absorption through the tibiofemoral joint.  They are wedge-shaped with thicker portions at the periphery of the joint, thereby deepening the articular surface area of the tibial plateau, which improves joint congruency and acts as a secondary stabilizing mechanism within the joint. 70% of each meniscus comprises a network of type I collagen arranged primarily in a circumferential direction.  The inner 2/3 of the adult menisci is avascular and referred to as the "white zone," likely receiving nutrition through diffusion with the synovial fluid.
