The frontal cortex contains four main gyri. The precentral gyrus, which is directly anterior to the central sulcus and runs parallel to it, contains the primary motor cortex (Brodmann area 4). The primary motor cortex is responsible for controlling the voluntary movements of specific body parts. Neuroanatomists and physiologists have developed a map known as the motor homunculus, which pairs particular regions of the primary motor cortex with the body part it controls.  The most medial portion of the motor homunculus represents control of the lower extremities, the intermediate portion represents the upper extremities, and the most lateral represents control of the facial muscles. The pathway which originates in the primary motor cortex to control the extremities is the corticospinal tract, while the pathway that controls voluntary facial movement is the corticobulbar tract.  Within the precentral gyrus and anterior to the primary motor cortex is the prefrontal cortex.  The prefrontal cortex is known to be the higher-order association center of the brain as it is responsible for decision making, reasoning, personality expression, maintaining social appropriateness, and other complex cognitive behaviors.

Rostral to the precentral gyrus and running parallel with the central sulcus is the precentral sulcus.  Extending forward and downward from the precentral sulcus are the superior and inferior frontal sulci, which act to divide the frontal lobe's lateral surface into the remaining three main gyri: the superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri.
