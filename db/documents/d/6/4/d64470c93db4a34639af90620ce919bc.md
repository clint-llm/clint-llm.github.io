Exposure to beryllium can lead to a cell-mediated immune response where T-cells become sensitized to beryllium. Each subsequent exposure leads to an immune response involving macrophages and CD4+ helper T-lymphocytes accumulating in the lungs. As this response proceeds, macrophages, CD+4 T-lymphocytes, and plasma cells aggregate to form noncaseating granulomas that evolve to cause fibrosis of the lung. Studies have revealed there is a genetic component to beryllium sensitivity. Specifically, those beryllium-exposed workers with a mutation at the HLA-DPB1 Glu69 position have increased the prevalence of beryllium sensitization and CBD. The HLA-DPB1 gene is important for MCH class II molecule function on antigen-presenting cells. Beryllium and beryllium compounds are category 1 carcinogens and carcinogenic to both animals and humans.
