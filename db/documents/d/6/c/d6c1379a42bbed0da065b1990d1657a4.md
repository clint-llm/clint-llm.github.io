Hypothyroid myopathy is fairly common but often missed because clinicians fail to ask patients about muscle-related symptoms. It is often mistaken for fatigue. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a pharmacist, orthopedic nurse, therapists, and physicians. The key it to replace the thyroid hormone, encourage physical activity, and enroll in a physical therapy program.

The recovery is not immediate and may take months or even several years. The patient should be monitored by serial CK levels. Even after treatment, residual muscle pain and fatigue may persist in some patients. Nursing staff should assist with monitoring, followup, and education of the patient and family. [Level 5]
