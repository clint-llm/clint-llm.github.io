The exact mechanism of development of Salzmann nodular degeneration (SND) is unknown; however, several important events are thought to contribute to nodule formation. These include disruption of the epithelial basement membrane and Bowman layer, changes in epithelial cells, differentiation and anterior shift of stromal fibroblasts, and deposition of the extracellular matrix material.

Mechanical disruption of the barrier between the epithelium and stroma from trauma, surgery, or chronic corneal irritation from ocular surface diseases, such as meibomian gland disease (MGD) or aqueous deficient dry eye, leads to prolonged wound repair and remodeling of the epithelium thus creating the conditions for excess deposition of extracellular material.
