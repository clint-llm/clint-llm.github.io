BPPV is a veryÂ common presentation in primary care. Estimates are that at least 20% of patients will complain of vertigo during a clinic visit. Tragically, the condition is often misdiagnosed, and patients are erroneously treated for some other disorder, leading to very high morbidity. Primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, urgent care providers, and emergency department clinicians must be aware of this disorder and how to manage it. Once the diagnosis is made and treatment initiated, the prognosis is good. Most people develop symptom resolution in 4 to 6 weeks, although in some patients, the symptoms persist. Despite optimal treatment, there is a 5 to 25% recurrence rate. The risk of recurrence is higher in females, older patients, and those with psychiatric comorbidities.
