The diagnosis and management of ovarian torsion are complex and involve many different healthcare professionals. A female presenting with non-specific symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting may represent a gynecological, obstetrical, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary process. Nursing plays a vital role in getting accurate vitals, drawing labs, and giving medications to help the patient feel better. The emergency room provider needs to take an accurate history, do a good physical exam, and order the appropriate tests. They also need to coordinate care with the interprofessional team. It is also very important for the ultrasound technician to get good images to send to the radiologist.

The radiologist is also necessary to read both ultrasound and CT findings to evaluate for intraabdominal and pelvic processes. Consultation with a gynecologist will also be necessary to take the patient to surgery. In the postoperative period, nurses will play an important role in pain management, patient education, and observing for complications.
