Several interventions have been developed to improve body image.

**General Cognitive-behavioral Techniques**

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most commonly used and most empirically supported intervention to improve body image. CBT aims to target core cognitive and behavioral processes that contribute to negative body image, and helps individuals to modify their dysfunctional thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to their body image.

Examples of techniques

- Discuss cognitions and the role they play in body image

- Teach self-monitoring and restructuring of cognitions

- Teach self-monitoring of behavior

- Change negative body language

- Conduct guided imagery

- Conduct exposure exercises

- Write about the body

- Provide relapse-prevention strategies

- Provide stress management training

**Techniques to Enhance Physical Fitness**

Fitness training interventions comprise aerobic or anaerobic exercises for enhancing physical capacities such as muscular strength, and also for encouraging individuals to focus more on the functionality and less on the appearance.

**Techniques to Provide Media Literacy and to Promote Media Resistance**

Media literacy interventions aim to teach individuals to critically evaluate the appearance ideals that conveyed to them by the media. Examples of techniques

- Discuss the beauty ideal

- Provide media literacy training

**Techniques to Enhance Self-esteem**

Self-esteem enhancing interventions have been found beneficial, safe, and suitable for improving body image. Examples of techniques

- Discuss alternatives to focus on appearance

- Discuss interpersonal relations

- Discuss individual differences

**Techniques Providing Psychoeducation Related to Body Image**

Psychoeducation aims to educate individuals about body image concept, negative body image, and its causes and consequences. Psychoeducation is often useful along with other interventions, such as fitness training interventions or self-esteem enhancement. Examples of techniques

- Discuss the causes of negative body image

- Discuss the consequences of negative body image

- Discuss the concept of body image

- Discuss the behavioral expression of negative body image

**Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT)**

Research into body image has begun to look at the neuropsychological aspects of how an individual with body image disturbance cognitively process information. Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) or Cognitive Enhancement Therapy is a group of interventions that are designed to enhance an individual’s neurocognitive abilities such as cognitive flexibility and planning, attention, working memory, set-shifting, and executive functioning. CRT can identify and target the cognitive impairments specific to an individual.

**Pharmacotherapy in Body Dysmorphic Disorder**

Current clinical guidelines indicate that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) plus serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are the first-line treatments for body dysmorphic disorder. Appropriate pharmacotherapy improves core BDD symptoms, suicidality, and psychosocial functioning in a majority of patients. The patient’s willingness to accept and adhere to pharmacotherapy requires identification since many patients have poor insight and may desire cosmetic treatment instead of pharmacotherapy. The doses of SRI medication necessary to treat BDD are often higher than doses needed to address other common psychiatric disorders, and patients should remain on the medication for relatively long periods.

**Pharmacotherapy in Eating Disorders**

Several drugs have been targets of study in anorexia nervosa treatment, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antidepressants, antipsychotics, nutritional supplementation, and hormonal medications. There is limited evidence supporting pharmacotherapy in anorexia nervosa, and many patients do not respond to the available treatments. In general, drugs are useful for patients with bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED). Antidepressants are the primary pharmacotherapy in bulimia nervosa. For binge eating disorder, Lisdexamphetamin is the first medication to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of binge eating disorder.
