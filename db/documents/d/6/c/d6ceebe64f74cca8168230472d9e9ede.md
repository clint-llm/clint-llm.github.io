Team-based care is an essential part of the medical response to a disaster. Numerous human-made and natural disasters highlight the need for an organized system-wide approach to disaster medical care. As the scope of a disaster progresses beyond local capabilities outside assistance is often needed. Many disaster response systems throughout the world are organized to provide scalable levels of response at the local, regional, and national levels. These disaster response systems are often organized into teams of disaster workers. Disaster teams vary by country and in terms of their objectives and specialization. An initial disaster response typically includes local or regional emergency medical service personnel or local medical assistance teams. Specialized teams may also be involved including surgical responseÂ teams, search and rescue teams, or mortuary assistance teams. Clinicians should understand the levels of response available in their community and the command structure which helps to guide this response.
