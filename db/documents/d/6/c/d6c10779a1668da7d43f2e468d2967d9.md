Treatment of oppositional defiant disorder is multimodal and should involve the patient, family, school, and community. Identifying and treating comorbidities (like ADHD, depression, and anxiety) and modifiable risk factors (such as bullying and learning difficulties) should be done. Treatment may also vary based on whether oppositional behavior primarily occurs in specific contexts or if the behavior is pervasive and thus requires more intensive treatment.

Treatment modalities include parent management training, school-based interventions, individual child therapy, and family therapy. Additionally, identification of attachment security, parent-child relationships, and specific cognitive beliefs held by parents regarding child-rearing may be further explored to provide a framework for the modalities listed below.

Lastly, the identification of comorbidities is an important aspect of treatment in oppositional defiant disorder. ODD, in particular, has been demonstrated to be part of the developmental history of several mental disorders in young adults and additionally has been shown to predict depression and anxiety later in life consistently.

**Parent Management Training (PMT)**

PMT is based on the principles of social learning theory and is the main treatment for oppositional behaviors. The guiding principle in PMT is the use of operant conditioning (using the role of positive reinforcement in changing behaviors) to decrease unwanted behaviors and promote prosocial behaviors.

Two notable parent management training programs are Webster-Stratton’s “Incredible Years” and the Triple P program. The former entails 13 to 16 two-hour weekly sessions during which parents are shown videos of correct and incorrect ways of child management, and are then asked to rehearse different approaches and complete weekly activities at home, with progress reported via telephone. The latter program comprises multiple levels of intervention, including advice and training programs, in addition to coping and support skills for both parent and child. Both parent management training programs have been shown to decrease conduct problems in multiple contexts and family backgrounds significantly.

**School-based Interventions**

Supportive interventions to improve school performance, peer relationships, and problem-solving skills are particularly useful in the treatment of ODD. This may include education and specific tools for the teacher to improve classroom behavior, techniques to prevent oppositional behavior or the escalation of such behavior, and other methods that facilitate adherence to classroom rules and acceptable social norms.

Individual therapy:

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) based anger management training is useful in treating anger problems. In older children, problem-solving skills training and perspective-taking are also CBT components that may alleviate aggressive behaviors.

**Pharmacologic Therapy**

As psychosocial interventions are the first-line treatment for children with ODD, pharmacologic agents are typically reserved for cases in which aggressive and disruptive behaviors cannot be managed by the above treatment modalities alone. Treatment of comorbidities is paramount and should be the first option considered, and the potential burden of side effects carefully considered. In cases of severe comorbid emotional dysregulation or severe aggression, an atypical antipsychotic may be added. Risperidone has the best evidence for control of aggressive behaviors, followed by aripiprazole.

Stimulants, including methylphenidate, are helpful in cases of comorbid ADHD, and non-stimulants such as atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine also have beneficial effects. Clear treatment goals should be identified prior to the initiation of pharmacotherapy, and adverse effects should be discussed with the patient (if applicable) and family members and regularly assessed on follow-up. The use of pharmacologic agents in the acute setting should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis after careful consideration by the clinician.
