The common carotid artery bifurcates in the cervical region and gives rise to the external and internal carotid artery. The internal carotid artery travels superiorly and enters the skull via the carotid canal. After entering the carotid canal, the internal carotid makes a 90-degree turn and travels horizontally in the petrous part of the temporal bone - this is the petrous part of the internal carotid artery. The petrous part of the internal carotid then enters the cavernous sinus via the foramen lacerum. In the cavernous sinus, the internal carotid artery is also referred to as the cavernous part. The cavernous part travels horizontally and anteriorly until it reaches the anterior limit of the sinus, where it curves vertically, exits the sinus superiorly, and becomes the cerebral part of the internal carotid artery. It is important to mention that the cavernous part of the internal carotid artery is the only artery in the body that is surrounded completely by venous blood.
