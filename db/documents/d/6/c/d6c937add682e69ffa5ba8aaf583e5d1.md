Peripheral neuropathy is a condition present in a wide range of etiologies. Of these etiologies, diabetes remains the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy, with about 50% of diabetic patients experiencing some form of peripheral neuropathy. However, many patients also experience peripheral neuropathy secondary to other etiologies, making the diagnoses and treatment of these conditions difficult. Although other forms of non-invasive testing are available, once these have been exhausted the sural nerve biopsy becomes a valuable option for potential diagnosis and treatment. In this activity, we will discuss the anatomy, indications, procedural technique, complications, and follow up needed for a sural nerve biopsy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of a sural nerve biopsy.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to a sural nerve biopsy.
- Review appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of a sural nerve biopsy.
- Summarize the guidelines for sural nerve biopsy.
