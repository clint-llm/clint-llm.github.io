- MIRM is thought to be a clinically distinct entity from other mucocutaneous eruptions.

- Historical features suggesting MIRM include a pulmonary infection approximately one week before the onset of the rash.Â  Other mucocutaneous reactions, such as EM often develops after a history of herpes simplex infection (recent oral ulcers), or the rash of SJS/TEN may occur in the context of new medication use.

- The rash pattern of MIRM may be different than other conditions. Mucous membrane involvement is almost always seen. The cutaneous rash of MIRM is more often sparse, rather than consolidated. It is more often located in acral areas (limbs). The type of rash in MIRM is usually vesiculobullous or target lesions.

- Although MIRM may have some long-term sequelae, such as mucous membrane damage and cutaneous skin changes, MIRM usually has a more benign course compared to other conditions, such as SJS/TEN.

- Treatment of different types of MIRM is not well defined, but patients with active pneumonia reasonably should receive organism directed antibiotics. Consultation with an infectious disease specialist or dermatologist may help to direct care.
