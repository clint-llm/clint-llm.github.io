Establishing the diagnosis of HD is generally based on pathological documentation compatible with the absence of ganglion cells. However, several obstacles have been well-defined in the process of obtaining a definitive pathological diagnosis. These include a lack of pathologists' expertise due to the rare exposure to the samples, inadequate and unacceptable quality, disorientation of the submitted tissue to the pathology ward, and normal immature ganglion cells in newborns.

A paramount component of the evaluation process in HD consists of the assessment of the obtained rectal tissue via specific staining methods, including acetylcholinesterase (AChE). However, the crucial role of routine staining methods, including H and E, should not be underestimated. Fresh frozen section tissues might be assessed with ACE staining.

The presence of the transition zone, a reversal of recto-sigmoid ratio, mucosal irregularity, irregular contraction, and persistent contrast retention (more than 24 hours) are features of HD on a contrast enema.
