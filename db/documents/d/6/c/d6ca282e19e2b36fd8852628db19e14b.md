Spider angiomas are usually benign but often can be suggestive of an underlying systemic disease such as cirrhosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or thyrotoxicosis. Solitary spider angiomasÂ are seen in 15% of young adults who usually have fewer than 3 lesions. The lesions also can appear in other physiologic conditions like pregnancy or severe malnutrition. Multiple spider angiomas are characteristic of chronic liver disease with a specificity of 95%.
