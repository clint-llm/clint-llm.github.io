Clinical suspicion in patients with risk factors related to MRSA infection is crucial in diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. Confirmation of MRSA infection should not delay treatment with empiric antibiotics against MRSA. Clinicians should send samples from suspected sources of infection for analysis including blood, sputum, urine, or wound scraping.

A positive Gram stain with cocci in clusters is suggestive of S. aureus. DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of MRSA is the most sensitive test and gold standard test if cultures are inconclusive.

DNA PCR of MRSA from nares is a frequently employed diagnostic test to rule out MRSA colonization. It is not a confirmatory test of MRSA infection, but a negative test is highly sensitive to rule out MRSA infection.

Sputum cultures are not very specific or sensitive to diagnose MRSA pneumonia, therefore bronchoalveolar lavage or a deep tracheal aspirate for intubated or tracked patients can be performed to identify the organism in patients with HAP or VAP.
