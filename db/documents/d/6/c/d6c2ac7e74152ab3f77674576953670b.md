The esophagus is roughly 25 centimeters in length, with upper and lower esophageal sphincters marking the entrance and exit to this elongated organ.

The esophagus is fed by several different arterial branches. The cervical esophagus derives its blood supply from the inferior thyroid artery. The thoracic esophagus has direct, terminal branches from the esophagus. The abdominal portion is supplied by the left gastric artery and the left phrenic artery. Venous drainage is similarly segmental with drainage into the superior vena cava and the systemic system from the azygous and inferior thyroid veins. The distal esophagus drains into the left gastric, which emptiesÂ into the portal vein. This connection of systemic and portal circulation can lead to distended veins in patients with cirrhosis called esophageal varices.

The main function of the esophagus is the transportation of the food bolus. It accomplishes this through complex, muscular coordination of peristaltic waves. The esophagus has two different types of muscle. In the cervical esophagus, the muscular layers are striated, whereas, in the thoracic and abdominal, they are smooth muscles.
