Prevention and modification of factors involved in the primary etiology should be conveyed to the patient. Affected patients are cautioned that they must turn the head to see into the defective field, but most of them learn to do that anyway. As a superior quadrantanopia usually does not affect the quality of life of the patient, they have to make only minimal adjustments to their daily routine.

In patients with dense homonymous hemianopias, crossing the street independently may be challenging. Also, the defect makes driving problematic. Many have difficulty reading, because left hemianopia may hamper their ability to find the beginning of the next line, and right hemianopia may not allow them to appreciate the entire line of words (hemianopic alexia). Family members are instructed to approach the patient from within the intact hemifield and keep food, utensils, and beverages within the patient’s intact hemifield when eating.
