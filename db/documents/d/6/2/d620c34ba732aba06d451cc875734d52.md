HLA Typing:

HLA typing is defined polymorphisms of class I and class II loci.****Serology was the first HLA typing methodology. The microcytoxicity method detects the presence of antigen by cytotoxic cell death induced by activation of complement. In this in vitro assay, T or B lymphocytes are isolated from an individual and are incubated with serum containing HLA antibodies of a known HLA specificity obtained from multiparous women.

There are three different categories of DNA based molecular HLA typing methods available. All of these methods determine the HLA types based on polymorphisms identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology which uses a heat-stable DNA polymerase to amplify the target sequences of HLA genes rapidly.

1- Sequence-specific primer (SSP) typing: This technique uses sequence-specific primer pairs that target and amplify a particular DNA sequence where PCR primers are designed to bind only to a specific HLA allele or allele groups. Confirmation of the amplified alleles is by the presence or absence of DNA amplification by a particular primer pair that are visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis**.**

2- Sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOP): This technique is frequently used in clinical histocompatibility laboratories. This method identifies HLA polymorphisms using oligonucleotide probes on a solid phase matrix (i.e., microbeads) in broadly generated, exon and locus-specific PCR products.

3- Sequence-based typing (SBT): This technique is performable on several different platforms. One is Sanger-based DNA sequencing, and the other platforms have their basis in next-generation sequencing. The most common application of SBT typing is to identify allelic level HLA typing for stem cell transplantation recipients and donors. An allele refers to a unique nucleotide sequence for a gene. By DNA based typing nomenclature, allelic resolution utilizes all the digits in a current allele name. (A*01:01:01:01). This methodology allows for confirmation of new allelic sequences.

As HLA typing methods developed and molecular HLA typing replaced serologic methodology, HLA nomenclature has changed to reflect the complexity of the output of the advanced typing methodologies.

HLA Antibody Testing:

Identification of HLA antibodies is important in a pre-transplant and post-transplant setting in solid organ transplantation. Currently, single antigen bead assays are the most common approach for HLA antibody identification. This test is a solid phase assay that utilizes microbeads coated with recombinant single HLA antigens. The analysis is performed on a specialized flow cytometry platform.

Crossmatching:

Flow cytometric crossmatch is an essential test to determine the compatibility between a donor and a recipient. It assay is frequently used prior to transplantation of solid organs.
