The knee joint is comprised of synovial fluid, which is an ultrafiltrate of blood plasma and includes hyaluronic acid, glycoproteins, lubricin, proteinases, and collagenases. Inflamed synovium contains large clefts, allowing molecules of almost any size to pass through its membrane, causing an effusion. Synovial fluid also contains proteins that areÂ identical to plasma proteins. The hyaluronic acid in the synovial fluid prevents friction and provides lubrication to the knee joint. Synovial fluid has antibacterial properties that help maintain a sterile environment for the joint.
