Management of filovirus disease and an outbreak is an interprofessional undertaking requiring the mobilization of not just resources within the hospital managing the patient, but also local resources to contain the spread of disease, identify infected individuals, and educate the population. National and global resources such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) assist in managing the local cases, identify the origin of the outbreak, prevent spread, provide diagnostic aid from high-level biosafety laboratories, and provide experimental treatment options.

Within the hospital, multiple specialists are needed to coordinate the care of critically ill patients requiring input from gastroenterology, nephrology, infectious disease, hematology, specialty-trained nursing, pharmacy, among possibly many others.  Infectious disease board-certified pharmacists can assist in the supportive measures or cutting edge unproven therapies if desired. Nursing will provide supportive care and monitor the patient's condition, reporting any status changes to the team. Furthermore, coordination of containment within the hospital and minimization lab draws and therefore, of exposure risks for healthcare workers is essential given the possibility of laboratory-acquired infection and person-person transmission. Thus, an interprofessional team approach is needed for both care and containment.
