Following equipment is required for an echocardiographic examination.

- Echocardiographic machine

- Electrocardiographic leads

- Gel, for good surface contact

- Echocardiographic contrast

- Saline for bubble contrast

- Intravenous cannula

- Defibrillator for emergency arrhythmias

**Echocardiography Terms**

- Frequency: Sound waves are mechanical vibrations. The number of vibrations per unit time is called frequency, expressed in Hertz, 1 Hz = 1 vibration per second. Higher the frequency of the probe, the better the resolution but, the lesser the penetration.

- Grayscale: This indicates the different amplitude detected by the ultrasound system. High amplitudes are displayed bright, low amplitudes as dark grey, and no signal as black.

- Depth and Sector: Adjusting depth helps to adjust the size of the image on the screen. Sector indicates the width of the scan area.  Both influence frame rate. Higher the frame rate, the higher is the resolution.

- Gain: Increasing gain increases the overall brightness of the image.

- TGC (time gain compensation):  This compensates for attenuation of ultrasound energy with depth. These knobs help to increase or decrease the brightness at different depth levels.

- Frame Rate: The more the frame rate, the better the temporal resolution. Decreasing the depth, narrowing the sector width, or using live zoom can increase the frame rate.
