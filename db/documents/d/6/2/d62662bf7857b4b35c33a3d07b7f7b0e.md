Replacement therapy with Von Willebrand factor (vWF) can be used to manage and treat Von Willebrand disease (vWD), especially in patients who are refractory to treatment with desmopressin. It is available as plasma-derived concentrates and, more recently, recombinant form. This activity reviews the indications, actions, and contraindications for using vWF as a therapeutic agent in the management of vWD. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors like dosing, monitoring, and relevant interactions pertinent for interprofessional team members involved in the care of patients with vWD.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the physiology of the Von Willebrand factor in the body and its role in hemostasis.
- Outline the indications in the administration of the Von Willebrand factor.
- Review the pharmacokinetics of the Von Willebrand factor.
- SUmmarize some interprofessional strategies that can help to improve patient outcomes when using von Willebrand factor therapeutically.
