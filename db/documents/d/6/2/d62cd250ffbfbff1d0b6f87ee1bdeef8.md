Patient education about the nature of the disease plays a vital role in improving the prognosis of patients, reducing morbidity and mortality, and improving their lifestyles. Ideally, early detection, follow up, and adequate treatment helps decrease the burden of the disease on the patients and their families. Hemophilia patients should use cold packs, immobilization, splinting, acetaminophen, and codeine for pain. It is necessary to prevent the use of anticoagulants, aspirin, and NSAIDs to avoid complications.

For children undergoing vaccination, special precautions should be taken by using 23 gauge needle and applying ice packs for five minutes with a factor replacement to be given soon after the procedure. Appropriate dental care should be encouragedÂ for all children with at least two times per day dental cleaning with flossing, and physical activity is a recommendation in all children with hemophilia.

There is no data that shows a preference of either cesarean or vaginal delivery in a pregnant woman with a child diagnosed with hemophilia in utero. But the use of operative vaginal delivery (use of forceps, vacuum extraction) should be avoided due to increased risk of intracranial bleeding and cephalohematoma. Circumcision should be deferred until the diagnosis is confirmed or excluded.
