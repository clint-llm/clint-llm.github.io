Neuroablation can lead to the development of deafferentation pain, which is why indications for neuraxial neurolysis are primarily for patients with less than a year life expectancy. NeuraxialÂ blockade might decrease the quality of life of patients with cancer by inducing motor weakness, incontinence, sexual dysfunction or loss of position sense. Reports of bowel paresis occur in less than 1 percent of patients. There is less risk of complications mentioned above with epidural neurolysis compared with subarachnoid neurolysis. There is also the risk of post-dural puncture headache.
