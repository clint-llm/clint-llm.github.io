The exact etiology of MS is unknown. Factors involved in pathogenesis broadly group into three categories:

- Immune factors

- Environmental factors

- Genetic associations

Dysimmunity with an autoimmune attack on the central nervous system is the leading hypothesized etiology of MS. Although there are various proposed hypothetical mechanisms, the postulated “out-side-in” mechanism involves CD4+ proinflammatory T cells.

Environmental factors, including latitudinal gradients in different countries, have been well-studied phenomena.

There is a high risk of MS in patients with biological relatives with MS. Heritability is estimated to be between 35 and 75%.
