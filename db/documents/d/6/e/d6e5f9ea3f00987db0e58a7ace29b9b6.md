Patient-centered management should include counseling on diagnostic work-up and treatment choices, individualizing patients with different risk factors for local or distant recurrence. Tumor staging should be done early, and repeated with more information, commonly after excision biopsy, and using the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system for patients with soft tissue sarcomas that arise in extremity/trunk.
