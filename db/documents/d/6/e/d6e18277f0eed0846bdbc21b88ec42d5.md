Acutely, lesions may begin as papules or vesicles that coalescence into plaques. When established, lesions will appear symmetrically distributed, sharply defined, round or coin-shaped, erythematous, and eczematous plaques ranging in size from 1 to 10 cm.  Late-stage lesions may develop a drier scale and lichenification. Lesions may be associated with mild to intense pruritus. Lesion and symptom severity are exacerbated by behaviors that decrease the skin's natural moisture barrier, such as harsh soaps and long, hot, frequent showering. The lower extremities are most commonly involved, followed by the upper extremities and trunk. The face and scalp are spared.  Post-inflammatory pigmentary changes commonly persist after resolution. Dermoscopic findings may reveal scales, shiny yellow clods, and irregularly distributed brownish-red globules.
