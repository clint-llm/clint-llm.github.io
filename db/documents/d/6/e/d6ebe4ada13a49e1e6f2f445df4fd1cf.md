Photodynamic therapy (PDT) usually involves the injection or topical application of a photosensitizing compound, which gets accumulated in the desired target cells, which are then irradiated by the light of a specific wavelength.

Photodynamic therapy basically requires three things i.e. a photosensitizer, a light source, and oxygen. It involves the application of a topical photosensitizing agent over a targeted area, followed by activation of the agent by light irradiation. It will lead to the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates in the presence of oxygen. These intermediates act on essential cellular components leading to apoptosis and necrosis due to irreversible oxidization. Photodynamic therapy was discovered almost a century back, but its clinical application is relatively new. It was only after the 1970s that the wider use of photodynamic therapy started, and many different newer indications of PDT were added. PDT is used for several pathologies in dermatology.

Although the current role of PDT in ophthalmology in today's era is quite limited, it has been in use for about the past 30 years. Choroidal neovascular membrane underneath the fovea was the first indication for which PDT was put into use in ophthalmology in the early 1990s. For PDT in ophthalmology, verteporfin is the most preferred agent owing to its lipophilic properties, short half-life (which lessens the chances of it causing skin sensitivity) and also because it has a favorable absorption spectrum.
