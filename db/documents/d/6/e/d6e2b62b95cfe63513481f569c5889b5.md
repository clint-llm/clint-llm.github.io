The diagnosis and management of quadriceps tendon rupture are best managed by an interprofessional healthcare team that includes an emergency department clinician, physical therapist, radiologist, sports clinician, orthopedic surgeon, and specialty orthopedic nurse,Â and all members of the team must utilize open communication regarding patient progress and recovery, whether or not the case requires surgery. Interprofessional case management will yield improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]

Like most musculoskeletal injuries, initial management of suspected quadriceps tendon ruptures includes rest, ice, compression, and elevation. Partial quadriceps tendon ruptures may be managed non-operatively. However, most complete quadriceps tendon ruptures require early diagnosis and surgical treatment to limit long-term morbidity and disability. The timing of surgical repair has been attributed to optimal recovery and functionality rather than the specific surgical approach.

The outcomes for most patients are good, but the recovery is often prolonged. Without physical therapy, recurrences are known to occur.
