Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory myopathy distinguished by a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate of the striated muscle. Genetic susceptibility is no longer in doubt since predisposing HLA systems have been identified. There is an activation of the complement leading to the deposition of the membrane attack complex in the wall of blood vessels, which causes microangiopathy and an inflammatory reaction.

Because the disorder appears to have seasonal clustering, it is believed that some infectious organisms may be playing a role in self-tolerance and generation of the autoimmune response. Infections implicated include:

- Parvovirus B19

- Coxsackievirus

- Streptococcus

- Enteroviruses

Non-infectious agents implicated include silica exposure, silicone implants, and medications that decrease lipids. There is a strong association of JDM with HLA-DR3.
