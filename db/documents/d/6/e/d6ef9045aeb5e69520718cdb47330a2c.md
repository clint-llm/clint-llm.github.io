Gastric stasis is associated with high morbidity and because of the many causes, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a gastroenterologist, endocrinologist, surgeon, internist, pharmacist, dietitian and the primary care provider. The pharmacist has to ensure that the patient is not on any medications that cause gastric paralysis. All reversible causes have to be sought and treated. Patients with diabetes need to manage their blood sugars well. Unfortunately, despite optimal treatment, gastric stasis is often a chronic problem that leads to poor quality of life. Some patients need continuous TPN and others need comprehensive changes in diet and lifestyle.

To date, the use of prokinetic drugs has not been effective. Placement of pacemakers in the stomach does work in a few people but there are no long term studies.

Surgical approaches include venting gastrostomy, feeding jejunostomy, pyloroplasty, and partial gastrectomy are performed when medical therapy fails for symptom relief.
