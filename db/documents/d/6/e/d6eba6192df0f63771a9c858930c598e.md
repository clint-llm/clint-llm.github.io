Human bites can be very serious and are best managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals. Loss of function and cosmetic deformity are very common complications. All patients should understand the signs of an infection following a human bite and when to seek treatment. Patients need to understand that long-term follow-up is necessary to prevent loss of function of the hand or fingers. In addition, the pharmacist should emphasize the importance of antibiotic compliance. Finally, all patients must be told that they may require a plastic surgery procedure later to improve function or cosmesis. Nurses can perform an initial evaluation and chart treatment progress, as well as answering patient questions, and reporting any concerns to the treating clinician.

**Outcomes**

Patients who seek immediate care after a human bite have excellent outcomes. However, patients who delay treatment tend to have adverse outcomes. In most cases, a florid infection develops which can involve the entire hand. In delayed cases, not only is there is a significant cosmetic deformity, but there is also a functional loss of the hand and fingers. Human bites on the nose, ear, or tips of the finger are difficult to cure and often require extensive plastic surgery. Scarring is another major complication of a human bite.
