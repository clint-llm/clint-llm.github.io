Vincristine belongs to a group of drugs known as the vinca alkaloids. Vinca alkaloids are organic compounds made up of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen derived from the periwinkle plant. These drugs block cell growth by stopping mitosis by interfering with microtubule polymerization. Other drugs in this class approved for use inÂ the United States include vinblastine and vinorelbine.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved indications of vincristine are acute lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia, and Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Vincristine also has several off-label uses that include central nervous system (CNS) tumors, Ewing sarcoma, gestational trophoblastic tumors, multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer, primary CNS lymphoma, small cell lung cancer, and advanced thymoma in adult patients.
