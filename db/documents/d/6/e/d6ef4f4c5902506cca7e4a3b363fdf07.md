Classic glycolipid-laden macrophages are found in liver biopsy and bone marrow samples.

Liver biopsy samples typically reveal glycolipid-laden Gaucher cells evident in the sinusoids, but the hepatocytes do not manifest overt glycolipid storage because of biliary excretion of glucocerebroside and because exogenous glycolipid turnover is typically handled by the mononuclear phagocytes. As hepatocytes are spared, there is a very low incidence of liver failure in individuals with Gaucher disease.

The pathologic hallmark of Gaucher disease is Gaucher cells in the macrophage-monocyte system typically found in the bone marrow. These cells have a characteristic wrinkled-paper appearance, resulting from intracytoplasmic substrate deposition, and stain positive with periodic acid–Schiff. Histologic evaluation should not be used as a primary diagnostic tool.
