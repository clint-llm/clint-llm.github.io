The exergonic process of electron transfer from NADH to oxygen couples with the endergonic process of ATP synthesis. Thus, catabolic reactions (that utilize ATP) get coupled with the anabolic reaction of ATP synthesis. Both reactions require each other to operate. Approximately 30 - 32 ATP molecules are generated from the electron transport chain, while the yield for glycolysis alone is only 2 ATP. ATP generation in oxidative phosphorylation is significantly greater than glycolysis alone, due to the efficiency of energy extraction in the electron transport chain (ETC).

The transfer of energy from reduced electron carriers to oxygen occurs through the pumping of hydrogen ions (also called proton or H+ ion) into the intermembrane space. This process is referred to as chemiosmosis because of the difference in H+ ion concentration between the intermembrane space and the mitochondrial matrix. The electrochemical gradient generated by H+ ions pumped into the intermembrane space is termed the ‘**proton motive**’ force.

To harness the proton motive force to generate ATP, ETC utilizes the final complex, ATP synthase (complex V). The energy expended from pumping H+ ions into the intermembrane space is equivalent to the energy generated by ATP synthase. Therefore, the first law of thermodynamics is maintained.
