A dysplastic nevus is also referred to as an atypical or Clark’s nevus and has been the topic of much debate in the fields of dermatology and dermatopathology. It is an acquired mole demonstrating a unique clinical and histopathologic appearance that sets it apart from the common nevus. These moles appear atypical clinically, often with a “fried-egg” appearance, and are commonly biopsied by providers due to the concern for melanoma. A clinical diagnosis of atypical nevi is based upon the presence of at least three of the following features: diameter greater than 5 mm, ill-defined borders, irregular margins, and lesional color variation. Individuals with these nevi have an increased risk for melanoma, but contrary to some individual beliefs, these are concerned banal nevi.
