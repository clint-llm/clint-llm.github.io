- In the United States of America, GBS is known to be the most common infectious cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates

- Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is only effective in the prevention of early-onset GBS infection

- The CDC recommends universal screening with GBS rectovaginal culture between 35 to 37 weeks in each pregnancy

- Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended with positive GBS rectovaginal culture, GBS bacteriuria at any timeÂ during the pregnancy, or a history of delivery of infant affected by early onset GBS infection

- If GBS status is unknown, antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended during preterm labor and delivery (less than 37 weeks), in the presence of maternal fever during labor, or with prolonged rupture of membranes (greater than 18 hours)

- Intravenous Penicillin G is the antibiotic of choice for intrapartum prophylaxis

- Additional options for antibiotic prophylaxis are ampicillin, cefazolin, clindamycin, or vancomycin
