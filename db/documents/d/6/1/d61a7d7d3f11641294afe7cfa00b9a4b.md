Both hereditary or familial and acquired causes of hypokalemic periodic paralysis have been identified. Familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis is caused by a mutation in either of two genes, calcium or sodium ion channel gene mutation. Over the last few decades, various mutations have been identified as a cause of HypoKPP. The most common familial form, type 1 HypoKPP, has a mutation in the dihydropyridine-sensitive, skeletal muscle calcium channel gene, CACNA1S. While the other familial form, type 2 HypoKPP, has mutations in the voltage-sensitive skeletal muscle sodium channel gene, SCN4A. Disease-causing mutations in the gene KCNJ2 and KCNJ18, code for inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channel, have also been identified.
