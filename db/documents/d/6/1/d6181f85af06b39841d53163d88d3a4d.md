Solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) is defined as a single lung opacity of size less than 3 cm. It is usually discrete and does not attach to the lung border or pleura. Associated lymphadenopathy is characteristically absent. Though most of the SPNs are benign in nature, these nodules pose diagnostic challenges for the physicians, especially when they are incidentally discovered during routine CT scans of the chest in relatively asymptomatic patients. Differentiating the benign and malignant nature of these nodules could be very challenging in the absence of biopsy. With the complications associated with the biopsies or repeated "unnecessary" CT scans of the chest, a systematic approach becomes essential in evaluating these nodules. Since its initial publication in 2005, Fleischner Society guidelines (updated in 2017) are utilized by most clinicians worldwide to evaluate the SPN and other pulmonary nodules.
