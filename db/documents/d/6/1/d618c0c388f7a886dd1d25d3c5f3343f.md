The Amsler grid is valid in the following scenarios

- Wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) - The choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) causes metamorphopsia and new scotoma

- Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) - Causes a central scotoma which may be round or oval depending on the shape of neurosensory retinal detachment

- Epiretinal membrane and other vitreoretinal interface diseases, which causes metamorphopsia.

- Acute macular neuroretinopathy - Flower petal-like scotoma is seen corresponding to fundus lesions which become more prominent in near-infrared (NIR) or multicolor imaging

- Cystoid macular edema - The distance between the photoreceptors increase due to macular edema, and things appear smaller (micropsia); cystoid macular edema may result from diabetic maculopathy, retinal vein occlusion, intermediate uveitis, CNVM, and other diseases

- Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy- The grid might reveal an altitudinal defect in the visual field

- Pituitary tumor - The Amsler grid may be used to demonstrate bitemporal hemianopia

- Hydroxychloroquine retinopathy may cause central scotoma; however, Amsler grid is currently not recommended as a screening tool for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy
