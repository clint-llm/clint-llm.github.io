The most common bacteria to cause IE for dental and respiratory procedures are the various Streptococcus viridans species. The recommended prophylactic antibiotic is amoxicillin 2 grams orally 1 hour before the procedure. If the patient needs intravenous (IV) medication, ampicillin or ceftriaxone may be used. Cephalexin or azithromycin may be used in patients with a penicillin allergy. There is new penicillin resistance of the Streptococcus viridian; therefore, the prescribing physician must consider the resistance in their practice area when prescribing the appropriate antibiotic. In cases where Staphylococcus aureus is suspected, antistaphylococcal penicillin or vancomycin is recommended.

Recent American Heart Association guidelines suggest that clindamycin is no longer recommended as an alternative antibiotic regimen for patients undergoing dental procedures, given more severe adverse drug reactions associated with this clindamycin.

Usually, antibiotics need to be administered 30 to 60 minutes before the planned procedure. However, only intravenous vancomycin needs to be administered two hours before the planned procedure. As per the 2013 guidelines for preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis of infective endocarditis, the desired timing for antibiotic administration is within 60 minutes before surgery. However, if the antibiotic prophylaxis is accidentally not administered before the dental procedure, it can be administered up to two hours after a performed procedure.
