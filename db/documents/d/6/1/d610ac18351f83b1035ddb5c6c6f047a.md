Bladder injury is broadly divided into extraperitoneal and intraperitoneal injuries. Extraperitoneal bladder injuries generally occur with pelvic fractures, while intraperitoneal bladder injuries occur with high-energy impact to an overdistended bladder. Extraperitoneal bladder injury is managed with an indwelling catheter, while intraperitoneal and complex bladder injuries are definitively repaired. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of traumatic bladder injury and highlights the role of the interprofessional health team in improving the care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of extraperitoneal and intraperitoneal bladder injury.
- Outline the indications for non-operative and operative management of bladder injury.
- Summarize the imaging findings associated with extraperitoneal and intraperitoneal bladder injury.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with bladder trauma.
