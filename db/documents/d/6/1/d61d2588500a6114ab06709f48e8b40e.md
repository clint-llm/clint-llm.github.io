- Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L

- When considering pseudohyponatremia, a careful review of the history of present illness, past medical history, medications, and a physical examination to exclude true hyponatremia should take place.

- For hyponatremia, serum osmolality is necessary to characterize the low sodium level further. Pseudohyponatremia is associated with normal serum osmolality, which is defined as a value between 280 and 300 mOsm/kg.

- Hyponatremia treatment varies considerably depending on serum osmolality and assessment of volume status; misdiagnosis can lead to improper management with potentially fatal outcomes. Therefore, before diagnosing pseudohyponatremia, true hyponatremia, or hyponatremia due to the presence of an osmotically active solute should be excluded.

- After establishing the diagnosis of pseudohyponatremia, one must construct a broad differential for possible etiology. The most common etiologies are disease states that predispose the patient to abnormal accumulation of cholesterol components or proteins in the blood.

- Management of pseudohyponatremia focuses on the treatment of the underlying disorder.

- Pseudohyponatremia is a lab error that by itself does not carry an increased risk of morbidity or mortality; however, many conditions that result in pseudohyponatremia correlate with increased health risk.

- In many cases, direct measurement of serum sodium level with direct potentiometry is not necessary.

- Patient education should involve discussing the diagnosis and specific emphasis on the proper treatment of the underlying medical condition.
