The symptoms of CO poisoning can be variable which explains why only 5% to 6% of patients who present to the emergency department with CO poisoning receive HBOT.

Most commonly, patients will present with headaches (more than 90%), dizziness, weakness, and nausea. Patients may be tachycardic and tachypneic. They may exhibit hypotension. Mental status changes such as confusion, altered level of consciousness, disorientation, and memory loss may occur. Intraocular findings may include retinal hemorrhages, congestion with papilledema. The kidneys are susceptible to ischemic injury from CO poisoning. The classic symptoms of cherry red nail beds and mucous membranes are not "classic" and are usually post-mortem findings. Patients may also develop ataxia, apraxia, incontinence, and cortical blindness.
