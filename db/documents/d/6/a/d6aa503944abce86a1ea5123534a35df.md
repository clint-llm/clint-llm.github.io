**Nitroprusside is Contraindicated in the Following Situations**

- Treatment of compensatory hypertension, such as that seen with arteriovenous malformations or aortic coarctation

- SNP should not be used for inducing controlled perioperative hypotension in patients with known inadequate cerebral perfusion

- Acute heart failure with low systemic vascular resistance (e.g., septic shock)

- Leber's hereditary optic atrophy*

- Tobacco amblyopia*

- Vitamin B12 deficiency (or associated disease states)

- SNP must not be used simultaneously with phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil (due to the synergistic cGMP-mediated mechanism of action)

- Known hypersensitivity to nitroprusside or any component of the formulation

*These patients are deficient in rhodanese. (rhodanese, also known as rhodanase, thiosulfate cyanide transsulfurase, thiosulfate sulfurtransferase, and thiosulfate thiotransferase, is a mitochondrial enzyme that detoxifies cyanide by converting it to thiocyanate).

**Precautions**

- Before use for controlled perioperative hypotension, correct any underlying hypovolemia and/or anemia (if possible)

- Use extreme caution in the setting of acute myocardial infarction in consideration of SNP's potent hemodynamic effects and potential for inducing coronary steal.

- In the setting of hepatic impairment, use extreme caution; monitor closely for cyanide toxicity.

- In the setting of renal dysfunction, use the lowest possible dose and monitor closely for thiocyanate toxicity.

**Additional Considerations**

Pregnancy Category C

- Although there is only limited information regarding the use of SNP in pregnancy, animal studies demonstrate its ability to cross the placental barrier, causing a dose-dependent increase in fetal cyanide levels.

Breastfeeding Considerations

- While it is unclear if SNP is present in breast milk, the potential for serious adverse reactions in the infant warrant either discontinuation of breastfeeding or discontinuation of SNP depending on the clinical scenario.
