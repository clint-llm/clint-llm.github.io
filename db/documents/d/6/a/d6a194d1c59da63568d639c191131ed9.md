Preparing for TJC evaluations and surveys can be a difficult task for healthcare organizations and their workers. The organizations must be up to date with TJC standards, policies, processes, and procedures at all times due to the common practice by TJC of unannounced visits. For example, the Joint Commission has Quality Measures for Acute Myocardial Infection or Congestive Heart Failure. This resource is useful for healthcare providers to make sure they do not overlook any highly effective measures. These checklist items allow for organization and consistency to ensure that each hospital is doing what it must to improve standardization across the hospitals.
