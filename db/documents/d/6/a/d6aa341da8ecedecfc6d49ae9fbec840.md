Autoimmune hepatitis should be considered in all individuals with both acute and chronic liver disease. Diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis requires exclusion of other chronic causes of liver disease including Wilson disease, drug-induced hepatitis, nonalcoholic hepatosteatosis (NASH), chronic viral hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).

A multi-pronged approach is used to make a diagnosis. This approach includes determining symptoms, laboratory tests, and biopsies, as no single diagnostic test is pathognomonic for autoimmune hepatitis. Marked elevation of serum transaminases (AST, ALT) and gamma-globulin is common; elevation in alkaline phosphatase is less common.  The serum levels of AST, ALT, and gamma globulin reflect disease severity and immediate prognosis at presentation.

The serologic markers required for the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis include antinuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibodies (SMA), and antibodies to liver-kidney microsome type 1 (anti-LKM1). Indirect immunofluorescence detects ANA, SMA, and anti-LKM1.  The diagnostic accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of these markers are 74%, 99%, and 43%, respectively. Anti-liver cytosol type I, anti-soluble liver antigen (SLA) antibodies, and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA) can also be associated with autoimmune hepatitis.

Anti-SLA antibodies are more useful from a prognostic standpoint as these are associated with more severe disease, treatment failure, and a higher relapse rate. Liver biopsy is required for both diagnosis and staging of autoimmune hepatitis.
