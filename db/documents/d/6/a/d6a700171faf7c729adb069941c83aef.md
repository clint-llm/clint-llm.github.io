The effectiveness rate of using the symptothermal method as a means of preventing unplanned pregnancy is controversial and highly debated. Multiple sources and studies report different results. An observational longitudinal cohort study conducted in Germany since 1985 reported a pregnancy rate of 0.6 per 100 subjects after recording thirteen cycles among 900 subjects. Each of these subjects denied sexual intercourse during their fertile period

Results from another study across five nations by the World Health Organization (WHO) that was published in 1981 reported a method-related pregnancy rate of 2.8 percent. However, the overall pregnancy rate of patients using the method was 22.6 percent

TheÂ main risk associated with this contraceptive method is the failure to prevent conception due to errors in instruction, the method's application, failure to abstain during the fertile period, and unreliable data collection

Due to these variables and the inconsistent data of its effectiveness, symptothermal contraception is not a first-line birth control method.
