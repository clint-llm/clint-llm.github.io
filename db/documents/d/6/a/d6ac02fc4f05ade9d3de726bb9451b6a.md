Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is the most critical form of acquired heart disease in children and young adults living in developing countries. RHD accounts for approximately 15 to 20 percent of all patients with heart failure in endemic countries.

A study of rheumatic heart disease cases estimated that in 2015, there were globally 33.4 million cases of RHD, 10.5 million disability-adjusted life-years due to RHD, and 319400 deaths due to RHD.

Rheumatic heart disease affects predominantly those living in poverty with inadequate access to health care and unchecked exposure to group A streptococcus. A systematic review and meta-analysis calculated the prevalence of clinically silent RHD (21.1 per 1000 people) to be approximately seven to eight times higher than that of clinically manifest disease (2.7 per 1000 people). The prevalence of rheumatic heart disease increases with age, from 4.7 per 1000 children at 5 years of age to 21.0 per 1000 children at 16 years of age.
