Various congenital and acquired etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia have been listed above. Vastly distinct physiological and histological pathologies, precipitating impaired biliary flow into the intestine or reduced conjugated bilirubin secretion into the bile, can result in conjugated hyperbilirubinemia;

**Extrahepatic Cholestasis**: Extrahepatic cholestasis occurs due to biliary duct obstruction; obstruction of biliary flow into the intestine induces accumulation of conjugated bilirubin within the hepatocytes.

**Intrahepatic Cholestasis:**

Intrahepatic cholestasis is a hepatocellular condition associated with aberrations in bilirubin transport, bile canalicular membrane fluidity, as well as hepatocyte cytoskeletal function; these deviations caused by a myriad of disease processes with or without bile duct alterations, render the hepatocyte inept in metabolizing and releasing bile.

Intrahepatic cholestasis is also observed in certain malignancies like prostate cancer and renal cell carcinoma; however, exact etiology is not clear.

**Hepatocellular Injury:**Hepatocellular injury usually entails the release of intracellular proteins into the plasma. Over time, such liver injury advances to cirrhosis and liver failure impairing protein synthesis and excretion. In chronic liver diseases, serum bilirubin concentration remains within the normal range until a significant degree of hepatic damage has occurred with the presence of cirrhosis.
