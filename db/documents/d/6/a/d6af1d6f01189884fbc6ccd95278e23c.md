**Third-Nerve Palsy (TNP) Causes**

- Vascular ischemia

- Trauma

- Intracranial neoplasm

- Hemorrhage

- Congenital

- Idiopathic

Diabetes mellitus and hypertension cause ischemic changes in the nerve and are the most common systemic causes of acquired nerve palsy.

The etiology and presentation of acquired third-nerve lesions at various levels are different

- Supranuclear lesions: Lesions at the level of the cerebral cortex or the supranuclear pathway cause conjugate paresis of both the eyes.

- Nuclear lesions: Vascular diseases, demyelination, and tumors are the main cause of third-nerve palsy.

- Fascicular lesions: The etiology is similar to the nuclear lesions.

- Basilar portion: In this region, isolated third-nerve palsy is very common. The primary causes of isolated palsy include aneurysms, diabetes mellitus,

- Intracavernous portion: As there are other nerves present in the vicinity of the third-nerve, any lesion in the cavernous sinus will result in multiple nerve palsies of the cranial nerve IV, cranial nerve VI, and the first division of cranial nerve V. The common etiology is diabetes, pituitary apoplexy, aneurysm, or carotid-cavernous fistula.

- Intraorbital portion: Trauma, tumors, and Tolosa-Hunt syndrome are the main causes of intraorbital third-nerve palsy.

**Third-Nerve Palsy in Children**

All acquired third-nerve palsy cases should be investigated thoroughly to exclude any space-occupying lesion. Other common causes include

- Congenital: 43%

- Local inflammation: 13%

- Trauma: 20%

- Aneurysm: 7%

- Myasthenia gravis

- Migraine

Also, all pediatric patients with strabismus should be checked for uncorrected refractive error after administering cycloplegics.

Congenital causes: Development aplasia or hypoplasia of the oculomotor nucleus, birth trauma due to molding forces acting on the skull during labor, intrauterine trauma, and rarely infections such as meningitis.
