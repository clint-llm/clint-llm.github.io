Equipment that is used is dependent upon the type of technique utilized. The following is a list of equipment used based on technique.

- Nerve stimulator guidance: peripheral nerve stimulator that delivers an adjustable electrical current to the tip of a hollow insulated disposable needle. The needle has specific tubing attached to a syringe that allows for aspiration and injection of a local anesthetic. A wire runs between the needle and an electrode and allows the electrical pulse to be transmitted to stimulate the nerve.

- Ultrasound guidance: portable ultrasound machines with both high and low-frequency probes that can identify superficial and deeper nerves

- Continuous catheter: numerous kitsÂ available, which usually contain a needle and catheter. A standard epidural kit can often be utilized.
