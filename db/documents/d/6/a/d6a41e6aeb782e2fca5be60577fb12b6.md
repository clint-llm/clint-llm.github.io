In casesÂ with no structural heart disease, the prognosis of PSVT is reasonably good. For patients with structural heart disease, the prognosis is often guarded. The arrhythmia may come on suddenly and last anywhere from a few seconds to several days. Most patients develop anxiety, a sense of doom, and others may develop hemodynamic compromise. The arrhythmia can result in congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary edema.
