Since the early 2000s, AAA prevalence, rupture rates, and mortality have declined when compared to data from the 1990s. Prevalence was previously reported to be between 4% to 9% in men whereas more recent studies report prevalence below 2%. Large reductions in smoking, which is associated with 75% of AAA; established screening guidelines, leading to approximately 40% mortality reduction; and an increased number of elective endovascular aneurysm repairs have contributed to this trend.
