The mainstay of treatment is the discontinuation of the drug and symptomatic treatment to provide pain relief, decrease edema, and prevent superinfection. Symptomatic treatment includes wound care, alcohol-free emollients, elevation, and pain medication.  Healing includes superficial desquamation of affected areas. Often chemotherapy dose intensity modification or reduction is needed if the drug cannot be discontinued or substituted for another cancer drug or cancer treatment.

Usually, it resolves within 2 to 4 weeks of drug cessation.

In the case of severe (grade 3) acral erythema, further chemotherapy doses should be reduced to prevent a recurrence. Depending on overall clinical status switching to an alternative regimen may be necessary if the risk of recurrence is thought to be high.
