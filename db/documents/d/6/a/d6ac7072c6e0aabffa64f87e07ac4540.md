There is a higher incidence of leiomyoma of the esophagus in men when compared to women; this is in the order of 2:1. The most frequent occurrence is usually between the ages of 20 to 50 years. The most typical location of these tumors is in the lower two-third of the esophagus. The occurrence of these tumors in the upper one-third of the esophagus accounts for only 10% of all leiomyomas of the esophagus. Majority of the tumors are detected when they are less than 5 cm in size. Rarely, they grow to be larger than 10 cm and then, they are called giant leiomyoma of the esophagus. These may occur as single or multiple tumors.
