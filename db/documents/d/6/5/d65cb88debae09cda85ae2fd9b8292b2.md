OO is one of the causes of atlantoaxial instability and dislocation,

- Acute dens fracture, an acute fracture would have a thinner and irregular space instead of the wide and smooth space of os odontoideum.

- Dens morphologic abnormalities (aplasia of the dens, bifid dens, dens duplicated, ossiculum terminale persistens).

- Down Syndrome

- Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis

- Klippelâ€“Feil syndrome

- Morquio syndrome

- Neurofibromatosis

- Normal development in the pediatric population. In pediatrics, awareness of the normal embryology and ossification of the odontoid process is critical to reducing the rate of false-positive diagnoses. The apex of the odontoid arises from the fourth occipital sclerotome, the odontoid process and anterior arch of C1 arise from the first cervical sclerotome, and the body of the axis arises from the second sclerotome. The apex (ossiculum terminale, secondary ossification center) ossifies at around ages 3 to 6 years but does not fuse with the body of the odontoid until approximate ages of 10 to 12 years. The normal sub-dental synchondrosis is between the odontoid and the body of C2 and fuses at approximately ages 3 to 8 years.

- Rheumatoid arthritis

- Transverse ligament injury
