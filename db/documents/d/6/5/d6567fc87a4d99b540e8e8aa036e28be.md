The etiology of rheumatoid arthritis is multifactorial. The combination of a number of genetic risk factors, environmental factors, and abnormal immune response constitutes the basis for the approved pathogenic theories. Genetic risk factors include HLA-DRB1-shared epitope, non-HLA genetic risk factors (PTPN22, TRAF1-C5, STAT4, TNFAIP3, and PADI4), epigenetic transformation, and generation of antigenic epitopes.

Non- genetic risk factors include female sex, smoking, microbiota, western diet, stress, infections, environmental and ethnic factors. Immuno-pathogenic theories in rheumatoid arthritis include the generation of new antigenic epitopes as a result of a triggering factor mostly environmental that leads to epigenetic transformation and autoimmunity.
