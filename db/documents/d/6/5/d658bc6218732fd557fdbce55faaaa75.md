Ventilator-induced lung injury is a clinical diagnosis made by ruling out common causes of respiratory deterioration on a ventilator and common etiologies of ARDS. New-onset pneumonia, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, endobronchial intubation, lung collapse, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism (thrombotic a well as non-thrombotic), auto PEEPing, pleural effusion, and abdominal distension could give rise to respiratory deterioration. Sepsis, aspiration, infectious pneumonia, severe trauma and/or fractures, pulmonary contusion, burns, inhalational injuries(e.g., smoke, gases, near drowning), and transfusion-associated lung injury need to be ruled out. ARDS could also occur after post cardiopulmonary bye pass and major surgeries, pancreatitis, and in patients following haematopoetic stem cell transplant.
