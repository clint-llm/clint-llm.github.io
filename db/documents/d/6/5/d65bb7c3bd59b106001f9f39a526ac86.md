The arrival of new diagnostic techniques and the ability to integrate information from different diagnostic modalities made it possible for clinicians to understand the brain structure and function and help localize brain pathologies. Some of these diagnostic techniques include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positive emission tomography (PET), neurophysiologic data from an electroencephalogram, magnetoencephalography, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

Researchers cite that the pathophysiology of OCD stems from abnormal function of the cortical-striatal-thalamic circuits. The genu of the corpus callosum has been strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and schizophrenia. In contrast, the medial cingulate cortex has been involved in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders.
