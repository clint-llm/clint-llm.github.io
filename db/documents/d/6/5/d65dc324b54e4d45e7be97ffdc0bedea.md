Regulation of thyroid hormone starts at the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus releases thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) into the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary gland. TRH stimulates thyrotropin cells in the anterior pituitary to the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TRH is a peptide hormone created by the cell bodies in the periventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. These cell bodies project their neurosecretory neurons down to the hypophyseal portal circulation, where TRH can concentrate before reaching the anterior pituitary.

TRH is a tropic hormone, meaning that it indirectly affects cells by stimulating other endocrine glands first. It binds to the TRH receptors on the anterior pituitary gland, causing a signal cascade mediated by a G-protein coupled receptor. Activation of Gq protein leads to the activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC). PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-P(PIP) into inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG). These second messengers mobilize intracellular calcium stores and activate protein kinase C, leading to downstream gene activation and transcription of TSH. TRH also has a non-tropic effect on the pituitary gland through the hypothalamic-pituitary-prolactin axis. As a non-tropic hormone, TRH directly stimulates lactotropic cells in the anterior pituitary to produce prolactin. Other substances like serotonin, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and estrogen can also stimulate prolactin release. Prolactin can cause breast tissue growth and lactation.

TSH is released into the blood and binds to the thyroid-releasing hormone receptor (TSH-R) on the basolateral aspect of the thyroid follicular cell. The TSH-R is a Gs-protein coupled receptor, and its activation leads to the activation of adenylyl cyclase and intracellular levels of cAMP.  The increased cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates different proteins to modify their functions. The five steps of thyroid synthesis are below:

- **Synthesis of Thyroglobulin**: Thyrocytes in the thyroid follicles produce a protein called thyroglobulin (TG). TG does not contain any iodine, and it is a precursor protein stored in the lumen of follicles. It is produced in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Golgi apparatus pack it into the vesicles, and then it enters the follicular lumen through exocytosis.

- **Iodide uptake**: Protein kinase A phosphorylation causes increased activity of basolateral Na+-I- symporters, driven by Na+-K+-ATPase, to bring iodide from the circulation into the thyrocytes. Iodide then diffuses from the basolateral side to the apex of the cell, where it is transported into the colloid through the pendrin transporter.

- **Iodination of thyroglobulin**: Protein kinase A also phosphorylates and activates the enzyme thyroid peroxidase (TPO). TPO has three functions: oxidation, organification, and coupling reaction.
- Oxidation: TPO uses hydrogen peroxide to oxidize iodide (I-) to iodine (I2). NADPH-oxidase, an apical enzyme, generates hydrogen peroxide for TPO.
- Organification: TPO links tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin protein with I2. It generates monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). MIT has a single tyrosine residue with iodine, and DIT has two tyrosine residues with iodine.
- Coupling reaction: TPO combines iodinated tyrosine residues to make triiodothyronine (T3) and tetraiodothyronine (T4). MIT and DIT join to form T3, and two DIT molecules form T4.

- **Storage**: thyroid hormones are bound to thyroglobulin for stored in the follicular lumen.

- **Release**: thyroid hormones are released into the fenestrated capillary network by thyrocytes in the following steps:
- Thyrocytes uptake iodinated thyroglobulin via endocytosis
- Lysosome fuse with the endosome containing iodinated thyroglobulin
- Proteolytic enzymes in the endolysosome cleave thyroglobulin into MIT, DIT, T3, and T4.
- T3 (20%) and T4 (80%) are released into the fenestrated capillaries via MCT8 transporter.
- Deiodinase enzymes remove iodine molecules from DIT and MIT. Iodine can be salvaged and redistributed to an intracellular iodide pool.
