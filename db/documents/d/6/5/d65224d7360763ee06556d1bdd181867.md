Enalaprilat injection is used in the management of hypertension when oral therapy is not practical. Enalaprilat is the active metabolite of the oral prodrug enalapril maleate. Enalaprilat is poorly absorbed orally and requires intravenous administration. It inhibits angiotensin I to angiotensin II conversion via competitive inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, dosing, contraindications, warning and precautions, monitoring, toxicity, and relevant interactions of enalaprilat, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients with conditions where this agent is indicated.

**Objectives:**
- Review the mechanism of action of enalaprilat and its conversion to enalapril.
- Discuss the contraindication for enalaprilat therapy.
- Review the adverse event profile for enalaprilat.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance enalaprilat and improve outcomes in hypertensive care.
