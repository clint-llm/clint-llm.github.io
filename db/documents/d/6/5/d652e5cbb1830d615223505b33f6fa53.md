Less than half of the cases with scrofula also have pulmonary TB. There are chances that scrofula can spread beyond the neck and involve other areas of the body. Ulcerations, draining sinus, open wound, and finally, chronic fistula formation are the most probable sequelae of scrofula. Superimposed secondary bacterial infections in open wounds lead to further serious infections. Scar formation is more prominent with nontuberculous mycobacterial involvement. The relapse rate is up to 3.5% in patients treated for tuberculous lymphadenitis.

The therapy-related paradoxical reaction occurs in about 25% during or after the cessation of treatment. Lymph nodes increase in size (79%), but it does not indicate treatment failure, worsening of the disease, and development of new diseases in other organs and new lymph nodes (29%) in the same or different sites.
