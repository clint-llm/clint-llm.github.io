The expected clinical outcomes have drastically changed since ALF was first defined approximately 50 years ago. The current 1-year survival rate of patients, including those undergoing liver transplantation, is greater than 65%. In the past, studies from the United States and Europe had indicated a lower 1-year survival rate of patients with ALF receiving a liver transplant when compared to their counterparts in patients with cirrhosis. However, the 2012 registry from the United States and Europe indicates a higher survival rate up to 79% at 1 year and 72% at 5 years. The most widely used criteria for determining ALF prognosis are the King's College Criteria for ALF due to acetaminophen overdose and ALF not associated with acetaminophen. Other useful prognostic criteria include Clichy criteria (presence of hepatic encephalopathy along with a factor V level lower than 20% to 30% of normal, MELD score higher than 30, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score higher than 15.
