The clinical significance of the PSDA is severalfold. It made an official stance on advanced directives and the requirement to inform patients of their rights under state laws. It empowers patients to play a role in the decision-making process of their healthcare delivery. It aimed to prevent over- and under-treatment by arriving at a patient's specific wishes and having those wishes executed if the patient is unable to dictate their wishes in realtime due to incapacitation. It sought to also permit for decreased costs by giving patients the option to elect or decline expensive critical care/ICU interventions, in the face of certain death, due to terminal illness or catastrophic injury. Approaching 30 years since its acceptance, the PSDA remains controversial in its implementation and successes. Nevertheless, the innovative amendment changed the face of healthcare for millions of people: patients, their families, and their healthcare providers alike.
