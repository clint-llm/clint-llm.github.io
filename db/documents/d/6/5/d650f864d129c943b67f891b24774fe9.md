Management of TEN cases should be done in an interprofessional team approach to ensure the best outcome. Early transfer to a burn facility or intensive care unit with experienced staff in dealing with complex wounds, fluid resuscitation, and mechanical ventilation improves the overall survival of these patients. Dermatologists have a vital role in identifying and managing these cases.

Plastic consultation is also important to assess the need for debridement of necrotic skin areas. Moreover, the early involvement of ophthalmologists is essential to decrease long-term ocular complications. The respiratory specialist may be needed to assess the need for a pulmonary toilet in cases of pulmonary sloughs. OtherÂ specialties such as otolaryngology and urology may also be involved. Additionally, the involvement of the dietitian and physiotherapy team is imperative to optimize the nutrition and mobility of the patient.
