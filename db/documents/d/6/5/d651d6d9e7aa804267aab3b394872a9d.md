Sufficient calcium intake is achievable from a well-balanced diet. A wide array of natural calcium sources exist, including dairy products (e.g., milk, yogurt, cheese), vegetables (e.g., broccoli, kale), and foods fortified with calcium (e.g., fruit juices, cereals, and some grains).

The two primary oral forms of supplemental are calcium carbonate and calcium citrate.

Intravenous formulations of calcium exist and are used to rapidly correct low serum calcium as a means to prevent seizure, tetany, or cardiac arrhythmias.
