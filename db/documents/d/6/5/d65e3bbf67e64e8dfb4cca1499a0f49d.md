Cervical cerclage is performed as an attempt to prolong pregnancy in certain women who are at higher risk of preterm delivery. Cerclage placement may be indicated by a history of cervical insufficiency or by certain sonographic or physical exam findings in a current pregnancy. The McDonald and Shirodkar techniques, or modifications thereof, are the most commonly used methods for placing a cerclage. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques for performing a cervical cerclage and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, treating, and managing patients who are candidates for this procedure.
