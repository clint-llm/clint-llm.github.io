When examined grossly, miliary tuberculosis is characterized by small, punctate, gray to reddish-brown, rounded lesions of the more or less uniform size seen in the lungs and various other organs. In an immunocompetent individual, microscopically, each focus represents a typical tubercle with caseation necrosis in the center having tubercle bacilli surrounded by typical Langhans type giant cells, epithelioid cells, lymphocytes, and fibrocytes. However, in immune-suppressed individuals, the foci show caseation with tubercle bacilli without granuloma formation, known as non-reactive miliary TB.
