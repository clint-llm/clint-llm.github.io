Transmission of dermatophyte infections to humans happens through direct contact with infected humans (anthropophilic), soil (geophilic), or infected animals (zoophilic).Trichophyton verrucosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Trichophyton rubrum are the most commonly reported causative organisms in the literature.Trichophyton violaceum, Trichophyton megninii, Trichophyton schoenleinii, Trichophyton tonsurans, Trichophyton interdigitale, Trichophyton ernacei,****Microsporum canis, Microsporum nanum, Mycroscporum gypseum, and Epidermophyton floccosum.

Until 2000, most of the tinea barbae cases that were documented in the literature were caused by zoophilic dermatophytes from infected farm animals and domestic animals, especially dairy cows (T. verrucosum), sheep, pigs (T. ernacei), horses, dogs, and cats (M. canis).T. rubrum have been a frequently reported causative organism, as noted in multiple individual case reports worldwide and case series published from Portugal and Mexico.T. rubrum in patients with tinea pedis.
