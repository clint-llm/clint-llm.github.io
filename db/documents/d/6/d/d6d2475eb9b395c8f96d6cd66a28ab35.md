Patients require continuous monitoring via ECG for four hours post discontinuation of ibutilide infusion or until the QTc returns to normal (less than 440 msec). If arrhythmia presents, continue monitoring patients for more than four hours and longer if the patient has impaired hepatic function. Equipment for the management of potentially fatal arrhythmias should be rapidly available. Electrolytes, particularly magnesium, should be established at baseline.
