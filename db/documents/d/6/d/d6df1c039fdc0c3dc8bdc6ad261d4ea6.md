Rabies causes viral encephalitis which kills up to 70000 people/year worldwide. Infected animal saliva transmits viral encephalitis to humans. Rabies is one of the oldest known diseases in history with cases dating back to 4000 years ago. For most of human history, a bite from a rabid animal was uniformly fatal. In the past, people were so scared of rabies that after being bitten by a potentially rabid animal, many would commit suicide. This activity describes the pathophysiology of rabies and stresses the importance of an interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of rabies.
- Review the pathophysiology of rabies.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for rabies.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with rabies.
