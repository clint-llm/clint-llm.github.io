**Pregnancy-related Pelvic Ligament Dysfunction**

Pelvic girdle pain is common in the third trimester of pregnancy, as the gravid uterus exerts more axial load on the pelvic structures. This leads to pelvic ligamentous stretch and pain and is a common cause of significant pain and discomfort in the later stages of pregnancy.

Prolonged or difficult vaginal delivery can cause significant trauma to the pelvic structures. Post-natal pain and pelvic organ prolapse may occur - specifically cystocele, urethrocele, cystourethrocele, enterocele, rectocele, or prolapse of the uterus into the vagina. In asymptomatic patients, conservative management is recommended, which includes vaginal pessaries and Kegel exercises.

**Pudendal Nerve Entrapment**

The pudendal vessels and nerve pass behind the sacrospinous ligament. The pudendal nerve may get trapped between the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments.

**Ligamentous Dysfunction in Lower Back Pain**

The most common causes of lower back pain (LBP) are muscular-ligamentous sprains and strains, occurring mainly in the lumbosacral region.

Biophysical modeling demonstrates the importance of these ligaments in the support and motion of the lower limbs. When sacrotuberous and sacroiliac tears are modeled, the result is contralateral pelvic instability which likely correlates with functional disability and pain in vivo following ligamentous injury.
