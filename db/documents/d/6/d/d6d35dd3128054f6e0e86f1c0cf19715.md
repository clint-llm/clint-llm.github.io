Prenatal ultrasound, often performed between the 9th and 11th weeks of gestation, is the mainstay imaging showing a fluid-filled sac through a skull defect.

DNA testing for chromosomal abnormality screening can be done at ten weeks.

Prenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will easily show the defect but will require fetal sedation. Postnatal brain MRI is the study of choice as it shows the defect, the contents, brain tissue, and any associated anomalies. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head with three-dimensional reconstruction is done to evaluate the skull defect, bone anomalies, and hydrocephalus. Angiography is used if the defect is close to the dural sinuses. This can be done using CT or MRI angiography.
