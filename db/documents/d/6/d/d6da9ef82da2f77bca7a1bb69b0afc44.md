**Predictive Value of a Single, Early PSA Level in Younger Men (Ages 40 to 45)**

The European Association of Urology Guidelines states that for men in their early 40s, any PSA level beyond one ng/ml indicates a higher long-term prostate cancer risk and warrants closer monitoring. This statement is supported by evidence from several long-term studies and databases such as the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, the Department of Defense Serum Repository Study, the Duke Prostate Database Report, and the Malmo Preventive Project, among others. These studies all demonstrate that a single PSA test of less than 1 ng/ml in a man in his early 40s is an excellent predictor of good prostate health and not getting prostate cancer for the next 25 years or so. Performing a PSA test in this young age group would also help find the small percentage of men who develop very aggressive and highly lethal prostate cancer before age 50.

For example, the best-selling author of "American Assassin," Vince Flynn, died of metastatic prostate cancer at age 47. Getting his initial PSA test at age 50 would not have helped him.

**Predictive Tables and Nomograms**

Various predictive tables and nomograms are now available to help predict outcomes, positive lymph nodes, and survival after radical prostatectomy, based on outcomes data from various sources. They generally include some combination of age, Gleason score, biopsy information, and PSA level. They may also require other clinical information, such as the number of positive biopsies with the percentage of tumor involvement and clinical and pathological staging.

**When Advanced Prostate Cancer Causes Bilateral Hydronephrosis**

Prostate cancer may directly extend into the bladder sub-trigonally, causing hydronephrosis and eventually renal failure if both ureters become obstructed. When this happens, a decision needs to be made whether or not to proceed with treatment. This is typically late in the course of the disease. Forgoing surgical procedures at this point leads to renal failure, which is usually painless, as it occurs slowly and incrementally.

Gradually increasing renal failure is usually a painless and natural way to expire peacefully. Patients slowly become more lethargic and eventually go to sleep. This may be preferable to forcing them to endure increasingly severe and debilitating pain from advancing disease and bone metastases. Treating the ureteral blockage may improve survival temporarily, but typically for just a few months. This is a very difficult and personal decision. There is no right or wrong answer, but there certainly is a choice. It is suggested that patients and families approaching this decision point review and discuss the options available, and make a decision long before it becomes necessary. Palliative care and/or hospice services should certainly be involved at this point if not engaged previously.

Treatment of hydronephrosis for obstructive prostate cancer may include surgical transurethral resection of the tumor inside the bladder over the expected location of the ureterovesical junction and intramural ureters. The resection only needs to be sufficient to unroof or expose the ureteral lumen, but this is not always technically possible due to the loss of landmarks, anatomical distortion, and potential lack of mobility of the scope due to cancer. Once the ureteral lumen is exposed, a double J stent can be used to maintain urinary drainage. Double J stents can be challenging to place in these cases unless the ureteral lumen is surgically exposed or opened first.

Nephrostomy tubes are another possible solution when one or both ureters cannot be identified or opened transurethrally. In such cases, antegrade placement of a double J stent from above is far easier than the standard transurethral retrograde method.

Ultimately, only one kidney needs to be drained and made functional. Studies have shown no survival advantage to treating both kidneys in these situations.

**Do We Absolutely, Positively Need to Have a Positive Prostate Tissue Biopsy to Treat Prostate Cancer?**

While a positive tissue biopsy is always preferred before treatment, situations arise where it may not be practical or obtainable.  Patients may present requiring treatment who have a history of prostate cancer treated elsewhere with no confirmatory records immediately available. Other patients may have had prior bad experiences with an earlier biopsy and are now refusing all-new diagnostic procedures.  Perhaps there are medical issues, such as a new cardiac stent or a history of pulmonary embolisms, which require an extended period of significant anticoagulants that preclude doing the biopsy.

With the use of MRI imaging, genomic-analysis testing validated prostatic nomograms, and all of the other pre-biopsy predictive tests, it is not unreasonable to consider initiating some degree of prostate cancer treatment in selected cases even without absolute histological confirmation of malignancy if the likelihood of cancer is sufficiently high. Such cases are likely to be infrequent, and patients need to be fully informed regarding the standard of care as well as the possibility of treatment complications and side effects without the absolute assurance that they have a prostatic malignancy that is sufficiently aggressive and dangerous to justify the therapy.

**Prognosis and Survival**

In the United States, patients with localized or regional disease at the time of diagnosis have a 5-year survival rate of nearly 100%, while patients presenting with distant metastases have a 5-year overall survival rate of only 29%.

In patients who undergo treatment, the most important prognostic indicators are patient age and general health at the time of diagnosis, as well as the cancer stage, pre-therapy PSA level, and Gleason score.

A poorer prognosis is associated with higher-grade disease, more advanced stage, younger age, increased PSA levels, and a shorter "PSA doubling time."

**Life Expectancy**

There is no clear evidence that either radical prostate surgery or radiation therapy has a significant survival advantage over the other, so treatment selection has relatively little effect on life expectancy.

- Patients with localized, low-grade disease (Gleason 2+2=4 or less) are unlikely to die of prostate cancer within 15 years.

- After 15 years, untreated patients are more likely to die from prostate cancer than any other identifiable disease or disorder.

- Older men with low-grade disease have approximately a 20% overall survival at 15 years, due primarily to death from other unrelated causes.

- Men with high-grade disease (Gleason 4+4=8 or higher) typically experience higher prostate cancer mortality rates within 15 years of diagnosis.

Life expectancy tables can be found online at the respective websites of the Social Security Administration, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (Male Life Expectancy Tool), and the World Health Organization (Life Tables by Country).

**Possible Urinary Marker for Aggressive Prostate Cancer in African American Men**

A study at the National Cancer Institute investigated the potential role of urinary thromboxane B2 (TXB2) as a possible marker for aggressive prostate cancer.  (Thromboxane B2 is a metabolite of TXA2, a cyclooxygenase-derived eicosanoid associated with metastatic disease.) In this study, 977 men with prostate cancer were followed for a median of 8.4 years. Investigators found a statistically significant and distinct association between high urinary TXB2 levels and mortality in African American men with prostate cancer but not in similar Caucasian American patients of European ancestry.

**Palliative Care and Hospice**

Palliative Care focuses on treating cancer symptoms and improving quality of life. The goal of palliative care is symptom control and pain relief rather than curing cancer.

Cancer pain related to bone metastases may be treated with bisphosphonates, rank ligand inhibitors, opioids, radiopharmaceuticals, and palliative radiation therapy.

Spinal cord compression can be treated with steroids, surgery, or radiation therapy.

A common mistake is failing to get palliative care and Hospice services involved early enough in the course of the disease so they can start patient assistance immediately when needed, without undue delays.
