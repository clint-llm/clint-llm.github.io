Skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles are derived from the mesoderm. More specifically, skeletal muscle is derived from the paraxial mesoderm, cardiac muscle is derived from the lateral splanchnic mesoderm, and smooth muscle fibers differentiate from the splanchnic mesoderm.

Smooth muscle exceptions not derived from the mesoderm include the muscles of the iris (sphincter and dilator pupillae) and the myoepithelial cells in mammary and sweat glands, which are derived from mesenchymal cells originating from the ectoderm.
