The adverse effects of biologic response modifier therapy could be secondary to stimulation, suppression, or disruption of immune homeostasis.

Since T cell-mediated response is involved in the destruction of pathogens, inhibition of immune response by BRM increases the risk of asymptomatic to life-threatening infection due to the virus, bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and protozoa.Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), non-mycobacterial TB, Histoplasma, Cryptococcus, Coccidioides, Blastomyces, Pulmonary actinomycosis,Pneumocystis carinii,Aspergillus, Candida, Listeria, Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Several biologics also increase the risk of malignancies, such as Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, non-melanoma skin cancer.

Disruption of immune homeostasis causes a paradoxical effect in various tissues leading to autoimmunity. Various BRM has associations with a lupus-like syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, vasculitis, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, peripheral neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune hepatitis, optic neuritis, uveitis, and interstitial lung disease.
