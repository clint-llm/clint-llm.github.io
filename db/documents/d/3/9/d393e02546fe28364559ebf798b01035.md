**Imaging**

A chest x-ray can be used as a screening tool for suspected pulmonary causes, but is non-specific and will often miss more discrete lesion compared to cross-sectional imaging. CT scanning is the most favored investigation, and it is advised to image the patient from skull base to diaphragm to incorporate the entire length of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Although it is useful for the anatomical definition of malignant disease,

**Serological Tests**

There is no strong evidence for use of routine serological testing, and these tests should only aid in the diagnosis of a particular etiology. Serum tests can be used in suspected inflammatory or infectious UVCP, with common tests including rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibodies, serum ACE, lyme titer, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).

**Direct Visualization**

Direct laryngoscopy of the glottis is the most sensitive and specific method of evaluating appearance and movement of vocal cords in a suspected iatrogenic injury.

**Other Investigations**

Laryngeal electromyography uses a percutaneous EMG needle to perform an electrophysiological evaluation of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx. Although growing in popularity, the test is not widely available, and a current consensus statement from the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine advises its use as a prognostic tool in patients who have been symptomatic between 4 weeks to 6 months.

Neck and laryngeal ultrasound can be used to assess vocal cord movement
