Nail patella syndrome (NPS) is a rare multisystemic disease with a classic clinical tetrad of fingernail dysplasia, hypoplasia or absence of the patella, presence of iliac horns, and elbow deformities. Ocular, renal, and neurological involvement can occur. This activity discusses its genetic basis and history, various clinical manifestations, multiple treatment strategies, and the role of the interprofessional team in diagnosis and management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the genetic basis of nail-patella syndrome and its phenotype in order to better understand the various but characteristic clinical manifestations.
- Describe the classic clinical tetrad of nail-patella syndrome.
- Review the medical and surgical treatment options for patients with nail-patella syndrome.
- Summarize the interprofessional team's role in diagnosing and managing patients with nail-patella syndrome to reduce patient morbidity and improving quality of life.
