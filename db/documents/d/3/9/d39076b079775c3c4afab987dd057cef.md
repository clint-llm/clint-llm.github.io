Inflammatory dermatoses such as nummular dermatitis are often treated by primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, or dermatologists. Although the differential diagnosis of nummular dermatitis is quite broad, it is most often clinically diagnosed by recognizing its patterns of morphology, distribution, and epidemiology. Ancillary testing such as skin scraping with potassium hydroxide preparation, bacterial swab for culture and sensitivities, or biopsy may be performed either in the primary care or dermatologic setting. If the nummular dermatitis is unresponsive to conservative management and topical corticosteroids, it is appropriate to consult a dermatologist. A specialist should supervise patch testing, narrowband UVB treatment, or systemic immunosuppressant, or immunomodulatory therapy.

Treatment of nummular dermatitis can be optimized with an interprofessional team approach. The patient’s nurse, primary care provider, or dermatologist should monitor for therapy compliance, report any adverse effects, and relay the response to therapy to the remainder of the team. This type of interprofessional teamwork will enhance patient outcomes and minimize adverse reactions in caring for patients with nummular dermatitis. [Level 5]
