Most early breast cancer patients are asymptomatic and discovered during screening mammography. With increasing size, the patient may discover cancer as a lump that is felt accidentally, mostly during combing or showering. Breast pain is an unusual symptom that happens 5% of the time. The locally advanced disease may be presented with peau d'orange, frank ulceration, or fixation to the chest wall. Inflammatory breast cancer, an advanced form of breast cancer, frequently resembles breast abscess and presents with swelling, redness, and other local signs of inflammation. Paget disease of the nipple usually presents with nipple changes that must be differentiated from nipple eczema.
