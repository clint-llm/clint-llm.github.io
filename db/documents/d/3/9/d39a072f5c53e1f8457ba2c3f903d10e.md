The management of interrupted aortic arch is with an interprofessional team that consists of a pediatrician, pediatric cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, radiologist and an internist. IAA is a relatively rare disorder which is often associated with other heart defects.

Once diagnosed, the treatment is immediate surgery. The objective of the surgery is to form unobstructed continuity between the ascending and descending aorta and to repair associated defects with the most common atrial and/or ventricular septum defect. The repair is done using either native arterial tissue, a homograph, or autograph vascular patch. For ventricular septal defect, repairs are closed with a synthetic patch. This synthetic patch is made up of polyester or polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE).  An alternative route to a definitive single-operation repair of the arch is to implement a two-stage approach. This approach consists of the reconstruction and placement of a pulmonary artery band in stage 1, postponing the placement of the ventricular septal defect closure to a later time. For the second stage procedure of the procedure, the pulmonary band is removed.

In cases of significant outflow tract obstruction, it may be necessary to perform a complex combination of the Norwood and Rastelli procedures.
