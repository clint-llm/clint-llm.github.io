Tests to consider include:

- Blood and urine studies

- Blood cultures

- Echocardiography; transthoracic versus transesophageal (TEE), with TEE being more sensitive and specific as well as recommended for the initial assessment of any patient with a suspected perivalvular disease

- Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring; new atrioventricular block has a positive predictive value of 88% for abscess formation but low 45% sensitivity.

It should always be kept in mind that it is in the realm of possibility to obtain negative cultures and still have a cardiac abscess. For example, a patient whose initial evaluation demonstrated bacteremia with, initially, no physical signs of IE or cardiac conduction deficit may receive intravenous (IV) antibiotics before a further workup, and therefore, cultures may not be reliable. Additionally, if cultures are not drawn properly, the likelihood of positive results decreases significantly.
