Various infections can mimic Kawasaki Disease including:

- Preseptal cellulitis

- Peritonsillar abscess

- Retropharyngeal Abscess

- Cervical lymphadenitis

- Group A streptococcal infection

- Adenovirus, Enterovirus, Parvovirus B19

- Measles

- Mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus)

- Scarlet Fever

- Rheumatic fever

- Toxic Shock Syndrome

- Meningitis

- Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever

- Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS)

Both KD and adenovirus present with conjunctival injection, however, the important differentiation is that adenovirus causes conjunctival exudates and KD does not.

Kawasaki disease' presentation also overlaps with other immunologic reactions such as multiple drug hypersensitivity reactions, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, infantile polyarteritis nodosa, and systemic lupus erythematosus. These can be differentiated from KD by the absence of classic clinical criteria and by chronicity and the number of joints affected.
