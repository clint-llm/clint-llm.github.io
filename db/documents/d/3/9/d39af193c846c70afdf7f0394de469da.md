Structural variation in the lateral geniculate nucleus can occur via divergent development of or subsequent damage to upstream structures in the visual pathway. Strabismic amblyopia, the permanent reduction of visual acuity due to abnormal development in the eyesâ€™ alignment, is associated with a significant decrease in LGN gray matter density despite normal development other major neural regions in the visual pathway.
