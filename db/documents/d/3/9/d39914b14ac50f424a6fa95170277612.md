Mismanagement of alkaptonuria can result in poor patient outcomes. As alkaptonuria affects various organ systems, a multi-disciplinary approach to the workup of the patient presentation can be helpful to reach the primary diagnosis. Multiple specialties may be involved in a patientâ€™s disease management, including medical geneticists, primary care providers, internal medicine specialists, pediatricians, orthopedic surgeons, and ophthalmologists. As is commonly seen with rare diseases, therapy options for alkaptonuria can be expensive.

Communication between the healthcare team, insurance companies, and other venues of reimbursement can help patients and families continue with adequate treatment. Family education and genetic counseling are essential for the prevention, education, and identification of alkaptonuria. Early therapeutic management of the disease is recommended and has been shown to improve the condition and slow the progression of the disease.
