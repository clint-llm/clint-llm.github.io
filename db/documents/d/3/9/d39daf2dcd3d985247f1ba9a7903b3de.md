While the MCL is the static stabilizer of the medial knee, the dynamic stabilizers of the medial knee are muscles: the semimembranosus complex, vastus medialis, and pes anserinus. The semimembranosus tightens the posterior oblique ligament and displaces the medial meniscus posteriorly to prevent impingement during knee flexion. The vastus medialis and pes anserinus potentially increase the stiffness of the MCL. However, the reaction time of these muscles is too slow to be protective against injury.
