Contraindications for undergoing facial reconstructionÂ after MMS are few but include patients who are either unfit for surgery (if sedation or general anesthesia is required), patients not willing to undergo additional surgery (if staged procedures are required), and patients with unrealistic expectations. These potential issues should be discussed during the initial preoperative consultation and before the MMS is done.

Regarding MMS, there are no absolute contraindications; however, specific reconstruction options may be more suitable for different patient populations based on comorbidities and age. Furthermore, a lack of specially trained personnel and equipment can hinder its availability for patients.
