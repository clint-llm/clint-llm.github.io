Loperamide is a highly lipophilic synthetic phenylpiperidine opioid.

The peak plasma time is 4 to 5 hours, with a half-life of 7 to 19 hours.

Loperamide was also found to inhibit both the Na+ gated cardiac channels, which in turn prolongs the QRS complex, and the hERG channel, which increases the QTc interval.
