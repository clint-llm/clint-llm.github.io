Management of anasarca should be guided by the treatment of the underlying etiology but generally includes diuresis. Pulmonary edema is one of the few forms of generalized edema that is life-threatening and requires immediate therapy. In all other edematous states, removal of the excess fluid can proceed more slowly as it is not acutely life-threatening to the patient. In patients with generalized edema due to heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, or primary sodium retention, the edema fluid can be mobilized rapidly with help of loop or thiazide diuretics. In patients with anasarca, removing 2 to 3 liters or more of edema fluid in 24 hours can ordinarily be accomplished without a clinically significant reduction in plasma volume.

In patients with localized edema due to venous or lymphatic obstruction or malignant ascites, diuretic therapy can lead to volume depletion. Diuretic therapy in generalized edematous states and anasarca is usually begun with a loop diuretic, such as furosemide or bumetanide. In patients with cirrhosis and ascites, the two mainstays of treatment include sodium restriction and oral diuretics. The dietary sodium restriction would be less than 2000 mg/day [88 mmol/day] and diuretic therapy should be a combination of spironolactone and a loop diuretic like furosemide. The addition of spironolactone is preferred in the initial diuretic regimen as it helps to prevent hypokalemia. As hypokalemia predisposes to increased production of ammonia. The recommended initial dose is spironolactone 100-200 mg/d with furosemide at 20-40 mg/d. The diuretic dosage can be monitored with a random “spot” urine sodium concentration. Diuretics should be increased until the urine sodium concentration is greater than the potassium concentration.

The mainstays of therapy for lower-extremity edema due to venous insufficiency are mechanical therapies, including leg elevation and compression stockings with 20 to 30 mmHg for mild edema and 30 to 40 mmHg for severe edema complicated by ulceration. Compression therapy is contraindicated in patients with peripheral arterial disease. Local skin and wound care of venous ulcers is essential in preventing secondary cellulitis and dermatitis. Eczematous (stasis) dermatitis, characterized by dry, inflamed, scaling skin overlying superficial varicose veins, often occurs in patients with chronic venous insufficiency. Treatment includes daily hydration with emollients and short courses of topical steroid creams for severely inflamed skin. Primary lymphedema treatment involves complex decongestive physiotherapy, including manual lymphatic massage and multilayer bandages. The first goal is the improvement of fluid resorption and continues until achieving the maximum therapeutic response. The maintenance phase of treatment includes compression stockings at 30 to 40 mmHg. Pneumatic compression devices can be used to augment standard therapies. Surgical debulking or bypass procedures are limited to severe refractory cases. Diuretics are not demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of lymphedema.
