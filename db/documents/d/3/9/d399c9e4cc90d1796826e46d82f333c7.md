A radial nerve block will provide anesthesia and/or analgesia to the hand, specifically the dorsal radial side. This includes anesthesia dorsally to the thumb, index and middle fingers, and the lateral aspect of the ring finger. It can be useful as a stand-alone or adjunctive therapy for interventions of the hands and fingers, palliation of acute pain involving the radial nerve's distribution, diagnosis and treatment of radial tunnel syndrome, and a diagnostic prognostication procedure in instances of injury to the radial nerve. This activity illustrates the technique of a radial nerve block, its indication, contraindications, and complication.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomy of the radial nerve.
- Describe the technique of a radial nerve block.
- Outline the indications for a radial nerve block.
- Review the importance of enhancing care and improving outcomes in patients undergoing a radial nerve block.
