The management of spinal TB disease is challenging and complex. While the major role in patient management is primarily played by the treating surgeon (spine/ orthopedic/neurosurgeon), the importance of contributions from the entire team including pediatrician, geriatrician,  physician, hepatologist (for hepatic function monitoring), infectious disease specialist, radiologist, pathologist, occupational therapist, orthotist, physiotherapist, nurse practitioner, and social workers cannot be understated. The major initial challenge in the management of the disease lies in early diagnosis and timely treatment. Later, identification of the disease-related complications and appropriate decision-making regarding the need for surgical intervention in addition to long-term chemotherapy constitute the next major task. The challenges associated with the administration of long-term chemotherapy (including adverse effects and complications of the drug, compliance issues, socio-economic factors among others) are also greatly significant; and need to be addressed. At each of these stages of disease management, major contributions from each member of the health care team are required. During the perioperative period, important issues including adequate maintenance of nutrition, availability of proper financial, and social support system (to discuss ambulatory restrictions, poor general medical conditions, need for long term medications, as well as complications encountered during the course of treatment), patient education, and challenges faced by the family or caregivers have to be addressed as well.

Based on the available literature, evidence on the role and efficiency of chemotherapy in tubercular spine disease is very strong. (Level I) However, evidence and recommendations regarding the ideal duration of treatment, indications for surgery and appropriate surgical intervention are largely based on level IV and V studies.
