Optimal facial laceration repair requires understanding the affected anatomy and soft tissue handling techniques. Poor aesthetic outcomes from improper management of facial lacerations can have negative psychological impacts on patients, who may be left with stress or anxiety disorders, scars, facial subunit distortion, or functional deficits. Discussing repair options and counseling patients regarding expected outcomes, when possible, builds the therapeutic relationship and improves long-term satisfaction for both patients and clinicians.
