After skin infiltration with local anesthesia according to surgeon preference, a transverse neck incision between two and three centimeters in length along the inferior aspect of the submandibular gland and approximately one to two centimeters inferior to the inferior border of the mandible is made. An existing skin crease is used when available.  In the case of excision of a submandibular neoplasm, a wider and often lower incision is often required to complete the neck dissection. It is important to place the incision at least one centimeter inferior to the mandible as this provides more broad access and provides a superior cosmetic result. After making the initial incision, a subplatysmal skin flap may be raised posteriorly. Some surgeons avoid raising a skin flap superiorly as this can traumatize the marginal mandibular nerve. Other surgeons raise the superior skin flap in a supraplastysmal plane and subsequently split the muscle fibers of the plastyma vertically to identify the marginal mandibular nerve.

Dissection in the marginal mandibular nerve area must be carried out carefully to avoid electrocautery close to the nerve. Some surgeons routinely identify the marginal mandibular nerve as it runs within the investing fascia over the superficial aspect of the submandibular gland. Other surgeons do not identify the submandibular nerve but rather elevate the in the subplatysmal plane as noted above. The facial artery and vein are identified and ligated at the inferior aspect of the submandibular gland. The vessels are then reflected superiorly with the marginal mandibular nerve protected. The submandibular gland is then dissected away from the inferior border of the mandible and dissection carried to the mylohyoid.

Dissection is then carried out at the anterior aspect of the submandibular gland and the posterior belly of the digastric muscle identified. It is important to keep the mylohyoid muscle in view to avoid injury to the hypoglossal or lingual nerves during this step. The posterior belly of the digastric muscle is then followed posteriorly and the inferior aspect of the submandibular gland dissected.  Dissection is carried posteriorly following the posterior belly of the digastric to avoid injury to the hypoglossal nerve or external carotid artery branches that lie deep to the posterior belly of the digastric. As dissection continues along the posterior digastric, the facial vein is encountered at the posterior aspect of the gland and which may be divided.

The submandibular gland is then retracted posteriorly and inferiorly off of the mylohyoid. A retractor is placed under the posterior aspect of the mylohyoid, retracting it anterior to expose the hypoglossal and lingual nerves and the submandibular duct. The submandibular duct and submandibular ganglion are then ligated. Some surgeons transect the submandibular duct and ligate the duct with a permanent suture, and others ligate the submandibular duct with electrocautery. Note that if a calculus is present within the submandibular duct, it is important that the duct be ligated distal to the calculus and the calculus (or calculi) removed.

Finally, the facial artery is ligated just superiorly to the posterior belly of the digastric, and the submandibular gland is removed.  Surgeon preference and cavity size determine the decision to place a drain surgical drain. The wound is closed per the surgeon's preference.

The trans-cervical procedure described above is the most commonly utilized approach for submandibular gland removal.  However, alternative approaches have been described, which include intra-oral endoscopic assisted or robot-assisted procedures. These approaches avoid a trans-cervical incision and may be addressed through a variety of incisions, including intra-oral, retro-auricular, postauricular, facelift, and trans-hairline neck incisions.
