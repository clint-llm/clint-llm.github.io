Management is implemented based on the gestational age at which the mother presents to the hospital. At >34 weeks, if the mother presents with preterm labor, she is admitted. After observation for 4-6 hours, if she does not have progressive cervical dilation and effacement, and fetal well-being shows on a reactive non-stress test, and complications in pregnancy have been excluded, she is sent home with instructions for follow-up in 1-2 weeks and return if there are additional signs and symptoms of preterm labor or other pregnancy concerns.

Cervical cerclage plays a vital role in preventing preterm birth prevention. It is used prophylactically in women with a history of recurrent mid-trimester losses and those diagnosed with cervical insufficiency. It is also used prophylactically in women identified with a short cervix, defined as a length of <25 mm during an ultrasound. Lastly, it is a ‘rescue’ treatment with an incompetent cervix and threatened preterm labor.

Another standard method to prevent preterm birth is the use of progesterone supplementation. Women that have had a history of prior singleton preterm birth or those with short cervixes are most likely to benefit. This approach demonstrates reduced neonatal morbidity and mortality. Under normal circumstances, progesterone levels fall before the onset of labor which triggers parturition. Administering progesterone promotes uterine quiescence which may block preterm labor.
