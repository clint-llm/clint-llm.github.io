- The surgeon should educate patients pre-operatively about expectations regarding surgery, post-operative pain, and the recovery process.

- Surgeons should educate patients about the surgical procedure including risks such as bleeding, infection, damage to surrounding structures, need for further surgery, and recurrence.

- Patients should receive counsel that a bowel resection may be necessary, depending on the contents of the hernia.

- As part of this discussion, a review of the risks associated with resection and anastomosis such as anastomotic leak is in order.

- If high-risk comorbid conditions are present such as immunosuppressive therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, steroids,Â etc.) or inflammatory bowel disease, then the surgeon may discuss the risk of possible ostomy prior to surgery.

- Postoperative pain expectations should be reviewed which are particular to each surgeon. Surgeons should review activity restrictions following surgery. As discussed above, activity restrictions should include no heavy lifting for four to six weeks after surgery. The surgeons should counsel patients to refrain from activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure and smoking cessation.
