The prevalence of mental disorders in the United States is approximately 30 percent. The global burden of disease statistics shows that four of the ten most important causes of disease worldwide are psychiatric in origin. The pathophysiology behind psychiatric disorders is the imbalance of the complex neurotransmitter system in the brain.  The mainstay of treatment for depression and anxiety has been therapies to modulate these neuron transmitters, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), mixed norepinephrine/serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI). This article will focus on venlafaxine, which belongs to the class of antidepressants called serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).

Venlafaxine is FDA approved to treat and manage symptoms of depression, social anxiety disorder,  and cataplexy. Off-label, venlafaxine can be used for attention deficit disorder, fibromyalgia, diabetic neuropathy, complex pain syndromes, hot flashes, migraine prevention, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.  Venlafaxine may be used independently or as part of combination therapy with other drugs.
