When considering the differential for ascites, it can often be helpful to determine the SAAG that can further guide the differential along with history, physical, and further testing. Pancreatic ascites occurs most often in those with chronic pancreatitis, and therefore, often coincides with a history of excessive alcohol use. In such cases, ascites secondary to increased portal pressure from cirrhosis must be considered. Other etiologies of cirrhosis as a cause of ascites in the absence of alcohol use should also be considered. While ascites from cirrhosis usually have a SAAG greater than 1.1, the presence of an infectious process can affect this ratio. Other processes with ascites and SAAG greater than 1.1 are hepatic vein occlusion (Budd Chiari), portal vein thrombosis, and right heart failure.

In new onset ascites with a SAAG less than 1.1, malignancy must be considered, keeping in mind that abnormal cytology of ascitic fluid in pancreatic ascites is sometimes due to a metaplastic response to the pancreatic fluid as opposed to a malignant process. Other differentials for abdominal ascites with SAAG less than 1.1 include peritoneal tuberculosis and nephrotic syndrome.
