Toxicity caused by cytarabine can classify into either low dose or high dose toxicity. The only noteworthy low-dose toxicity is myelosuppression, while corneal toxicity is frequent with high doses of cytarabine. Continuous infusion may prove more toxic than the typical intermittent dosage. Considerable cardiac toxicity has been observed only in the standard induction schedules.
