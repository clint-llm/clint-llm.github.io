Once a physician has obtained the full history and physical examination as above, the next step (if not already done) is to obtain thyroid function tests. These should include a TSH and free T4. Also, testing TSH receptor antibody levels is important, not only to help confirm the diagnosis but also to be used as a measure of severity and in tracking response to treatment.

There are a variety of scoring systems used to classify Graves orbitopathy. The first described was the modified NO SPECS criteria, which assist in classifying severity, but not necessarily clinical activity. There are four grades; 0 being no signs or symptoms, I is only limited signs (i.e., lid retraction/lag), II is involvement of soft tissues, III is the presence of proptosis, and IV is if there is any extra-ocular muscle involvement.

Next, evaluating a patient with Graves orbitopathy should include a consideration of imaging. MRI is a helpful modality in identifying those with clinically active disease, and this may help decide which patients may respond better to immunomodulatory therapy. MRI is also useful if the presentation of the orbitopathy is atypical or asymmetrical to exclude other ocular pathology that may be on the differential. Also, if one suspects there may be orbital nerve compression, an MRI would help to determine this. Concerning the CT scan, this imaging modality does not help in determining clinical activity but may be useful in the planning stages of orbital decompression surgery.
