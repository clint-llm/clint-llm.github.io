Until the diagnosis is confirmed, continue supportive care for the patient. With any patient, first assess and stabilize the airway, breathing, and circulation. Approximately 50% of infantile botulism cases will require intubation and an advanced airway regardless of whether they are treated with human botulism immune globulin intravenous (human BIG-IV); however, those who are not treated may require mechanical ventilation longer. As a result, a clinician should have a very low threshold to intubate a patient. This will require careful monitoring and admission to the intensive care unit.

If trying to decide if the patient requires an advanced airway, the best way to measure respiratory depression at the bedside is with the use of a continuous end-tidal carbon dioxide monitor. To help combat the respiratory distress, patients should be placed in Trendelenburg position at a 20-degree angle with a neck roll to stabilize the neck, cervical spine, and prevent sliding. If the patient has a decreased gag reflex, he or she is at increased risk for aspiration.

Human BIG-IV has shown to decrease the length of hospital stay and the length of mechanical ventilation. It is a single dose treatment that is infused intravenously over 30 minutes. The risk of anaphylactic shock is low but the cost of this IVIG is close to $50K.

There is antitoxin available and can rapidly reverse the course of symptoms, especially it is administered within 24 hours of symptoms.

There is no indication for the use of antibiotics in infantile botulism. Further supportive care involving ventilation, nutrition, and position are also essential in the patient’s care.

It is vital to avoid all aminoglycosides in the infant as they may potentiate the neuromuscular weakness. Penicillin G and metronidazole are recommended if the cause is a wound infection.
