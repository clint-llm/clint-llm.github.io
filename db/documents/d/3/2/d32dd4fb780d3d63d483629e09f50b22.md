Some of the complications of immediate hypersensitivity reactions are:

**Status Asthmaticus**

This is a type I hypersensitivity reaction, an acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma that does not respond to the standard therapy with bronchodilators. It is a medical emergency and must require aggressive treatment.

**Anaphylactic Shock**

This is an allergic reaction, often life-threatening, triggered by an allergen to which the immune system overreacts.

**Post-Transfusion Reaction**

This is a hypersensitivity reaction that occurs within 24 hours of a blood transfusion. Hemoglobinuria that appears during or after the procedure becomes an alarming sign. Other manifestations include back pain, fever, chills, dizziness, and dyspnea.

**Serum Sickness**

This is a type III hypersensitivity reaction that commences after the administration of a drug (e.g., penicillin) or heterologous anti-serum or plasma. Clinically,Â it is characterized by skin rash, fever, arthralgias, or arthritis. Immune-complexes mediate this complication, and it may affect many organs.
