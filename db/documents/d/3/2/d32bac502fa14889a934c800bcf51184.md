# Continuing Education Activity

Malaria is a global infectious disease that remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world. Severe and fatal malaria is predominantly caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Its management and prognosis depend on the awareness of a possible diagnosis in travelers returning from endemic areas, early recognition, and timely effective treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with falciparum malaria and explains the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of P. falciparum infection. 
- Summarize the findings seen in a patient with P. falciparum malaria. 
- Describe common complications for patients with severe P. falciparum malaria. 
- Outline the importance of communication and collaboration among the interdisciplinary team to enhance the delivery of care and improve outcomes for patients affected by P. falciparum malaria.

# Introduction

Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by five protozoa: Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale, and most recently implicated P.knowlesi. Infection with P. falciparum is being accounted for more than 90% of the world’s malaria mortality and therefore remains an important threat to public health on a global scale.

# Etiology

Five species of genus Plasmodium are known to cause malaria in humans. The vector for Plasmodium spp. is a female Anopheles mosquito that inoculates sporozoites contained in her salivary glands into the puncture wound when feeding.P. falciparum produces high levels of blood-stage parasites and is known to modify the surface of the infected RBC, creating an adhesive phenotype, e.g. (sticky cell) causing RBC sequestration inside small and middle-sized vessels, removing the parasite from the circulation for nearly half of the asexual cycle.nopheles mosquito, the male micro-gametocytes go through a process of ex-flagellation in the mosquito's midgut, fusing with female macro-gametes to form a zygote. The zygote then reaches the stage of ookinete that migrates through a thin wall, matures into oocyst, producing and upon rupturing, releasing numerous sporozoites that are dispersed throughout mosquitos body, including salivary glands, therefore completing the lifecycle. Gametocytes are hence of vital importance to the transmission cycle of malaria.

# Epidemiology

**Worldwide**

WHO World Malaria Report 2019 states that an estimated 228 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide in 2018, and reports steadily decreasing the number of cases since 2010. In 2018, nineteen sub-Saharan African countries and India carried approximately 85% of the global malaria burden. The most prevalent and pathogenic malaria parasite, most commonly associated with severe illness and death, especially in the WHO African region, accounting for 99.7% malaria cases, is P. falciparum.P. falciparum is also highly prevalent in South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, and Western Pacific regions. The most vulnerable groups affected by malaria in high-transmission areas are children younger than 5 years old, their deaths accounting for 67% of global malaria deaths, and primigravidae. In low transmission areas, all ages are at risk due to low immunity.

**The United States**

Most malaria cases diagnosed in the United States of America are imported from endemic countries.P. falciparum, accounting for 86.6% cases from Africa, 70.9% from Central America, 20.8% from South America, and 4.8% from Asia.

Based on present predictions for climate change, researchers predict an increase in the geographical distribution of malaria and an increasingly suitable climate for malaria transmission in tropical regions.P. falciparum, particularly prevalent in Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), causing high failure rates of artemisinin-combination therapies.

**General Epidemiology and Risk Groups**

Severe malaria occurs in patients with no or little effective immunity. In parts of the world with the stable and intense transmission of P. falciparum, severe malaria is mostly a disease of the pediatric population younger than 5 years, as specific acquired immunity develops with age (due to repeated infections), providing increased, although incomplete, protection in older children and adults. Severe malaria can, however, occur at any age in areas with low or/and unstable transmission rates and individuals with no-immunity (e.g., travelers to the endemic areas).

# Pathophysiology

The rupture of the first liver schizont and the release of motile merozoites into peripheral circulation to invade red blood cells marks the start of a possible symptomatic infection. The first rupture and invasion are usually silent in most infected patients, but as the asexual cycle repeats itself in the next 24 to 48 hours, parasitemia rises, and immune response increases accordingly. It is usually associated with an increase of TNF alpha and other inflammatory markers in the cascade, including interleukin 10 (IL-10) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma).

The most important virulence determinant in P. falciparum infection is the parasite´s ability to modify the surface of the infected red blood cell, thus creating an adhesive phenotype. The cytoadhesion is mediated through the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1(PfEMP1) family, which is the product of var gene transcription. There is immense diversity in var genes in the parasite population, which has recently been a focus of research, due to its suggested association between increased transcription of specific var genes and the development of severe malaria.

In essence, the key features that render a fatal disease are the sequestration of P. falciparum in tissues, in conjunction with the up-regulation of cytokines and other toxic substances and an absence or an untimely provision of effective antimalarial therapy.

# History and Physical

Malaria is a complex disease with a spectrum of clinical effects that not only differ between children and adults but can range from practically none in patients with asymptomatic parasitemia, to uncomplicated malaria, through to severe and possibly lethal malaria.P. falciparum is 12 days, with most patients presenting in the first or second month after exposure in endemic areas.

**UncomplicatedP. falciparum Malaria **

Malaria can be separated into two disease presentations: uncomplicated and severe. P. ovale or P. vivax. P. falciparum infections, although only a small percentage, approximately 1% to 2% of infections, lead to severe malaria.

**SevereP. falciparum Malaria**

The patient presenting with at least one of the clinical or laboratory features listed below, with asexual P. falciparum parasitemia (either detected in the peripheral blood smear or confirmed with rapid diagnostic test) and no other confirmed cause of his symptoms, classifies as suffering from severe malaria. P. falciparum is responsible for the majority of the cases of severe malaria, it is also, albeit rarely, observed with P. vivax and P. knowlesi infections.

A shortened list of danger signs is used for rapid clinical assessment, which includes prostration, respiratory distress (acidotic breathing), and impaired consciousness.**.******A comprehensive list of diagnostic criteria for falciparum malaria is shown in Table 1 - Diagnostic criteria for severeP. falciparum malaria.

**Physical Examination**

Physical examination is usually unremarkable, especially of patients with uncomplicated malaria. They frequently present with irregular and erratic fever, reaching up to 41°C, sometimes accompanied by agitation or confusion.P. falciparum malaria.

**Children**

Children are more likely to present with non-specific and gastrointestinal symptoms such as fever, lethargy, malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and somnolence.

**Pregnant Women**

The clinical features of infection in pregnancy vary from asymptomatic to severe, depending on the degree of (incomplete) immunity that a woman had acquired by the time she got pregnant. In semi-immune pregnant women, only a few infections result in fever or other symptoms.P. falciparum infections are proven to be associated with complications such as maternal anemia, low birth weight, miscarriage, stillbirths, and congenital malaria.

# Evaluation

Once malaria is considered a possible diagnosis, it is important to facilitate immediate laboratory testing.

A full blood count, urea, creatinine and electrolytes, blood glucose level, and liver function tests should be routinely performed. Thrombocytopenia suggests both non-falciparum and falciparum malaria infections in non-immune adults and children. In severely ill patients, additional studies such as blood gases, blood culture, lactate, and clotting studies are appropriate. In patients with fever and impaired consciousness, one should consider a lumbar puncture to exclude meningitis.

The golden standard for diagnosis is a**microscopic analysis of thick and thin blood smears.**Thick smears allow for a sensitive parasitemia quantification, as parasitemias as low as 30-50/microL can be detected, while thin smears enable a determination of thePlasmodium species, prognostic assessment based on the staging of parasite development and estimation of the proportion of neutrophils containing malaria pigment.

Perceived peripheral blood parasitemia varies greatly in patients with severe malaria, due to the sequestration of the infected red blood cells in tissues.

**Rapid diagnostic tests**are commonly used in addition to blood slides and are useful alternatives in settings where a microscopic diagnosis is non-reliable or infeasible.P. falciparum histidine-rich-protein 2 (PfHRP2)) or enzyme called Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH). Tests have several downfalls as they cannot provide quantitative results, can stay positive months after infection with P. falciparum, or are, if testing for pLDH, positive only while there are living parasites in the blood.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of the possible diagnostic modalities but is, even if promptly available, too timely to use for initial diagnosis and prompt treatment of acute malaria. It should, however, be used for research and epidemiologic purposes in any malaria infection in the USA, to determine and confirm the infecting species.

# Treatment / Management

CDC recommends that the treatment of malaria should not be initiated until the diagnosis has been confirmed by laboratory testing. Treatment should be initiated immediately after the confirmation of malaria infection. Empirical treatment is, however, reserved only for extreme cases where there is a strong clinical suspicion with convincing exposure history, presence of severe disease, or an inability to diagnose malaria due to inadequate laboratory facilities.

The treatment should be guided by three main factors: the infecting Plasmodium species, the clinical status of the patient, and drug susceptibility of infecting Plasmodium, determined by the geographic region where the infection was acquired. Chloroquine sensitivity can be expected if the infection was acquired in Central America west of Panama Canal, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. In a case when the diagnosis is strongly suspected, and it cannot be confirmed, or when there is no species determination possible, given the global spread of P. falciparum resistant to chloroquine, the clinician should opt for a treatment option effective against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum. CDC recommends making additional blood smears in infections with P. falciparum after initiating the treatment, to confirm adequate parasitological response (decrease in density) to treatment.

Extended, evidence-based, and comprehensive guidelines for malaria management and optimal dosing of antimalarial medications can be found in the third edition of WHOs Guidelines for the treatment of malaria. Treatment and management algorithms for malaria in the USA are available on the CDC´s official website.

**Uncomplicated Falciparum Malaria**

Uncomplicated falciparum malaria should be treated with one of the artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT). Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is highly effective due to its effect on a broader range of parasite life cycles, causing faster parasite clearance and is therefore considered a drug of choice for uncomplicated malaria.

There are some other treatment options, although not as effective as ACTs, such as atovaquone-proguanil, quinine sulfate plus doxycycline, tetracycline, or clindamycin, and mefloquine. For chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum infections (including

pregnant women), the drug of choice is chloroquine. However, any of the drug choices listed above for chloroquine-resistant strains can be used. Treatment options are the same for the pediatric population, with doses adjusted by the patient’s weight.

**Severe Falciparum Malaria**

All patients diagnosed or with a strong suspicion with signs and symptoms of severe malaria should be promptly treated with parenteral antimalarial therapy. Effective, urgent, and appropriate treatment has the greatest impact on prognosis.

Intravenous or intramuscular artesunate is the first-line treatment in all patients (including children, lactating women, and pregnant women in all trimesters) worldwide and should be used for at least 24 hours and until the oral medication is tolerated.

If artesunate is not available, the recommended drug is artemether in preference to quinine. After the complete course of a 24 hour intravenous artesunate, a regimen of a follow-up drug should be completed. A full 3-day regimen of ACT is recommended. In returning traveler, the follow-on antimalarial medication needs to be other than the antimalarial medication taken for prophylaxis.

Intravenous artesunate is currently not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or commercially available in the U.S. but is available from CDC under an expanded-access investigational drug (IND) protocol. It is prepositioned at distribution sites throughout the USA and readily available after contacting CDC. Since severe malaria can progress rapidly, CDC offers guidance on oral treatment that can be used while waiting for IV artesunate to be delivered. They recommend interim treatment with oral artemether-lumefantrine (preferably), atovaquone-proguanil, quinine sulfate, or mefloquine. If a patient can not tolerate oral medications, administration after an antiemetic or via nasogastric tube should be considered.

Patients with falciparum malaria should be admitted to the hospital due to the possibility of deterioration even after the effective treatment was initiated. If patients are determined to have uncomplicated malaria, they can be treated as outpatients after confirming that they can tolerate oral therapy, and the parasitemia has declined.

It is important to provide supportive therapy, such as glucose to maintain euglycemia and acetaminophen for fever control, careful, individualized fluid management as patients present with variable degrees of hypovolemia, acidosis, and acute kidney failure. Blood transfusion is sometimes indicated in severe anemias; benzodiazepines should be used for seizure control. However, prophylactic antiepileptic medications are not recommended, and empiric antibiotics should be used in children with severe malaria and adults with concurrent shock.

# Differential Diagnosis

Other travel-related infections such as typhoid, viral hemorrhagic fevers (such as Ebola, Lassa fever, etc.), hepatitis, dengue, and other arboviruses, enteric fever, avian influenza, tuberculosis, MERS-CoV infections, HIV, meningitis, and encephalitis can resemble malaria. Non-tropical infections such as bacterial pneumonia, septicemia, and influenza should be excluded.

Cerebral malaria can mimic bacterial meningitis, measles, (locally prevalent) viral encephalitis, toxic syndromes, and intracranial vascular or mechanical events.

# Prognosis

Patients with uncomplicated malaria, especially with timely diagnosis, treatment, and proper compliance, usually recover from malaria without consequences. The mortality rate for uncomplicated malaria is low, around 0.1%.****The mortality rate rises steeply once the patient develops signs and symptoms of severefalciparum malaria. Adults have higher mortality rates and more frequent multisystem involvement than children, with mortality rates being 18.5% and 9.7%, respectively.****While the general mortality of treated severe malaria is between 10% to 20%, the mortality in pregnant women reaches approximately 50%.

# Complications

A distinct complication of P. falciparum malaria is cerebral malaria (CM), a diffuse and symmetrical encephalopathy.

Other possible complications, predominantly caused by P. falciparum, include:

- Acute kidney injury complicates up to 40% of P. falciparum malaria.

- Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and hypoxia

- Electrolyte and fluid abnormalities

- Acid-base disturbances – mostly acidosis and hyperlactatemia

- Hypoglycemia, often exacerbated by quinine therapy

- Anemia, with the reduction in hemoglobin levels being proportional to disease severity and duration of illness before treatment

- Other hematological complications (delayed hemolytic anemia following artemisinin treatment, hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS), and splenic rupture)

- Blackwater fever and hemoglobinuria due to intravascular hemolysis in patients with severe clinical manifestations of falciparum malaria

- Profound thrombocytopenia is often associated with P. falciparum infection, however, bleeding and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are rare.

- Hepatic dysfunction

- Shock and associated infections (such as Salmonella bacteriemia, aspiration pneumonia, nosocomial infections, etc.)

- Neurological sequelae (epilepsy, permanent focal deficits, etc.)

The three most common complications occurring in children are cerebral malaria, severe anemia, and acidosis, either isolated or overlapping.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Although no intervention for preventing the infection is 100% effective, there are several different approaches available that can be used alone or in combination. Personal protective measures reduce the risk of exposure to infective mosquitoes, and chemoprophylaxis can aid in reducing the risk of a poor outcome if infected.****A common approach usually applied is an “ABCD” of malaria – A standing for awareness of the risk, B for bite avoidance, C for compliance with chemoprophylaxis, and D for diagnosis in case of fever. It is essential to consider traveler´s health (especially pregnancy, age, immunosuppression) when assessing the risk for developing severe malaria and choosing an appropriate antimalarial drug.

It is necessary to emphasize the importance of personal protective measures such as barrier clothing, insecticide-impregnated bed nets, application of effective mosquito repellent (higher percentage of active ingredient provides longer protection), and spraying the residence with insecticide. Products that contain 20%-40% of DEET (N, N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide), picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or PMD (p-menthane-3,8-diol) and IR3535 are recommended. Behaviors to minimize exposure to mosquitos are also encouraged – for instance, staying indoors from dusk till dawn, choosing screened accommodations.Anopheles mosquitos.

A standard recommendation for all travelers to endemic areas is strict compliance with the antimalarial drug. There are several different drug choices, prescribed after assessing individual´s risk (level of local transmission, duration of exposure, rural vs. urban travel, type of travel and season), travelers health status, present contraindications, level of parasite drug resistance (mostly chloroquine and mefloquine resistance) and traveler’s preference based on schedule, cost and nature of possible side effects**.**There is an increasing problem with counterfeit and substandard medications being sold in several Sub-Saharan countries, and travelers should be advised to buy the needed medications before departure.****A complete list of recommendations for drug choice can be found on the CDCs website – Malaria Information by Country.

As pregnant women are at increased risk for severe malaria, the WHO and other organizations recommend not traveling to the endemic areas.

Travelers to the endemic areas, former residents of malaria-endemic areas and people diagnosed with malaria should be informed, as per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations, that they may not donate blood for 1 year after travel or 3 years after departing or revisiting the country or for 3 years after treatment, respectively.

Travelers should be informed that malaria can be fatal with delayed treatment, and one should, therefore, seek medical attention while abroad if symptoms of malaria develop and not fly back for treatment, as medical treatment may not be readily available on transit**.**

# Pearls and Other Issues

Malaria vaccine would be an ideal tool to control, prevent, eliminate, and ultimately eradicate the disease. The complexity of P. falciparum infection has hindered several attempts at developing an effective vaccine, yet the acquisition of partial immunity and successful treatment of malaria with purified immunoglobulins from semi-immune adults showed that the development of a vaccine is attainable. Researchers have identified several potential targets in the parasite´s infectious cycle. Currently, 20 vaccine candidates are undergoing clinical trials.****The most promising and most advanced vaccine to be developed so far is a licensed RTS, S subunit vaccine (RTS, S/ASO1), targeting the pre-erythrocytic stage of infection, thus preventing hepatocyte infection and parasite development, consequently limiting RBC invasion. It consists of a recombinant protein of theP. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) conjugated to the hepatitis B surface antigen.

There has been an emergence of a (widely used) pyrethroid insecticide-resistant malaria vector population, causing extensive research with their first results suggesting a better effect of long-lasting insecticidal nets treated with PBO (piperonyl butoxide) instead of pyrethroid laced nets.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Most cases of malaria in the U.S. are imported and could, therefore, be avoided with appropriate personal protective measures and compliance with prescribed chemoprophylaxis. Health care providers on all levels must be educated not only on the diagnosis and treatment of malaria but especially on the importance of prevention. They should be able to provide enough information to travelers at risk. Travelers to the endemic areas should obtain appropriate clothing, insecticides, and other protective gear based on the information offered by health care providers and CDC. Collaboratively, a physician and a pharmacist, should decide on, recommend and prescribe appropriate chemoprophylaxis, considering traveler's personal preferences, time of travel, current health status, risk factors, drug-drug interactions, and possible contraindications, while emphasizing the importance of compliance with the drug-taking regimen.

The crucial issue in the diagnosis and treatment of malaria is the consideration of the possibility of diagnosis. Expert advice from an infectious disease or travel medicine specialist should be sought once malaria is a suspected diagnosis, especially in the setting of severe disease.****Healthcare providers that are a part of the interprofessional team (nurses, respiratory therapists, physicians, etc.) managing patients with severe malaria in critical or intensive care units, should be educated on early recognition of complications.
