**Prognostic Factors**

**Age at Onset**

- Usually younger age at diagnosis equals a better outcome.

- Patients less than 6 years old may develop a normal hip joint.

- Patients older than 6 years may have continued pain and subsequent arthritis.

**Lateral Pillar Classification**(degree of femoral head involvement: A [least] to C [most])

- Patients more than 8 years old and patients in lateral pillar group B or B/C (border group) do better with surgery than with nonoperative treatment.

- Patients less than 8 years old and patients in group B do well regardless of treatment choice.

- Patients in group C experience poor outcomes regarding hip condition, regardless of treatment choice.

**Recovery**

Fifty percent of patients almost fully recover, with no long-term sequelae

**Pain and Disability**

Fifty percent of patients develop pain and disability in their 40s and 50s and degenerative joint disease leading to hip replacement in their 60s and 70s.

**Gender**

Female patients have worse prognoses than male patients if onset occurs at more than 8 years of age.
