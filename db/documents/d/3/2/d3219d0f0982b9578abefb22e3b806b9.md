Neuroendocrine chromaffin cells, responsible for the biosynthesis of catecholamines, are located throughout the brain and in the adrenal glands. The highest density of chromaffin cells is located within the adrenal medulla, the most functionally significant area of catecholamine production. The kidneys are responsible for excreting the byproducts of catecholamine degradation. Adrenergic receptors activated by catecholamines are located in multisystem smooth muscle and adipose tissue.
