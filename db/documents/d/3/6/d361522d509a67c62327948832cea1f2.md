Major cardiothoracic surgery—the typical scenario in which a TTMPB is utilized—is an orchestrated production consisting of a multidisciplinary healthcare team for the patient's perioperative care, with pain management being a significant aspect of this care. The surgeons, the anesthesiologist, the perfusionists, the perioperative nursing staff, the cardiologists, the pharmacists, and the rest of the patient's hospital team – clear and compelling communication between all parties involved leads to better patient outcomes.

Before performing any nerve block or procedure, a thorough review of the patient's medical record is required to select interventions that will provide maximal dermatomal coverage and analgesic benefit. A universal timeout should be performed before beginning the block to eliminate confusion, minimize errors, and answer questions regarding the procedure. The TTMPB should be performed by an anesthesiologist proficient in regional anesthesia to provide the most accurate needle placement and local anesthetic deposition possible.

After performing a TTMPB, the patient should be stationed in a unit that frequently monitors the patient's cardiopulmonary status, whether in the emergency department connected to ASA standard monitors or in the intensive care unit postoperatively. This is because complications following a TTMPB, while rare, could be severe and require prompt attention from interprofessional team members who recognize the warning signs.
