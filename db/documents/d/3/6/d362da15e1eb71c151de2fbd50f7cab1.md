Epidural anesthesia is achievable using either the classic epidural, the combined spinal-epidural (CSE) technique, or dural puncture epidural (DPE). CSE and DPE include an additional step consisting of delivering a spinal dose of LA and coadjuvants (CSE) or only puncturing the dura mater (DPE) using a spinal needle.

Monitoring the patient hemodynamic status during the procedure is very important. The minimum monitors required are a pulse oximeter for pulse and oxygen saturation as well as a blood pressure cuff and continuous EKG to assess cardiovascular status.

Several drugs can be used in different combinations to achieve neuraxial anesthesia:

Local anesthetics: Llidocaine1% and 2%, bupivacaine 0.25%, 0.5% and 0.75%, tetracaine 0.5%, mepivacaine 1%, 1.5% and 2%, ropivacaine 0.75%, levobupivacaine 0.5%, chloroprocaine 2% and 3%.

Epidural Additives: Vasoconstrictors such as epinephrine and phenylephrine are used to decrease the vascular absorption of local anesthetics.

Opioids: fentanyl, morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, or sufentanil (augment analgesic effects of the LA).

Alpha-agonists: clonidine prolongs epidural analgesia.

Palpating the spine and recognizing the spinous processes can be challenging in obese and morbidly obese patients. The ultrasound helps to identify bony structures and the epidural space in these cases. Also, it has been associated with a decrease in procedure time and the number of attempts compared to palpation alone.
