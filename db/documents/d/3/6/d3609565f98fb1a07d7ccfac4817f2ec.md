The marginal zone contains post germinal center B cells that have undergone somatic hypermutation. Chronic and persistent immune stimulation, either of infective or autoimmune nature, leads to the development of MALTomas. The postulated pathophysiologic mechanism of tumor development is that chronic inflammation leads to the accumulation of antigen-dependent B cells locally in the associated MALT. This growth is monoclonal, but continuous growth signal due to chronic inflammation makes B cells prone to accumulating mutations. With time, the cells accumulate mutations, and the growth pattern transforms from monoclonal to polyclonal, leading to the development of neoplastic B cells in the marginal zone of the MALT. Following translocations are most commonly found in MALTomas:

- t(14;18)(q32;q21)

- t(11;18)(q21;q21)

- t(3;14)(p13;q32)

- t(1;14)(p22;q32)

Many of these mutations lead to the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which increases the survival of neoplastic B cells in the marginal zone.
