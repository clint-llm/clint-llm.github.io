Physiologic variants in the popliteal fossa are a common finding and are seen most commonly in the branches of the popliteal artery and sciatic nerve. Studies have revealed seven major branching variances in decreasing order of frequency: aplastic or hypoplastic posterior tibial artery; hypoplastic or aplastic anterior tibial artery; trifurcation; high origin of the anterior tibial artery; hypoplastic or aplastic posterior tibial and anterior tibial arteries; high origin of the posterior tibial branch; and anterior tibioperoneal trunk. Also of note, when a variant is discovered on either extremity, the probability of a variant being found in the contralateral extremity is approximately 28%. If one side has normal vascular anatomy, the probability of a physiologic variant in the contralateral extremity is close to 13%.

Usually, the sciatic nerve divides into the tibial nerve and common peroneal nerve at the level of the superior angle of the popliteal fossa. However, the most common variant branching pattern of the sciatic nerve division is found superior to this landmark. Divisions as high as in the pelvis have been seen, however, the majority of the sciatic nerve divisions into tibial and peroneal components are most often seen outside of the pelvis.
