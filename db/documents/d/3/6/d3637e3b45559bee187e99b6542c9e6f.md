Researchers have identified HHV-6B as the etiologic pathogen responsible for most HHV-6 infections presenting with symptoms. While research supports that a majority of people have been infected with HHV-6 at some point in their life, primary infection with HHV-6 occurs within the first 2 years.Â  In this age group, it is usually associated with an undifferentiated febrile illness, albeit a subset of children will exhibit the classic manifestations of roseola infantum.

HHV-6 is a ubiquitous virus found worldwide. In a large prospective study of North American children, the peak age of HHV-6 acquisition was between 6 and 9 months of age.
