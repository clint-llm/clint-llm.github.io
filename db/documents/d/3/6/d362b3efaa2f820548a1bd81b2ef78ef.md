The management of corneal arcus while often clinically insignificant requires an interprofessional approach. If the patient is young the clinician may decide to further assess lipids. If the patient is older the may decide to monitor the condition and not proceed with any further diagnostic studies. An ophthalmology nurse will be involved in a more complete assessment and may assist with patient education. Nurses coordinate care and document for the team. If a future lipid study is required a nurse will likely be required to perform this test. Pending the results of the lipid study, additional healthcare professionals may be required including cardiology, vascular surgery, neurology, etc. This interprofessional team paradigm will drive better patient outcomes.
