The most common indication for osteocutaneous radial forearm free flap is the osseous reconstruction of the mandible and maxilla. The amount of radial bone harvested is generally limited. It is best used in short segment mandibular and maxilla reconstruction, but its thickness is insufficient to support dental implant placement. Similarly, the osteocutaneous radial forearm can be used to augment bone in the extremities, but the thin bone stock limits its use.
