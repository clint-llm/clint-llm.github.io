Members ofÂ the interprofessional healthcare team, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), who prescribe penicillamine, should be familiar with its pharmacology. Because the agent can bind many drugs and minerals, regular monitoring of the patient is necessary. Nursing staff can counsel the patient on the drug and assist with monitoring. The pharmacist should educate the patient not to take the other medications at the same time as penicillamine, watch for drug-drug interactions, and verify dosing is appropriate for the condition being treated and the patient's age and health status. All interprofessional team members need to participate in close monitoring of therapy to prevent adverse events and therapeutic failure. Finally, before prescribing this agent, always ask if the patient has any allergies; nearly 30% of patients develop some type of allergic reaction to penicillamine.
