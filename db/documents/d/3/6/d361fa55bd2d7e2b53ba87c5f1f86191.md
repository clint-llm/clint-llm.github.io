Colposcopy is a procedure in which a lighted, magnifying instrument called a colposcope is used to examine the cervix, vagina, and vulva. Hans Hinselmen of Germany first described colposcopy in 1925 as a screening tool for cervical cancer. It is a diagnostic procedure performed to evaluate women with an abnormal Papinocalau (Pap) test, women with visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), women positive for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, or with a suspicious appearing cervix even if the PAP test is normal. It is also performed as a post-treatment follow-up of intraepithelial and invasive carcinoma.

Colposcopy is practiced by a number of different clinicians, including advanced practice clinicians, family medicine physicians, gynecologists, gynecological oncologists, and some internists. There is poor standardization of this process as well as training received or continued development based on daily, monthly, or more infrequently practiced procedures. It is well known that colposcopy has significant variability and poor reliability between colposcopists. The ASCCP (American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology) published colposcopy standards in 2017 to address these and other concerns.
