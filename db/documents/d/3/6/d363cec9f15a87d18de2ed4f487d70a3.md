Transient **s**ubstance-induced disorders may be differentiated from a primary psychiatric illness through observation during a period of abstinence with a temporal association of the intake of a substance. A family history of a primary psychiatric illness may also facilitate distinction. For substance-induced symptoms of mania, the differentiation may be more complex because of a high probability of temporal association or causality of mood symptoms after substance use.
