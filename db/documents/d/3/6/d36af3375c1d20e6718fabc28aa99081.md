Blood is mandatory to maintain adequate circulation within the cardiovascular system and perfuse body tissues. Hemorrhage is the loss of blood components from the vascular system and can lead to inadequate tissue oxygenation. Hemorrhagic shock occurs when this blood loss leads to inadequate tissue oxygenation. Hemorrhage secondary to traumatic injury is the leading cause of death of Americans from one to 46 years of age. The stop the bleed campaign was first launched in 2013. This educational program aims to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with hemorrhage secondary to traumatic injury. This activity will discuss the common types of bleeding, their causes, and ways to treat hemorrhage and highlight the interprofessional team's role in managing the hemorrhaging patient.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the types of bleeding and the most common initial actions to treat them.
- Review the trauma classification system for hypovolemic shock and the incorporation of the base deficit as a factor.
- Identify the surgical and pharmacologic treatments available to treat hemorrhage and the indications for each of them.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure that medical advancements in hemorrhage control are incorporated into civilian systems which utilize laypeople, EMS, and in-hospital teams.
