In addition to standard operating room set-up, table, and sterile drapes, other needed equipment will vary by surgeon preference but typically includes an orthopedic set with retractors, clamps, etc. An oscillating saw or Gigli saw, a scalpel, and a drill will also be needed. Variable sutures and ties of the surgeon's preference are another necessity for tying off vessels. A suction drain is typically used as well as a device of the surgeon’s preference for wound closure. Additionally, some surgeons may choose to use a sterile tourniquet to reduce blood loss. Radiology is not routinely necessary, but one must make sure the patient is on a radiolucent bed if it is needed intraoperatively.
