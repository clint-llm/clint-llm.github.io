Stress echocardiography constitutes the combination of two-dimensional echocardiography with physical, pharmacological, or less commonly, electrical pacing. In some patients, stress may increase
ischemia or lead to new or worsened wall motion abnormalities. Stress echocardiography plays an important role in identifying wall motion abnormalities in the assessment of ischemic heart disease. It is also used for evaluation of systolic and diastolic heart failure, valvular pathologies, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, and congenital heart disease. This activity reviews stress echocardiography, its indications, and the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating patients with heart disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for stress echocardiography.
- Describe the techniques for performing stress echocardiography.
- Review the clinical relevance of stress echocardiography.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients undergoing stress echocardiography.
