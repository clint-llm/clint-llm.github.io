Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory liver disorder usually characterized by circulating autoantibodies and elevated serum globulin levels. The pathology of the disease is that of a gradual hepatocellular inflammation that cannot be explained by more common etiologies of chronic liver disease, such as alcohol-related liver disease, viral hepatitis, hereditary liver disorders, or exposure to hepatotoxic substances.

Autoimmune disorders and having positive autoantibodies are risk factors for obstetric complications and perinatal morbidity and mortality.
