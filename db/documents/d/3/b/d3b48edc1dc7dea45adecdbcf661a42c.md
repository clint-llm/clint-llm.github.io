In mass spectrometry, the following components are used to test the sample for analysis.

**Ionization**

During ionization, the atoms are ionized by removing an electron to give off a positive ion known as a cation. Mass spectrometers only work with positive ions. Cations are formed regardless of the present state of the atoms. For example, this is true even if there is initially a negative ion in the sample, such as fluoride, or an element that does not form ions, such as neon.

The most common form of ionization used in GC/MS is electron ionization (EI). This method requires a source of electrons in the form of a filament to which an electric potential is applied, typically at 70 eV.

Unlike electron ionization (EI) in GC/MS, most LC/MS ionization techniques are conducted at atmospheric pressure. Electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) are “soft” ionization techniques that leave the molecular ion largely intact in the source.

Electrospray ionization uses a combination of voltage, heat, and air to produce successively smaller droplets from the liquid, eluting off a chromatographic column.

Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization produces ions by using a combination of heat to completely vaporize the sample and plasma produced by an electrical discharge, commonly referred to as a corona discharge.

**Acceleration**

All ions will undergo acceleration to have the same amount of kinetic energy. Cations will pass through slits in the mass spectrometer apparatus and accelerate into the ion beam. This allows the mass analyzer to start separating the ions based on the mass-to-charge ratio.

**Deflection**

A magnetic field will deflect cations based on their mass and charge. Mass and deflection are inversely proportional, while charge and deflection are directly proportional. Therefore, if an ion is of lesser mass, it will get deflected more in the apparatus. If an ion has a greater positive charge compared to its counterparts, then it will get deflected more, as well.

Thus, the deflection principles will allow the mass-to-charge ratio to be determined by the apparatus. The mass-to-charge ratio is denoted by m/z. If an ion has a mass of 120 and a charge of 3+, the ratio would be 40. Of note, it is important to remember that most ions that pass through the mass spectrometer have a charge of 1+, so almost all the ions will have a mass (or molecular weight) equivalent to the m/z value.

**Detection**

A detector in the mass spectrometer apparatus will quantify the ions and remove certain ones. Positive ions are detected by the apparatus, while neutral ions will be removed by the vacuum.

**Vacuum**

Mass spectrometers operate at low pressure, which creates a vacuum effect as there is less probability that ions will collide with one another in the apparatus. This then allows for the proper separation of cations with the neutral ions as the vacuum extracts the neutral molecules.
