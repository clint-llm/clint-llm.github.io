Boutonniere deformity describes a medical condition in which the finger is flexed at the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) and hyperextended at the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP). This is usually a result of trauma in the acute setting and is caused by a rupture of the PIP central slip. This results in damage to the extensor function of the affected digit. A boutonniere deformity can also result from laceration injury to the central slip and dorsal capsule.
