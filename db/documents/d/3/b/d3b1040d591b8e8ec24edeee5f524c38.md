Most complications are related to the sequela of portal hypertension. Esophageal and gastric varices resulting in large volume hematemesis, ascites, hemorrhoids, and hepatic encephalopathy are just some of the complications that can arise. In addition to the above-listed complications, end-stage liver disease itself is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma, and patients with this condition whose disease has progressed to cirrhosis are at a heightened risk for malignancy. Those with PFIC2 appear to be at risk of malignancy independent of their risk associated with cirrhosis.

Also, on top of the complications of the disease process itself, the complications and adverse effects of the various treatment modalities are listed below:

- Medical management

- UDCA: Diarrhea, +/- pruritis
- Rifampicin: Hepatotoxicity, fever, gastrointestinal disturbances, rash
- Cholestyramine: Constipation, intestinal obstruction
- Phenobarbital: Sedation, dizziness, nystagmus, ataxia

- Surgical management

- Liver transplant: Rejection, recurrence with PFIC2, adverse effects of immunosuppressant drugs
- External diversion: Stoma prolapse and cholangitis
- Internal diversion: Rectal bleeding and choleretic diarrhea
