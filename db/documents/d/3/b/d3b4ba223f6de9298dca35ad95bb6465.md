- The plantar calcaneal spurs are not a common cause of the plantar heel pain. Spurs are present in 50% of patients with plantar fasciitis. Over 15% of the general population has a radiologically asymptomatic spur.

- Repeated corticosteroid injection, for treatment of the plantar fasciitis, can lead to heel fat pad atrophy and rupture of the plantar fascia, due to attenuation of the fascia.

- Physicians should treat the  underlying cause of the plantar fasciitis, such as flat feet and ankle instability; otherwise, symptoms will recur shortly after the injection under ultrasound guidance.

General ultrasound criteria for entrapment neuropathies include:

- The cross-sectional area is more than 2 standard deviations above the mean reference value.

- Change in the echotexture of the affected nerve, like being hypoechoic.

- Notching and flattening of the nerve at the entrapment site.

- Change in the fascicle size (enlargement of fascicles within the affected nerve).
