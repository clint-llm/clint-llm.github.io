Syncope is a relatively common phenomenon encountered among patients of every age range, race, religion, and socioeconomic status. Cardiovascular disease is the second most common cause of syncope, with arrhythmias being far more common than structural diseases. Ventricular tachycardia alone is responsible for 11% of syncopal events. Cardiovascular syncope overall is far more prevalent in the elderly population than the younger population, with 10% to 30% of syncopal events in patients over 60 having a cardiac origin. Cardiovascular syncope is also more common in men than in women.

Structural cardiac diseases are more prevalent among patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and patients who smoke. Pre-excitation syndromes tend to be more common among women than men.

Brugada syndrome is more common among males and people of Southeast Asian descent.
