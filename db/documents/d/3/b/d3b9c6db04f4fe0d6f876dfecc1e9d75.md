**Adenoidectomy**

Adenoidectomy, the removal of adenoid tissue, is amongst the most common surgeries performed by an otolaryngologist. The adenoids (nasopharyngeal tonsils) are within the roof and posterior wall of the nasopharynx. Nasopharyngeal adenoid hypertrophy (NAH) is a common cause of nasal obstruction and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB)/obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children, and it is associated with recurrent otitis media and chronic rhinosinusitis. There are three primary indications for an adenoidectomy: chronic otitis media with effusion and concomitant eustachian tube dysfunction, recurrent rhinosinusitis refractory to standard medical treatment, and accompanying tonsillectomy for management of SDB/OSA. Adenoid tissue can regenerate post-removal but rarely to the extent to reproduce pre-operative symptoms.

The traditional method of removing adenoid tissue is using the “blind curettage” method. With this method, the adenoid tissue is not directly visible; therefore, there is a theoretical risk of leaving residual tissue. Consequently, endoscopic techniques have been developed to help achieve full visualization. The most popular endoscopic techniques use a “microdebrider” or radiofrequency.
