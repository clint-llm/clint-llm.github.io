Tufted hair folliculitis is an uncommon, progressive condition associated with cicatricial (scarring) alopecia that affects the scalp. Tufted hair folliculitis is considered a clinicopathologic feature rather than a distinct entity, since it may be observed in association with several scarring conditions. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of tufted hair folliculitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of tufted hair folliculitis.
- Describe the presentation of tufted hair folliculitis.
- Outline the management options available for tufted hair folliculitis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of tufted hair folliculitis and improve outcomes.
