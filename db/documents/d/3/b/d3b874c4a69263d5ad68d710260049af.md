In KSS muscle fibers stains demonstrate ragged red fibers like in other mitochondrial myopathies.

Postmortem ophthalmic pathology reveals atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and outer retina accompanied by the aberrant pigment in all layers of the sensory retina most marked posteriorly, in contrast to the preservation of peripheral retinal rods and cones. This pattern of photoreceptor degeneration led to the theory that the primary defect producing the retinopathy of KSS is in the retinal pigment epithelium.

Furthermore, postmortem neuropathology of patients with KSS can sometimes be associated with severe demyelination of the white matter tracts of the brain. It is not known why the loss of myelin occurs.
