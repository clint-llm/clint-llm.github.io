**Prevention**

Balanoposthitis can be prevented by first establishing proper hygiene habits, including washing area routinely, avoiding forceful retraction, forceful scrubbing, or cleaning under the prepuce in young boys with physiologic phimosis and avoiding strong soaps.

Another way to prevent balanoposthitis is circumcision. Although controversy exists regarding recommendations for circumcising neonates, research ahs show it to prevent penile dermatosis, urinary tract infections, penile cancer, and sexually transmitted infections such as HIV and syphilis.

Conflicting literature exists regarding whether circumcision prevents balanitis compared to balanoposthitis in uncircumcised patients.

Avoiding high-risk sexual behavior may help prevent balanoposthitis by decreasing the risk of sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis, herpes simplex virus, and human papillomavirus.

**Disposition/referral**

The majority of patients without a clear infectious etiology will respond to changes in hygiene and empiric therapy with emollients within one to two weeks. About one in ten of those patient’s symptoms, however, will recur needing further evaluation and more targeted management.

Refractory cases may represent cancerous or precancerous lesions, including balanitis xerotica obliterans, squamous cell carcinoma.
