High clinical suspicion should be maintained as the presentation of osteochondral lesions can mimic several much more common causes of knee pain. The historical features and symptoms of osteochondritis dissecans lesions lie along a spectrum depending on the age of the patient and disease progression at presentation. Asymptomatic osteochondritis dissecans may be discovered incidentally on plain radiographs taken for other reasons while advanced stages may present similarly to an acute knee injury once a loose body is present. Important historical questioning includes a history of trauma, a recent increase in activity level, previous knee injuries and the presence of mechanical symptoms. Pain during weight bearing is the most commonly reported symptom, occurring in approximately 80% of symptomatic osteochondritis dissecans cases.

As mentioned above, osteochondritis dissecans lesions of the knee may be completely asymptomatic, stressing the importance of a comprehensive physical examination to rule out other causes of knee pain. Inspection of knee alignment may reveal genu varus, associated with a lesion at the medial femoral condyle, or genu valgus, more common with osteochondritis dissecans of the lateral femoral condyle.
