Natural and synthetic estrogen may cause the following common adverse effects: breast tenderness, nausea, vomiting, bloating, stomach cramps, headaches, weight gain, hyperpigmentation of the skin, hair loss, vaginal itching, abnormal uterine bleeding, also known as breakthrough bleeding, and anaphylaxis.

Weight gain may be a reported adverse effect of the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) containing ethinyl estradiol, but studies conducted on short-term and long-term use of OCPs resulted in no weight gain association.

More severe side effects of estrogen include hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, exacerbation of epilepsy, irritability, exacerbation of asthma, galactorrhea and nipple discharge, hypocalcemia, gallbladder disease, hepatic hemangioma and adenoma, pancreatitis, breast hypertrophy, endometrial hyperplasia, vaginitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis (intravaginal preparations), enlargement of uterine fibroids, and risk of cervical cancer and breast cancer.

**Box Warnings**

The use of estrogen without progestins increases the risk of endometrial cancer. The use of estrogen with and without progestins resulted in an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary emboli, and deep vein thrombosis in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years old) and an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years old) with oral conjugated estrogens with medroxyprogesterone by studies established by the Women’s Health Initiative. The use of oral conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate increased the risk of developing dementia in postmenopausal women older than 65 years of age, have been established by the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study.

**US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Score: D**

Using estrogen-alone or combined estrogen and progestin to prevent a chronic condition in postmenopausal women with or without a uterus is not recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).
