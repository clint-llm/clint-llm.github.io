**Electrophysiological Testing**

Evoked potentials (EPs) measure electrical signals going to the brain and can determine whether there is motor or somatosensory impairment. The signal is detected by electroencephalography (EEG) or electromyography (EMG). Evoked potentials may be used to assess spinal cord damage in the setting of spinal cord injury and tumors, and measure functional impairment and predict disease progression in multiple sclerosis.

Nerve conduction studies determine whether there has been an injury to a spinal nerve root, peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, muscle, cranial nerve, or spinal nerve. They can also be used to pinpoint spinal cord lesions. Nerve conduction studies work by stimulating nerves close to the skin or using a needle placed near a nerve or nerve root. Neurologists often use them with needle electromyograms.

**Lumbar Puncture**

A lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, samples the CSF from the subarachnoid space. The needle to obtain the sample should be inserted between lumbar spinal canal levels L3 and L4 to avoid contact with the spinal cord.

**Deep Tendon Testing**

One component of the neurological exam is testing the deep tendon reflexes, which are involuntary motor responses to various stimuli that function via reflex arcs within the spinal cord. They can be used to test the function of the motor and sensory nerves at specific spinal cord levels. Reflex grading is on a scale of 0 (absent reflex) to 5+ (sustained clonus).

- Biceps reflex: C5, C6

- Brachioradialis reflex: C6

- Triceps reflex: C7

- Patellar reflex: L2-L4

- Achilles reflex: S1

Additionally, the Babinski reflex, or the extensor plantar reflex, can be seen in newborns but is an abnormal response after six to twelve months of age. If the Babinski reflex is seen after twelve months of age, it may indicate an abnormality in the corticospinal system.

**Romberg Test**

- The Romberg test is used in the evaluation of posterior column disease. In this test, a patient stands up with their feet placed together and their eyes open. The test is said to be positive if the patient closes their eyes, eliminating their visual cues, and they sway or fall.

**Tuning Fork:**

- Vibration sense carried by the dorsal column pathway is tested using a tuning fork. While the patient's eyes are closed, a low-frequency tuning fork is applied to various bony prominences, and the patient is instructed to state when the vibration starts and stops.
