Hypovolemia requires a multidisciplinary approach to management to improve patient outcomes. First, patients should be properly triaged by the severity of their presentation. Nurses should be properly trained and comfortable in the administration of intravenous fluids (IV) and other medications needed. Pharmacists should distribute and maintain an adequate supply of intravenous fluids readily available for fluid resuscitation. Finally, the physicians should be comfortable and astute in their management of hypovolemia, with the goal of identifying the underlying disorder and promptly treat it.
