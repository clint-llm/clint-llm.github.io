Obesity is best managedÂ with an interprofessional team, including clinicians (including mid-level practitioners and specialists), dietitians, nurses, therapists, and pharmacists. Each team member should be able to contribute from their specialty to manage the case. For example, nurses will assist in patient evaluation, coordinate activities between various clinicians, and offer patient counseling. The dietician will make recommendations for a nutrition plan to enable the patient to lose weight, while the pharmacist can assist in selecting a weight-loss medication. Obesity has significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated. Psychological professionals can also help the patient with the behavioral changes needed. The key is to educate the patient on the harms of obesity. Patients must change their lifestyle, become physically active, maintain a healthy weight, and exercise regularly. All current therapies for obesity hypoventilation syndrome are palliative until the patient loses weight. Under a coordinated interprofessional team effort with open communication, this becomes increasingly possible. [Level 5]
