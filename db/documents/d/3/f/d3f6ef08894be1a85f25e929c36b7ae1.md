If a patient takes too many oral contraceptive pills at one time, the most likely complications will be severe headaches, nausea, or vomiting. There is no antidote to treat this condition, just treating the symptoms with antiemetics and analgesics. If the patient has other risk factors significant for increased venous thromboembolism, one may temporarily consider a prophylactic anticoagulant medication. High doses of estrogen and progesterone (the same types found in the combined OCâ€™s) are even treatment options for menorrhagia that have led to severe or symptomatic anemia.

There have been no reports of serious ill effects from an overdose, including ingestion by children. However, overdosage may cause withdrawal bleeding in females and nausea. Drospirenone is a spironolactone analog with anti-mineralocorticoid properties, so monitor serum concentration of potassium and sodium and evidence of metabolic acidosis in overdose cases. Contact the local poison control center for the protocol to follow if an overdose is suspected or confirmed.
