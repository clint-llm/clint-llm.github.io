Digoxin is contraindicated in the following conditions

- Acute myocardial infarction

- Hypersensitivity to the drug

- Ventricular fibrillation

- Myocarditis

- Hypomagnesemia

- Hypokalemia

- Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome

Its use requires caution in cases of:

- Hypercalcemia/hypocalcemia

- Renal impairment

- Diseased SA node

- Bradycardia

- AV block

- Restrictive cardiomyopathy

- Constrictive pericarditis

- Thyroid disease - hypothyroidism leads to delayed drug clearance, and hyperthyroidism does the opposite.

Digoxin may present interactions with the following:

- Azole antifungals, which inhibit the transport of digoxin via human P-glycoprotein

- Macrolide antibiotics inhibit P-glycoprotein, thus increasing intestinal drug absorption

- Rifampin

- Dronedarone

- Loop diuretics

- Quinidine

- Intravenous calcium products
