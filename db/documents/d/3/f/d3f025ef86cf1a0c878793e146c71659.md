Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is a progressive disorder that can lead to worsening stenosis and, ultimately, renal failure. In previous studies, the 3-year cumulative incidence of disease progression was found to be 18%, 28%, and 49% for renal arteries classified as normal, <60% stenosis and >60% stenosis. High blood pressure (systolic >160 mm hg), diabetes mellitus, and high-grade stenosis (>60% obstruction) have been shown to be associated with an increased rate of progression. Untreated renovascular hypertension can also lead to end-stage renal failure with a median survival time of 25 months and a 4-year mortality rate of 35%. Primary management of renovascular hypertension should aim to correct the underlying cause. Renovascular hypertension due to atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis should be primarily managed medically as multiple studies have failed to show renal or cardiovascular benefits with invasive management.
