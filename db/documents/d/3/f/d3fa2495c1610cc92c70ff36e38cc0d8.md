Weightbearing radiographs of both feet, including anteroposterior, lateral, and sesamoid, assess the degree of varus, the intermetatarsal and interphalangeal angles, absent lateral sesamoid, excessive medial eminence resection, the position of the sesamoids relative to the metatarsal head, and degenerative changes in the metatarsophalangeal or interphalangeal joints.
