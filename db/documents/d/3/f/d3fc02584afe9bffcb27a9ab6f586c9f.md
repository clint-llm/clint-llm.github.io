**Imaging**

Three imaging modalities are primarily used in the evaluation of venous sinus thrombosis. The first is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is the least sensitive and specific. This is most often used as dural sinus thromboses will often present as undifferentiated neurologic symptoms or elevated intracranial pressure, which prompts an MRI of the brain. Certain findings on MRI can suggest thrombosis depending on the age of the clot and the breakdown stage of hemoglobin being more useful in subacute clots, which have started to break down.

On non-contrast-enhanced head CT, one common sign is hyperdensity within the sinus. This is due to thrombus being denser than flowing blood. However, sensitivity for non-contrast CT scan is low around 33% in some studies.

On MRI imaging, several signs can be seen. An acute clot begins as isointense in T1-weighted imaging and will become more hyperintense as oxyhemoglobin converts into deoxyhemoglobin and subsequent breakdown products.Â On T2-weighted images, the clot will appear hypointense or dark. T2-weighted gradient echo (T2-GRE) sequences can be highly sensitive and specific for venous thrombosis.

**Laboratory**

Routine complete blood count, routine coagulation studies - prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), international normalized ratio (INR) should be performed on patients with suspected venous sinus thrombosis. If no predisposing condition is known, a thorough history should be done to screen for potential predisposing conditions. If none is found, consider workup for occult malignancy or inherited thrombophilia (factor V Leiden, etc.). D-dimer, if normal, indicates less likelihood of venous sinus thrombosis. However, it is possible to have VST in the setting of a normal D-dimer.
