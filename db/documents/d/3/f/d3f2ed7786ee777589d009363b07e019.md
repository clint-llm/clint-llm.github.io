Trichotillomania (TTM) also known as hair-pulling disorder, was first described in ancient Greece, but its current name was coined in the later part of the 18th century. In these cases the hair is pulled from anywhere on the body repeatedly, appearing as hair loss but is caused by the action of the patient. As this condition can greatly affect the appearance of the patient, it is associated with societal stigma. This activity describes the etiology, presentation, and management of trichotillomania and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of trichotillomania.
- Review the presentation of a patient with trichotillomania.
- Summarize the treatment options for trichotillomania.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by trichotillomania.
