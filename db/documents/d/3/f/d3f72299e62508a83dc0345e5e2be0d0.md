**Decreased Liver Function, Hepatomegaly, and Cirrhosis**

- Nevirapine is contraindicated in patients with Child-Pugh Class B or C liver impairment because of its potential hepatotoxic effects. If the liver is already damaged or has decreased function, administration of nevirapine could lead to liver failure.

**Pregnancy**

- In treatment-naive patients, nevirapine should be avoided during pregnancy, although there is no known risk of fetal harm based on human data and animal studies.

- For virologically suppressed, treatment-experienced patients, nevirapine therapy may continue during pregnancy if baseline CD4 counts are above 250.

- Pregnant patients should be enrolled in the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry.

**Drug-Drug Interactions**

- Nevirapine is contraindicated for concomitant administration with atazanavir.

- Many other agents that also affect or are metabolized by the hepatic CYP450 system will require caution or dose adjustments and, in some cases, changes in therapy.
