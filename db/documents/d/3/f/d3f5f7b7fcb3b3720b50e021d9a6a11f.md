Emulsions are a sub-class of colloids, which are two-phase systems of matter.

Although the terms colloid and emulsion are at times used indistinctly, emulsion applies only when both phases, dispersed and continuous, are liquids. A colloid is a mixture of a compound that is in solid, liquid, or gas state and a liquid. The critical difference between colloid and emulsion is that colloid can form when any state of matter (solid, gas, or liquid) combine with a liquid. In contrast, the emulsion has two liquid components that are initially immiscible with each other.

Emulsions, as liquids, do not demonstrate a static internal structure. Emulsions are thermodynamically unstable as both the dispersed and continuous phases can revert as separate phases, oil, and water; by fusion or the coalescing of droplets. Industries use emulsifying agents, e.g., surfactants to maintain a static structure.
