There are no absolute contraindications to central venous catheter placement as they are used in emergent situations in the most critical of patients. However, there are relative contraindications to fluoroscopic PICC placement. These contraindications include:

- Skin infections

- Trauma or burns to the upper extremities

- Active bacteremia

- Patient agitation

- Procedure refusal by the patient

Additionally, fluoroscopic procedures are contraindicated in pregnant patients unless the procedure is medically necessary for patient well-being. PICC placement can be performed using ultrasound without the use of fluoroscopy in these patients.
