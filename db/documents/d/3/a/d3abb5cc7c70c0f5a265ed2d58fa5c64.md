Clinicians must keep gastrointestinal tuberculosis on the list of differential diagnoses when evaluating patients with new-onset Crohn disease or those with vague gastrointestinal symptoms and nonspecific test results. This is particularly important in those who have migrated from an endemic region and/or have other risk factors. Although it is more commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, it can also affect immunocompetent individuals.

Early consultation with experts in infectious diseases and gastroenterology, combined with an interprofessional approach and maintaining a high index of suspicion, is important in successful management.
