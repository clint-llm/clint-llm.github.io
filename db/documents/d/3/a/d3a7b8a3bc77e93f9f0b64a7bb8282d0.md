Patients with subfalcine herniation frequently require neurosurgical consultation and monitoring by critical care clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs) in a medical or neurological intensive care unit. The interprofessional team should be prepared to intervene timely to prevent progressive herniation and neurological deterioration in the patient. Because initial symptoms of subfalcine herniation may be subtle before sudden clinical deterioration, the interprofessional healthcare team must maintain open and clear lines of communication. Nursing staff should thoroughly examine the patient for any clinical deterioration and immediately contact the physician responsible for the patient’s care. A thorough evaluation by the clinician must follow, and pertinent imaging studies should be ordered immediately. If subfalcine herniation is detected, the team should immediately start the treatment algorithm to stabilize the airway, maintain adequate cerebral perfusion, and halt or reverse the herniation syndrome.
