For localized lesions, the treatment of choice is wide surgical resection with negative margins.

Radiotherapy may improve outcomes in patients who undergoÂ close resection margins.

After surgical excision, patients should be followed closely due to the high rates of recurrence. Patients with higher risk may benefit from close interval imaging, while lower-risk patients may be followed with yearly imaging.
