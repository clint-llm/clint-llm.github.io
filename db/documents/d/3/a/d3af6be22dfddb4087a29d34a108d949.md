The primary function of the biliary tract is to transport and release the bile. The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile. Bile assists with the absorption and digestion of fats and fat-soluble vitamins in addition to the removal of lipid-soluble waste products. The main components of bile are cholesterol, bile salts, and bilirubin. Bilirubin, responsible for the signature yellow-green color of bile, is also excreted in bile and is responsible for the pigmentation of feces.
