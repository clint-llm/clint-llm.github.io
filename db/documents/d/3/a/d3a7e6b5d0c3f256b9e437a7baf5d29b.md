The tibialis posterior muscle (TPM) is the deepest muscle of the deep posterior compartment of the lower leg. Its long muscle belly arises from the posterior aspect of the interosseous membrane and superior two-thirds of the posterior and medial surface of the fibula, and the superior aspect of the proximal tibia. The TPM tendon inserts distally onto many attachment points on the plantar surface of the foot. The muscle is primarily responsible for plantar flexion and inversion of the foot and receives its arterial blood supply and innervation from the posterior tibial artery and tibial nerve, respectively.
