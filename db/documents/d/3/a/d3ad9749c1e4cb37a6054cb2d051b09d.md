Microscopic examination is of great importance, especially for the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma in situ. It considers the features of the specimen obtained via biopsy regarding invasion, differentiation, and depth. Note that biopsy specimens usually include samples of the normal tissue which would be used in spotting the differences; also, there is the need for a full thickness biopsy to determine the depth of lesion and invasion levels correctly. Histopathologically, hyperkeratosis, and parakeratosis is noted in the epidermis. Prominent acanthosis along with elongation and thickening of the rete ridges is usually observed. These changeÂ over highly atypical keratinocyte cells. The atypical cells span the full thickness of the epidermis and demonstrate mitotic activity, pleomorphism, and enlarged nuclei. In some cases, hair follicle involvement is observed. The upper epidermis cells might undergo vacuolization and show an abundant and strongly eosinophilic cytoplasm.
