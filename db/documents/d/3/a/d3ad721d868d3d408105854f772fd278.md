Morphea encompasses a wide variety of phenotypes that range from benign isolated lesions to deep forms of morphea, which can have a poor prognosis. Unfortunately, this makes diagnosis challenging, and there is no consensus in classification, which can result in delayed diagnosis and initiation of treatment.

A coordinated effort of health care providers that includes primary clinicians, dermatologists, and rheumatologists is necessary for early diagnosis and treatment. It is essential to do appropriate testing to differentiate morphea from systemic sclerosis, which has a poor prognosis due to systemic organ involvement. It is also important to get an appropriate histopathologic diagnosis to understand the diagnosis and rule out other fibrotic skin disorders.

Methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil can cause significant side effects in pregnant patients, so appropriate pharmacy education on contraception, medication interactions, and toxicity monitoring help improve patient compliance with these medications and prevent side effects.
