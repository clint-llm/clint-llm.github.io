Management is often based on presenting symptoms. Acute management of patients with an ICH is similar to other spontaneous ICH. Attention to blood pressure and intracranial pressure is essential. When surgical intervention is performed, the mortality risk is largely unchanged when compared to other types of ICH. The factors that are associated with a worse prognosis are intraventricular hemorrhage and age greater than equal to 75.

ICH associated with CAA is frequently recurrent. Because of this high rate, clinicians typically avoid antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants when a strong indication for anticoagulation is not present. Notably, there have been studies demonstrating benefits in restarting anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Blood pressure control has also been associated with mortality benefits, even though CAA does not seem to be largely driven by hypertension.

Lastly, limited evidence has shown benefits in utilizing immunosuppression for the treatment of the inflammatory forms of CAA. Small trials have shown pulsed cyclophosphamide or glucocorticoids resulted in sustained clinical improvement. Other immunosuppressive medications have also been associated with benefits, including mofetil, mycophenolate, and methotrexate.
