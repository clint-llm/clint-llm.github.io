The use of ultrasound in the setting of pregnancy is vast and has become the standard of care in the evaluation of pregnant women. The average number of ultrasounds performed during pregnancy has increased from 1.5 in 1995 to 1997 to 2.7 in 2005 to 2006, with even higher numbers of ultrasound studies obtained for high-risk pregnancies.
