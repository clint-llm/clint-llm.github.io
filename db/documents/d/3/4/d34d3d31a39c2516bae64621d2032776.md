Management varies depending on the clinical presentation, laboratory results, and radiological findings of the biloma. The three main options are percutaneous or endoscopic drainage, surgical drainage, or close monitoring. Ongoing bile leak, size, and position of the biloma, alongside superimposed infection and patient fitness, will determine which management strategy is most appropriate.

Most bilomas can be managed successfully with radiologically guided percutaneous drainage. Fixation of the underlying disruption of the biliary tree is often unnecessary.

Ongoing bile leaks may require further management, with either surgical fixation or endoscopic stent placement. However, Lee et al. recommend drainage of the biloma post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the first case, especially in the acutely unwell or symptomatic patient.

Surgical management of biloma is sometimes indicated in failed percutaneous drainage, some multiloculated lesions, and in cases with ongoing bile leaks.Â Cases of bile leak identified intraoperatively during laparoscopic cholecystectomy or requiring surgical management for ongoing bile leak are best managed in specialist tertiary centers.

The rarity of biloma formation means there is little reliable evidence beyond case reports and case series describing management strategies. However, percutaneous drainage has successfully managed biloma, and biloma patients have a very good prognosis.
