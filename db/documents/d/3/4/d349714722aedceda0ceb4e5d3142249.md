Patients taking triamterene or the combination form of triamterene/HCTZ should have close follow up with primary care physicians caring for them. Clinicians and other interprofessional healthcare team members should educate patients on possible side effects or adverse effects that the patient could experience while beginning treatment or having a dose change, having the patient be on the lookout for potential issues with the use of the drug. In the in-patient setting, hospitalists should be prudent to contact the patient's primary care physicians or pharmacies to obtain a history of the patient's adherence and tolerance to the medication. Collaborative decision-making between physicians, patients, pharmacists, and nurses, operating as an interprofessional team, is vital for creating the most effective outcomes and decreasing the likelihood of nonadherence.
