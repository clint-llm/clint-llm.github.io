Caroli disease can affect both the kidneys and liver; therefore, clinical manifestations of the disease appear as renal and hepatic complications. Since kidneys are the organ most affected, the first presentation is in the form of polycystic kidneys noted in neonates (ARPKD). The hepatic abnormalities occur later in life as there is relatively less expression of the affected fibrocystin gene in the cholangiocytes as compared to the renal tubular cells.

In Caroli disease, there is biliary stasis and sludge formation leading to obstruction of bile flow. Hence, patients typically present with episodes of recurrent bacterial cholangitis: abdominal pain, fevers, chills, and jaundice much like signs of ascending cholangitis. Pruritis is also commonly reported, it is caused by hyperbilirubinemia from intrahepatic cholestasis. Rarely the disease presents at an older age, after the development of hepatic fibrosis, and patients present with symptoms and signs of portal hypertension such as ascites and variceal bleeding. Patients with Caroli disease are at an increased risk for the development of cholangiocarcinoma.

The physical exam may show right upper quadrant tenderness with a negative Murphy's sign. Hepatomegaly due to gross enlargement due to cystic disease is also seen commonly along with scleral icterus. After the development of hepatic fibrosis, shifting dullness and fluid thrill indicative of ascites can be appreciated. Other signs of liver cirrhosis like spider naevi are also seen.
