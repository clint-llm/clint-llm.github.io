Misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of HIV-1-associated radiculopathy are common. Consequently, HIV-associated progressive polyradiculopathy has 100% mortality without prompt diagnosis and treatment. Even with the advent of HAART, reducing the morbidity and mortality in neurological complications of HIV infection, the prognosis of progressive polyradiculopathies is poor in HIV patients due to severe immunosuppression.Â CMV-associated polyradiculopathy is rapidly fatal without treatment, but the mortality for this particular form is as high as 22% even with treatment.

CMV blood detection is considered a poor prognostic marker for CMV morbidity and survival.
