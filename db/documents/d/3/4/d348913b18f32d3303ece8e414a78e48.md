The goal of surgery for pathologic fractures is early mobilization and function. Patients undergoing surgical fixation for pathologic fractures will ideally undergo physical therapy immediately following surgery and will mobilize quickly using a targeted protocol with the goal of being weight-bearing as tolerated in most cases. Patients who have had lower-extremity surgery should be placed on anticoagulation postoperatively. Anticoagulation may be warranted for upper extremity cases as well due to the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in the setting of malignancy.

Long-term bisphosphonates or denosumab should be seriously considered to minimize the risk of skeletal-related events (SREs) and prevent hypercalcemia of malignancy. Skeletal-related events are defined as the presence of one of the following criteria: 1) radiation or surgery to bone, 2) pathologic fracture, 3) spinal cord compression, or 4) hypercalcemia of malignancy.

A retrospective review of 718 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma from 1981-1991 revealed the presence of SREs in over 50% of patients.
