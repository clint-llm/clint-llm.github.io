With water toxicity, in clinical practice hyponatremia impacts the choice of treatment the most. For the evaluation of hydration status, various methodologies exist:

- Markers of hydration (osmolarity)

- Water balance estimates

These principles encompass the following strategies:

Serum sodium

This is the most important parameter in the evaluation of the severity and choice of treatment.

Plasma and urine osmolarity

It is not routinely considered as part of diagnostic evaluation but can be supportive for diagnosis.

Water intake and output

Estimation of water balance by the assessment of both water intake (input) and water losses (output) during a period.  Water output includes losses in urine and stool.

Body weight changes are a sensitive, accurate and readily measured indicator of water balance when measured under standard conditions and if past data is available for comparison.
