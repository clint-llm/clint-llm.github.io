In the bone marrow, stem cells transform into very large cells known as megakaryocytes. Megakaryocyte forms cell fragments known as platelets and each megakaryocyte can produce anywhere between 5,000 to 10,000 platelets. The pathophysiology of secondary thrombocytosis may differ, depending on the cause of thrombocytosis. Thrombocytosis is driven byÂ overproduction of thrombopoietin, interleukin-6, other cytokines, or catecholamines in inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic conditions or in situations of stress.
