The history of the term "empathy" (translated from the German word Einfuhlung, that means feeling into) started over 100 years ago, introduced by the psychologist Edward Titchener.

**Definition**

Empathy is a complex psychological influencing social interaction; it plays a role in the understanding of other's feelings, suffering, and behavior with a significant link to compassion. It is a motivated phenomenon that allows people to connect emotionally, mainly by sharing experiences and feelings.

Empathy has been shown to be linked to neuroanatomical structures such as the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and anterior insula. Furthermore, a multidimensional approach to empathy classifies it as either being cognitive, affective, or behavioral empathy.

**Measuring Empathy**

In order to measure empathy, several scales have been designed that help to identify the capacity of an individual to be more empathic or less empathic. As empathy involves a wide range of psychological concepts, many scales are currently being used to identify empathy. Some of these include the Empathic Accuracy Task (EAT), Empathy Components Questionnaire, and the very old Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI).
