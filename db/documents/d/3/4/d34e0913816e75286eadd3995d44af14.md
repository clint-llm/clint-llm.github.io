Technetium-99m (99mTc) is a radionuclide isotope that is used primarily for imaging and diagnostic purposes.

**FDA Approved Technetium-99m Use**

- Technetium-99m sodium pertechnetate - Used for diagnostic imaging of the thyroid, salivary gland, urinary bladder, vesicoureteral reflux, and nasolacrimal drainage imaging. Its use in the gastrointestinal tract is primarily for the diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum(Meckel scintigraphy scan).

- Technetium-99m sulfur colloid - Imaging of liver, spleen, and bone marrow - used for upper-gastrointestinal imaging assessing for reflux or gastric aspiration. It can also be useful to localize lymph nodes draining a malignant melanoma or breast cancer.

- Technetium-99m tetrofosmin - Cardiac perfusion imagining, assessing the function of the left ventricle, and determining coronary artery disease isolating ischemia and infarction

- Technetium-99m sestamibi - Cardiac perfusion imaging, assessing function, and localizing ischemia and infarction - also used for breast imaging.

- Technetium-99m tilmanocept - Used to localize lymph nodes drainage of primary tumors.

- Technetium-99m bicisate - Cerebral perfusion imagining used to localize the area of stroke.

- Technetium-99m exametazine - Used for imaging abdominal infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and brain perfusion.

- Technetium-99m pentetate - Imaging bone, kidney, and assessing pulmonary embolism

- Technetium-99m pyrophosphate -Imaging bone, gastrointestinal bleeding, and myocardial infarction

- Technetium-99m red blood cells - Localizing gastrointestinal bleeding.

- Technetium-99m succimer - Used for renal imaging.

- Technetium-99m methylene biphosphonate - Used for imaging bone.

- Technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin - Used to assess pulmonary perfusion.

- Technetium-99m mebrofenin - Used for hepatobiliary imaging.

- Technetium-99m medronate - Used for imaging bone.

- Technetium-99m mertiatide - Used for renal imaging.

- Technetium-99m oxidronate - Used for imaging bone
