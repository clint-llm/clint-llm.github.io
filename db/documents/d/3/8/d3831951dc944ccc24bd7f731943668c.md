The detailed pathogenesis remains unclear, but there is enough evidence to believe that host immunity plays an important role. Most individuals who contract T. whippelii are asymptomatic carriers or develop a limited infection with subsequent development of protective humoral and cellular immunity. In diseased individuals, the inflammatory response to the organism is muted. It consists primarily of altered macrophage function and activation and an impaired type 1 T-cell response. Whipple bacillus shares antigenic similarity with Streptococcal groups B and G and with Shigella flexneri. Host factors play an important pathogenic role as suggested by the two to threefold increase in the frequency of HLA-B27 antigen among affected individuals.

The organism is ingested by macrophages which can be observed PAS. Unfortunately, PAS-stained macrophages are not pathognomonic for Whipple disease. Electron microscopy may reveal coccobacillus bodies that reflect the organism.

The malabsorption seen is due to disruption of the normal villus function. If systemic disease develops, the organism can be found in many tissues.
