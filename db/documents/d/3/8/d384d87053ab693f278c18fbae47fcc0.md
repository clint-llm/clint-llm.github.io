Only patients who have already failed all therapeutic options available for refractory angina will be evaluated for transmyocardial laser extravascular angiogenesis (TMLR). It is important to carefully consider risks and benefits for each case as TMLR is not recommended for refractory angina. Evaluation for this procedure will likely involve basic cardiac evaluation. Patients should have basic labs such as complete blood count and complete metabolic panel check. An ECG should be performed. Depending on the comorbidities of the patient other tests such as echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, or coronary angiography may be performed to accurately assess the risk and benefits of this procedure for the patient peri-operatively.
