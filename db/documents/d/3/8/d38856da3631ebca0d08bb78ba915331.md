The majority of patients with MPO deficiency are asymptomatic with no increase in infections. However recurrent severe infections with Candida Albicans have been observed only in patients who also suffered from other conditions such as diabetes mellitus. Thus, in these patients, it is not clear if the infections were a mere outcome of MPO deficiency or if other MPO independent mechanisms were also responsible. In a study conducted by European researchers, only 50% of the complete MPO deficient patients had infectious complications, the rest were asymptomatic, and only 10% of the patients suffered from life-threatening infectious complications.Â  The lack of serious infections in MPO deficiency compared to CGD emphasizes the importance of the reactive oxygen species such as amplified hydrogen peroxide generation serving as a potent bactericidal agent that protects patients with MPO deficiency. However, the absence of MPO-mediated species such as HOCl appears to be crucial in the failure to abort fungal infections such as Candidiasis.
