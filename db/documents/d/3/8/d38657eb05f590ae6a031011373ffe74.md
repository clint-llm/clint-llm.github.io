There is limited epidemiological data regarding the effects of glycol ethers (GE). Most information is from case reports, animal studies, and a few epidemiological studies. Given glycol ethers (GE) have a ubiquitous industrial role, occupational exposures are the majority of presentations. Animal models first displayed the toxic reproductive effects in the 1970s, which prompted investigations in the United States a decade later. France partially regulated the compound in 1992, but the first complete ban on using GEs in drugs and cosmetics occurred in 1999.

Men and women working in semiconductor factories had increased reproductive defects. For example, an American retrospective cohort study from 1996 reported an increased relative risk of spontaneous abortions among female workers in semiconductor manufacturing facilities.

Diethylene glycol (DEG) is of critical historical significance as it was the responsible compound that resulted in the 1937 elixir sulfanilamide incident. The Elixer was prepared with sulfanilamide, an early sulfa-based antimicrobial, and DEG. Unfortunately, due to the lack of premarket testing regulations, the incident resulted in over 100 deaths.

A similar tragedy occurred in Haiti between 1995 and 1996, when DEG was identified in acetaminophen preparations, resulting in acute renal failure in 86 children.

Recently, a French study in 2020 demonstrated a widespread detection of glycol ether metabolites in 6-year-old children undergoing neurodevelopmental evaluation.
