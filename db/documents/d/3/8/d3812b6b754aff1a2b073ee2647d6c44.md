Saxitoxin is most commonly absorbed by oral ingestion when eating shellfish containing the toxin. However, it can also exert its toxic effect when injected or inhaled. Symptoms of PSP are dose-dependent and can appear in as few as ten minutes after ingestion. The LD50 of saxitoxin, when ingested by humans, is 5.7 micrograms per kilogram. When delivered by injection, the LD50 of saxitoxin is 0.6 micrograms per kilogram. Symptoms of ASP begin from 15 minutes to 38 hours after ingestion, and the mortality rate is two percent. The exact LD50 of domoic acid in humans is not known, but humans have been shown to develop symptoms at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Symptoms of DSP begin from 30 minutes to 12 hours after consumption of toxic shellfish, and as little as forty micrograms of okadaic acid can cause gastrointestinal symptoms in humans. However, no fatalities have been reported. Ingestion and inhalation can absorb brevetoxins; dermal uptake may also occur but has not been well studied. Symptoms begin 15 minutes to 18 hours after exposure. Neurotoxic shellfish poisoning is not fatal, however many hospitalizations have been reported.
