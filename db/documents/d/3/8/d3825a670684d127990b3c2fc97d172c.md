Sever disease is ultimately a self-limiting condition that resolves with maturation and closure of the apophysis.

**Nonoperative Modalities**

There is no role for operative treatment in the management of Sever disease.

In general, non-operative options include:

- Rest/periods of inactivity (guided by pain)

- This may also include holding out of sport/practice until symptoms subside

- Orthotic use/casting

- Patient-specific treatment protocols should be dictated as necessary by the treating clinician.  Immobilization including periods of casting or use of a CAM boot may be necessary depending on symptom severity
- Heel cups or heel pads

- Achilles tendon stretches

- Ice application

- Before and after sporting activity

- NSAIDs

Footwear should be well-maintained and up-to-date. A rehabilitation regimen is essential and should include heel cord stretching in addition to dorsiflexor strengthening. If the pain does not respond to conservative measures, a walking boot or short leg cast may be used for short-term immobilization. Symptoms are usually self-limited with improvement within 6 to 12 months and a complete resolution with apophyseal closure. There is no role for injection therapy or surgical intervention in the treatment of Sever disease. There are no long-term complications, and the prognosis is excellent.
