Adverse effects of metoclopramide use include extrapyramidal symptoms.

- Acute dystonic reactions

- Torticollis
- Trismus
- Opisthotonus
- Akathisia
- Dystonia
- Oculogyric crisis
- Laryngospasm
- Hyperprolactinemia
- Tardive dyskinesia
- Parkinson symptoms
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare adverse effect.

- Hyperthermia

- Lead pipe rigidity

- Leukocytosis

- Elevated creatine phosphokinase levels

- Altered consciousness

- Symptoms of autonomic instability (potentially)

- Diaphoresis
- Tachycardia
- Incontinence
- Pallor
- Irregular blood pressure or pulse
- Cardiac arrhythmias

Thus, any patient on metoclopramide who develops neuroleptic malignant syndrome should have metoclopramide immediately discontinued and undergo treatment with dantrolene. These adverse effects stem from metoclopramide’s anti-dopaminergic mechanism of action. It is important to note that these adverse effects are dose-independent and generally reversible following discontinuation of the drug.

- Seizures

- Cranial nerve palsies

- Paroxysmal tonic upward gaze

- Encephalopathy

Metoclopramide-induced hyperprolactinemia can cause the following:

- Gynecomastia

- Galactorrhea

- Amenorrhea

- Impotence

- Hypogonadism

In patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency, metoclopramide can cause methemoglobinemia and sulfhemoglobinemia.

Less acute adverse effects of metoclopramide, generally reversible and observed in children, include the following:

- Sedation

- Diarrhea

Rarer psychiatric side effects that have developed following brief exposure to metoclopramide include:

- Panic disorder

- Major depressive disorder

- Agoraphobia

**Drug-Drug Interactions**

Reduced efficacy of dopamine agonists(like bromocriptine and cabergoline)

Concurrent administration of metoclopramide and antipsychotic drugs should be avoided due to the potential for additive effects and neuroleptic malignant syndrome(NMS).
