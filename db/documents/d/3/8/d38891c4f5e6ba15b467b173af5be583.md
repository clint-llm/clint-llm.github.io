Pancoast tumor constitutes a group of malignancies (as it is classified based on location), which means there is no specific laboratory diagnosis to diagnose Pancoast tumor.

Initial plain radiological test with a chest x-ray is generally used to screen a patient with suspected or as an incidental finding showing soft tissue opacity at the apex of the lung (unilateral) or just an asymmetry in the apices greater than 5 mm can be noted. Local rib extension can sometimes be appreciated. Lordotic chest views may be helpful. In the early stages, it is difficult to appreciate these findings in the PA view of chest x-ray because of difficulty in interpreting the overlying shadows at apices (clavicle, scapula, acromion, and 1st rib).

CT scan provides more information on the extent of the primary tumor, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and satellite tumors, which are essential in staging the tumor.

MRI is far more sensitive and specific for local staging due to its superior delineation of the extent of involvement in lung tissue, surrounding blood vessels, spinal cord involvement, brachial plexus invasion.

Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is useful in assessing nodal and distal metastasis, and accurate delineation of gross tumor volume at baseline staging; this is helpful for radiation treatment planning.

Chest CT and PET-CT scans are considered mandatory before and after preoperative therapy, but recommendations vary whether mediastinoscopy or endobronchial/esophageal ultrasound is necessary.
