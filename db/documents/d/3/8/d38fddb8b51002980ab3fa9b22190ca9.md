Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a nuclear imaging modality used frequently in diagnostic medicine. It allows the clinician to assess the perfusion and functionality of specific tissues. This activity reviews the basics of single-photon emission computed tomography imaging, including the underlying mechanism of imaging, indications, and contraindications, the technique utilized and personnel required, complications, and the clinical significance of this imaging modality in medicine.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of SPECT imaging.
- Describe the equipment and personnel required for SPECT imaging.
- Outline the potential complications and their clinical significance of SPECT imaging.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving test performance and outcomes in SPECT imaging.
