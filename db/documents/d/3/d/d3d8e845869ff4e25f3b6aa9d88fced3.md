Lasers for tattoo removal were first used in the late 1960s, but they did not emerge as a primary treatment until the 1980s when the concept of selective photothermolysis allowed more specific targeting of tattoo pigment. Greater knowledge and utilization of optimal pulse duration and cooling times have led to further advancements of this technology. This activity reviews the principles of laser removal of tattoos and describes which lasers are useful for specific chromophores. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of individuals undergoing laser removal of tattoos.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the principles of laser destruction of tattoo chromophores.

- Explain which lasers are used to for different tattoo chromophores.
- Review when laser therapy of exogenous skin pigmentation should be avoided.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for individuals undergoing laser tattoo removal.
