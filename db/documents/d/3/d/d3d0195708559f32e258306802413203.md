Most of our current knowledge of tumor suppressor genes originates from the initial studies of the retinoblastoma (RB) gene; this was the first tumor suppressor gene discovered, and mutations in RB cause childhood retinoblastoma. This disease is an inherited condition caused by an inactivating mutation in the RB1 gene that causes a 10,000-fold increased risk of developing retinoblastoma (often in both eyes) as compared to the general population. These patients are also at increased risk of developing osteosarcoma and other sarcomas. Interestingly, about 60% of retinoblastomas occur sporadically (almost always in one eye), and these patients are not at increased risk for other forms of cancer.

- In the inherited form of retinoblastoma, children inherit one mutated RB allele (germ-line mutation), and the other copy is normal. Retinoblastoma develops when the normal retinoblastoma (RB) allele undergoes a spontaneous somatic mutation; this is the “second hit.”

- In sporadic cases of retinoblastoma, both normal RB alleles must undergo a somatic mutation in the same cell. The probability of this is low, which explains why retinoblastoma is uncommon in the general population. In both cases, the resulting two hits lead to the development of retinoblastoma.

Based on these original observations, there are three important properties of classic tumor suppressor genes (TSGs):

- Classic tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are recessive at the cellular level, with inactivation of both alleles typically found in tumors.

- Inheritance of a solitary mutant allele increases tumor susceptibility because only a single additional inactivating event is necessary for complete loss of gene function.

- The same gene is often inactivated in sporadic cancers.
