The majority of life-threatening complications occur shortly after the initial infarct or during the hospitalization period. Hypotension can occur due to the involvement of the lateral horns containing sympathetic neuronal cell bodies. Respiratory failure is a possibility in high cervical infarctions due to involvement at the level of the phrenic nerve, which innervates the diaphragm.

High cervical infarctions can also cause bradycardia requiring treatment with atropine or electrical pacing. Since patients typically have a significant motor impairment, prolonged immobilization can easily lead to deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

Other complications during the hospitalization period include neurogenic bowel and bladder, pressure sores, and gastrointestinal stress ulcers. Survivors must handle a myriad of long-term complications, including functional motor and sensory dysfunction, chronic pain, spasticity, and bowel/bladder/sexual dysfunction.
