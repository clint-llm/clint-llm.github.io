There is a lack of standard definition for surgical success in patients with intermittent exotropia. The different treatment approaches, differences in intervention time, and paucity of long-term follow-ups further add to the ambiguity. Most of the studies considered a residual misalignment of ≤ 10 prism diopters as surgical success. Various studies with different duration of follow-ups have shown variable success rates. The success rates in previous literature vary from 50% to 80%, with a follow-up varying from 6 months to 5 years, with a longer duration of follow-ups showing lesser success rates. Recent studies have also reported variable success rates in all types of intermittent exotropia, around 40 to 70%.

Kushner compared the surgical results for different degrees of intermittent exotropia, surgical procedure, amount of surgical dosage and drew the following conclusions:

- Patients with high AC/A are at high risk of developing consecutive esotropia at near.

- Patients with tenacious proximal fusion have a better chance of surgical success.

- The surgery in patients with intermittent exotropia should be planned based on the maximum deviation documented consistently for the patient.
