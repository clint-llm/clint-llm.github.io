Non-surgical treatment aims to treat underlying refractive errors, treatment of amblyopia, and orthoptic exercises. Surgical treatment aims to maintain binocularity, prevent amblyopia with early alignment, and promote peripheral fusion.

**Non-Surgical Treatment**

- Refractive error correction – It is advisable to give full hypermetropic refractive correction, i.e., without drug correction applied, as examined after cycloplegic refraction for the patient. Any hypermetropia more than +1.5D should be prescribed to the patient. Ocular deviation and AC/A ratio can be reassessed after six weeks of spectacle usage. Children with a high AC/A ratio or eyes aligned for distance and a residual esotropia for near should be considered for bifocals.

- Further, it has been suggested that the higher the delay between onset of esotropia and start of refractive correction, the higher the chances of the child ending with partially accommodative esotropia.

- Miotics have been tried as an alternative to glasses in uncooperative patients or those not compliant with glass usage.

- Amblyopia therapy is indicated when a patient is brought late with pre-set amblyopia and fixation preference for the other eye. Most often, alternate eye patching might be advised to prevent fixation preference and thus prevent amblyopia in these cases.

- Orthoptic treatment is useful in patients with refractive or non-refractive accommodative esotropias. These exercises aim at overcoming the suppression and improving the negative fusional convergence.

- Botulinum Toxin – This has been studied and proven helpful in infantile esotropia and new-onset acquired esotropia.

**Surgical Treatment**

The timing of surgery and surgical procedures may vary with the type of esotropia, amount of deviation, presence of associated clinical features, amblyopia, and compliance with non-conservative management.

We will cover the most common procedure of choice and considerations for timing for surgery for each type of esotropia separately.

**Infantile/Congenital Esotropia**

The ideal time for surgical intervention in these patients is between 6 months to 2 years of age. The final decision should be taken based on the child's co-operation to measure squint and understanding of the parents and the examiner. Choice of surgery also varies depending upon the surgeons' preference. Bimedial recessions are usually preferred over unilateral recession/resect procedures. If significant inferior oblique overactions are associated, combining bimedial recession/ unilateral recession-resection with bilateral inferior oblique muscles weakening is preferable. The surgery for dissociated vertical deviation should be deferred as a primary procedure and can be combined later as a staged procedure if needed.

**Refractive Accommodative Esotropia**

Surgery for refractive accommodative esotropia should always be avoided. Any associated vertical deviation or A/V pattern might need surgical correction.

**Non-Refractive Accommodative Esotropia**

In this conservative management in the form of bifocals, orthoptic exercises should be preferred. Surgery might be indicated in patients with a large angle of residual deviation, which conservative methods cannot correct. Bilateral medial rectus recession with or without bilateral Faden procedure to medial rectus can be planned based on the angle of deviation for near.

**Partially Accommodative Esotropia**

These cases require a surgical correction for the residual deviation following spectacle correction. Few studies showed improvement with occlusion therapy in these cases.

**Sensory Esotropia**

Surgical intervention might be indicated for cosmetic correction in these cases. In children, any associated aphakia or traumatic cataracts should be corrected, along with a trial of occlusion therapy. Eventually, these can be planned for squint correction once the maximum best-corrected visual acuity is achieved. Surgical squint correction using unilateral recession-resection procedure should be preferred in the amblyopic eye or the eye with poor visual acuity.

**Cyclic Esotropia**

Botulinum toxin or surgical correction by bimedial rectus recession or recession resection procedure for medial and lateral rectus respectively might be needed. The dose of surgical correction should be based on the deviation on the day of esotropia.
