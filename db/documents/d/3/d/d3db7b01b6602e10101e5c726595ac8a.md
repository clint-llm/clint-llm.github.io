The most feared adverse effect of milrinone is its potential to induce hemodynamic changes and arrhythmias. Milrinone may cause ventricular tachyarrhythmia, leading to cardiac ischemia or sudden cardiac death. These changes are not shown to follow a dose-dependent relationship. Milrinone can cause an increase in venous vessel capacitance, leading to decreased preload and manifesting as headaches, syncope, and severe hypotension. Unlike tachyarrhythmias, hypotension occurs in a dose-dependent relationship.

Anagrelide may enhance the toxic effect of milrinone. Both milrinone and anagrelide inhibit the phosphodiesterase III enzymes. Therefore anagrelide prescribing information states that clinicians should avoid concomitant use of milrinone with anagrelide.

Besides its hemodynamic and arrhythmogenic effects, milrinone may also affect platelet function and inflammatory pathways. It may block platelet aggregation, suppress neointimal hyperplasia associated with endothelial injury, and attenuate the proinflammatory effects of cardiopulmonary bypass.
