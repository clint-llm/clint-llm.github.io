Porokeratosis is an uncommon diagnosis that presents with keratotic papules or annular plaques with an elevated border. It usually occurs on sun-exposed skin, most commonly in the fifth decade of life, but can occur at any age and with similar frequencies in males and females. The increased occurrence of disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis on sun-exposed skin likely indicates that ultraviolet light is a risk factor. While porokeratosis is usually an acquired disease, there is often a familial predisposition that could signify a hereditary component. This activity illustrates the evaluation, treatment, and complications of porokeratosis and the importance of a team approach to managing and surveillance of affected patients.
