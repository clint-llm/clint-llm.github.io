**Support**

The CSF supports the weight of the brain estimated at 1500 gm and suspends it in neutral buoyancy to a net weight of about 25 gm. Hence, the entire brain density is cushioned, protecting it from crushing into the bony cranium.

**Shock absorber**

It protects the brain from damage during head trauma. Otherwise, even minor head-bopping will result in severe brain injury.

**Homeostasis**

The biochemical constituents and volume of the CSF play vital cerebral homeostatic roles:

- Maintains stable intrinsic CNS temperature

- Biochemical constituents and electrolytes maintain the osmotic pressure responsible for normal CSF pressure which isÂ essential to maintaining normal cerebral perfusion

- Biochemical waste products diffuse into the CSF and are removed as CSF is resorbed through arachnoid granulations into the venous circulation, a small percentage of CSF also drains into lymphatic circulation.

**Nutrition**

The CSF contains glucose, proteins, lipids, and electrolytes, providing essential CNS nutrition.

**Immune function**

The CSF contains immunoglobulins and mononuclear cells.
