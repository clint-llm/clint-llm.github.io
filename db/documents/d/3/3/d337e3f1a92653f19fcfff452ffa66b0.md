Pathogenesis of HHT is primarily due to the gene mutations (endoglin, ACVRL1, and SMAD4) that affect the endothelial cell receptors of the TGF-B superfamily. A mutation in these receptors prevents downstream signaling and disrupts angiogenesis, promoting disorganized cytoskeleton and dysfunctional remodeling of the vascular endothelium. As a result, these vesselsÂ exhibit a loss of elasticity and remain chronically dilated.

The loss of vascular integrity, combined with constant pressure, results in the formation of telangiectasias (dilated microvessels) and large AVMs.

Up to 10% of HHT patients have cerebral AVMs, 15 to 45% develop pulmonary AVMs, and 75% have hepatic AVMs. Rupture of these AVMs can result in severe complications, including internal hemorrhage, embolic or hemorrhagic stroke, seizures, migraines, or brain abscesses.

There are phenotypic variations between HHT1 and HHT2. HHT1 patients develop epistaxis earlier in life and have pulmonary AVMs, while HHT2 patients are more likely to develop hepatic AVMs.
