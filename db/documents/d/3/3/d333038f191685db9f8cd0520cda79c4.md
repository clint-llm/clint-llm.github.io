Vaginal atrophy is now included under the new term genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), which also includes vulvovaginal atrophy, urogenital atrophy, or atrophic vaginitis. We will focus on vaginal atrophy. ItÂ is most commonly due to decreased estrogen levels in postmenopausal women or women of any age who experience a decrease in estrogenic stimulation of the urogenital tissues. Vaginal atrophy signs and symptoms present similar to many other genitourinary conditions, thus delaying diagnosis and management.
