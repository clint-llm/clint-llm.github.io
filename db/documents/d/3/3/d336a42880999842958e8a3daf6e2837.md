The evaluation includes a thorough history and physical exam, depending on the underlying etiology of the enthesopathy. For enthesopathies secondary to repetitive use with a low likelihood of underlying inflammatory disease, the evaluation is primarily through physical examination, with imaging as needed. X-rays can be used to evaluate for bony pathology and calcifications. Diagnostic ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging can be used to visualize soft tissue, including the enthesis itself.

Evaluation of enthesopathies secondary to a diffuse inflammatory response leading to enthesitis may include a complete blood count, HLA-B27 assessing for seronegative SpA, rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibody, and other autoimmune factors that may reveal the underlying cause. Additionally, imaging studies may be ordered similar to those when evaluating enthesopathies from repetitive use.
