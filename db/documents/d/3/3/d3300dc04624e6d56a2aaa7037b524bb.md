Physical examination may be normal or patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of chronic illnesses.

Some common clinical manifestations are listed below:

**1. Infections**

- Recurrent infections of the sino-pulmonary tract with encapsulated pyogenic bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae type B, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas species, and some atypical species).

- Tympanic membrane scarring from recurrent otitis can be noted on the physical exam.

- In XLA by 2 years of age, more than 50% of patients have had serious infections with encapsulated bacteria, and virals including coxsackievirus, enterovirus, and echovirus infections are also common.

- In CVID, sinopulmonary infections and complications like bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening being common in all age groups. History of at least one episode of bacterial pneumonia is present in almost 75% of the patients prior to diagnosis.

- Urogenital infections by mycoplasma, gastrointestinal infections by Giardia lamblia (common in IgA deficiency), and Campylobacter jejuni have also been reported in CVID and XLA patients. CNS involvement with intracranial granulomas manifesting as seizures, ataxia, weakness, headaches, vision loss, and coma has been seen in children with CVID.

- Opportunistic infections are common in Hyper-IgM syndrome. Congenital rubella syndrome may also cause elevated IgM levels.

**2. Autoimmune Manifestation**

-  Cytopenias, polyarthritis, and other immune dysfunctions. Autoimmune cytopenias are more common in children with CVID compared to adults.

-  Vitiligo, Psoriasis, ITP, Hyper/Hypothyroidism, SLE, JIA, IBD can be the presenting disorder in patients with CVID.

-  Antibodies to IgA are reported in almost 44% of patients with selective IgA deficiency with an increased incidence of autoimmune diseases and malignancies.

**3. Hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly, and Peripheral Lymphadenopathy**

- Physical exam findings in children and adults seen in hypogammaglobulinemia.

**4. Allergic Symptoms**

- Allergic diseases such as asthma, eczema, urticaria, and allergic rhinitis have been reported in children with CVID.

- Children with IgA deficiency have higher rates of atopy and food and drug allergies.

**5. Growth Retardation or Developmental Abnormalities**

- Failure to thrive, poor oral intake, GI symptoms like diarrhea, and abdominal pain seen as common findings.

- With XLA, the absence of tonsils and adenoids can be present in adulthood from prophylaxis treatment with antimicrobials in childhood.

- In CVID,  GI involvement presenting with diarrhea, weight loss and malabsorption in children and adults are common.

- In IgA deficiency, children and adults may present with the celiac-like syndrome, recurrent diarrhea with blunting of villi on jejunal biopsy leading to growth retardation in children.

**6. ENT Abnormalities and Cardiovascular Abnormalities such as Digeorge or CHARGE Syndromes in Pediatric Patients**

- Tympanic membrane perforation, scarring, and possible hearing loss found on examination.

- Cobblestoning pattern of mucosa in the pharynx with the absence or underdevelopment of tonsillar tissue, nasal exudates.

**7. Malignancies in the Older Population**

- Approximately 25% of patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) developed hypogammaglobulinemia long term, this was demonstrated in a study conducted at the Mayo Clinic in the 2000s. IgG levels were subsequently lower during the course of the disease when compared to initial levels during diagnosis.

- Patients with CVID and XLA may also present with colorectal cancer, lymphoreticular malignancies, and non-Hodgkins lymphoma.

- Adults with IgA deficiency may develop complications like adenocarcinoma of stomach and lymphoma.
