Diagnosis of congenital ptosis is usually clinical. The following findings point towards the diagnosis of congenital ptosis:

- Mild to severe ptosis

- Reduced levator palpebrae superioris function

- Lid lag in downgaze (lid lag sign)

- Absent or weak lid crease in normal position

- Increase in size of the palpebral aperture in downgaze.

**Grades of Ptosis**

Ptosis mayÂ be graded based on the difference of MRD1 of both eyes in unilateral cases and difference from normal in bilateral cases as:

- Mild - 2 mm or less

- Moderate - 3 mm

- Severe - 4 mm or more

The typical case of simple congenital ptosis does not require any additional investigations for diagnosis of the condition.

Preoperative anesthetic fitness is determined in a normal fashion.

When syndromes are suspected, an appropriate clinical opinion should be obtained together with appropriate investigations to rule out other associated defects.
