There are two distinct types of Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

**Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia(UHB) or Indirect Hyperbilirubinemia**

Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is the more common type and is either physiological or pathological. Physiological jaundice accounts for 75% of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and results from a physiological alteration in neonatal bilirubin metabolism. Healthy adults have a normal TSB level of less than 1mg/dl in contrast to neonates, where TSB levels are physiologically higher. Even in healthy full-term newborns, there is an increased bilirubin load owing to increased red blood cells (RBC) mass and a decreased RBC lifespan. Clearance of bilirubin is also compromised due to impaired activity of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), the enzyme needed for bilirubin conjugation. The UGT enzyme in a newborn has an activity of about 1% of the adult level.

Jaundice is considered pathological if it presents on the first day of life, TSB is more than the 95th centile for age based on age-specific bilirubin nomograms, levels rise by more than 5 mg/dL/day or more than 0.2 mg/dL/hour, or jaundice persists beyond 2 to 3 weeks in full-term infants.

Based on the mechanism of bilirubin elevation, the etiology of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be subdivided into the following three categories:

**Increased Bilirubin Production**

Immune-mediated hemolysis -   Includes blood group incompatibilities such as ABO and Rhesus incompatibility.

Non-immune mediated hemolysis - includes RBC membrane defects like hereditary spherocytosis and elliptocytosis; RBC enzyme defects like glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency; pyruvate kinase deficiency; sequestration like cephalohematoma, subgaleal hemorrhage, Intracranial hemorrhage; polycythemia, and sepsis.

**Decreased Bilirubin Clearance**

Crigler-Najjar type I & II, and Gilbert syndrome.

**Miscellaneous Causes**

Other miscellaneous etiologies include the infant of a mother with diabetes, congenital hypothyroidism, drugs like sulfa drugs, ceftriaxone, and penicillins, Intestinal obstruction, pyloric stenosis, breast milk jaundice, breastfeeding jaundice.

Exaggerated hemolysis, either immune or non-immune mediated, is the most common cause of pathological hyperbilirubinemia in newborns. Immune-mediated hemolysis is seen with blood group incompatibility such as  ABO/RH incompatibility and leads to hemolytic disease of newborns (HDN). In HDN, due to ABO incompatibility, preformed maternal anti-A and anti-B antibodies of immunoglobulin (Ig) G subclass cross the placenta and cause hemolysis and UHB in newborns with blood type A, B, or AB. Although the direct Coombs test is used to aid diagnosis, the sensitivity and positive predictive value for predicting severe UHB are low.

In Rhesus (Rh) incompatibility, an Rh-negative mother who has been previously exposed to Rh-positive RBCs usually from a previous pregnancy or miscarriage, becomes sensitized and develops antibodies against Rh antigen. Initially, sensitization produces IgM antibodies that can not cross the placenta. However, during subsequent pregnancies, the antibody class switch produces IgG antibodies which can cross the placenta, causing RBC hemolysis in the fetus with Rh-positive blood. The Rh antigen is very immunogenic, and the resultant HDN is usually severe, often leading to hydrops in fetuses or severe UHB in newborns. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has recommended that all Rh-negative pregnant women receive anti-D immune globulin at 28 weeks of gestation and again following delivery if the infant is Rh-positive/unknown.

Non-immune causes of UHB include RBC enzyme defects, RBC membrane defects, hemoglobinopathies, sepsis, sequestration, and polycythemia. The glucose-6 phosphatase dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme deficiency is the most common RBC enzyme defect and is transmitted as an X-linked recessive trait. G6PD protects RBCs against oxidative damage by generating NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogenase) from NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). When exposed to oxidant stressors like illness, certain medications, dyes, and foods like fava beans, G6PD deficient RBCs are hemolyzed, causing anemia and hyperbilirubinemia. More than 200 different types of mutations are known to cause G6PD deficiency.

UHB due to RBC membrane defects includes hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and hereditary elliptocytosis (HE). HS, also known as Minkowski Chauffard disease, is the most common RBC membrane defect caused by mutations in RBC membrane proteins.

RBC sequestrations from cephalohematoma, subgaleal hemorrhage, and Intracranial hemorrhage are also important causes or risk factors for UHB in the neonatal period due to increased bilirubin load. Polycythemia is another entity associated with an increased risk of UHB in newborns. Clinical conditions associated with polycythemia are intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), infant of diabetic mothers (IDM), large for gestational age (LGA), maternal smoking, high altitude, twin to twin transfusion, and placental transfusion (delayed cord clamping/umbilical cord milking). Studies have shown that placental transfusion reduces the incidence of postnatal anemia and leads to improved neurodevelopmental outcomes among term and preterm infants.

Indirect hyperbilirubinemia due to decreased bilirubin clearance usually results from quantitative or qualitative defects in the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzyme. Gilbert syndrome, Crigler–Najjar syndrome type 1, and Crigler–Najjar syndrome type 2 are three prototype disorders resulting from an abnormality in the UGT enzyme. Gilbert syndrome is the most common of these and results from a mutation in the UGT1A1 gene resulting in decreased UGT production leading to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Breast milk jaundice and breastfeeding jaundice are two other common etiologies of UHB in newborns. Breastfeeding jaundice, also known as breastfeeding failure jaundice, occurs in the first week of life and is due to inadequate intake of breast milk leading to dehydration and sometimes hypernatremia.

Other miscellaneous causes of UHB include IDM, gastrointestinal obstruction, congenital hypothyroidism, certain medications. IDMs often have polycythemia which is mainly responsible for the increased incidence of jaundice in these infants.

The majority of infants with clinical UHB have a combination of two or more factors discussed earlier. Furthermore, certain recognized risk factors predispose an infant to jaundice. These risk factors comprise prematurity, a history of jaundice in previous siblings requiring phototherapy, Asian ethnicity, male gender, and exclusive breastfeeding.

**Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia(CHB) or Direct Hyperbilirubinemia**

Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, also referred to as neonatal cholestasis, is characterized by elevation of serum conjugated/direct) bilirubin (> 1.0 mg/dL) and is due to impaired hepatobiliary function. Distinguishing CHB from UHB is critical because cholestatic jaundice/CHB is almost always pathologic and warrants prompt evaluation and treatment.

The causes of neonatal cholestasis/CHB are extensive and can be classified into the following categories:

**Obstruction of biliary flow:**Biliary atresia, choledochal cysts, neonatal sclerosing cholangitis, neonatal cholelithiasis

**Infections:**CMV, HIV, rubella, herpes virus, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, urinary tract infection (UTI), septicemia

**Genetic causes**: Alagille syndrome, alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency, galactosemia, fructosemia, Tyrosinemia type 1, cystic fibrosis, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), Aagenaes syndrome, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Bile acid synthesis disorders(BSAD)

**Miscellaneous:**Idiopathic neonatal hepatitis, parenteral nutrition induced cholestasis, gestational alloimmune liver disease/neonatal hemochromatosis, hypotension,

Biliary atresia (BA) is the most common cause of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infants.

Choledochal cysts involve dilation of the intrahepatic and extra-hepatic bile duct. Ultrasonography can detect cysts with normal or dilated intrahepatic bile ducts as opposed to sclerosed ducts in biliary atresia. However, cystic biliary atresia may resemble choledochal cysts.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common congenital infection that manifests in various ways. Most infected newborns are asymptomatic, but hepatomegaly and CHB are the most prominent feature of hepatic involvement.

Alagille syndrome (ALGS) is an AD disorder caused by mutations in JAG1 or NOTCH2 genes leading to a lack of interlobular bile ducts.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the most common genetic cause of cholestatic and may mimic biliary atresia in early infancy. Accumulation of anti-trypsin polymers in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes of a patient with the PiZZ genotype leads to apoptosis of hepatocytes, ultimately resulting in cholestasis and cirrhosis later in childhood.Escherichia coli sepsis after the ingestion of galactose from milk.

Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is a heterogeneous group of three genetic disorders that present with cholestasis. They are related to mutations in one of the genes involved in canalicular hepatobiliary transport.

Parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC) is an important iatrogenic cause of cholestasis recognized most commonly in preterm infants managed with parenteral nutrition (PN). PNAC is present in about 20% of neonates who have received PN for more than two weeks.

In GALD, maternal IgG immunoglobulin against fetal hepatocytes crosses the placenta causing complement-mediated damage to fetal hepatocytes. Patients present with signs of liver failure in the form of hypoglycemic, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, cholestatic jaundice, edema, and elevated liver enzymes. The risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies is almost 90%, and GALD can result in fetal or neonatal deaths.
