**Glycogen Storage Disease Type 1 - Von Gierke Disease**

Glycogen storage disease type 1 is a group of inherited complex metabolic disorders which share poor fasting tolerance.

- Hepatomegaly and kidney enlargement due to glycogen accumulation

- Severe fasting hypoglycemia since liver cells cannot release glucose in blood postprandially

- Lactic acidosis since accumulated glucose-6 phosphate blocks gluconeogenesis and consequently lactate uptake

- Hypertriglyceridemia, since increased levels of glucose-6 phosphate favor glycolysis and acetyl-CoA production, leading to increased malonyl-CoA synthesis and subsequent inhibition of carnitine acyltransferase 1 (the rate-limiting mitochondrial enzyme of fatty acid beta-oxidation)

Hyperuricemia results from increased uric acid production and decreased uric acid excretion (uric acid competes with lactate for excretion via the same organic acid transporter in proximal renal tubules).

**Pyruvate Carboxylase Deficiency**

Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency is due to the lack of pyruvate carboxylase or altered enzyme activity. It causes lactic acidosis, hyperammonemia, and hypoglycemia. Hyperammonemia is due to pyruvate not being converted into oxaloacetic acid. Oxaloacetic acid gets transaminated into aspartate; reducing aspartate levels results in the reduced introduction of ammonia into the urea cycle.
