The precise incidence of gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) is not known. Before the advent of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), peptic ulcer disease (PUD) was the major cause of GOO cases. With the better treatment of H. pylori infections and the use of PPIs, the incidence of GOO from PUD has declined to 5%. More recently, 50% to 80% of cases of GOO are related to underlying cancers. The incidence of peripancreatic malignancy causing GOO is 15% to 20%.

Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is a frequent cause of GOO in neonates. It occurs in 1.5 to 3 per 1000 live births and more common in males (1:150 male and 1:750 female). Its occurrence is rare in older children and adolescents. HPS is caused by diffuse hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the pyloric smooth muscles that narrow the antrum, resulting in GOO. It is one of the most common indications of surgery during the first six months of life.
