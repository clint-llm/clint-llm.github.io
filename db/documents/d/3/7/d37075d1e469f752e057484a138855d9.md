Experience with corrective surgery is limited. The main aims of surgery are to decompress the brain by providing adequate intracranial volume, increase the infraorbital volume to accommodate the globe, and to widen the nasopharynx by the advancement of the naso-maxillary-zygomatic complex.

Multiple staged surgeries are the general treatment plan for patients with PS. A suturectomy is done in the first year of life to open the intracranial space allowing brain growth.

Patients having TCS usually requires tracheostomy, mainly to treat obstructive sleep apnea that results from maxillary hypoplasia, choanal stenosis, and macroglossia. The trachea will be rigid in these patients, and this makes appropriate sizing of tracheostomy tubes difficult. This may, in turn, lead to increased formation of granulation tissue and associated complications. The parents of any child having TCS should be counseled regarding the need for tracheostomy, which can, later on, affect the prognosis and quality of life.
