Cinacalcet is a “calcimimetic,” meaning that it acts on the calcium-sensing receptors (CaSR) located on the chief cells of the parathyroid gland.

“Calcimimetic” medications, as the name suggests, may not be the real calcium ligands, but they activate these receptors and utilize the Gq/Gi pathways to establish the negative feedback loop to raise calcium levels. This feedback occurs through the suppression of both the production of PTH and its secretion and ultimately leads to the mitigation of calcium and phosphorus products in the blood.
