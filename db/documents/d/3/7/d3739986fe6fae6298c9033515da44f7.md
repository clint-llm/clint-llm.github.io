Adrenal crisis (also known as Addisonian crisis), also termed acute adrenal insufficiency is an acute life-threatening condition with a mortality rate of 0.5/100 patient-years and remains a significant cause of death in patients with adrenal insufficiency

There is no consensus regarding the definition of an adrenal crisis. Multiple expert reviews have tried to formulate their definitions of adrenal crisis. Here we will be using the definition suggested by Rushworth, et al 2019:

- "An acute deterioration in health status associated with absolute hypotension (systolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg) or relative hypotension (systolic blood pressure ≥20 mm Hg lower than usual), with features that resolve within 1 to 2 hours after parenteral glucocorticoid administration (i.e., a marked resolution of hypotension within 1 hour and improvement in clinical symptoms over a period of 2 hours)".
