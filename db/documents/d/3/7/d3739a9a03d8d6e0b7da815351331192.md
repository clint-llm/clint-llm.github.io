There are four reported etiologies of Lp-X-induced hyperlipidemia. They include liver dysfunction, deficiency of the lecithin-cholesterol-acyl- transferase enzyme, graft vs. host disease in liver transplant patients, and lipid infusion.

Cholesterol is normally converted to bile acids by certain enzymes, including the cholesterol 17 alpha-hydroxylase enzyme. Cholestasis prevents the normal formation of bile acids leading to the formation of Lp-X. It can also be present in patients with mutations to the enzyme that esterifies cholesterol lecithin–cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT).  Patients with LCAT deficiency will have the higher formation of Lp-X because of their inability to convert free cholesterol to cholesterol esters.

LCAT deficiency patients also have low HDL levels and anemia. Lp-X is formed in patients with lipid infusion, such as seen in patients getting total parenteral nutrition. Total parenteral nutrition has been shown to cause an increase in the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids, which make up most of the structure of Lp-X.
