Richter hernias are difficult to diagnose as herniation of the anti-mesenteric portion of the bowel wall rarely results in complete luminal obstruction. As discussed, because of this, patients with an incarcerated Richter hernia may have a prolonged subclinical course and may present only when the process is advanced, and there is a high risk for bowel ischemia. Due to this, there is a crucial need for interprofessional discussion. When patients with abdominal pain present to the emergency department, and there is suspicion for an incarcerated hernia, which may even be strangulated, it is essential for emergency medical staff to involve the surgical team as early as possible. If there is a concern for strangulation, the consulting surgeon may proceed to the operating room based on physical examination rather than pursuing imaging studies. The mortality rate surrounding strangulated Richter hernias is 17%; thus, one must have a high index of suspicion and keep Richter type hernias in the differential when considering patients with abdominal pain.
