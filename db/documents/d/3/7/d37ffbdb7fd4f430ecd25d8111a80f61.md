As sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is one of the most feared and catastrophic complications of epilepsy, options for mitigating or modifying the risk are important. Several interventions for decreasing the risk of SUDEP have been explored, including optimizing epilepsy control, detecting seizures through observation and devices, positioning to decrease the risk of airway compromise, and pharmacologic interventions to reduce the possibility of hypoventilation.

A 2012 Cochrane Review, however, has shown that while generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) may be accurately detected with such methods, there has not been enough data to suggest that they would prevent SUDEP. Similarly, the efficacy of interventions such as “safety pillows” or pharmacologic intervention with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors to reduce central hypoventilation is not supported by data.
