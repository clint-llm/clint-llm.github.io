A migraine is a common primary headache. A neurologist evaluates clinical features and the MIDAS score. Initial treatment is through medicines and behavioral therapy. Botulinum toxin is commonly used as a screening tool to identify the triggers. Peripheral neurolysis/neurectomy is an effective treatment for drug-refractory cases.
