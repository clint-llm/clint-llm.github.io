Laboratory investigation is typically not required in most cases. However, stool studies are indicated for patients with high fever, hematochezia, or tenesmus. Typical stool studies include stool culture, fecal leukocytes, and lactoferrin. The stool should be assessed for ova and parasites in patients with longer duration of symptoms. New multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screens are becoming available and provide a quick analysis of multiple stool pathogens. These screens, however, are expensive, are not widely available, and may not change the clinical management of patients.

Radiological studies are not required in most cases. Kidneys, ureters, and bladder studies can be obtained to assess for acute intra-abdominal pathology or look for evidence of perforation in severe cases. An abdominal computerized tomography (CT) can also be used as a diagnostic tool for intraabdominal pathology in severe cases.
