Vascular sonography is a generalized term defined by assessment of the venous and arterial system via the use of sound waves. Some of the more commonly encountered pathologies include arterial stenosis and venous thrombosis; however, a wide variety of vascular abnormalities may be identified. Ultrasound also provides an excellent assessment of lymph node morphology and may help characterize malignancy and metastatic disease. This activity reviews the assessment, protocols, and interpretation of commonly encountered vascular and lymph node pathologies while reviewing common sonographic artifacts.

**Objectives:**
- Identify common ultrasound characteristics for arterial stenosis.
- Explain the physiological mechanisms of augmentation, phasicity, and pulsatility.
- Summarize the ultrasound characteristics for benign and malignant lymph nodes.
- Review some interprofessional strategies that can advance the utilization of sonography for vascular and lymphatic assessment to improve patient outcomes.
