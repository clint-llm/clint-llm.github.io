Americans spend over $2 billion a year on weight-loss dietary supplements. These supplements are costly and can contain dozens of ingredients, including plant components, herbs, dietary fiber, caffeine, and minerals. The proposed mechanisms of action vary for each supplement. These include blocking the absorption of fats and carbohydrates, reducing appetite and increasing satiety, increasing thermogenesis, and changing metabolism to improve body composition. There are concerns over the efficacy, safety, and purity of the compounds in supplements, which are usually marketed without substantiating data. The FDA regulates dietary supplements as foods, not drugs.

People considering using weight-loss supplements should talk with their healthcare providers to discuss potential benefits and risks. This is especially important for patients with comorbid conditions who are taking prescription medications. Yet fewer than one-third of U.S. adults who use weight-loss dietary supplements discuss this with a clinician.

The evidence supporting the use of weight-loss dietary supplements is limited, inconclusive, and unconvincing.
