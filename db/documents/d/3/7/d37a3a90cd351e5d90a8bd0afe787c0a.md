Right ventricular failure (RVF) is most commonly a result of left ventricular failure (LVF), via pressure and volume overload.

In addition to LVF, there are other conditions of pressure overload that lead to RVF. These include transient processes such as:

- Pneumonia

- Pulmonary embolism (PE)

- Mechanical ventilation

- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

Furthermore, chronic conditions of pressure overload may lead to RVF. These include:

- Primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and secondary pulmonary hypertension (PH) as seen in chronic-obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pulmonary fibrosis)

- Congenital heart disease (pulmonic stenosis, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, or a systemic RV).

The following conditions result in volume overload causing RVF:

- Valvular insufficiency (tricuspid or pulmonic)

- Congenital heart disease with a shunt (atrial septal defect (ASD) or anomalous pulmonary venous return (APVR)).

Another important mechanism that leads to RVF is intrinsic RV myocardial disease. This includes:

- RV ischemia or infarct

- Infiltrative diseases such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis

- Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD)

- Cardiomyopathy

- Microvascular disease.

Lastly, RVF may be caused by impaired filling which is seen in the following conditions:

- Constrictive pericarditis

- Tricuspid stenosis

- Systemic vasodilatory shock

- Cardiac tamponade

- Superior vena cava syndrome

- Hypovolemia.
