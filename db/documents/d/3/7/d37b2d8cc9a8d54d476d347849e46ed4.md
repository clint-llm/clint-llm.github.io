The patient can present with symptoms as quickly as one minute after inhalation and within a few minutes of cyanide ingestion. If the hydrogen cyanide was inhaled, the victim might detect a bitter, almond odor, which is discernible by approximately 60% of the population. The clinical manifestations can be divided into early and late categories. Some early central nervous system findings are headache, dizziness, confusion, and mydriasis. These are due to tissue hypoxia, and seizures and coma can develop as it progresses to an altered level of consciousness. Early respiratory and cardiovascular findings include tachypnea and tachycardia, while late findings include apnea, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmia. Hypotension and bradycardia are common in cyanide poisoning. It is important to note that a patient's skin can be a normal or slightly ashen appearance despite tissue hypoxia. Patients with cyanide poisoning will not be cyanotic but will have a cherry red color due to excess oxygen in the bloodstream.
