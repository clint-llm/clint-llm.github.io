There are a wide range of diseases that affect the male genitalia including inflammatory lesions, infectious etiologies, preneoplastic syndromes, and malignant conditions. However, The most common cause of balanitis is related to inadequate personal hygiene in uncircumcised males leading to infection. The warm moist environment under the uncircumcised penile foreskin favors the growth of organisms that cause balanitis such as Fungi.

Fungal infections are the most common identifiable etiology with the majority of infections being caused by Candida albicans.

Infectious etiologies:

- Candidal species (most commonly associated with diabetes)

- Group B and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci

- Neisseria gonorrhea

- Chlamydia species

- Anaerobic infection

- Human papillomavirus

- Gardnerella vaginalis

- Treponema pallidum (syphilis)

- Trichomonas species

- Borrelia vincentii and Borrelia burgdorferi

Noninfectious etiologies:

- Poor personal hygiene (most common)

- Chemical irritants (e.g.,  spermicides, detergents, perfumed soaps and shower gels, fabric conditioners)

- Edematous conditions, including congestive heart failure (right-sided), cirrhosis, and nephrosis

- Drug allergies (e.g., tetracycline, sulfonamide)

- Morbid obesity

- Allergic reaction (condom latex, contraceptive jelly)

- Fixed-drug eruption (sulfa, tetracycline)

- Plasma cell infiltration (Zoon balanitis)

- Autodigestion by activated pancreatic transplant exocrine enzymes

- Trauma

- Neoplastic conditions
