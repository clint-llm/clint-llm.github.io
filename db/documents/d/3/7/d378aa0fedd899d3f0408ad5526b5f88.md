Most primary care clinicians will encounter patients with a food allergy. Food items that account for 90% of hypersensitivity reactions include cow's milk, egg, soy, wheat, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish. Peanuts are one of the most frequent food allergens and can cause fatal reactions when ingested. A reaction to peanuts will typically occur in the first few years of life. Peanut allergy is usually lifelong and potentially fatal. This activity addresses the evaluation and management of peanut allergies and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

- Describe the epidemiology of peanut allergies.
- Summarize the evaluation of a patient with a peanut allergy.
- Review the treatment and management options for a patient with a peanut allergy.
