Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by Brucella species. It is known by many other names, including remitting fever, undulant fever, Mediterranean fever, Maltese fever, Gibraltar fever, Crimean fever, goat fever, and Bang disease. The disease was described by George Cleghorn, a British army surgeon stationed on Minorca, in his 1751 work Observations on the Epidemical Diseases in Minorca from the Year 1744 to 1749. Brucellosis again came to the attention of medical officers of the British army on the island of Malta following the Crimean War. The genus Brucella is named for Major-General Sir David Bruce, who, in 1886, led the Malta Fever Commission that identified Brucella melitensis as the organism responsible for the disease. In 1905, Sir Themistocles Zammit identified that infected goats transmitted brucellosis in their milk.

Brucella organisms are small aerobic intracellular coccobacilli. These are found in the reproductive organs of host animals, causing abortions and sterility. They are shed in urine, milk, placental fluid, and other fluids of the animals. Many species have been identified, but the following four have moderate-to-significant human pathogenicity:

- Brucella melitensis (from sheep)

- Brucella suis (from pigs)

- Brucella abortus (from cattle)

- Brucella canis (from dogs)

Brucella melitensis and suis have the highest pathogenicity, while Brucella abortus and canis have moderate pathogenicity.
