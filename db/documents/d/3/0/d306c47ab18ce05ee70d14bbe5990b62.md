Distal to their bifurcation from the subclavian arteries, the vertebral arteries course cranially to the base of the skull. They progress past the C7 vertebrae anteriorly before entering the transverse foramen of C6.  After exiting the C2 transverse foramen, the arteries bend laterally to enter the more widely placed transverse foramen of C1 and then revert medially over the superior aspect of the arch of the atlas before entering the base of the skull. The main tributaries of the vertebral arteries, the cervical radicular arteries, supply blood directly to the cervical vertebral bodies.

Also located in the cervical spine region are the carotid arteries. The right common carotid artery is a branch of the brachiocephalic artery, whereas the left common carotid arises directly from the aortic arch. The common carotids then bifurcate into the internal and external carotids at the C3 vertebral level.  Despite their association with the neck, they do not perfuse any structures in the cervical spine.
