The inguinal lymph node can be subdivided into the superficial and deep lymph nodes and collectively drains the anal canal(below the pectinate line), the skin below the umbilicus, lower extremity, scrotum, vulva, glans penis, and clitoris. The lymph node's primary function is to filter for harmful substances as lymphatic fluids travel through its cortex, paracortex, and medulla. Clinical signs of inguinal lymphadenopathy can help to clue physicians in possible diagnoses of sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, chancroid, and lymphogranuloma venereum. The lymph node can also serve to assist in the diagnosis of cancer.
