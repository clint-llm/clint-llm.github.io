Causes of RTD in adult population include:

- PDR

- Retinal vein occlusion (RVO)

- Retinal vasculitis

- Trauma

- Sickle cell retinopathy

- Uveitis

- Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR)

- Penetrating trauma

Causes of RTD in the pediatric population include:

- Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and its complications

- Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR)

- Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV)

- Toxoplasma retinitis

- Toxocara retinitis
