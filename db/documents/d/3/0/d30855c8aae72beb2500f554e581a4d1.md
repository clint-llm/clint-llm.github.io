The diagnosis of ADPKD is made based on ultrasonographic criteria. The criteria for ultrasonographic diagnosis of individuals with a positive family history with unknown genotype (as is usually the case) is as follows:

- In patients ages 15 to 39 years, at least three unilateral or bilateral renal cysts

- In patients ages 40 to 59 years, at least two cysts in each kidney

- In patients age 60 years or older, at least four cysts in each kidney

While ultrasound is the only study required to make a definitive diagnosis, patients are routinely evaluated with a basic metabolic profile and urinalysis to determine the extent of any renal insufficiency.
