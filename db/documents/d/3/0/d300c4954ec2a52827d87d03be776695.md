Celecoxib is chemically designated as 4-[5-(4-methylphenyl)- 3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl] benzenesulfonamide and is a diaryl-substituted pyrazole. The mechanism of action of celecoxib is due to selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which is responsible for prostaglandin synthesis, an integral part of the pain and inflammation pathway.

CelecoxibÂ also has anticancer properties discussed below and exerts its anticancer properties by binding cadherin-11 (CDH11), which likely plays a significant role in the malignant progression of cancerous cells.

Celecoxib is extensively metabolized through cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) and may have interactions with other medications that are substrates of CYP2C9.
