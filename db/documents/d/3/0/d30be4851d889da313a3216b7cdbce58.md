Stopping the over-the-counter sale of copper sulfate and the restriction of purchase, distribution, and sale to authorized agents is important in decreasing the incidence of copper toxicity. Alternatively, over-the-counter availability of copper sulfate can be limited to large crystals as cases of poisoning are usually due to inadvertent/intentional dissolving of the fine powder-like pulverized form of the compound.
