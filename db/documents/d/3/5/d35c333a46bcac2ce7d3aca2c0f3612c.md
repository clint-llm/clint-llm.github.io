**Risk Factors**

Several factors increase the risk of developing bisphosphonates-related osteonecrosis of the jaw:

1) Invasive oral procedures such as tooth extraction, periodontal surgery, and oral implant placement, and the use of dentures increase the rate of bone turnover and the risk of osteonecrosis.

2) Comorbidities like cancer, chemotherapy, low hemoglobin levels, diabetes mellitus, renal dialysis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypercholesterolemia.

3) Concomitant medications: corticosteroids and H2 blocking drugs, which increase BP absorption. Antiangiogenic agents, particularly sunitinib and bevacizumab. Erythropoietin and cyclophosphamide therapy.

4) Infection: it is still unclear if osteonecrosis precedes or follows the infection. However, polymorphonuclear aggregates and bacterial microfilm in the surrounding tissue have been associated with bone resorption and necrosis.

BPs inhibit the proliferation and viability of oral keratinocytes, damaging the oral mucosa integrity and increasing the risk of infection.

5) Genetic predisposition: polymorphism in farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase or CYP2C8 coding for a cytochrome P450 enzyme predisposes some individuals to bisphosphonate-associatedÂ osteonecrosis of the jaw in multiple myeloma.

6) Other risk factors include increasing age, alcohol, and tobacco use.
