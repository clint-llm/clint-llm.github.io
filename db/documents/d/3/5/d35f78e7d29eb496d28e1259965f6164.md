The history and physical findings for the pulmonary veno-occlusive disease are most similar to the clinical presentation of other forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Most patients will present with signs of right-sided heart failure, such as leg edema, ascites, and volume overload. They often will complain of dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea. Physical findings in these patients may include a split S2, loud P2, crackles, and cyanosis.
