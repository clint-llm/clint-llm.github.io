Etiologic factors include genetic influences, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, pregnancy, hormonal therapies, cosmetics, phototoxic drugs, and antiseizure medications.

Melasma stimulates melanocytes by the female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, producing more melanin pigments when the skin is exposed to the sun.

**Genetic**

Genetic predisposition may be a major factor in the development of melasma.

- Melasma is more common in females than in males.

- Persons with light-brown skin types from regions of the world with high sun exposure are more prone to the development of melasma.

- Approximately 50% report a positive family history of the condition. Identical twins have been reported to develop melasma.

**Sunlight Exposure**

UV radiation can cause lipids peroxidation in cellular membranes, resulting in free radicals which could stimulate melanocytes to produce excess melanin.

- Sunscreens that block UV-B radiation (290-320 nm) do not block the longer wavelengths of UV-A and visible radiation (320-700 nm) which also stimulate melanocytes to produce melanin.

**Hormonal Influences**

Hormones may play a role in developing melasma in some individuals.

- The mask of pregnancy is known to occur in obstetric patients. The exact mechanism is unknown. Estrogen, progesterone, and melanocyte-stimulating hormone levels are normally increased during the third trimester of pregnancy and may be a factor.

- Patients with melasma who are nulliparous have no increased levels of estrogen or MSH but show elevated levels of estrogen receptors within the lesions. In addition, melasma with estrogen- and progesterone-containing oral contraceptive pills and diethylstilbestrol treatment for prostate cancer have been observed.

- A woman who is postmenopausal and given progesterone may develop melasma, while those who are given estrogen alone do not; this implicates progesterone as playing a primary role in the development of melasma.

**Thyroid Disease**

There is a four-fold increase in thyroid disease in melasma patients.

- There is an association between the development of melasma and the presence of melanocytic nevi and lentiginous nevi.

- This would indicate a relationship between the development of melasma and the presence of pigmentation.
