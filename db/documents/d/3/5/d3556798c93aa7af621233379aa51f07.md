The disease is caused by an encapsulated ribonucleic (RNA) virus â€“ severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), which belongs to the family of viruses Coronaviridae.

The origin of the virus remains a hotly debated topic, but one of the propounded theories involves a complex lineage involving wild bats, pangolins, and/or seafood.
