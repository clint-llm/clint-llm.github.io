The physiology of a newborn is unique and complex in that it changes over a period of minutes, hours, days, and months. Once a human reaches adulthood, our physiology typically remains stable and predictable, with any deviation potentially leading to pathology and disease. However, a newborn's rapid and ever-changing physiology is essential in adapting to a world outside the womb. This article aims to discuss the important physiology associated with the newborn period to allow a deeper understanding of the complexities of this stage of life.
