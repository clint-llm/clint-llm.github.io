Atypical fibroxanthomas most commonly are seen on the head and neck of elderly White race patients. Other reported sites of atypical fibroxanthoma include the trunk, shoulders, upper extremities, and dorsum of the hands. Trunk and limb lesions appear to occur more commonly in younger patients (mean age 39) compared to head and neck lesions in the elderly (mean age 69). A review of 171 cases in Western Australia found a patient age-range of 41 to 97 years old (median age 74), with 76% of the tumors occurring in men. Atypical fibroxanthoma also has been reported in patients as young as 13 with predisposing disorders such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum. The incidence increases in immunosuppressed populations, with an estimated incidence of 78 per 100,000 transplant patients.
