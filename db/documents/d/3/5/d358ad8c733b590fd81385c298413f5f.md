Adrenal adenomas are benign neoplasms of the adrenal cortex. Non-secreting adrenal adenomas secrete low levels of hormones, are usually asymptomatic and are typically discovered incidentally on abdominal imaging. The glucocorticoid producing adrenal tumors can present with the symptoms and signs of Cushing syndrome. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of adrenal adenoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review imaging findings of adrenal adenomas.
- Outline the differential diagnosis of adrenal lesions.
- Explain the importance of monitoring patients with indeterminate adrenal lesions.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to enhance care coordination for patients with adrenal adenoma.
