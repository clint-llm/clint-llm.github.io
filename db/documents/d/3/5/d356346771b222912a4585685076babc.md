**Pharmacodynamics/Kinetics**

Route of Administration: Intrathecal

The onset of action: 5 to 10 minutes

Duration of action: Clinical duration of action can be as long as 20 hours given the biphasic pattern.

Distribution: 1.0 to 4.7 L/kg after intravenous dosing. Limited data suggest that the volume of distribution of morphine in the intrathecal space is 22 +/- 8 mL.

Protein Binding: 36% (low)

Metabolism: The drug undergoes hepatic glucuronidation to morphine-3-glucuronide, which is pharmacologically inactive.

Half-life: The disposition of morphine in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) follows a biphasic pattern with an early half-life of 1.5 hours and a late phase half-life of about 6 hours.

Excretion: Primarily renal excretion of the conjugate (morphine-3-glucuronide). Approximately 2% to 12% is excreted unchanged in the urine.
