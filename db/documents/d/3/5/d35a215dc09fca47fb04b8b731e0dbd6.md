Afferent neural pathways mediate the sensation of pain.

Postoperative pain can additionally characterize as somatic or visceral. The somatic division of pain is composed of a rich input of nociceptive myelinated, rapidly conducting A-beta-fibers found in cutaneous and deep tissue, which contribute to a more localized, sharp quality.

Therapeutic interventions developed for pain management aim to target the afferent pain pathway by various mechanisms. For example, by antagonizing pain receptor activity or by blocking the production of pro-inflammatory mediators.
