The widely adopted staging of adrenocortical carcinoma is by the European Network of Study of Adrenal Tumors (ENSAT) due to its correlation with clinical outcome.

- Stage I with a tumor size of smaller than 5 cm.

- Stage II is a tumor with a size of over 5 cm; strictly localized both stages.

- Stage III is characterized by the positive regional lymph nodes, infiltration of the tumor in the surrounding tissue, or a tumor thrombus in the vena cava and/or renal vein.

- Stage IV is defined by distant metastasis.
