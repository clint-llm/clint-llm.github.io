The prognosis of pernio is overall excellent since lesions are rarely severe, and most cases of pernio can be resolved relatively easily without prolonged sequelae. In patients who develop pernio in association with chronic systemic conditions like CHLE, ensuring adequate control of the systemic illness along with symptomatic treatment of the pernio can aid in the rapid resolution of the pernio lesions.
