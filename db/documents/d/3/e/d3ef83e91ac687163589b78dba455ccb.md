The exact cause of pityriasis rosea is not known, but features like seasonal variation and clustering in communities suggest that it is an infectious disease. Infections like viruses, bacteria, spirochetes, and noninfective causes like atopy and autoimmunity are known causes. Upper respiratory tract infections that precede pityriasis rosea suggest a role of Streptococcus. Recently, reactivation of latent human herpesvirus-6 and human herpesvirus-7 infection have been found as the possible etiologic agents. Pityriasis rosea-like eruptions have been reported after vaccinations such as Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), influenza, H1N1, diphtheria, smallpox, hepatitis B, and Pneumococcus. Eruptions have also been seen with drugs like gold, captopril, barbiturates, D-penicillamine, and clonidine. In temperate regions, it is more common in the winter season, while in tropical areas some seasonal variation is noted.
