Neurilemmomas are benign findings, and while they can produce symptoms due to mass effects on surrounding tissues, they generally are not a cause for concern.Â If a patient experiences pain or neurologic deficit, disfigurement, bleeding, or if there is suspicion for a developing malignancy, surgery may be indicated. Surgical intervention does yield very favorable outcomes, with some expected risk of associated nerve damage.
