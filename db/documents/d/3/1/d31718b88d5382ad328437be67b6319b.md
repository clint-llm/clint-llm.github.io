Lifestyle factors such as weight loss or improved diabetic control should be explained to the patient to allow modifiable risk factors to be addressed. This may also translate to reducing the risk of the surgery itself in the future, by reducing anesthetic and post-operative complication risks. Lifestyle measures such as reducing caffeine and timing of fluid intake can also be used as a measure to address specific problematic urinary symptoms.

Those managed with long-term catheters or intermittent self-catheterization should be taught the importance of hygiene and catheter care to prevent urinary tract infections. This may be done with the assistance of dedicated specialist nurses. The provision for managing the catheter in the community should also be made.

Patients with BPH should understand the risks of disease progression before committing to treatment options and should be counseled on alternative management options such as watchful waiting, medical therapy along with any other surgeries available in order to make an informed decision.
