# Continuing Education Activity

Olfactory training is a non-pharmacological and non-surgical treatment option for patients with olfactory dysfunction. Patients undergoing olfactory training expose themselves to 4 different odors twice daily for at least 24 weeks. The main indications include post-infectious, post-traumatic, and idiopathic olfactory dysfunction and olfactory dysfunction due to Parkinson disease. This activity reviews the details of olfactory training and highlights the role of the interprofessional team during olfactory training.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the physiology of olfactory training.
- Identify the main indications for olfactory training.
- Explain the protocol for olfactory training.
- Summarize how an interprofessional team approach can provide patient benefit when performing olfactory training.

# Introduction

About 20 percent of people in the general population have an impairment of the sense of smell.

If there is a clear structural pathology in the nose or brain, treatment may be oriented toward the underlying lesion, such as functional endoscopic nasal surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis with polyposis or neurosurgical interventions for an anterior skull base tumor.

Medications such as corticosteroids for chronic rhinosinusitis and other inflammatory conditions may provide some relief from olfactory decline.

Several studies have described the efficacy of olfactory training.

Additionally, younger patients, patients with relatively well-preserved olfactory function, females, and non-smokers have a good chance of a spontaneous improvement of olfactory functioning.

Olfactory training is comparatively simple, and so far, serious side effects have not been reported. Although its precise mechanism of action and efficacy are incompletely understood, olfactory training is increasingly applied in routine care for patients with olfactory dysfunction of varying etiologies.

# Anatomy and Physiology

The olfactory system is the most primitive of the human special senses and is very closely connected to the limbic system, the seat of emotion.

The olfactory epithelium is located at the apex of the nasal cavity, along both the upper septum and the superior turbinate, as well as the roof of the nose. Olfaction has many roles, including recognition of danger and identification of edible food, and is responsible for a significant proportion of the human sense of taste; taste buds on the tongue can only differentiate among sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami (savory) flavors, but the human sense of smell can differentiate as many as 1 trillion odorants.

Compared to other sensory systems, the olfactory system, including the olfactory epithelium and parts of the olfactory bulb, is unique in that it can adapt and regenerate.

# Indications

Recent work suggests that olfactory training is more effective in younger individuals than in the elderly and is more effective in individuals with severe olfactory dysfunction than in individuals who are only mildly affected.

- **Post-infectious olfactory dysfunction:**This is one of the most common causes of olfactory decline in clinical practice and one of the most common indications for olfactory training.

- **Post-traumatic olfactory dysfunction:**This type of olfactory dysfunction may occur suddenly or with a delay after a brain or nasal injury.

- **Parkinson disease:**Patients with Parkinson disease have a severe impairment of olfactory functioning, which starts many years before the onset of motor symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesic gait.

- **Idiopathic olfactory dysfunction:**This diagnosis is made after excluding all other causes of olfactory dysfunction.

# Contraindications

There are no described contraindications for olfactory training in terms of past medical or surgical history or medications. However, the value of olfactory training for treating olfactory dysfunction secondary to sinonasal disease remains yet to be determined.

Many patients with olfactory dysfunction due to sinonasal disease, especially those with chronic rhinosinusitis (with or without polyposis), may benefit from functional endoscopic surgery, generally with a pre-operative course of nasal topical steroids.

# Equipment

The set-up for olfactory training includes four sniff bottles or jars (the volume of each container should be approximately 50 ml). Inside each container is 1 ml of an odor solution soaked into cotton pads. The different scents are typically phenylethyl alcohol (rose scent), eucalyptol (eucalyptus scent), citronella (lemon scent), and eugenol (clove scent­).

# Personnel

Patients need to be instructed on how to perform olfactory training by a physician, a nurse, a nurse practitioner, or other medical professionals with experience in managing olfactory dysfunction.

# Preparation

The cause of the olfactory dysfunction needs to be determined using a comprehensive evaluation that follows consensus guidelines.

# Technique or Treatment

For standard olfactory training, the patients sniff twice daily (preferably once in the morning before breakfast and once in the evening before going to bed) for at least 20 to 30 seconds on each of the four scents separately. It is imperative that patients constantly sniff for 20 to 30 seconds on each odor without a break.

The odors for training are presented in sniff bottles or jars. Typically, patients undergo olfactory training for at least 24 weeks. For patients with post-infectious olfactory dysfunction, olfactory training over the course of one year yielded better results than training for 16 weeks.

Olfactory training over several months is challenging for both the patients and the health care provider. The effects may be less dramatic than expected, and it takes a high degree of discipline to follow the standard protocol of olfactory training.

# Complications

Olfactory training has been assessed in more than 40 clinical studies, and results have been reviewed in several independent meta-analyses.

# Clinical Significance

Except for post-viral olfactory dysfunction and olfactory dysfunction secondary to chronic rhinosinusitis, there is no established medical or surgical treatment for olfactory dysfunction.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

A multi-professional team is critical for achieving the best possible results of olfactory training. This team should include several members such as medical clerks, nurses, nurse practitioners, and physicians. Medical clerks are responsible for the coordination of patients' appointments and ordering and storing the materials needed for olfactory training. Nurses and nurse practitioners screen patients to determine candidacy for olfactory training. They also instruct patients to ensure the olfactory training protocol is followed correctly and thus facilitate the best possible outcome of the therapy—furthermore, they follow up with patients to ensure adherence to the protocol.

Physicians oversee and supervise medical clerks, nurses, and nurse practitioners. Additionally, regular conferences ensure that all team members are apprised of the patients' progress undergoing olfactory training, ensuring all patients' needs are addressed and problems resolved. It is also critical for the team to educate itself regarding current developments in the field of olfaction and olfactory training.
