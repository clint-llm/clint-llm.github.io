One of the appealing aspects of clonus as a physical examination technique is that it can easily be performed without equipment. As it is most commonly tested at the ankle, with swift dorsiflexion of the entire foot, no equipment is required. Elsewhere, when testing other joints, for instance, the knee, the patellar tendon can be struck briskly with the fingers, or an improvised object like a stethoscope, or phone. However, as clonus is a mark of hyperreflexia, it is generally easy to elicit in a patient without much force, so the examiner’s fingers may even be preferred over other equipment.
