Lidocaine is used by many healthcare professionals, including physicians, certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. Practitioners using this anesthetic must be aware of its potential toxicity and how to manage it. Because lidocaine can cause seizures and arrhythmias, poison control should be contacted. A toxicologist, a neurologist, and a cardiologist should be consulted immediately. At the same time, the airway should be managed and maintained patent. The other mainstay of treatment is to reduce the free available local anesthetic concentration in the plasma by the administration of lipid emulsions. Due to the high lipid solubility, infusion of lipid emulsions will bind free circulating local anesthetics and lower the plasma levels. The outcomes of patients with lidocaine toxicity depend on the dose and presence of neurological symptoms. When treatment is prompt, the outcomes are good, but any delay in treatment can lead to death.
