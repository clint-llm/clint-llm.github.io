The prevalence ofÂ Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is estimated to be between 1 in 5000 and 1 in 100,000, based on the EDS subtype, but this could be an underestimation.

EDS classical type is estimated to affect 1 per 10000 to 1 per 20000. Aside from the common subtypes, most others are exceedingly rare, with specific subtypes like EDS kyphoscoliotic type identified in about 60 total patients and EDS dysfibronectinemic type identified in only one single family. However, it is important to note that there is likely underestimation of the overall incidence of EDS as the more mild presentations with only minimal joint or skin involvement may not have clinically significant disease and, therefore, may not seek medical care. If they do, subtle signs and symptoms can be difficult to diagnose, and genetic testing is not indicated or pursued.
