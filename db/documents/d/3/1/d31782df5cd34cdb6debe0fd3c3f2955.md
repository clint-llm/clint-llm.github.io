ARDS has many risk factors. Besides pulmonary infection or aspiration, extra-pulmonary sources include sepsis, trauma, massive transfusion, drowning, drug overdose, fat embolism, inhalation of toxic fumes, and pancreatitis. These extra-thoracic illnesses and/or injuries trigger an inflammatory cascade culminating in pulmonary injury.

A lung injury prevention score helps identify low-risk patients, but a high score is less helpful.

Some risk factors for ARDS include:

- Advanced age

- Female gender

- Smoking

- Alcohol use

- Aortic vascular surgery

- Cardiovascular surgery

- Traumatic brain injury

- Pancreatitis

- Pulmonary contusion

- Infectious pneumonia

- Drugs (radiation, chemotherapeutic agents, amiodarone)
