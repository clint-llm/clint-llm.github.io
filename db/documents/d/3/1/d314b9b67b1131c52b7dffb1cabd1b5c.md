Interprofessional team members must be familiar with the important anatomical, physiological, and pathological features related to the airway and have a solid knowledge of the various tools and methods for airway management. They also should know the differences between the adult, pediatric, and neonatal airways and should be well-versed with other difficult airways, as these differences can have significant impacts on patient outcomes. This activity describes the different techniques used for airway management and highlights the interprofessional team's role in the care of the patients requiring it.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the differences between the pediatric airway and the adult airway.
- Describe the technique involved in performing bag-mask ventilation.
- Summarize the types of equipment used for airway management and list the indications and contraindications for endotracheal intubation, confirmation of proper endotracheal tube placement, and complications of endotracheal intubation.
- Review interprofessional team strategies to enhance care coordination and communication to advance airway management and improve patient outcomes.
