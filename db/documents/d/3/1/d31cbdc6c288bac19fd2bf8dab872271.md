Foville syndrome is a rare inferior medial pontine syndrome first characterized in 1858 by anatomist and psychiatrist Achille Louis Francois Foville. In his paper, “Notes on a Little-known Paralysis of Eye Muscles, and Its Relation to the Anatomy and Physiology of the Pons,” Foville posed a question: does the analysis of paralytic symptoms provide a basis for the exact localization of cerebral disease? He followed it with a description of a 43-year-old male who presented with unilateral conjugate horizontal gaze paralysis and facial nerve paralysis on the same side with crossed hemiparesis. Though several clinical variants have emerged over the years, classical Foville syndrome presents with ipsilateral sixth nerve palsy, facial palsy, and contralateral hemiparesis. Reports exist of other features such as facial hypoesthesia, peripheral deafness, Horner syndrome, ataxia, pain, and thermal hypoesthesia.
