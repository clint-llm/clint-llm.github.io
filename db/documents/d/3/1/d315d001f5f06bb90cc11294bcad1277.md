The pituitary gland sits directly behind the nasal bridge in a protective boney structure called the "sella turcica" and it is connected to the hypothalamus by the infundibular stalk. The hypothalamus is largely responsible for regulating the synthesis and secretion of various hormones within the pituitary gland, including Prolactin. The pituitary gland is structurally divided into anterior and posterior regions. The anterior pituitary is capable of producing and secreting its own hormones, compared to the posterior pituitary gland which acts more as a conduit for presynthesized hormones by the hypothalamus. Prolactin is synthesized by lactotrophs in the anterior pituitary gland. The number of lactotrophs will increase during pregnancy in response to the physiological need to develop breast tissues and to prepare for milk production. It should be noted that the increase in lactotrophs cells is not accompanied by an increase in angiogenesis. This fact is important to understand the pathophysiology behind pituitary infarction and ischemia presented later. Prolactin production is regulated at the gene transcription level. Factors that stimulate production, upregulate prolactin gene transcription while factors that inhibit secretion downregulate prolactin gene transcription.

Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and dopamine are both released by the hypothalamus and have activity in modulating lactotophic activity. Dopamine is tonically (i.e. continuous) secreted by dopaminergic neurons that project from the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus into the anterior pituitary gland via infundibulum. This pathway is called the tuberoinfundibular pathway. The dopamine that is released at the terminal buttons of the nerves, acts on lactotrophic cels through D2-receptors modulating intracellular signaling and inhibiting prolactin synthesis. In the absence of pregnancy (i.e., high estrogen) or lactation in sexually mature females, prolactin is constitutively inhibited by dopamine, and the effect of dopamine trumps the effect of minimal stimulatory effects of TRH. Additionally, prolactin has a negative feedback on its own production by stimulating the release of dopamine in the hypothalamus. Medications that antagonize dopamine production (i.e. antipsychotics) or masses that compress the infundibulum disrupt the basal inhibition of prolactin synthesis, resulting in hyperprolactinemia. Conversely, medications that are dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine or cabergoline will inhibit prolactin secretion and can be used to treat pathologies associated with hyperprolactinemia. Lastly, the decidua-layer of the placenta has been found to synthesize prolactin as well. This process is independent of dopamine regulation.

During pregnancy, estrogen and progesterone are found at elevated levels and they function to promote the growth of mammary tissue. Estrogen largely does not impact prolactin's production or secretion. The most potent stimulator for prolactin synthesis interestingly is suckling or nipple stimulation. This mechanical process stimulates sensory nerves in the nipple that carries the signal via the spinal cord to the arcuate nucleus which inhibits dopamine release, thus, removing the inhibitory action of dopamine on prolactin. At the same time, the afferent signal from the nipple activates supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei to increase the production of oxytocin which allows for milk "let-down". Oxytocin and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) both promote the inhibition of dopamine allowing the synthesis of prolactin. During periods of stress, the secretion of prolactin contributes to the modulation of adrenal ACTH-sensitivity, and hypertrophy of the gland.

Prolactin release has an inhibitory effect on the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)  from the hypothalamus. The loss of GnRH results in a lack of pulsatile stimulation of gonadotrophic cells resulting in the loss of FSH and LH release from the anterior pituitary.  FSH and LH are the primary hormones needed to regulate menstruation, thus, females who are lactating will experience a period of transient amenorrhea until the cessation of breastfeeding. This mechanism serves as a natural contraceptive and may play a role in pregnancy spacing. Similarly, prolactin in males inhibits GnRH release resulting in decreased spermatogenesis and infertility, but this is considered pathologic.
