The clinical features of chylothorax depend upon the cause. Small chylothorax can be asymptomatic and is detected incidentally. Patient with large chylothorax usually presents with signs and symptoms caused by the mechanical effect of compression on lung expansion. Progressive breathlessness decreases exercise capacity; chest pressure is common presenting complaint. Fever and chest pain is usually absent. The patient can accumulate a large amount of chylothorax without any complaints if the fluid recommendation is gradual and the respiratory system gets acclimatized to it. Post-traumatic chylothorax can present up to 10 days after the inciting trauma. In the post-surgical patient’s, the chylothorax me the first detected as a pleural effusion or by persistent drainage from the indwelling chest tubes.

On physical examination, findings of decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion may be present depending on the size and location of fluid. Eighty percent of chylothorax cases are unilateral. Due to the location of the thoracic duct, the right side is more common than the left, accounting for two-thirds of the total cases.
