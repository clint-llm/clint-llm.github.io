In most cases, Strongyloidiasis is asymptomatic, especially in immunocompetent individuals.

**Acute Infection**

Acute infection may show an itchy serpiginous skin rash in the area where the larvae penetrate the skin. When filariform larvae in fecal-contaminated soil enter the body through skin penetration, intense pruritus, congestion, and edema is noted at the portal of entry.

Larva currens or “running” larva is a pathognomonic dermatologic manifestation of strongyloidiasis and can be seen with autoinfection as well. Larva currens manifest as a raised, pink, pruritic, serpiginous streak and can progress approximately 5 to 15 cm per hour.

Passage of the larvae through the lungs can give a dry cough and cause a Loeffler-like syndrome with dyspnea, wheezing, eosinophilia, and migratory pulmonary infiltrates. The larvae travel through venules and lymphatics to enter pulmonary circulation producing pulmonary hemorrhages and cough. Eosinophilic infiltration of the alveolar spaces often results in pneumonitis as well.

Intestinal symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, and epigastric pain.

Hyperinfection syndrome presents with fever, gram-negative bacteremia, and sepsis with signs of end-organ damage (hemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, ileus, hyponatremia).

**Chronic Infection**

Strongyloides stercoralis can also cause chronic infections, which can persist for years in humans. Chronic Strongyloides stercoralis infections present with cough, rhonchi, dyspnea, abdominal pain, anorexia, diarrhea, and/or constipation.

**Hyperinfection**

Hyperinfection is caused by accelerated autoinfection of the parasite within the host leading to a high parasite burden and severe disease. The signs and symptoms of hyperinfection are similar to symptoms of increased larval migration within the organs. Disseminated disease occurs with hyperinfection syndrome leading to the spread of larvae to distant organs such as the liver, pancreas, kidneys, mesenteric lymph nodes, brain, and skeletal muscles.
