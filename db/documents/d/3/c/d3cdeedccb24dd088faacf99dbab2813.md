Patients with central cord syndrome are challenged not only physically but also psychologically as well. Effective communication between interprofessional teams, including neurologists, internists, neurosurgeons, psychiatrists, physiatrists, physical and occupational therapists, and nurses, can lead to better outcomes. These patients are prone to depression and suicidal ideation. Furthermore, the lack of motivation can delay the treatment progress and may lead to permanent disability.

The following strategies can assist in achieving better recovery:

- Close routine follow-up with the neurologist/physiatrist/internist.

- Educate patients on clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) to avoid urinary tract infections and secondary complications.

- Educate patients to avoid immobility and regularly change position after 2 to 4 hours.

- Close follow-up with a physical therapist for muscle and core strengthening exercises to avoid muscle atrophy.

- Blood pressure monitoring at home.

- Close follow-up with the psychiatrist to look for signs of depression and suicidal ideation.
