After pre procedure clearance, probe is inserted via mouth under moderate sedation. Patient's vitals should be monitored continuously during the procedure. The probe is inserted and is manipulated to obtain different views of the heart. The following terminology is used in the ASE/SCA guidelines to understand the manipulation of the probe with the assumption that the imaging plane is anterior to the esophagus looking into the heart in a patient in supine anatomic position.

Rotating the anterior aspect of the probe within the esophagus clockwise is called “turning to the right” and rotating it counterclockwise is called “turning to the left”. “Advancing the transducer” means pushing the tip of the probe more distal into the esophagus or the stomach while pulling the tip more proximally is called “withdrawing the probe”.  Flexing the tip of the probe with the large control wheel anteriorly is called “anteflexing”, and flexing it posteriorly “retroflexing”.  Using the small control wheel, flexing the tip of the probe to the patient's right is called “flexing to the right”, and flexing it to the left is called “flexing to the left”. Finally, increasing the transducer multiplane angle from zero degrees towards 180 degrees is called “rotating or multiplane forward”, and decreasing in the opposite direction towards zero degrees is called “rotating or multiplane back”.
