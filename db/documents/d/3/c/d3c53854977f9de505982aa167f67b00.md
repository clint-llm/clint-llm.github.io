Weight-based dosing scalars are important because administration based on total body weight may result in overdose, while dosing based on ideal body weight may be sub-therapeutic. Recommendations are that non-depolarizing NMBDs are dosed based on ideal body weight to avoid prolonged paralysis.

A providerâ€™s choice of non-depolarizing NMBD depends on the desired speed of onset, duration of action, route of elimination, and side effects. For instance, muscle relaxants with a rapid onset (i.e., rocuronium) and brief duration may be desirable when endotracheal intubation is the reason for paralysis. On the other hand, a longer-acting agent like pancuronium may also produce intubating conditions in 90 seconds, but at the cost of pronounced tachycardia within the patient and a block that may be irreversible by an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (for over 60 minutes), increasing the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications.

Duration of action for some of the most commonly used agents:

- Atracurium - 30 minutes or less

- Rocuronium - 45 to 70 minutes

- Pancuronium - 180 minutes or longer

- Vecuronium - 30 to 40 minutes
