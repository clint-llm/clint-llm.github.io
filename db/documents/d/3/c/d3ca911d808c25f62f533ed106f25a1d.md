Data published by arthritis foundation in 2015 suggests that there are over 100 types of arthritis. And about 91.2 million adults either have physician-diagnosed arthritis and/or report joint symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of arthritis.

Arthritis, and polyarticular arthritis, in particular, are more common in females and obese patients. Age significantly increases the prevalence. One estimate puts the total costs related to arthritis (medical care, earning losses, lost time, etc.) at 1% of US gross domestic product ($304 billion) for the 2013 fiscal year.

Among people with arthritis, 33% have depression or anxiety, 25% have cardiac problems, 20% have respiratory conditions, and 16% have Diabetes. It is likely that arthritis is predisposing patients to all the comorbidities through physical inactivity.
