A diagnosis is made upon clinical examination with eversion of the eyelids and examination under the biomicroscope. Concretions may be single or multiple. They present as yellowish-white structures located in the palpebral conjunctiva or fornices. They may become confluent, and these, as well as the larger ones, may erode through the conjunctiva and protrude to become symptomatic. The surrounding conjunctiva may show signs of allergy-like follicles and redness.
