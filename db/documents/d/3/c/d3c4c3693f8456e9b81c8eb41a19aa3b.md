Basophils are typically the least numerous myeloid cells seen in a peripheral blood smear. Their numerous dark azurophilic granules easily distinguish them.

Basophils express CD45 and are positive for myeloid markers CD13, CD11b, and CD33. They also express CD22 (alsoÂ positive in B-cells), bright CD38, and bright CD123.
