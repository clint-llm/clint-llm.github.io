Cadmium toxicity usually occurs after occupational, environmental, or hobby work exposure.  Environmental exposures can occur from contamination in the surrounding soil with the metal, and then the resultant food grown there is consumed.  This type of contamination can occur in areas where mining or refining of ores takes place.

Something to this effect took place in Japan in the 1950s at the Jinzu River when a mine discharged a large amount of cadmium into the environment.  The rice grown in the area caused an epidemic of painful osteomalacia that occurred mostly in multiparous postmenopausal women.   The name given this condition was “itai-itai” disease which is “ouch-ouch” in Japanese since those affected would say this every time they took a step.
