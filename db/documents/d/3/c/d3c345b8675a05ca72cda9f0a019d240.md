**Violence**

Given its serious implications, measures should exist to prevent violence and physical abuse. Primary physicians should identify risk factors for violence and offer interventions such as counseling and social worker support.

**Alcohol**

Patients with mild alcohol use disorder show a good response to alcohol-related counseling and participation in mutual-help groups. Interventions for moderate to severe alcohol use disorder include a combination of medications, psychosocial interventions, mutual help groups, and need-based social services. For medical management, naltrexone is preferable to acamprosate.

**Tobacco Use**

Treatment of tobacco use disorder is a significant public health priority. Many biological, environmental, and psychosocial factors impact their progression.

**Risky Sexual Behaviors**

Sexual health risk reduction should be a priority, and individuals, particularly adolescents and young adults, should receive education on safe sexual practices. Everyone should receive age-appropriate vaccinations that protect against sexually transmitted infections, particularly those people who are at risk. Infected patients and their partners should be thoroughly evaluated and should receive effective treatment and counseling on practicing safe sex.

**Eating Disorders**

Management of eating disorders requires a multidisciplinary team composed of a mental health expert, a general practitioner, and a nutritionist. Both anorexia and bulimia increase the risk of death; hence medical health professionals should focus on the prevention of disease.

High-risk behaviors require psychoeducation, behavioral modification, mental health, and substance abuse treatment. An array of professionals from health care and law enforcement can help notice these behaviors and assist the individuals concerned in receiving appropriate treatment. Clear and frequent interdisciplinary collaboration and communication go a long way in improving patient outcomes in individuals with high-risk behaviors.
