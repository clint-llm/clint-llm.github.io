- In the United States, there are over 626,000 hospital admissions a year for complicated urinary tract infections, comprising about 1.8% of all annual hospitalizations, with eighty percent of these being non-catheter related.

- Cohorts with more risk factors show an increased incidence of urinary tract infections. Risk factors include female gender, increasing age, diabetes, obesity, long-term catheters, and frequent intercourse (although UTI is not defined as a sexually transmitted infection).

- Simple UTIs in nonpregnant immune-competent females have been estimated to occur with as high as 0.7 infections per person per year. Fifty percent of females will have at least one UTI at some stage in life.

- Complicated UTI incidence is associated with specific risk factors. For example, there is a 10% daily risk of developing bacteriuria with indwelling bladder catheters and up to a 25% risk that bacteriuria will progress to a UTI.

- About twenty percent of all bacteremias associated with healthcare originate from the urinary tract. The mortality associated with these urinary tract-based bacteremias can be up to 10%.

- Bacteriuria occurs in up to 14% of diabetic females but does not tend to occur with a higher frequency in diabetic males.

- Asymptomatic bacteriuria tends to increase with age in females and is present in up to 80% of the elderly female population. It is rare among younger healthy males but can be present in up to 15% of older males.

- About 9.4% of all urological inpatients developed a complicated UTI during their hospital stay.

- An increased incidence of UTI has been described in patients using dapagliflozin (SGLT2i) which treats diabetes by producing glycosuria.

- UTIs are the most common infections in renal transplant patients. Up to 25% of these patients will develop a UTI within the first year after a transplant.

- UTIs are the seventh most common reason for a patient to be seen in an Emergency Department in the US, constituting over 1 million visits annually.
