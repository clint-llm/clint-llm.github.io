Most patients with velocardial facial syndrome arise from a de novo microdeletion, with subsequent autosomal dominant inheritance. Prevalence ranges from 1 to 2 per 4,000 live births, with an increased incidence in patients with cardiovascular malformations.

There does not appear to be an association with any ethnic group and the development of velocardial facial syndrome.

Though patients with velocardial facial syndrome generally have unaffected fertility, their offspring have a 50% chance of inheriting the syndrome.
