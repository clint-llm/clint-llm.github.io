A study evaluating microalbuminuria in 22,244 patients (aged 6Â to 80 years) reported a prevalence of 7.8%, especially in those older than 40 years. Women had a higher prevalence of 9.7%, whereas men had 6.1%.

Microalbuminuria has been associated with patients who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. For patients with type 1, the prevalence of microalbuminuria within the first three years after diagnosis is only 6%; however, after five years, it is 41%. In type 2, the prevalence is 20 to 25% for newly diagnosed and long-standing diabetics.
