**Acute Leukemia**

Acute leukemia tends to present non-specifically, although the most common presenting features include fever, lethargy, and bleeding. Hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and musculoskeletal symptoms (especially involving the spine and long bones) can also be clues to the diagnosis. Adults may also have more prominent anemia-related symptoms, such as shortness of breath, or symptoms related to thrombocytopenia, such as excessive bruising or increased bleeding tendency. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation-type symptoms, can present with mucosal bleeding, including gum bleeds, nosebleeds, or menorrhagia.

**Chronic Leukemia**

Chronic leukemia subtypes occur almost exclusively in adults. Many patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, identified only incidentally after marked leukocytosis is discovered on a complete blood count (CBC) performed for another reason. Hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy can be appreciated in some cases, while bleeding and bruising are less common, presenting features relative to acute leukemia subtypes.
