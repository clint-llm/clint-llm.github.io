The role of the nurse is crucial in facilitating inpatient recovery and monitoring for deterioration post-operatively. Hourly observations in recovery until the patient is considered stable allow an assessment of how the patient is recovering post-op with escalation to anesthetic colleagues if required. Nursing monitoring includes regular four hourly vital signs and the use of major early warning scores is key to the escalation of deteriorating patients. Monitoring and accurate charting of patient urine output, drain output, bowel function and nutritional intake are also key elements of inpatient care.
