In patients with acute hypercalcemia, Paget disease of bone, and osteoporosis, introducing calcitonin therapy should involve the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team that includes the patient's primary care clinician (MD, DO, PA, NP), endocrinologist, oncologist, nursing staff, and a board-certified pharmacotherapy pharmacist to provide a comprehensive approach towards patient care. Each interprofessional team member will contribute with the expertise from their discipline and must communicate with other team members to keep everyone apprised of the patient's progress or lack thereof. This will optimize the potential therapeutic effectiveness of the medication while minimizing adverse events. [Level 5]
