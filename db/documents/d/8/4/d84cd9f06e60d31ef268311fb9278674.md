**Clark’s Level**

- Measures the level of invasion

- I: melanoma cells are in the epidermis only (melanoma in situ)

- II: melanoma cells invade through the basal layer and are in the papillary dermis

- III: melanoma cells fill papillary dermis

- IV: melanoma cells involve the reticular dermis

- V: melanoma cells involve the subcutaneous fat

**Breslow Thickness**

- Measures depth of invasion in mm

- Measures of tumor thickness

- Performed on 10x magnification from stratum granulosum to the deepest invasive tumor cell

- When ulceration is present, Breslow is measured from the bottom of the ulceration

- Breslow less than 1 mm: Thin melanoma

- Breslow greater than 1 mm usually require sentinel lymph node biopsy

**Melanocytic Markers**

**S100**

- A common marker for neural tissue. Acidic protein in the nucleus and cytoplasm

**MART-1 (MELAN-A)**

- Most sensitive melanocytic marker

- Can stain pseudonests in lichenoid actinic keratosis in sun-damaged skin

**MITF-1**

- Nuclear stain, positive in melanocytes, mast cells, and osteoclasts

**HMB-45**

- Recognizes melanosomal glycoprotein gp100

- Blue nevi stain with HMB-45

**Special Considerations: Desmoplastic melanoma**

- S100: Must be performed

- MART-1 is usually negative
