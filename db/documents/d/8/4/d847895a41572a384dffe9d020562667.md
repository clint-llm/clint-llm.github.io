The etiology of pulseless electrical activity is classified into primary i.e., cardiac, and secondary i.e., noncardiac causes.

Primary pulseless electrical activity, often caused by or related to cardiac arrest, is due to the depletion of myocardial energy reserves. It responds poorly to therapy.

Causes of secondary pulseless electrical activity include the famous "5 Hs and 5 Ts." These are as follows:

**5 Hs**

- Hypovolemia

- Hypoxia

- Hydrogen ion (acidosis)

- Hypo/hyperkalemia

- Hypothermia

**5 Ts**

- Tension pneumothorax

- Trauma

- Tamponade

- Thrombosis, pulmonary

- Thrombosis, coronary
