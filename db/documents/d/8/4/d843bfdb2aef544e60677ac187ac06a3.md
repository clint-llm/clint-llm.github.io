Patient education in individuals with a tendency for oxalate precipitation is of utmost importance to reduce episodes of stone formation. Preventing dehydration by consuming adequate water and restricting oxalate-rich food in the diet are two of the easiest ways to prevent recurrent stone formation. A decreased vitamin C in the diet is advisable.Â Sodium and protein content in the diet should be decreased along with oxalate.

In patients with primary hyperoxaluria, the inheritance occurs in an autosomal recessive pattern and therefore genetic counseling is important.
