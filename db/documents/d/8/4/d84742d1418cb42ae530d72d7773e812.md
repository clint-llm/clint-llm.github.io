Baseline liver functions require monitoring before or periodically during therapy in patients taking trazodone. Patients receiving trazodone should also be monitored for suicide ideation, especially at the beginning of the treatment or when the dose is modified. Monitor also for signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome. In addition, concomitant administration of CYP 3A4 inhibitors can lead to increased levels of trazodone, increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome and cardiovascular adverse effects.
