The prognosis differs between primary and secondary forms. Patients with the primary form (PSS) of upper extremity DVT are typically young and healthy, while those with secondary forms are often previously hospitalized and may have significant co-morbidities such as cancer. In a large database study, overall 3-month mortality in patients with DVT in the upper extremity was 11%. In a sub-group analysis of patients with cancer, the mortality rate was as high as 28%. Complications such as PE and post-thrombotic syndrome can also occur. PE occurs in up to 6% of cases and occurs most often in secondary forms of upper extremity DVT. Post-thrombotic syndrome occurs in less than 5% of upper extremity DVT and can result in persistent limb swelling, pain, and heaviness. However, in patients with PSS, post-thrombotic syndrome can occur in as high as 45% of cases. If this continues untreated, it can result in skin discoloration and collateralization. Investigations are underway to determine if compression therapy may help prevent and/or treat post-thrombotic syndrome.
