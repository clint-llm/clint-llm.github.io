Treatment for encephalitis is supportive. Methylprednisolone 1 gram intravenously daily for three days produces significant improvement. The first-line treatment for catatonia is benzodiazepines, followed by electroconvulsive therapy. In treatment-resistant cases, bromocriptine, memantine, zolpidem, and valproate can also be used.
