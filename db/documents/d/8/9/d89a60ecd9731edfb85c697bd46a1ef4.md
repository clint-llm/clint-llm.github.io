SD presents as variable degrees of erythematous, greasy, flaking plaques that predominantly affects the scalp, nasolabial folds, eyebrows, and chest. Dandruff appears similarly but less severe as red, oily, scaly patches on the scalp that may be pruritic. SD is typically self-limited in children, and the most common presentation is scalp involvement, so-calledÂ  "cradle cap."

PV characteristically demonstrates multiple round to oval macules, patches, or plaques that vary in color (hence the name, versicolor), ranging from hypopigmented to a hyperpigmented red, blue, pink, or grey. Lesions may have peripheral scaling and pruritis.

Malassezia folliculitis may appear clinically similar to acne as erythematous papules and pustules with or without pruritis. Some studies report the most common lesions are dome-shaped, comedopapules with a central "dell" not unlike molluscum contagiosum. Patients are often hospitalized in the intensive care unit or immunosuppressed on biologic agents or chemotherapy.

In immunocompromised patients, the clinical manifestations of fungemia and sepsis are nonspecific. Patients are typically critically ill and suddenly develop fevers, chills, lethargy, and signs and symptoms of internal organ involvement. Yeasts may gain venous access through central venous catheters or parenteral lines.
