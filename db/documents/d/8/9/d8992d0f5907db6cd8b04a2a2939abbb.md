Many interprofessional healthcare team members can perform the Apley compression test to assess for meniscal injury, including emergency and sports medicine providers, orthopedic nurses and surgeons, chiropractors, and physical therapists. However, it is crucial to understand that the test is not 100% sensitive, and an MRI should be utilized to confirm the diagnosis.

Patients with meniscal injuries should receive a referral to an orthopedic surgeon for definitive management.
