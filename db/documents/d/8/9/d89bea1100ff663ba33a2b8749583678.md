CAC score is of prognostic value. A score of 400 or more indicates an increased risk of ASCVD events, while a lower score predicts a lower risk. This score can be used complementary with other ASCVD risk prediction models. In patients with intermediate-risk of ASCVD using the Framingham score, a CAC of 0 will indicate a lower risk when these two scores are combined. Similarly, in patients with an intermediate ASCVD score, a high CAC will predict the risk of future ASCVD events to be high when combined with the original score.

The severity of valvular stenosis is calculated by echocardiogram based on visual and hemodynamic estimations. Severe aortic valve stenosis carries a poor prognosis, especially with symptoms present.

The prognosis of pericardial calcification can be predicted by signs and symptoms of heart failure. If the symptoms are refractory to medical management, they indicate poor prognosis. In these cases, surgical management is required.

The prognostic value of myocardial calcification is not clear. For now, it is merely recognized as an incidental finding on various imaging modalities or autopsy.
