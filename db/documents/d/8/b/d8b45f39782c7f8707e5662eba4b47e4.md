Symptoms from reported cases of reserpine poisoning include hypotension, nausea, vomiting, sedation, coma, cardiovascular collapse, and death, while the latterÂ two are uncommon.

After ingestion, toxicity symptoms will develop over the initial 4 hours and generally resolve around 18 to 24 hours.

If the patient is experiencing gastric hyperacidity, H2-histamine receptor antagonists or atropine are therapeutic options. Gastrointestinal decontamination may also be an option.

There have been no signs of clinically apparent liver injury with reserpine use.
