The anatomy of the hypothenar eminence is essential to know during hand surgeries. The knowledge of the relationship between the nerves, blood vessels, muscles, and bones allows for a safe and optimal approach when it comes to hand surgery.

When hand reconstruction involves the ulnar artery, the collateral blood supply should undergo evaluation for sufficiency — the assessment of the collateral blood to the hypothenar eminence occurs with the modified Allen's test. The reason collateral blood flow should be evaluated is that if the hypothenar eminence is left with inadequate perfusion post-operatively. The muscles, nerves, and tissues of that region may undergo ischemic necrosis.

The repair of the ulnar nerve in "handlebar palsy." This procedure requires the surgeon to know the relationship between the hook of the hamate bone to the pisiform bone. The ulnar nerve will pass between the hook of the hamate and the pisiform bone (Guyon’s canal). During the repair, it is crucial to release the compression of the ulnar nerve without damaging it. If damage to the ulnar nerve occurs. There will be atrophy of the hypothenar eminence along with loss of sensory and motor function in the region the ulnar nerve innervates.
