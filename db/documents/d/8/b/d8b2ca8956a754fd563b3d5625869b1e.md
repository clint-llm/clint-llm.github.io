The prognosis of poromas is good as the lesions have minimal clinical significance. Poroma clinically presents as a solitary nodule or papule. The lesions are typically asymptomatic, and few lesions have mild tenderness. The patient sometimes develops multiple poromas at the same time, a phenomenon called porokeratosis. Poromatosis is of cosmetic concern for the patient.

The malignant transformation risk of poroma is very minimal, and it transforms into porocarcinoma. In the study of Salih et al., metastasis of porocarcinoma was detected at a presentation in 31% of cases. The most common sites in the body for the metastases of porocarcinoma were the neighboring lymph nodes (57.7%) followed by respiratory tract/lungs (12.8%),brain (9%), liver (9%), skin (5.8%), bone (3.2%), stomach (0.6%) and breast (0.6%). Metastasis was disseminated in 1.3% of cases.
