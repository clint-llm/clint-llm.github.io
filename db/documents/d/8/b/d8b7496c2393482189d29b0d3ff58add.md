HTN is the most common risk factor for the development of CVD and mortality. Since HTN impacts >60% of people over the age of 60 in the developed world, most studies have focused on outcomes in older patients. Still, even HTN in late adolescence is associated with increased cardiovascular causes of death in middle age, as compared with people with lower BP.

The continuous relationship between increasing BP and increased morbidity and mortality has been demonstrated at all ages. Furthermore, the treatment of elevated SBP has been shown to significantly reduce total mortality, CVD, coronary heart disease-related mortality, and stroke.
