Defects in fatty acid metabolism during late pregnancy are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy, although the pathogenesis of this disease remains poorly understood. During late pregnancy, free fatty acids increase, to support fetoplacental growth. The thinking is that in the presence of defects related to the metabolism of these fatty acids, they accumulate in hepatocytes, and cause cellular damage.
