In a study of 50 dissections, Jackson et al. discussed anatomical variants of the vagus nerve in the area of the distal esophagus and stomach. From their specimens, they found that the left vagus nerve contributed more fibers to the anterior vagal trunk than did the right, albeit the right vagus did contribute more branches overall.

In their analysis of the branching pattern of the anterior vagal trunk, they found four distinct types of patterns: in one pattern (type A, 33 specimens), the anterior trunk became a single trunk above the diaphragm, and subsequently passed through the diaphragm; in another variation (type B, 14 specimens), the anterior vagal trunk was also formed above the diaphragm, as in the previous variation, but split into two distinct branches just before encountering the diaphragm; a third type (type C, two specimens), in which a single trunk did not form until the trunks reached the diaphragm; and a final type (type D, one specimen), in which the researchers noted no single trunks above the diaphragm.
