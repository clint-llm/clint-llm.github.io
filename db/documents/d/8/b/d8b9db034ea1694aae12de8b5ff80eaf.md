Target antigens for pemphigus herpetiformis are usually Desmoglein 1 (Dsg1) and less commonly Desmoglein 3 (Dsg3). Recently, several cases of pemphigus herpetiformis without anti-Dsg1 or anti-Dsg3 autoantibodies have been reported, and some patients show reactivity against other antigens such as desmocollin (Dsc). In contrast to pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceous, pemphigus herpetiformis is characterized by an intense inflammation that may not be associated with acantholysis. In fact, pemphigus herpetiformis autoantibodies may recognize functionally less important epitopes of Dsg1 or Dsg3, and therefore, do not induce acantholysis. A recent study supports this hypothesis through its discovery of a broader epitope distribution compared to pemphigus vulgaris or pemphigus foliaceous. It is also held that autoantibodies in pemphigus herpetiformis lead to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by keratinocytes, especially interleukin-8. This, in turn, consecutively leads to the recruitment and stimulation of inflammatory cells, resulting in eosinophils and/or neutrophils spongiosis and focal intercellular edema that are responsible for the blistering process.
