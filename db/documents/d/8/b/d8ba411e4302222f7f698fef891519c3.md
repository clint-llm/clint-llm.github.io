Variable expression of PKD 1 and PKD 2 genes causes ADPKD. PKD 1 gene-disease has more severe manifestations than PKD 2 genes. Polycystin 1 and 2 proteins are components of cell membranes of primary cilia of renal tubular epithelial cells.

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate, a cellular second messenger, also induces the proliferation of tubular epithelial cells. Mutations also cause mislocalization of sodium-potassium-activated adenosine triphosphate at the apical membrane of tubular epithelial cells, resulting in secretion of sodium and a gradient formation accounting for fluid secretion and cyst formation. According to Knudson's two-hit hypothesis, all the renal tubular epithelial cells of the patient carry a germline mutation in PKD1 and PKD2. When somatic mutations occur in the normal allele,  a second hit takes place. This leads to the monoclonal proliferation of that cell causes further pathogenesis of the disease.

Intrarenal cysts distort normal renal architecture and function causes continued activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system which leads to hypertension. Liver cysts arise by excessive proliferation and dilatation of biliary ductules, caused by a similar mechanism.

Pathogenesis of ARPKD is characterized by circumferential proliferation of epithelial cells, which predominantly affects collecting ducts in renal tubules.
