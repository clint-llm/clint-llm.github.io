The FDA has approved metoclopramide to treat nausea and vomiting in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (in patients who fail to respond to established therapy) and diabetic gastroparesis by increasing gastric motility.

Metoclopramide is used off-label prophylactically to prevent nausea and vomiting in postoperative patients when nasogastric suction is contraindicated or unavailable. It is particularly useful in this role because it does not cause any concomitant increase in gastric secretions.

Metoclopramide can also be used off-label to treat hyperemesis gravidarum in pregnant patients; still, it should be used cautiously because of the lack of studies on the effects of the drug in pregnant women.
