The mucosa lining the vallecula has the potential to develop a squamous carcinoma, although rarely. While also concerning for metastasis, these tumors are especially concerning due to their potential to obstruct the airway. These tumors can present a difficult challenge for both the airway team and the otolaryngologist who must resect the tumor.

Vallecular cysts are also potential manifestations in this region. The incidence of these cysts is unknown due to the rare nature of this pathology. These are most common in pediatric patients, although they can potentially occur in adulthood. These cysts are most commonly present in infants and they affect both genders equally. They can arise after obstruction of the mucosal ducts.

Infants classically will present with difficulty with feeding, failure to thrive, and potentially respiratory distress. For adults with this condition, difficulty swallowing is the most common presenting complaint. As the cyst or tumor enlarges shortness of breath on exertion can be the primary presenting complaint. Diagnosis of these cysts often includes nasopharyngeal laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy. Treatment requires excision of these cysts is necessary as these cysts will often recur if only drained. Treatment may include marsupialization, excision with a carbon dioxide laser, or coblation. Marsupialization is a procedure where the cyst is opened, and a permanent pouch is formed to allow continuous drainage of the cyst.
