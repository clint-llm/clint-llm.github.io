Enuresis refers to the involuntary loss of urine during sleep that occurs at least twice a week in children older than 5 years of age (or the developmental equivalent) for at least 3 months, and it is the most common urologic complaint in pediatric patients. Primary enuresis is that which occurs in a child who has not been dry for at least 6 months, whereas secondary enuresis is the one that has an onset after a period of nocturnal dryness of at least 6 months. Also, the enuresis is classified as monosymptomatic or non-monosymptomatic, with the latter correlating with daytime incontinence or other lower urinary tract symptoms like urgency. This activity reviews the definition, pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of enuresis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in identifying and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of enuresis. 
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of enuresis.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for enuresis.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance enuresis and improve outcomes.
