Tremor diagnosis is based on a careful clinical examination, neurophysiological studies, and radiological assessment.

A neurological examination will show a unilateral resting, intention, and postural tremor affecting the extremity symmetrically, which is usually greater proximally than distally. It has a high amplitude at resting, which may worsen with intention. The frequency is generally belowÂ 4.5 Hz. Prolong or sustain posture will accentuate the tremor.

The Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale is used to measure tremor severity.
