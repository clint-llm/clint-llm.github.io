Chronic interstitial nephritis in agricultural communities is a complex disease that develops in susceptible individuals working in agriculture. The hypothesized causal factors can be minimized and may be preventable. Therefore, it is critical to have an interprofessional collaboration and multidisciplinary/interprofessional approach that seeks to strengthen health services, workforce training, health technology, medical surveillance, and increase medication supply with international cooperation. As a relatively recently recognized condition, interprofessional communication between clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), specialists, nursing staff, and pharmacists is crucial because some team members may not be familiar with the disease or how to monitor and treat it. Therefore, additional training may be necessary for providers who come onto the case management team, and all members must understand the condition, monitor patient progress, and document their findings and observations so everyone managing the case can have access to current and accurate patient data. This interp[professional approach will help drive better outcomes. [Level 5]
