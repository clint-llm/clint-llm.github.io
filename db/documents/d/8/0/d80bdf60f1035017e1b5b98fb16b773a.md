In bacterial diarrhea, the pathogen attaches to the epithelium and produce toxins that increase the intracellular cyclic-AMP (adenosine monophosphate), a secondary messenger. This ultimately revs up the secretory process in the enterocytes. The toxins may also provoke the release of cytokines responsible for chemotaxis and production of eicosanoids (prostaglandins), worsening the intra-luminal unbalance of water. This excess of water and electrolytes in the intestinal lumen draws more fluid into the lumen, further worsening diarrhea with this osmotic effect.
