1.) Acute myocardial infarction: Myocardial stunning occurs after acute myocardial infarction as evidenced by patients treated with reperfusion therapy who have shown near normal recovery by 2 weeks.

2.) Stable angina: Myocardial stunning can exist in chronic stable angina with coronary artery disease. The LV dysfunction often improves after revascularization, the extent of angina not always being directly proportional to the number of hibernating islands involved.

3.) Unstable angina: Manifested as repetitive episodes of chest pain, pain at rest or effort, or chest pain after MI. The myocardial ischemia can trigger perfusion defects which are present on echocardiography as wall motion abnormalities. Such repeated episodes of myocardial stunning could translate into myocardial hibernation over a period of time; this explains why hibernating myocardium presents more frequently in unstable than in stable angina.

4.) Heart failure with or without severe left LV dysfunction or anomalous coronary artery: There is a proportion of patients with severe LV dysfunction or heart failure with hibernating myocardium. In a large number of these cases, evidence of remodeling of the LV was evident by its spherical shape and an increase in its volume. These parameters have known to decrease after reperfusion in what is termed reverse remodeling of the LV which indicates recovery of some of the hibernating myocardial segments.
