Initial evaluation of undifferentiated fever in stable patients with possible malaria exposure includes a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation panel, blood culture, urinalysis, chest radiograph, and thick and thin blood smears. In patients with altered mental status, when cerebral malaria is suspected, a lactate level, arterial blood gas, and lumbar puncture may also be indicated.

In patients with malaria, complete blood count reveals thrombocytopenia in 60-70% of all cases and varying degrees of anemia in 29% of adults and 78% of children.P. falciparum due to invasion of all aged erythrocytes and capillary and splenic erythrocyte sequestration secondary to decreased flexibility and cytoadherence.P. vivax and P. malariae due to preferential invasion of reticulocytes and older erythrocytes, respectively.

The gold standard for malaria diagnosis is a microscopic evaluation of Giemsa-stained thick and thin smears of a free-flowing venipuncture blood specimen.

- The ring stage in P. falciparum appears as a "purple spot with a thin ring;" in P. vivax as a "purple spot with a deformed body;" in P. ovale as a "ring with a large purple spot;" in P. malariae as a "purple spot with a thick body;" and in P. knowlesi as a "purple spot (or spots) with an amorphous thick ring."

- The trophozoite stage in P. falciparum appears as "a bigger spot [growing] around a smaller spot;" in P. vivax as "a misshapen circle which contains an extended spot;" in P. ovale as "an oval circle (sometimes with small corners) which contains a purple spot with undefined shapes;" in P. malariae as "basket or band-shaped [without a] spot;" and in P. knowlesi as a "purple branched spot."

- The schizont stage in P. falciparum is not established; in P. vivax, it appears as "not defined purple spots inside a circle;" in P. ovale as "more than one spot inside an oval circle (sometimes with small corners);" in P. malariae as "diffuse purple spots around a darker spot;" and in P. knowlesi as "defined purple spots [that are] easy to count."

- The gametocyte stage in P. falciparum appears as "banana [or] sausage-shaped;" in P. vivax as an "extended, big spot;" in P. ovale as a "row of accumulated spots;" in P. malariae as a "big stained spot which almost fills[s] the circle;" and in P. knowlesi as a "big spot which contains small spots."

An initial negative smear does not rule out malaria, as infected erythrocytes may become intravascularly sequestered; if clinical suspicion of malaria is high, smears require repetition in 12 and 24 hours.

Other diagnostic modalities include rapid diagnostic testing (RDT), microhematocrit centrifugation, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RDTs detecting parasitic antigens histidine-rich-protein-2, lactate dehydrogenase, and aldolase are increasingly being utilized to diagnose P. falciparum infection.P. falciparum species only, the inability to quantify parasitic burden, and false-positive results occurring weeks after infection due to persistent blood antigens.
