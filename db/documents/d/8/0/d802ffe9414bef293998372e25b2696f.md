Round hole retinal detachment is often surgically repaired by laser demarcation which promotes adhesion between the neural retinal layers and the retinal pigment epithelium.

In cases of vitreous cloudings, such as steroid hyalosis or vitreoretinal traction where the degradation of the vitreous pulls on the retina, a vitrectomy is a commonly performed procedure. Vitrectomy involves vitreous removal, done through the pars plana of the sclera.
