There is no well-defined epidemiology in regards to arachnoiditis. Since Horsley described it in 1909 as a disease entity, fewer in 1000 case reports exist in the literature. Its true incidence or frequency is hard to determine as it is a rare, difficult-to-diagnose condition with many different terms used in the literature to describe it, such as “chronic spinal meningitis” and “meningitis serosa circumscripta spinalis.” Since the clinical presentation of arachnoiditis ranges from sub-clinical to severe, many of the mild or subclinical cases of arachnoiditis will either never be diagnosed or not reported. Therefore the true frequency of arachnoiditis remains not only unknown but also likely significantly underestimated. It was noted recently, though, that the frequency of lumbar arachnoiditis appears to be increasing due to an increasing amount of lumbar spine surgeries.
