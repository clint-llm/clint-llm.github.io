Most patients with micro prolactinomas have good prognosis and normalize prolactin levels with treatment. These patients can be managed with medical therapy for a prolonged period. The success of the pituitary surgery also depends upon the size of the tumor, the serum prolactin level, and the experience of the neurosurgeon. The success rate of pituitary surgery is related inversely to tumor size and prolactin levels.
