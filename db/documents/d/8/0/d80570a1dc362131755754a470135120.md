Little is understood about the physiology behind MET and how it provides pain relief, but there are three mechanisms commonly thought to contribute. First, post-isometric relaxation appears to be implicated, defined as decreased muscle tonicity after an isometric muscle contraction. Reciprocal inhibition is also suspected in playing a role; via inhibition of the alpha motor neuron, isometric contraction of an agonist muscle leads to decreased muscle tonicity of the antagonist muscle.

Post-isometric relaxation is used more frequently in the osteopathic community, but reciprocal inhibition is primarily used when a muscle is chronically fibrotic and has significant constraints.
