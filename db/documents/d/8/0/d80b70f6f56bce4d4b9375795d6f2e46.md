Abuse and neglect of the child and the elderly are often perpetrated by the parent or caregiver responsible for their care. This can include physical abuse, sexual abuse or exploitation, psychological abuse, neglect or abandonment, and confinement.

Predisposing factors for child abuse and neglect are multifactorial, ranging from socioeconomic stressors to harmful cultural practices all contributing to the various degree of vulnerability among the world child population.

- Poor socioeconomic status: Poverty and unemployment among parents provide an unfortunate premise for abuse. Neglect may be a result of a parent not able to provide basic needs for the child.

- Domestic violence: Parents who abuse their partners have an increased tendency to abuse their children either directly or by indirect emotional trauma from the child constantly witnessing domestic violence.

- Drug and alcohol abuse: Parents who abuse drugs or alcohol are likely to be abusive.

- Unwanted or unplanned pregnancy: Product of unwanted or unplanned pregnancy may suffer abuse or neglect either because the unprepared mother, who also may be a child, is not emotionally ready for the role.

- Gender-based discrimination: In some societies, the female child is even more at risk. They suffer gender-based violence like female genital mutilation, early child marriage, and denial of education.

The following factors predispose the elderly to abuse and neglect:

- Caregiver burnout: Care of the elderly can be burdensome.

- Chronic health challenges: Elderly patients are over-dependent, and the caregiver may not be prepared to provide the needed support.

- The onset of mental and behavioral challenges: The onset of memory loss in diseases like dementia and Alzheimer disease makes the elderly prone to abuse and neglect.
