It is the responsibility of the interprofessional dental team to work together to treat endodontic infections. Dental hygienists often serve as the first line of evaluation during dental prophylaxis treatment and should report to the dentist any significant concerns from the patient. Dentists should also be prudent in endodontic case selection and management. For example, if a patient requires endodontic therapy, and the recommended treatment is severely complex, or the dental practitioner feels complications could arise, the dentist should refer the patient to an endodontist to ensure proper patient management. In addition, if other healthcare professionals note any intra- or extra-oral swelling, a referral or consultation with a dental professional to evaluate for potential endodontic infections would be appropriate. Ensuring proper continuity of care will result in optimal care coordination between health professionals to improve patient outcomes and patient safety and enhance team performance.
