- Contraindications to atomoxetine include allergy to atomoxetine, use of an MAOI within the last 14 days, narrow-angle glaucoma, history of pheochromocytoma, and cardiac disorders, which can not tolerate increases in blood pressure or heart rate.

- Drug Interactions: Because of the potential for interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors (paroxetine, fluoxetine, and quinidine) dose of atomoxetine needs to be adjusted to prevent side effects from a higher concentration of atomoxetine.

- Women of childbearing age should use appropriate contraceptive measures as the adverse effects of atomoxetine have not been investigated thoroughly during pregnancy. Women breastfeeding should exercise caution when taking atomoxetine as it is unknown if atomoxetine is excreted in breast milk.

- Suicidal ideation in adolescents & children: Atomoxetine raised the risk of suicidal ideation in children or adolescents with (ADHD). Placebo-controlled trials of atomoxetine in adolescents & children have shown a greater risk of suicidal ideation earlier during treatment in those receiving atomoxetine than in placebo. Therefore, patients who are started on therapy should be observed closely for suicidality. Clinicians should instruct caregivers on the need for close observation and communication with the clinician. The average risk of suicidal ideation in patients taking atomoxetine capsules was 0.4%.
