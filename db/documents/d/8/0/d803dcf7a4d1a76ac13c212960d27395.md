The dorsal nucleus of CN X originates anterior to the base of the fourth ventricle in the medulla. The dorsal motor nucleus of CN X has general visceral efferent fibers that send parasympathetic signals to the heart and lungs.

Nucleus ambiguus is in the medullary reticular formation. The nerve fibers originating from nucleus ambiguus are efferent special visceral branchiomotor fibers that provide motor innervation for swallowing and phonation.Â  In addition to the vagus nerve, nucleus ambiguus contributes to the efferent portions of the glossopharyngeal and spinal accessory nerves.

Nucleus tractus solitarius is a vertical column of grey matter in the dorsomedial medulla that is transected by a bundle of myelinated nerve fibers known as the solitary tract. Nucleus tractus solitarius receives general visceral afferent information from the chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors of the carotid body and carotid sinus (innervated via the glossopharyngeal nerve) and aortic bodies and sinoatrial node (innervated via the vagus nerve).

The spinal trigeminal nucleus receives input from the pinna of the ear regarding deep touch, pain, and temperature. It also receives sensory information from the dura of the posterior cranial fossa and mucosa of the larynx.
