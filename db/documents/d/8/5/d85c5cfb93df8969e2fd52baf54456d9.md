C. neoformans reproduces by budding and forms round yeast-like cells that are 3 to 6 micrometers in diameter. In the host and culture media, each cell is surrounded by a large polysaccharide capsule that has antiphagocytic properties and may be immunosuppressive. It can form smooth, convex, yellow, or tan colonies on solid media at 20 to 37 degrees C. The non-pathogenic strains do not grow at this temperature.
