- Nursing care should include ongoing monitoring of patient's vital signs and medical apparatus output monitoring, in addition to all routinely indicated monitoring care as is appropriate for the patient's given condition.

- Patients are often initially monitored in the ICU after thoracostomy placement. Other patients may move out to a step-down or ward level of care. In those patients, oxygen saturation levels should be monitored at a minimum of every two hours and preferably continuously.

- Indications to perform a thoracotomy are immediate output from a chest tube of more than 1,500 cc or averaging more than 200 cc for 4 hours. With such high output, there is likely a vascular injury that requires a surgical repair.

- Drain output should be monitored no less than every 8 hours.
