Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited cardiac condition characterized by left ventricular muscular hypertrophy in the absence of other cardiac, systemic, or metabolic conditions. Septal reduction therapy (SRT) effectively reduces LVOT gradients in HCM patients due to LVOT obstruction. SRT can be done by surgical myomectomy or by percutaneous catheter-directed alcohol septal ablation. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment options for HCM patients. It highlights the interprofessional team's role in catheter-directed management of HCM as an alternative option to surgical myomectomy.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the indications of catheter management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
- Review the contraindications of catheter management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
- Describe the equipment needed for catheter management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
- Explain the procedure of catheter management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
