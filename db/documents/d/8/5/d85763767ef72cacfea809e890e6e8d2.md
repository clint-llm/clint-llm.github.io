Albendazole is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to albendazole, benzimidazoles, or any component of the formulation. Clinicians should use the drug with caution in patients with active liver disease or dysfunction because the liver metabolizes the drug via the CYP450 system.

The FDA classified albendazole as a category C drug under the prior pregnancy rating system, which states the drug should be avoided during pregnancy and reserved only for use in pregnant patients if there is not an acceptable alternative available. Studies in rats have shown some teratogenic effects in the offspring of rats that received the drug; however, some studies of pregnant patients that received albendazole did not show an increased risk of teratogenicity with exposure to the drug. More research is necessary as there are very few articles in the literature about the potential effects on pregnancy and the developing fetus.
