**1. General Management**

Symptomatic management is done with diuretics, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) OR angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), systemic anticoagulant therapy (newer direct oral anticoagulant agents or vitamin K antagonist therapy), antihypertensives, and dietary salt restriction. 1/3rd of the patients respond to these conservative measures and another 1/3rd will need one of the following therapies.

**2. Immunosuppressive Therapy**

Ponticelli regimen (6 months):

- Months 1, 3, and 5: Methylprednisolone (1 g) daily for 3 days followed by prednisolone (0.4 mg/kg/day) or prednisone (0.5mg/kg/day) for 27 days.

- Months 2, 4, and 6: Cyclophosphamide orally 2 mg/kg/day for 30 days.

Modified Ponticelli regimen (6 months):

- Months 1, 3, and 5: Methylprednisolone (1 g) daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisone (0.5mg/kg/day) for 27 days.

- Months 2, 4, and 6: Cyclophosphamide orally 2 to 2.5 mg/kg/day for 30 days.

- To be given with appropriate pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and antiviral prophylaxis (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and valganciclovir).

Rituximab:

- Monoclonal antibody to CD20 antigen of B cell.

- Usually a second-line therapy after failure of steroids.

- As first-line therapy or in refractory cases, or after 6 months of conservative management.

- Dose: 375 mg/m^2 intravenously once weekly × 4. The maintenance dose is similar but is given every six months.

Alternate therapy:

- Tacrolimus ( 0.025 to 0.040 mg/kg divided into twice a day ) for six months.

- Cyclosporine (1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg divided into twice a day) +/- 0.15 mg/kg prednisone for six months.

Other drug options are:

- Chlorambucil

- Mycophenolate mofetil

- Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) analogs

The various immunosuppressive treatments come with their inherent adverse effects like increased risk of infections, malignancies, cytopenias, side effects of long-term steroids like cataract, metabolic syndrome, avascular necrosis of joints, etc.

**3. Treat the Specific Cause of Secondary MN**

**4. Management of Progressive Disease**

- In advanced oliguric/ anuric renal injury, renal replacement therapy may be required.

- Patients may need vitamin D and calcium supplementation, especially if treated with steroids.

- Renal transplant for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD Stage 5) or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)
