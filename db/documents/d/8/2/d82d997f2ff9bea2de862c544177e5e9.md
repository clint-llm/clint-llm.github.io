The key to monitoring is establishing protocols for ABI.

An appropriate protocol for nursing monitoring should address the following three questions: Which values should I use? What periods to perform the test? When should I notify someone?  Routine trauma monitoring for injuries such as knee dislocations has been suggested at intervals of every 2 hours. This approach should consist of clinical assessment and determination if ABI is necessary at the same time with every clinical evaluation.  Other options include ABI at specific periods (i.e., a clinical exam every 2 hours and ABI every 4 hours) or only if there is a change in the clinical exam.
