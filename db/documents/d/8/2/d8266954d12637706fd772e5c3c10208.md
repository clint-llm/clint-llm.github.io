The gallbladder wall may be thickened to variable degrees, and there may be adhesions to the serosal surface. In some cases, due to extensive fibrosis, the gallbladder may appear shrunken. Smooth muscle hypertrophy, especially in prolonged chronic conditions, is present. Calcium bilirubinate or cholesterol stones are most often present and can vary in size from sand-like to completely filling the entire gallbladder lumen. They can be multiple or singular. The acalculous disease may reveal sludge or very viscous bile. These findings are usual precursors to gallstones and are formed from increased biliary salts or stasis. Normal appearing bile can also be present. Various species of bacteria can be found in 11% to 30% of the cases. Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses are present or accentuated in 90% of the time in chronic cholecystitis specimens. These are a herniation of intraluminal sinuses from increased pressures possibly associated with ducts of Luschka. The mucosa will exhibit varying degrees of inflammation. T lymphocytes are the common cells followed by plasma cells and histiocytes. Metaplastic changes can be seen. There is usually hypertrophy of the muscularis mucosa with varying degrees of mural fibrosis and elastosis. A variant in which calcium deposition and hyaline fibrosis leads to diffuse thinning of the gallbladder wall is called hyalinizing cholecystitis. The brittle consistency also gives it the name porcelain gallbladder.
