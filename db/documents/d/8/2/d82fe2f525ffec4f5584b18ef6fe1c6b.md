Pregnancy and breastfeeding are absolute contraindications for RAI therapy.

Vomiting and diarrhea are contraindications as radioiodine absorption could be hampered and possess the risk of radiation exposure to others. Inefficiency and noncompliance with following the radiation protection and safety instructions and recommendations are contraindications for therapy. History of intake of interfering medications, the recent history of imaging using iodinated contrast, and incontinence issues should be properly addressed.
