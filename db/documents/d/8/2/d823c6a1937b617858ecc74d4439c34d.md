Salivary gland neoplasms encompass a wide array of different histologies and locations, including the parotid, submandibular gland, sublingual gland, and minor salivary glands of the upper aerodigestive tract. The majority (80%) of these neoplasms are benign but are heterogeneous in their ability to recur and/or transform into malignant lesions.

The most common benign subtypes identified include pleomorphic adenoma (PA), Warthinâ€™s tumor (WT), and myoepithelioma (MYO), followed by rarer histologies including lymphadenoma (LA), sebaceous adenoma (SA), oncocytoma (OC), cystadenoma, sialadenoma papilliferum (SP), ductal papilloma (intraductal and inverted), canalicular adenoma (CA), and basal cell adenoma (BCA).
