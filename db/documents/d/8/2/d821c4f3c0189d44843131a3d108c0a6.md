The anterior pituitary contains special cells having distinct hormonal functions. Somatotrophs produce growth hormones and are acidophilic on light microscopy. Mammosomatotrophs are similar to somatotrophs. ACTH-producing cells are called corticotrophs, which are basophilic cells on staining. These basophils contain complex lysosomes and large vacuoles. The secretory granules vary in shape and size, and their membranes have indentations and evaginations. Adrenocortical hypofunction results in increased demand for ACTH, causing an increase in sparsely granulated basophils. Moreover, the tissue section of adrenals shows an absence of fasciculata or reticularis cells, as well as disorganization of glomerulosa cells in adrenal hypoplasia.
