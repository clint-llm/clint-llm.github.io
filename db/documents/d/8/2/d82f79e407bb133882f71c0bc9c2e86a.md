Due to the complex nature of anterior vaginal prolapse and its progressing effects on women's physical, mental, and sexual health, a multidisciplinary team's involvement is essential. Getting a broad group of specialists engaged in inpatient care provides support and significantly improves management outcomes.

According to the 2019 guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, the multidisciplinary team for women with a vaginal prolapse should include a specialist level doctor with experience in pelvic floor prolapse, a urogynecology specialist, a urogynecology nurse, and a pelvic floor specialist physiotherapist.

Additional members may include a member of the geriatric team, an occupational therapist, and a colorectal surgeon with interest in pelvic floor surgery and expertise in operating in the obturator region in cases of concurrent rectoceles. For some cases, a radiologist with expertise in pelvic floor imaging, a pain team member, and a clinical psychologist might be required.
