Noonan syndrome is a condition that is very similar to Turner syndrome and often can be confusing to distinguish. Noonan syndrome presents with similar clinical characteristics such as a webbed neck, short stature, cardiac, and renal abnormalities. In Noonan syndrome, there is no chromosomal abnormality, unlike in Turner syndrome with the absent or non-functioning X chromosome. Therefore, Noonan syndrome can be seen in both males and females, whereas Turner syndrome is seen only in females. Genetic testing is required to differentiate between these two conditions.
