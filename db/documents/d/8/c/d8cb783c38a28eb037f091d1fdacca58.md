Glatiramer is an immunomodulator used in the treatment and management of multiple sclerosis. Its mechanism is not clearly understood, but it appears to work by altering the immune processes responsible for MS. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, mechanism of action, adverse events, and other key elements of glatiramer therapy and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes for patients with multiple sclerosis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for glatiramer acetate. 
- Describe how to administer glatiramer acetate for patients with multiple sclerosis.
- Outline considerations regarding the use of glatiramer acetate in treating patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. 
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients receiving glatiramer acetate.
