Histologically, lung parenchyma in the sequestered segment displays evidence of lymphocytic inflammation and fibrosis. There can be a presence of cystic air spaces lined by cuboidal or columnar epithelium. There may also be alveoli with emphysema-like hyperinflation.

A granulomatous reaction in response to superimposed infection can sometimes be seen.
