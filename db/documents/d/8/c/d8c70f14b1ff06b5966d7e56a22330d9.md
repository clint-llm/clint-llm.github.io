Once the general practitioner suspects testicular cancer, a referral is made under the suspected cancer pathway for an appointment within two weeks with a urologist. The patients can be seen in one-stop clinics with direct access to testicular ultrasound scanning. A large cohort study involving 1757 patients who attended a one-stop testicular clinic in a University hospital in the UK showed that the median waiting time to be seen was nine days compared to 13 days for general patients. The time from clinic to orchidectomy was five days with the benefits of discovery of subclinical cancers, timely diagnosis, treatment, and on-time reassurance of patients with benign results.

All patients with a strong suspicion of or confirmed case of testicular cancer merit discussion in the local multidisciplinary meeting (MDT) of the hospital. All aspects of a patientâ€™s management are discussed and agreed at the MDT meeting. These include staging investigations, plan for adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, social, psychological care, and follow-up.

The members of the urology cancer MDT include:

- Urologist/lead clinician

- Macmillan clinical nurse specialists

- Radiologist

- Histopathologist

- Palliative care medicine
