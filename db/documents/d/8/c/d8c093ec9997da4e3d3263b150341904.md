Hemoglobin is a tetramer formed from two dimers of alpha and non-alpha chains. Adult hemoglobin (HbA or HbA1) comprised of two alpha and two beta globin chains account for 98% of total hemoglobin. The other type is HbA2, which is made up of two alpha and two delta chains. Another type is fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which is present during pregnancy and up to 6 months postpartum and is made of two alpha and two gamma chains.

The primary underlying pathophysiology in thalassemia is ineffective erythropoiesis. It is characterized by decreased HbA production secondary to decreased beta-globin chain production and maturation arrest due to apoptosis of the erythroid precursors caused by an excess of alpha chain precipitates. Another mechanism that plays an important role is oxidative stress. Normally the balance is maintained between antioxidants like reduced glutathione and reactive oxygen species (ROS), a byproduct of cellular respiration, for maintenance of the physiologic environment. In beta-thalassemia, oxidative stress ensues due to the failure of that balance, which results in damage to the red blood cell (RBC) membrane causing anemia, white blood cells (WBC) causing infections, platelets causing hypercoagulability, and affecting other organs as well.
