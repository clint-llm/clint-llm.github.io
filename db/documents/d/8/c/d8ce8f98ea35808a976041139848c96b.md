This activity describes the development of pulmonary hypertension due to high altitude. We describe a phenomenon known as HAPH (high altitude pulmonary hypertension), which is classically defined as a mean pulmonary arterial pressure greater than or equal to 25 mmHg on a right heart catheterization and results in pulmonary vascular remodeling. This condition can present in individuals who typically reside at altitudes greater than 2500 meters. The hypoxic stimulus of high altitude and individual genetic factors play a role in the pathophysiology of pulmonary vasoconstriction and, eventually, vascular remodeling that occurs with HAPH. This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, clinical evaluation, and treatment of HAPH and highlights the interprofessional team's role in providing well-coordinated care to enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of high altitude pulmonary hypertension. 
- Describe the clinical evaluation of high altitude pulmonary hypertension.
- Outline the management options available for high altitude pulmonary hypertension.
- Summarize the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and understanding of high altitude pulmonary hypertension to improve clinical outcomes.
