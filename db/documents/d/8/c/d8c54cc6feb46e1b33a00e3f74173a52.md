The clinician and other healthcare staff must provide guidance to patients regarding appropriate preputial hygiene; this can be preventative and therapeutic in the majority of balanoposthitis cases. Proper preputial hygiene involves gentle cleaning of the area 2 to 3 times per day. If physiologic phimosis is present, forceful prepuce retraction should be avoided. In patients able to retract the foreskin, the area can be cleaned with gentle use of cotton swab. Avoidance of strong or scented soaps is also a recommendation as they can be irritating. Investigating other possible irritants and providing guidance on how to avoid them can also significantly improve symptoms.
