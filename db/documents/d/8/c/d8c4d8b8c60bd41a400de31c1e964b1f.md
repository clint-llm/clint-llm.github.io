In patients on hemodialysis, Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) has shown increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality with calcium level greater than 10 mg/dL, phosphorus level greater than 7 mg/dL, and PTH level greater than 600 pg/ml.

Evaluation of Cinacalcet Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Outcomes (EVOLVE) study is the largest, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in dialysis patients with SHPT. This study showed that cinacalcet therapy did not offer survival benefit or improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients on hemodialysis.

In the ADVANCE study, cinacalcet with low dose vitamin D analogs as compared to flexible vitamin D dosing showed a positive trend in decreasing vascular calcification, although the study was inconclusive.

OPTIMA study is a multicenter, open-label study that looked into cinacalcet based treatment algorithms being compared with conventional therapy in dialysis patients showed an increase in the achievement of KDOQI targets.

Observational studies have shown that parathyroidectomy is beneficial in dialysis patients as it can lead to normalization of calcium and phosphorus, reduced fracture rate, improved health-related quality of life, and decreased all-cause mortality.
