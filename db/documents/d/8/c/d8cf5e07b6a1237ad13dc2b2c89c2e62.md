The Weber test is used by multiple health professionals operating as an interprofessional team, includingÂ primary care providers, physician associates (PAs) and nurse practitioners (NPs), otorhinolaryngologists, neurologists, internists, and chiropractors, to evaluate the patient's hearing. The test is almost always used along with the Rinne test to differentiate between conductive hearing loss from a sensorineural hearing loss. This will guide the clinician to the need for further examination, investigation, and management. Also, the Weber and Rinne tuning fork tests can be used to confirm audiometric findings, particularly when the audiogram is inconsistent with clinical findings. In assessing a patient with bilateral conductive hearing loss, the Weber test is a quick and useful test for the otorhinolaryngologist to help determine which side of the ear to operate on first. Usually, the ear with the more significant conductive hearing loss is preferred.

All interprofessional team members need to accurately record their examination findings, including Weber test results, so that all team members can access accurate, updated patient information to guide their decision-making, leading to improved patient care and outcomes.
