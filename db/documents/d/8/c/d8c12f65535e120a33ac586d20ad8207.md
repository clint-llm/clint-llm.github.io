Epistaxis (nosebleed) is one of the most common ear, nose, and throat (ENT) emergencies that present to the emergency room or primary care. There are two types of nosebleeds: anterior (more common), and posterior (less common, but more likely to require medical attention). The source of 90% of anterior nosebleeds lies within Kiesselbach's plexus (also known as Little's area) on the anterior nasal septum. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of epistaxis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Recall the causes of epistaxis.
- Describe the common anatomic locations of epistaxis.
- Summarize the treatment options for epistaxis.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by epistaxis.
