Asymptomatic patients with WPW pattern do not require any immediate treatment. It may be beneficial for them to undergo evaluation by a cardiologist or electrophysiologist to try to determine the risk of the patient developing a tachyarrhythmia. Patients deemed to be at high risk may benefit from preventative antiarrhythmic medications or prophylactic accessory pathway ablation depending on their level of risk, the type and characteristics of the pathway, their cardiac comorbidities, and other medical conditions. In these cases, the risk of developing a dangerous arrhythmia must be weighed against the benefits and risks of medications and invasive interventions.

In general, patients with asymptomatic WPW pattern are considered at low-risk of a cardiac arrest. Those patients who have had a cardiac arrest usually almost always experience preceding tachycardia related symptoms. Thus, most asymptomatic patients may be managed by reassurance and close watchful clinical monitoring. Patients may be advised to notify their clinician urgently in case of rapid palpitations or syncope. Alternatively, an additional risk stratification strategy may be utilized.  Risk stratification of asymptomatic WPW pattern may be performed either invasively or by non-invasive means. Neither risk-stratification scheme is 100% perfect due to some false positives or false negatives. Non-invasive evaluation is usually a preferred initial modality. Patients can undergo exercise treadmill testing, ambulatory ECG monitoring, or sodium channel blocker challenge.  The presence of an abrupt and clear loss of preexcitation at faster sinus rates on electrocardiogram suggests a weak or low-risk pathway. These pathways thus are unlikely to result in life-threatening ventricular rates during AF. They can usually be managed with watchful monitoring alone without subjecting them to an invasive EP study. On the other hand, if preexcitation persists at faster heart rates during exercise testing, or is persistent during the entire ambulatory monitoring period, then it may suggest that an invasive evaluation may be further needed. However, it does not necessarily mean that the pathway is "high-risk."

The 2015 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines indicate that in asymptomatic patients with WPW pattern, EP study is reasonable, and ablation is reasonable for accessory pathways found to be either at high risk or in patients with high-risk occupations.

Treatment of patients who have demonstrated WPW syndrome can be broken down into two categories. Patients presenting with an acute tachyarrhythmia and patients with known WPW pattern and prior symptomatic episodes but currently without an arrhythmia or symptoms. This second group of patients is similar to patients with known WPW pattern only as they do not require immediate treatment. They differ because they have proven that their accessory pathway is capable of initiating and maintaining or conducting an arrhythmia. This places them at a higher risk of recurrent arrhythmias, and they should be evaluated and treated. The treatment of choice for symptomatic patients is an accessory pathway catheter ablation. This is commonly done by radiofrequency current ablation, but cryoablation can also be utilized.

A patient with known WPW pattern on baseline ECG or prior episode of WPW syndrome-related tachyarrhythmia who presents with an acute tachyarrhythmia will require acute medical management. The patient who presents with an acute tachyarrhythmia can be managed following the "2010 American Heart Association guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care" The first step in this algorithm is determining if the patient has a pulse. If no pulse is identified, CPR should be initiated, and the patient should be managed using the Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) Cardiac Arrest Algorithm. If a pulse is Identified, then management can proceed using the ACLS Tachycardia Algorithm.

According to the ACLS tachycardia algorithm, patients with persisting tachyarrhythmia who are deemed hemodynamically unstable as determined by identification of hypotension, acutely altered mental status, signs of shock, ischemic chest discomfort, or acute heart failure should undergo synchronized cardioversion or defibrillation. A trial of adenosine may be considered for a regular narrow complex tachycardia.

Pharmacological treatment of a hemodynamically stable acute tachyarrhythmia suspected to involve an accessory pathway must be based on the type of arrhythmia and accessory pathway present as certain pharmacological treatments may be detrimental or even fatal. Pathways that are not involved in the initiation and maintenance of an arrhythmia leading to AVRT will conduct an arrhythmia generated elsewhere in the heart. In the setting of an accessory pathway capable of rapid antegrade conduction, rapid atrial arrhythmias can be conducted to the ventricle inducing rapid ventricular rates that may deteriorate into ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. AV nodal blockade can induce this scenario if given in the setting of a bystander accessory pathway and rapid atrial rhythm, as seen in atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or other atrial tachycardias. These arrhythmias will be wide complex tachycardia and may be regular or irregular, depending on the underlying arrhythmia. Without electrophysiologic study, antidromic AVRT will be difficult to diagnose definitively and should, therefore, be managed similarly with avoidance of nodal blocking agents. The pharmacologic treatment of choice for antidromic AVRT is procainamide. In the setting of preexcitation and atrial fibrillation, AV nodal blockade is contraindicated. Procainamide and ibutilide are agents of choice in atrial fibrillation with preexcitation on ECG. Amiodarone has been used in WPW pattern with atrial fibrillation, but some evidence suggests that it is less effective and has a higher risk of precipitating ventricular fibrillation. If there remains any doubt about the diagnosis of a wide complex tachycardia, it is recommended that it be managed as suspected ventricular tachycardia.

Patients with WPW pattern on ECG who present with hemodynamically stability, orthodromic AVRT will demonstrate a regular narrow complex tachycardia. They can be managed similarly to other regular narrow complex supraventricular tachycardias. Vagal maneuvers followed by a trial of adenosine are the first-line therapy. The 2015 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines recommend beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers as the second-line agents with electric cardioversion being reserved for refractory arrhythmias. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis of orthodromic AVRT or in the setting of aberrant conduction leading to a wide complex appearance, caution should be used with nodal blocking agents. Managing as an undifferentiated wide complex tachycardia may be prudent.
