Postoperative management in Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome is synonymous with postoperative management for retinal detachment repair and includes close IOP monitoring. Following surgical treatment, topical steroids, prophylactic antibiotics, and cycloplegics are often prescribed to prevent further inflammation and infection. Any worsening vision, ocular pain, headache, nausea, or vomiting could suggest rising IOP and needs to be evaluated urgently.
