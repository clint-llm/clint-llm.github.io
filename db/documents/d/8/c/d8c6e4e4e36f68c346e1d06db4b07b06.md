Prevalence data on Wernicke encephalopathy comes mainly from autopsy studies with rates ranging between 1% and 3%. Several studies indicate that prevalence rates via analysis of clinical records are lower in comparison to necropsy studies as the diagnosis is easily overlooked or missed. The incidence of Wernicke encephalopathy is believed to be higher in developing countries due to vitamin deficiencies and malnutrition. The female to male ratio for Wernicke encephalopathy is 1:1.7, and there are no studies that show a particular race predisposed to Wernicke encephalopathy.
