Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is classified as paraneoplastic or non-paraneoplastic, also referred to as non-tumor Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (NT-LEMS). NT- LEMS occurs in the absence of malignancy. Sixty percent of patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome have an underlying tumor. Paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is typically associated with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Other malignancies that have been associated with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome include non-small cell and mixed lung carcinoma, prostate cancer, thymoma and lymphoproliferative disorders. Studies have indicated that the diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome can precede a diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, ranging from up to 5 to 6 years. History of smoking is also considered a risk factor. The genetic association with HLA–B8–DR 3 haplotype is present in about 65% of young patients with NT–L EMS.
