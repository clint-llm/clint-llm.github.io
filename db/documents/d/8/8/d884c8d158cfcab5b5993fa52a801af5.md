Testicular cancer is the most common solid tumor between the ages of 20 to 35 years. Testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs) are by far the most common malignant group of tumors arising in the testis (95%), mainly represented by seminoma. Non-seminomatous histotypes (embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, teratoma) are less common, more aggressive in behavior, and can be pure or mixed.

Testicular teratoma can be found in children and young adults (20 to 35 is the most common age group, as stated previously). In children, it usually occurs in the first 2 years of life (mean age 20 months), representing the second most common GCT histotype after yolk sac tumor. It is rare in young adults as a pure form but is commonly encountered in a mixed form with other GCT histotypes.

Of all testicular cancer, nearly 90% present with locoregional disease. In general, testicular cancer is a highly curable disease with a 5-year survival rate of 95% (based on SEER 2010–2016), but data change when histotype-specific survival is taken into account. The presence of teratoma is associated with a higher cumulative incidence of disease-related death.
