In lesions with thrombus burden, atherectomy can result in distal embolization. Moreover, thrombi usually overlie unstable or ruptured plaques, which can dissect or perforate upon using these techniques. Spontaneous coronary artery dissections or those created by attempts at angioplasty can propagate further with rotational atherectomy. The presence of severe tortuosity may make it difficult to get the equipment close to the lesion, and the spinning burr may increase the chance of vessel rupture. Lack of available cardiac surgery or patient ineligibility for coronary artery bypass graft surgery are both relative contraindications.
