The procedure is most commonly performed for patients suffering from debilitating, end-stage arthritic conditions of the knee. Once considered a procedure limited to the elderly, low-demand patients, TKA is becoming an increasingly popular procedure performed in younger patient populations. Between 1991 and 2010, the annual primary TKA volume in the US Medicare population alone increased by 161.5%, from more than 93,000 to more than 226,000 cases.
