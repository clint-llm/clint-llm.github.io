Pancuronium administration is by intravenous bolus. A continuous IV infusion may be a consideration in the management of the critically ill patient.

The typical intubating dose is 0.1 mg/kg with a 3 to 5-minute onset to maximal muscle relaxation. The 95% effective dose is 0.07 mg/kg. The drug has a 60- to 90-minute duration of action (return to 25% of control twitches) with a typical intubating dose. Maintenance of neuromuscular blockade is possible with a dose of 0.02 mg/kg, titrated to the level of blockade.

Typical infusion dosing may range from 0.7 to 2 mcg/kg/min.
