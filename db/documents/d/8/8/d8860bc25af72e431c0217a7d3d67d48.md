A review of 49 patients undergoing endovascular repair of descending thoracic aneurysm and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms facilitated by continuous intraoperative motor/somatosensory-evoked potential (MEP/SEP), cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and use of iliofemoral conduits allowed for early prediction and management of SCI.

Laboratory Evaluation

Laboratory examinations are can differ depending on the clinical presentation they can include copper, zinc, vitamin B12, Lyme disease serology, varicella-zoster viral serology, HIV serology, syphilis serology, human T-lymphotropic virus 1 serology, antinuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, angiotensin-converting enzyme, aquaporin-4-IgG, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, hypercoagulable profile, and paraneoplastic autoantibody assessment.

CSF Analysis

Lumbar punctures are performed in certain SCI cases. CSF analysis includes red blood cell count, white blood cell count and differential, protein, and glucose. Further analysis may be comprised of IgG index, cytology, flow cytometry, gram stain, oligoclonal bands, bacterial culture, Lyme disease serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cryptococcal antigen, paraneoplastic autoantibodies, venereal diseases, varicella-zoster virus PCR, Epstein-Barr virus PCR, enterovirus PCR, cytomegalovirus PCR, mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR, and cultures.

Neuroimaging

While radiography can be equivocal in certain cases, it remains to be a fundamental aspect of SCI diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5 Tesla (T) including sagittal and axial T1 and T2-weighted sequences and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with contrast are often employed to identify and localize SCI.

Additional Diagnostic Evaluations

Additional examinations that can confirm SCI and rule out other etiologies include magnetic resonance angiography, computed tomography angiography, full spinal magnetic resonance angiography, thoracoabdominal computed tomography angiography, digital subtraction angiography and electromyography (EMG).
