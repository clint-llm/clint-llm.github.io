The mean duration of hospitalization in pediatric patients without tracheostomy ranges from three to twelve days. Most children recover without debilitating sequelae, with the tracheal mucosa fully healing without permanent damage.

In regards to pediatric tracheostomy-dependent patients, one multicenter retrospective cohort study evaluating over 4000 pediatric patients revealed a median length of stay of 4 days with an interquartile range of three to eight days, with a 30-day revisit rate of 24.9%.
