In the neck, the facial artery starts deep to the platysma and quickly becomes superficial.  The facial artery traverses superior to the stylopharyngeus, styloglossus, and hyoglossus muscles. It travels along the inferior surface of the posterior belly of the digastric and stylohyoid muscles. The artery then enters a groove on the posterior surface of the submandibular gland and follows an upward trajectory over the body of the mandible as it courses along the anteroinferior border of the masseter.  On the face, the facial artery remains superficial to the buccinator and levator anguli oris muscles.
