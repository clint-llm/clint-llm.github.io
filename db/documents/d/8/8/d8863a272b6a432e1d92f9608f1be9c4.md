Ocrelizumab is FDA-approved for intravenous infusion. It is supplied in 300 mg/mL single-dose vials. The initial dose is given as a 300 mg intravenous infusion over 2.5 hours, followed up with an additional 300 mg intravenous infusion 14 days later. Subsequent doses are given every six months as a 600 mg intravenous infusion over 3.5 hours.Â  Maintenance doses of ocrelizumab should be at a minimum of five months apart. Some argue that dosing should not be on a fixed schedule but based on CD19/20 counts to optimize dosing to minimize unnecessary patient exposure and allow for significant cost savings.
