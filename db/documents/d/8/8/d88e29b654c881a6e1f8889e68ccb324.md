- **Septic arthritis:**Acute purulent arthritis due to other bacteria may present similarly. They may be distinguished from gonococcal arthritis through microbiologic identification from synovial fluid culture.

- **Poststreptococcal arthritis:**Acute rheumatic arthritis may present with both polyarthritis and rash. The rash, however, is transient and is typically not vesicular or pustular.

- **Crystal arthropathy:**This may also present as mono- or oligo-arthritis and may be distinguished through synovial fluid analysis.

- **Other inflammatory arthritis:**Rheumatoid arthritis, reactive arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis may be mistaken for gonococcal arthritis, but these disease entities are usually associated with other clinical or radiologic manifestations not seen in disseminated gonococcal infection.

- Several other infections such as Lyme disease, infective endocarditis, and certain viruses may also present with some form of joint involvement.
