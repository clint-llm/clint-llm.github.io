For the diagnosis of the double-chambered right ventricle, a high index of suspicionÂ is necessary from the primary clinician, cardiologist, and cardiothoracic surgeon. It should always receive a thorough preoperative evaluation. Encouraging surgery when appropriate is important, but patients may refuse. If and when they refuse, alternative options that are not curative but can provide symptomatic relief and reduce future hospitalizations are available and should be offered as well. These should have outpatient follow up with their primary care clinician and a cardiologist to monitor them.

Nursing will play a critical role in the management of this condition, primarily by preparing the patient for surgery, monitoring vitals, and assisting during surgery, and administering postoperative care, reporting to the surgeon, or managing clinician any concerns that may arise. Only with this type of strong interprofessional team dynamic can patients with a double-chambered right ventricle achieve optimal outcomes. [Level 5]
