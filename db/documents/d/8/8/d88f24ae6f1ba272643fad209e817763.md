The intricacy of the coronary venous system highlights both the complexity and beauty of the human heart's anatomical features. As biomedical scienceÂ and technology advance, coronary veins have gained significant clinical importance for treatment and intervention for cardiac patients globally. Coronary veins are responsible for draining deoxygenated blood from the myocardium into the cardiac chambers. Comprised of two venous systems, coronary veins classify into either the greater cardiac venous system or the smaller cardiac venous system. The greater cardiac venous system drains the majority of the deoxygenated blood, while the smaller cardiac venous system drains a smaller portion of the deoxygenated blood to its respective heart chambers. Physiological variability of coronary veins also exists among a diverse patient population. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the anatomy of the coronary venous vasculature is thus vital to enhance clinical knowledge and aid informed physician decision-making for future cardiovascular patients.
