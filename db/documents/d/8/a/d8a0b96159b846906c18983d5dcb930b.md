Patients with acute bronchitis present with a productive cough, malaise, difficulty breathing, and wheezing. Usually, their cough is the predominant complaint and the sputum is clear or yellowish, although sometimes it can be purulent. Purulent sputum does not correlate with bacterial infection or antibiotic use.

On physical exam, lung auscultation may be significant for wheezing; pneumonia should be suspected when rales, rhonchi, or egophony are appreciated. Tachycardia can be present reflecting fever as well as dehydration secondary to the viral illness. The rest of the systems are typically within normal limits.
