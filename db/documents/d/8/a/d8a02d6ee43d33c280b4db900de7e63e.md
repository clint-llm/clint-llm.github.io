The frequency of acute pancreatitis is rising in the United States and the rest of the world. Whether this trend is related to an actual increase in incidence or increased detection, the rise is partly due to increased metabolic syndrome and hypertriglyceridemia. Multiple reports are showing an increase in acute pancreatitis secondary to hypertriglyceridemia. The mortality rate is decreasing in the United States despite the increased incidence, with an approximately 2% mortality rate cited by most recent studies.Â The peak incidence of acute pancreatitis is in the fifth and sixth decades; however, there is an increase in mortality with age.

It is thought that the difference in incidence is due to geographic region and socio-economic strata. It is most likely due to differences in the use of alcohol and the occurrence of biliary calculi, which are the two major causes of acute pancreatitis. In the United States, population incidence has been cited as 600 to 700 per 100,000 people, with 200,000 to 250,000 discharges occurring yearly for acute pancreatitis.
