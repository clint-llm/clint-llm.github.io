The prognosis of PDB is dependent upon the initial presentation of the disease and the presence of an underlying invasive ductal carcinoma or axillary node metastases. If PDB presents initially with a palpable mass, it is usually associated with more advanced disease than cases without a palpable mass.Â When breast mass is not palpable, 92% of patients survive five years after excision; 82% survive ten years. When breast mass is palpable, 38% survive five years; 22% survive ten years. Prognosis is worse when there is lymphadenopathy.
