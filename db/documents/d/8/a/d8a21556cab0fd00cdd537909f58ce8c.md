The role of the interprofessional team is vital to successful quality improvement projects in which the Six Sigma methodology is used. Clinicians, nursing staff, allied health, and other interprofessional healthcare team members must be included in the Six Sigma initiatives and team goals set.

One outcome of a comprehensively planned Six Sigma project should be to foster the collaboration of multidisciplinary teams in the healthcare facility. Strong interprofessional relationships and knowledge of Six Sigma among team members would allow for better communication, enhanced patient care, and better analysis of the root causes of the problem, ultimately resulting in better solutions and outcomes.

Research to detail the current organizational dynamic and flow, an assessment of what is successful within the organization, and an analysis of where improvements can and should be made determine the scope and steps of the quality improvement project. Part of the initiative's success is the involvement of the interprofessional team during the define phase of DMAIC. Hence, the entire system is assessed, and better decisions can be made regarding which interventions should be prioritized.

Various team members are critical in the subsequent steps after the projects have been defined, such as in the evidence-based planning and development of the initiatives. Specific outcomes of Six Sigma projects can be accomplished through benchmarking and setting distinct goals. Reasonable timeframes should be set to achieve the specified goals. Overall, part of the success of healthcare Six Sigma projects has been in studying the dynamics and interactions between interprofessional teams as team members work on interventions that have been shown to improve patient outcomes and care.
