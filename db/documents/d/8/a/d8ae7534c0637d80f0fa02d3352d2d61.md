When a patient develops VFS, the intravenous antibiotic infusion should be stopped immediately. Supportive care should be provided. H1 (diphenhydramine) and H2 antihistamines (cimetidine) are used in the management of VFS. Future doses of vancomycin may be given at decreased infusion rates in most cases.

Mild cases (mild flushing and mild pruritus) can be managed with antihistamines such as diphenhydramine 50 mg by mouth or intravenously and cimetidine 300 mg intravenously. Most episodes will resolve within 20 minutes, and the vancomycin may be restarted at 50% of the original rate. Future doses should be given at the new, slower rate, typically over two hours.

Moderate to severe cases (severe rash, hypotension, tachycardia, chest pain, back pain, muscle spasms, weakness, angioedema) should be managed according to severity. Patients with severe symptoms should be evaluated for anaphylaxis or other serious cause for their symptoms before assuming vancomycin flushing syndrome (VFS). If, after careful evaluation, the patient is determined to have VFS, antihistamines such as diphenhydramine and cimetidine can both be started intravenously. Normal saline intravenous boluses are used to treat hypotension. After the symptoms resolve, the vancomycin can be restarted and given over four hours. If alternative antibiotics to vancomycin are available, they should be used. If vancomycin must be continued, patients should be premedicated with diphenhydramine 50 mg intravenously and cimetidine 300 mg intravenously 1 hour before each dose, and vancomycin should be administered over four hours under close observation.

If the symptoms of anaphylaxis are present, such as altered mental status, hypotension, stridor, difficulty breathing, wheezing, and hives, treatment should be started immediately for anaphylaxis and the patient needs emergency care. Epinephrine should be given early, and the patient may have an epinephrine auto-injector with them, which can be used.

Patients requiring a rapid infusion of vancomycin may be pre-treated with diphenhydramine and cimetidine. However, the best preventive measure to avoid VFS is maintaining infusion rates below 10 mg/min.
