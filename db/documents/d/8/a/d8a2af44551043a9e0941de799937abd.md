The pelvic anatomy divides into three compartments: anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior compartment contains the bladder and urethra. The vagina and uterus are within the middle compartment. Finally, the posterior compartment contains the sigmoid colon, rectum, and anal canal.

The pelvic muscles, ligaments, and fascia prevent prolapse of the pelvic organs in each compartment. The most crucial pelvic fascia is endopelvic fascia, and it supports the uterus and vagina. Endopelvic fascia is composed of the uterosacral ligament, parametrium, and paracolpium. Pubocervical fascia is between the anterior vaginal wall and pubis; it supports the bladder. Lastly, the rectovaginal fascia supports the rectum. It situates between the posterior vaginal wall and rectum. The primary supporting pelvic muscles include iliococcygeal, pubococcygeal, and puborectal muscles. These are clearly visible on the pelvic MRI. On the other hand, the pelvic ligaments and fascia are less well appreciated on the MRI, but their dysfunctions can be inferred from the prolapse of pelvic organs in each compartment. In healthy patients, the pelvic muscles, ligaments, and fascia prevent the prolapse of pelvic organs and keep the rectum, vagina, and urethra elevated near the pubic symphysis.
