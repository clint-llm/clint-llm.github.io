There are many challenges in researching the role of simulation and quality improvement. Those involved in the simulation are a heterogeneous group and may have quite variable outcomes depending on the participants, the setting, and the scenario.

Simulation can be viewed as a tool in the greater quality improvement process. Simulation activities are an opportunity to work on communication and team factors. Simulation also can be used to streamline protocols or processes without involving patients. Multidisciplinary simulation exercises in the practice setting can be used to identify latent threats and improve readiness. Finally, there is growing evidence that simulation may be a tool that improves patient outcomes, the ultimate measure of quality. In the future, simulation should be thoughtfully integrated into quality assessments and systems improvements to achieve the highest possible standards for patient care.
