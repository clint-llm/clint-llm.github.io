Patients with pernicious anemia are at an increased risk of gastric cancer. An international meta-analysis of over 22,000 patients with pernicious anemia found a pooled gastric cancer incidence of 0.27% per person-year. The same study showed a pooled gastric cancer recurrence rate of 6.8.

A large United States population study based on a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Medicare database found an increased risk of 10 cancer types. The authors state, “The most striking of our findings was an 11-fold increase in the risk of gastric carcinoid tumors for both men and women with pernicious anemia, a risk that was higher among cases occurring 6 or more years after the pernicious anemia report/diagnosis.” They also point out these are uncommon cancers with low absolute risk: “Of the 17,076 cancers in our study among people with pernicious anemia, just 83 (0.5%) were gastric carcinoid tumors.”

**Management Guidelines**

British Society of Gastroenterology (2019): "We suggest that a baseline endoscopy with biopsies should be considered in individuals aged ≥50 years, with laboratory evidence of pernicious anemia, defined by vitamin B12 deficiency and either positive gastric parietal cell or intrinsic factor antibodies. As gastric adenocarcinoma affects the corpus in pernicious anemia, biopsies should be taken from the greater and lesser curves (evidence level: low quality; grade of recommendation: weak; level of agreement: 93%)."

European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE), European Helicobacter and Microbiota Study Group (EHMSG), European Society of Pathology (ESP), and Sociedade Portuguesa de Endoscopia Digestiva (SPED) (2019): "Patients with autoimmune gastritis (includes those with pernicious anemia) may benefit from endoscopic follow-up every 3 to 5 years. Low-quality evidence, weak recommendation (82% agree [76% strongly or moderately agree])."

American Gastroenterological Association (2021): "Providers should recognize pernicious anemia as a late-stage manifestation of autoimmune gastritis that is characterized by vitamin B-12 deficiency and macrocytic anemia. Patients with a new diagnosis of pernicious anemia who have not had a recent endoscopy should undergo endoscopy with topographical biopsies to confirm corpus-predominant atrophic gastritis for risk stratification and to rule out prevalent gastric neoplasia, including neuroendocrine tumors."
