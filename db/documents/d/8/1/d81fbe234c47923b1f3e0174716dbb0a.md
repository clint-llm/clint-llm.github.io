Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis will show an accumulation of eosinophils, mast cells, and proliferation of fibroblasts. Biochemical stains will reveal the presence of proteases, chymase, and tryptase. The substantia propria is thickened due to collagen deposition. Both T and B lymphocytes are present, which release IgE and IgG. The overall picture resembles both type 1 and type IV hypersensitivity reactions.

Atopic keratoconjunctivitis will also show a slight increase in eosinophils and mast cells. Tears will contain high levels of IgE. The picture resembles Type 1 hypersensitivity.

Giant papillary conjunctivitis will reveal infiltration of many white cell types, including plasma cells, mast cells, lymphocytes, basophils, and eosinophils. Elevated levels of IgE are found in tears.
