Management of diabetes mellitus type 2 is an interprofessional process with the patient at the center of care.

All treatment should consider the patients' preferences, and patients should always be well informed and encouraged to make their own decisions about their care.

Patient education is key to the management of diabetes mellitus type 2, and it is the healthcare professional's responsibility to ensure all guidance is evidence-based, goal-oriented, and suitably informative.

Evidence has suggested that educating patients on the self-management of their diabetes leads to improved clinical outcomes, as does input from specialists outside of the medical team, including but not limited to dieticians and occupational therapists. Information regarding possible drug-drug interactions, dosing alterations, and organ failure prevention is provided by specialists.

Research suggests there may be benefits in switching to repaglinide from other antihyperglycemic agents in the elderly. Pharmacists and specialists shouldÂ be trained in providing adequate education, risks versus benefits, and support clinicians (MDs) DOs, NPs, PAs) in making this transition. The interprofessional approach will yield improved patient results with targeted medication management and reduce adverse events.
