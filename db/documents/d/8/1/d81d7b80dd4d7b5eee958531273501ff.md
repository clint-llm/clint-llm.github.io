One study from Tawain reviewed three Tawainese medical centers and divided patients into a mild/moderate or severeÂ encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis category. Severe EPS included signs and symptoms of intractable obstruction, gut ischemia, sepsis, and those that needed surgical intervention. They found that the overall mortality rate of EPS was 35% and 74% in patients in the severe EPS group.
