Healthcare workers, including nurse practitioners and clinicians, need to be aware that papular acrodermatitis of childhood is a benign viral-induced skin disorder. It is often confused with other skin infections of childhood. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist. Papular acrodermatitis of childhood is not person-to-person transmissible and does not require isolation beyond standard precautions or restrictions from school or other community activities. However, the associated viral infection may be contagious; thus, isolation may need to be considered based on other symptoms suggestive of infectious disease. The dermatologist and dermatologist nurse specialist should provide a team effort to educate patients and their families about the disease and the necessary precautions. [Level 5]
