For treated Tarlov cysts, symptom relief is generally good and does not appear to significantly differ initially between surgical treatment over percutaneous treatment. However, the recurrence rates are lower in surgically treated cysts compared to percutaneously treated cysts (8% over 20%). This may be limited by the length of follow-up as surgically managed patients are, on average, followed up for longer compared to percutaneously treated ones (38 months vs. 15 months).

In terms of symptom relief, it is reported that 81% of patients treated surgically remain symptom-free at one year, similar to the cyst being completely or substantially reduced in size (79%).
