Neutropenic fever is the most common and serious complication associated with hematopoietic cancers or with patients receiving chemotherapeutic regimens for cancer. Neutropenic fever occurs when a neutropenic patient encounters an infectious pathogen. Patients lose or have weakened immunity to fend off infections in this immunocompromised state. The host barriers, such as the mucosal lining of the GI tract or sinuses, may be damaged, leading the host open to invasion from an infectious pathogen.
