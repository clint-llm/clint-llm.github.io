Clinically significant ITP presents in both childhood and adulthood, making it a familiar diagnosis for all clinicians providing pediatric and adult care. While the pediatrician or primary care provider may be the first to discover the initial rash with an associated hematologic abnormality, coordination with an interprofessional team comprising hematologists, pathologists, pharmacists, and nurses familiar with ITP is necessary for optimal diagnosis and management. Care plans may include education on the diagnosis of ITP, bleeding risks associated with the disease, and proper treatment. Pharmacists should review the patient's prior medications (if any), coordinate with the prescribing clinician regarding the possible treatments for ITP, perform medication reconciliation, and communicate any concerns that may arise. Nurses will coordinate activities between specialists, serve as liaisons/contact points, and assist in patient counseling. Accurate and updated records are also a means of communication between various care team members. In addition, many patients and caregivers must undergo education to avoid certain sports and activities associated with an increased bleeding risk and medications, including aspirin and NSAIDS, to avoid further decreasing platelet counts. This interprofessional model will help drive optimal patient care. [Level 5]
