Pacemakers and defibrillators are often compatible with spinal cord stimulator implants. However, a history of a prior pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator requires the approval of stimulator implantation by a cardiologist before the procedure. Having either a pacemaker or defibrillator remains a relative contraindication to the implant. Both devices require close follow up following stimulator implants.
