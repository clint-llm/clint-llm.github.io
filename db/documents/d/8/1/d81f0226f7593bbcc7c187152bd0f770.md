The alcoholic liver disease covers a spectrum of disorders beginning from the fatty liver, progressing at times to alcoholic hepatitis and culminating in alcoholic cirrhosis, which is the most advanced and irreversible form of liver injury related to the consumption of alcohol.

There are three histologic stages of alcoholic liver disease****

- **Alcoholic Fatty Liver or Steatosis -**At this stage, fat accumulates in the liver parenchyma.

- **Alcoholic Hepatitis -**Inflammation of liver cells takes place at this stage, and the outcome depends on the severity of the damage. Alcohol abstinence, nutritional support, treatment of infection, and prednisolone therapy in severe cases can help in the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis, but more severe cases lead to liver failure.

- **Alcoholic Cirrhosis -**Liver damage at this stage is irreversible and leads to complications of cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
