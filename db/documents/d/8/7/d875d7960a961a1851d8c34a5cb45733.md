Yvette Roke et al. (2012), in a retrospective observational study, reported lower lumbar spine bone density in antipsychotic-treated boys (n = 56) with hyperprolactinemia compared to the non-antipsychotics treated control (n = 47), with a mean duration of 52 months antipsychotics exposure.

Calarge et al. (2010) have reported a significant reduction in BMD in adolescents with risperidone and SSRI combination induced hyperprolactinemia compared to controls with risperidone exposure only. A three-year cross-sectional retrospective observational study (n = 108 boys, mean age = 11.7 years) was enrolled with DSM-IV clinical diagnoses.

In a retrospective observational study, Al-Omran et al. (2016) found that over 80% of adult psychiatric patients on chronic antipsychotic have low bone mineral density, and 44% of patients were osteoporotic, and 45% were osteopenic.
