There are eight enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of heme, and in cells, the first and last three steps of the pathway occur in the mitochondria while the rest occur in the cytosol. The production and metabolization of uroporphyrinogen III take place in the cytosol.

Uroporphyrinogen III is one of the intermediates in the 8 step biosynthesis of heme. It forms from the linear compound hydroxymethylbilane, also called preuroporphyrinogen, by the cytosolic enzyme uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS). The newly cyclized compound is then converted to coproporphyrinogen III by the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD).
