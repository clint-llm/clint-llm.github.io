**Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)**, a rare formÂ of thrombotic microangiopathy, is caused by defective or deficient ADAMTS13, a vWF-cleaving plasma protease. Mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene (congenital TTP, autosomal recessive) or aberrant autoimmune activity (acquired TTP or immune TTP) can impede enzymatic function such that large vWF multimers accumulate and dramatically increase thrombus formation and platelet consumption.

- Clinical presentation is often described as a triad of neurologic symptoms due to impaired cerebral blood flow, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or a pentad of the aforementioned triad plus fever and renal problems. Given its namesake, skin findings such as petechiae and purpura are also manifestations of TTP. Ultimately, microthrombi formed due to this condition can affect the perfusion of any organ system, so the scope of possible symptoms is broad.

- Lab findings include low levels of ADAMTS13 activity, antibodies against ADAMTS13 (specific to acquired TTP, not found in congenital TTP), evidence of hemolytic anemia such as elevated lactate dehydrogenase, elevated reticulocyte count, elevated unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin, in addition to the presence of schistocytes, significantly decreased platelet count and increased bleeding time.

- Standard treatment for TTP is plasmapheresis and steroids; however, in cases of acquired TTP, rituximab is used to prevent relapse when ADAMTS13 activity levels are especially low by inhibiting the production of ADAMTS13 autoantibodies.

**Bernard-Soulier syndrome**, a rare genetic platelet disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, is caused by abnormally large platelets with impaired surface expression of Gp1b, causing defective platelet adhesion to vWF.

- Clinical presentation typically includes excessive bleeding, epistaxis, easy bruising, petechiae, and (in females) heavy menses.

- Lab findings include normal or decreased platelet counts, increased platelet size, increased bleeding time, normal prothrombin time, normal partial thromboplastin time, and a failure of platelet aggregation when exposed to ristocetin cofactor due to Gp1b deficiency.

- Treatment for Bernard-Soulier syndrome is supportive and genetic counseling is recommended. In some scenarios, antifibrinolytic therapy may be administered to reduce post-procedural bleeding.

**Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)**is associated with hypercoagulability; the risk of microthrombosis correlates with disease severity. One proposed mechanism is a quantitative imbalance between vWF and ADAMTS13 activity. Similar to the hypercoagulable state of patients with sepsis, inflammatory microthrombogenesis in severe COVID-19 is facilitated by excessive release of vWF, which outpaces ADAMTS13 activity.
