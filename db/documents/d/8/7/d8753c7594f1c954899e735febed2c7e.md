There are few measures during and after the surgery which can reduce the incidence of mediastinitis post-operatively. These include:

- Complete aseptic technique during surgery

- Secure hemostasis carefully

- Prophylactic intranasal mupirocin to Staphylococcus aureus carriers will reduce the risk of surgical site infection postoperatively

- Proper closure of the sternum

- Topical application of bacitracin ointment on sternotomy to reduce the risk of mediastinitis after cardiac surgery
