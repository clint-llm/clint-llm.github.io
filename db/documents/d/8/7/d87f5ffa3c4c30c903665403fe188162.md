Patients with OSA are at risk of multiple adverse clinical outcomes. One of the most common adverse outcomes in patients with obstructive sleep apnea is an increased rate of motor vehicle collisions. Patients with OSA are involved in motor vehicle collisions at a rate of 2 to 3 times that of the general population. Thus it is important to counsel patients diagnosed with OSA regarding this risk. In patients who spend a significant amount of time in motor vehicles, such as those in commercial transportation, appropriate treatment for obstructive sleep apnea is particularly important to avoid adverse outcomes.

Obstructive sleep apnea may also result in neuropsychiatric dysfunction, including difficulties with attention, memory, cognitive deficit, and impaired executive function. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea are also more likely to experience mood disorders, psychosis, and sexual dysfunction than the general population.

Cardiopulmonary mortality is another important factor to consider for patients with OSA. Multiple large studies have demonstrated that patients with moderate to severe OSA are at increased risk for coronary artery disease, systemic hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, and cerebrovascular accident.
