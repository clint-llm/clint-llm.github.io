Carcinoid syndrome is most commonly caused by neuroendocrine tumors of midgut that metastasize to the liver. Neuroendocrine tumors of foregut and hindgut can also rarely cause carcinoid syndrome. Neuroendocrine tumors mostly arise in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (about 70%) followed by respiratory tract (about 25%).
