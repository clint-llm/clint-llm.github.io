The most common presenting symptoms of tibial neuropathy are pain and a change in sensation in the plantar aspect of the foot and toes. Commonly, there is also pain located around the medial malleolus where the tibial nerve runs. Symptoms can be exacerbated by passive ankle inversion. A key component of tibial neuropathy at the tarsal tunnel or distally is the sparing of sensation over the heel. This is because the calcaneal branch of the tibial nerve branches off proximal to the tarsal tunnel and, therefore, will not be affected in tarsal tunnel lesions.

The Tinel sign is tested by tapping over the suspected nerve entrapment site. A positive sign is indicated by the reproduction of pain and/or tingling in the distribution of the nerve. A positive Tinel’s sign can be seen at the ankle if the source of the pain is in the tarsal tunnel.

The patient’s gait should be evaluated, including heel walking, toe walking, and tandem gait. Overpronation may be seen with ambulation, which can place the tibial nerve under increased tension. If a proximal lesion of the tibial nerve is suspected, testing the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles is key to assessing for weakness. Given the strength of the plantar flexors, this is best assessed by having the patient perform one-legged calf raises if the patient can.

If tarsal tunnel syndrome is suspected, strength testing may be unreliable due to the difficulty in testing the intrinsic foot muscles on examination. Sensory testing should be performed, consisting of an evaluation of both pinprick and light touch. The patellar and Achilles reflexes should be compared from side to side, although this is a nonspecific finding that can also be seen in radiculopathy and polyneuropathy. In addition, these reflexes may not be involved depending on the location of the lesion. Tarsal tunnel syndrome generally does not affect the Achilles reflex.
