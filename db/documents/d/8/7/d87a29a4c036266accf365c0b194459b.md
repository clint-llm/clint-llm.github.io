Ultrasound utilizes high-frequency sound waves to generate diagnostic images. The advantage of ultrasound is that no ionizing radiation is required for its use. Unfortunately, calcified structures such as the bones of the calvarium preclude adequate sound transmission for an ultrasound to be useful in diagnostic imaging of the brain. As such, ultrasound plays no role in the evaluation of patients with seizures.
