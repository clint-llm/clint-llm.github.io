The exact pathogenesis is unknown. The most commonly accepted hypothesis is that meconium plug syndrome is a transient functional colonic immaturity specifically of the myenteric nervous system. Consequently, peristalsis is ineffectual, and therefore the meconium remains in the colon for a more extended period, leading to higher water absorption and the development of meconium plugs that cause obstruction.

In diabetic mothers, the higher occurrence of neonatal hypoglycemia induces the pancreas to secrete glucagon. In turn, glucagon decreases peristalsis in the left colon. Furthermore, neonatal hypoglycemia stimulates the autonomic nervous system. Increased stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system causes a decrease in intestinal movement, which accelerates the development of meconium plugs.
