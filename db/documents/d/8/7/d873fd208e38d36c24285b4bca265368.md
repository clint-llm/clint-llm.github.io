The Amsel criteria are useful in the outpatient setting. The presence of three out of four positive criteria indicates that the cause of a patient’s vaginal complaints is bacterial vaginosis.  Use of the Amsel criteria requires a vaginal swab of discharge, microscope and slide/wet prep, and potassium hydroxide solution. The Amsel criteria allow diagnosticians to narrow down the broad differential for vaginal discharge and discomfort with quick and simple testing.
