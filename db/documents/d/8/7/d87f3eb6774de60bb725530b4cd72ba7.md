For non-waived tests, laboratory regulations require, at the minimum, analysis of at least two levels of control materials once every 24 hours. Laboratories can assay QC samples more frequently if deemed necessary to ensure accurate results. Quality control samples should be assayed after calibration or maintenance of an analyzer to verify the correct method performance. To minimize QC when performing tests for which manufacturers’ recommendations are less than those required by the regulatory agency (such as once per month),

Acceptable performance (accuracy) for alkaline phosphatase assays according to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) is the target value ± 30%, which is also the acceptability criteria used by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) in its surveys.
