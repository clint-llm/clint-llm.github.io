A dysplastic nevus is also referred to as an atypical or Clarks nevus and has been the topic of much debate in the fields of dermatology and dermatopathology. It is an acquired mole demonstrating a unique clinical and histopathologic appearance that sets it apart from the common nevus. These moles appear atypical clinically, often with a fried-egg appearance, and are commonly biopsied by providers due to the concern for melanoma. This activity reviews the cause and pathophysiology of dysplastic nevus and highlights the interprofessional team's role in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of dysplastic nevi.
- Recall the presentation of dysplastic nevi.
- List the management options available for dysplastic nevi.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with dysplastic nevi.
