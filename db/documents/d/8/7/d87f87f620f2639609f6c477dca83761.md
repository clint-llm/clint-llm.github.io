Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma is an extremely rare neoplasm with an annual incidence of 3 to 4 cases per million people. It represents approximately two percent of all hematologic malignancies. In the United States, there are 1000 to 1500 new cases per year. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma is a disease of elderly individuals in the seventh and eighth decade of life, with a slight male predominance. The disease is indolent, and most patients survive 7 to 8 years post-diagnosis. In rare cases, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma can transform into an aggressive immunoblastic variant or other high-grade lymphomas.
