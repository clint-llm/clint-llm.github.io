# Continuing Education Activity

Myocarditis is a significant cause of sudden death and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, especially in the young. It has a very diverse and sometimes, nonspecific presentation, and can mimic various disease entities. Although viral myocarditis is the most common type, nonviral myocarditis also must be considered. Nonviral myocarditis comprises several infectious and autoimmune etiologies that should not be overlooked; recognition is critical for a timely intervention. This activity describes the etiology, evaluation, and management of nonviral myocarditis and highlights the role of interprofessional teams in improving outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of nonviral myocarditis.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with nonviral myocarditis.
- Summarize the management of nonviral myocarditis.
- Explain the importance of coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with nonviral myocarditis.

# Introduction

German physician Joseph Friedrich Sobernheim coined the term "myocarditis" in 1837, which translates to "inflammation of the myocardium." However, for a long time, there was no clear consensus on what truly constituted myocarditis. In the nineteenth and early twentieth century, the term was a catch-all diagnosis for many non-valvular heart diseases, including what we now recognize as hypertensive and ischemic heart diseases.

# Etiology

The cause of myocarditis is most commonly viral, and most prominently linked with enteroviruses like Coxsackie B,

The non-viral causes of myocarditis can broadly classify into infectious, immune-mediated, and toxic.

Infectious causes include:

- Bacterial pathogens like group A Streptococci, which can cause rheumatic myocarditis, characterized by Aschoff nodules on histopathology; Corynebacterium diphtheriae associated with toxin-mediated myocarditis; Mycobacterium, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Other bacteria which may lead to myocarditis include Staphylococcus, Gonococcus, Meningococcus, Pneumococcus, Hemophilus influenzae, and Brucella. There are also a few reported cases of myocarditis associated with non-typhi Salmonella species like S. enteritidis and S. berta, and rarely with typhoid fever

- Spirochetes like Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme myocarditis and may correlate with atrioventricular conduction abnormalities; Leptospira, associated with Weil's disease; and rarely Treponema pallidum, causing gummatous myocarditis in tertiary syphilis

- Protozoa like Trypanosoma cruzi, causing Chagas' disease, which could present as acute myocarditis or chronic cardiomyopathy; Toxoplasma gondii, associated with post-cardiac transplant myocarditis and rejection; Entameba histolytica, which often also causes acute pericarditis; Leishmania; and Naegleria fowleri

- Parasitic causes like cysticercosis because of Tenia solium; Trichinella-associated eosinophilic myocarditis, larva migrans, and Echinococcus granulosus

- Fungi like Aspergillus, Candida, Actinomyces, Blastomyces, Coccidioides, Histoplasma, Cryptococcus, Mucormycosis, Nocardia, and Sporothrix

- Rickettsial diseases like Q fever, caused by Coxiella burnetii; or Rocky Mountain spotted fever, due to R. rickettsii

Immune-mediated myocarditis could be due to:

- Autoimmune causes, like giant cell myocarditis and infection-negative lymphocytic myocarditis; or associated with immunologic syndromes like systemic lupus erythematosus, Churg-Strauss syndrome, Wegener’s granulomatosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Kawasaki disease, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, myasthenia gravis, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis or sarcoidosis

- Hypersensitivity reaction to drugs like sulfonamides, penicillin, cephalosporins, furosemide, thiazide, digoxin, dobutamine, tricyclic antidepressants, isoniazid, tetracycline, phenytoin, phenylbutazone, and methyldopa; or serum sickness-like reaction to toxoids or vaccines

- Allograft rejection after a cardiac transplant

Toxic myocarditis may be caused by:

- Drugs, like amphetamines, cocaine, ethanol, chemotherapeutic agents (anthracyclines, trastuzumab, cyclophosphamide), antipsychotic medications (clozapine, lithium) and interleukin-2

- Heavy metal toxicity with copper, iron, lead

- Metabolic causes like pheochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, hemochromatosis, or beriberi

# Epidemiology

Myocarditis is a significant cause of sudden death and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, especially in the young. It was recently ranked as the third leading cause of sudden cardiac death in competitive athletes by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, and it is considered the most common known cause of dilated cardiomyopathy in children less than 18 years of age.

Whereas neonates and children are more susceptible to viral-induced fulminant myocarditis,

Unlike viral myocarditis, there is a lot of variation in the distribution of non-viral pathogens causing myocarditis. Rheumatic heart disease and tertiary syphilis are rare in the developed nations because of better access to healthcare and early administration of antibiotics. Enteric pathogens and parasitic infestations are more prevalent in regions with poor sanitation, whereas diphtheritic myocarditis is limited to populations with poor immunization coverage.

Some pathogens are endemic to certain geographic regions, such as follows:

- Borrelia burgdorferi, Babesia, and Anaplasma species, associated with Ixodes tick (northeastern United States)

- Trypanosoma cruzi (rural areas of Central and South America)

- Coccidioides immitis (the southwestern United States and northern Mexico)

- Histoplasma capsulatum (central and eastern United States, most prevalent in the Ohio and Mississippi river valley

-  Blastomyces dermatitidis (eastern North America, around St. Lawrence and Mississippi river systems)

# Pathophysiology

Most studies have focused on the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis, using murine models. However, barring a few differences, most cases of myocarditis develop from the same three-step sequence of events

- Acute injury because of infectious or non-infectious causes, leading to myocardial damage

- Myocytolysis causing the release of intracellular antigens and cytoskeletal proteins like cardiac myosin

- Activation of the innate immune response against cardiac self-antigens, followed by CD4+ T cell activation, clonal expansion of B cells, and production of cardiac autoantibodies.

Rheumatic carditis occurs because of molecular mimicry of streptococcal antigens (like M protein) with cardiac antigens such that anti-streptococcal antibodies cross-react with cardiac myosin and valvular endotheliumBorrelia, Trypanosoma, or Toxoplasma cause myocyte injury by direct invasion and intracellular proliferation

Studies have implicated both cell-mediated, and antibody-mediated immune responses in the pathogenesis of myocarditis, and CD4+ T cells play a major role in both pathways.

# Histopathology

Aretz et al. proposed the Dallas criteria in 1986 for the histopathologic diagnosis of acute myocarditis, which requires evidence of inflammatory cellular infiltrate and myocyte necrosis for a diagnosis of acute myocarditis; whereas borderline myocarditis describes an inflammatory infiltrate in the absence of myocyte necrosis.

Some types of myocarditis have very characteristic morphologies. Aschoff nodules with central fibrinoid necrosis and Anitschkow cells are the hallmark findings of rheumatic carditis, typically seen in perivascular regions. Patients with toxoplasma myocarditis may have pseudocysts containing Toxoplasma tachyzoites in the non-inflamed regions of the myocardium.

# History and Physical

Myocarditis can present with a broad spectrum of symptoms of varying severity. From being asymptomatic to mild nonspecific symptoms like fever, myalgias, decreased exercise tolerance, or pleuritic chest pain, it can also mimic angina/MI and heart failure, or present with life-threatening arrhythmia or cardiogenic shock. In their position statement on myocardial and pericardial diseases, the European Society of Cardiology broadly grouped myocarditis symptoms into four classes

- Acute coronary syndrome-like presentation, associated with ST-T wave changes, the elevation of troponins, and even regional or global wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography, but with no evidence of CAD on coronary angiography. A respiratory or gastrointestinal illness often precedes symptoms by approximately 1-4 weeks.

- New onset or worsening heart failure lasting for fewer than 3 months, in the absence of CAD or known causes of heart failure, with symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, pedal edema, fatigue, and chest discomfort. Physical examination may reveal a distressed, tachypneic individual with sinus tachycardia, an audible S3, bilateral crackles, or jugular venous distension. An echocardiogram can show impaired left or right ventricular systolic function with or without increased wall thickness or ventricular dimensions, and patients might have associated atrioventricular or bundle branch blocks.;

- Chronic heart failure with symptoms lasting for over 3 months, in the absence of CAD or known causes of heart failure

- Life-threatening conditions like ventricular arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock with severely reduced ejection fraction.

Patients might also display signs and symptoms of the causative disease. For example, a patient with Chagas’ disease might present with swelling at the infection site (chagoma), fever, myalgia, rash, lymphadenopathy or eyelid swelling (Romaña's sign) in the acute phase; or with dysphagia (megaesophagus), constipation (megacolon) or orthostatic hypotension (dysautonomia) in the chronic phase. Similarly, Lyme carditis may present with rash, flu-like symptoms, joint pain, facial palsy, or neuropathy.

Liebermann et al. introduced a clinicopathologic classification in 1991 that utilized clinical presentations to differentiate fulminant myocarditis from active lymphocytic myocarditis (acute, chronic active, or chronic persistent).

# Evaluation

Myocarditis typically causes nonspecific changes in the EKG but can include diffuse ST-segment elevations that are typically concave (as opposed to convex morphology in STEMI). Lyme carditis, giant cell myocarditis, and cardiac sarcoidosis often present with AV blocks or bundle branch blocks. Patients with a prolonged QRS duration have a greater risk of cardiac transplant or death in the setting of clinically suspected myocarditis.

Myocarditis may cause elevation of cardiac biomarkers like troponin T or troponin I, but this is more sensitive than specific.

An echocardiogram may or may not reveal an impairment of ventricular function, with or without global or regional wall motion abnormalities. Both acute and chronic myocarditis can present with an increase in the size of the ventricular chambers; acute myocarditis can have a normal-to-thickened myocardium whereas chronic myocarditis more commonly correlates with thinning and scarring of the ventricular walls. However, it can morphologically resemble any of the three cardiomyopathies (dilated, restrictive, or hypertrophic).

Microbial diagnosis of myocarditis requires respective serologies. A patient with acute myocarditis will have IgM immunoglobulins whereas chronic microbial myocarditis will show IgG antibodies. Adding viral PCR for DNA or RNA on the EMB specimen may improve the diagnostic yield.

Studies have linked several autoantibodies with myocarditis; some target cardiac and muscle-specific antigens like anti-heart antibodies (AHA), anti-intercalated disk antibodies (AIDA), and anti-sarcolemmal antibodies (ASA).

Nuclear imaging with Gallium-67 scintigraphy, Thallium-201 scan, or 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography have poor specificity but can help detect sarcoidosis in its acute phase and also be useful in monitoring the progression of the disease.

Cardiac MRI (CMR) has developed as a promising mode of non-invasive diagnosis of myocarditis. In patients with clinically suspected myocarditis, the Lake Louise criteria help determine if the CMR findings are consistent with myocarditis.

- Increase in global or regional myocardial signal intensity in T2-weighted images, suggestive of myocardial edema

- Early gadolinium enhancement of the myocardium suggestive of hyperemia and capillary leakage (markers of inflammation), and an increased ratio of signal intensity between myocardium and skeletal muscles in T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced images

- At least one focal lesion of late gadolinium enhancement (in inversion recovery-prepared gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images) is suggestive of myocyte injury and/or scar due to myocarditis; this must be in the non-ischemic regional distribution (sub-epicardium or mid-wall, rather than the sub-endocardium which is involved in myocardial infarction)

If high clinical suspicion exists for myocarditis with recent onset of symptoms, but the CMR does not meet the Lake Louise criteria, then the CMR must be repeated in 1-2 weeks.

Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is the only means of a definitive diagnosis of myocarditis and must fulfill the histologic and immunohistochemical criteria discussed before. Since it is an invasive procedure with significant morbidity, it is not feasible in every patient. The European Society of Cardiology proposes that EMB should be performed in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis after ruling out ischemia with coronary angiography.

The patient has clinically suspected myocarditis if he has one or more "clinical presentations" with one or more "diagnostic criteria"; or if he/she is asymptomatic, he/she must meet 2 or more "diagnostic criteria" from different categories.

- Acute chest pain (which can be pericarditic or pseudo-ischemic)

- New onset/ acute worsening (<3 months)

- Chronic (>3 months) heart failure (with dyspnea and/or fatigue with or without the left and/or right heart failure signs)

- Arrhythmias (palpitations, syncope, other unexplained arrhythmia symptoms, or aborted sudden cardiac death)

- Unexplained cardiogenic shock

Diagnostic criteria include:

- Newly abnormal 12-lead EKG, Holter or stress testing

- Elevated myocytolysis markers like Troponin T or Troponin I,

- New and otherwise unexplained functional and structural abnormalities on cardiac imaging (echocardiography, angiography, or MRI)

- Tissue characterization by CMR (including edema and/or late gadolinium enhancement of myocarditis pattern).

All patients raising clinical suspicion of myocarditis should be admitted to the hospital for observation. Patients must have a 12-lead EKG testing and a transthoracic echocardiogram and should be considered for coronary angiography to rule out ischemic heart disease. If the patient is clinically stable, a cardiac MRI may precede EMB for further characterization; but if the patient has a life-threatening presentation, he/she must undergo an EMB without delay.

# Treatment / Management

Treatment of myocarditis can be symptomatic or etiologic. Symptomatic treatment involves the management of heart failure and arrhythmias based on current guidelines.

Hemodynamically unstable patients need intensive care and may require inotropic support, ventricular assist devices, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in cases of severe ventricular dysfunction as a bridge to cardiac transplant or recovery.

Myocarditis patients may present with conduction abnormalities like complete A-V blocks, which can rapidly evolve into life-threatening arrhythmias. As a result, temporary or permanent pacing may be necessary. Ventricular tachycardias can be treated with amiodarone or may require an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) as a bridge to transplant or recovery.

Etiologic management includes appropriate antimicrobial therapy for infective causes (like ceftriaxone or doxycycline in Lyme carditis, benznidazole, or nifurtimox for Chagas disease).

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) do not seem to have any benefit in myocarditis; in fact, their use in myocarditis correlates with greater mortality.

# Differential Diagnosis

Myocarditis mimics several conditions; therefore, one must carefully consider its differential diagnoses. Acute coronary syndrome, valvular disease, infective endocarditis, cardiac tamponade, and pericarditis must be ruled out. Right ventricular myocarditis can present like arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

# Prognosis

The prognosis of myocarditis varies by the type and etiology of the disease. Viral myocarditis usually resolves spontaneously. Even fulminant myocarditis which is marked by severe ventricular impairment and multiple foci of myocarditis (while it might require aggressive interventions during the active phase of the disease) eventually resolves completely.

The presence of biventricular dysfunction at the time of diagnosis is a major predictor of death or the need for a cardiac transplant.

# Complications

Immediate complications of myocarditis include cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Unresolved myocarditis can progress to dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, areas of focal hypokinesis, and ventricular aneurysms that may also lead to intracardiac thrombi, which may further result in a stroke or MI. Dilated cardiomyopathy is perhaps the most common sequelae of myocarditis that develops in up to 30% of biopsy-proven cases of myocarditis.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients should receive education about the course of the disease and their respective prognoses. Patients have an increased risk of sudden death and should avoid physical activity until the disease has completely resolved (acute myocarditis), or until 6 months from the onset of symptoms.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

All patients with clinically suspected myocarditis must undergo vigilant monitoring in the hospital for acute decompensation.

- Clinically unstable patients must undergo endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) without delay; for stable patients, one might consider a cardiac MRI.

- Sampling for EMB must be adequate, and it should be supplemented by immunohistochemical staining, HLA typing PCR, and viral genome analysis; inconclusive results delay treatment.

- Etiologic treatment for myocarditis cannot be started without EMB, which differentiates infective from autoimmune causes, and determines whether the patient needs antimicrobial or immunosuppressive therapy.

- Prognostic information plays a vital role in guiding treatment; for example, a patient with fulminant myocarditis may require aggressive interventions like ventricular assist devices or ECMO, because he/she is expected to make a full recovery after the resolution of myocarditis.

- Patients must avoid physical activity until complete resolution of symptoms, or at least until 6 months from the onset because of increased risk of sudden death.

Clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists caring for a patient with myocarditis must work together to provide close monitoring and alert the team when there are signs or symptoms of developing decompensation.
