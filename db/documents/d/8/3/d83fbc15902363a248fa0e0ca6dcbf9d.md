**Performing Block With Ultrasound**

With the patient properly positioned, the skin is disinfected, and the transducer is placed over the neck until the appropriate landmarks and structures are identified. There are 2 commonly accepted techniques for finding the proper image. Firstly, the transducer is placed at the level of the cricoid cartilage medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and the carotid artery is identified. The transducer is then slid laterally until the brachial plexus in between the anterior and middle scalene muscles are identified. The second method is to place the transducer just above the clavicle and identifying the subclavian artery with brachial plexus (the image for a supraclavicular block). The transducer is then moved cephalad towards the patient's neck while keeping the brachial plexus nerves in view until the "stop-light" image is seen. The needle is then inserted in-plane to the transducer entering lateral to medial. If preferred the needle can be inserted medial to lateral as well. Once the needle reaches the interscalene groove, after careful aspiration, the local anesthetic is injected. If a nerve stimulator is used, the patient should exhibit a motor response of the shoulder and arm.

Prior to cleaning the skin the proper landmarks are identified and marked with a marking pen. The 3 major landmarks required for the block are the clavicle, the clavicular head of the sternocleidomastoid and the external jugular vein. Another helpful landmark is the cricoid cartilage. After identifying these landmarks, the skin is prepped, and with sterile gloves, the anterior and middle scalene muscle can be palpated. This is located just posterior the clavicular head of the sternocleidomastoid around the level of the cricoid cartilage. The external jugular vein usually crosses the interscalene groove. The skin is then anesthetized with 3-mL local anesthetic subcutaneously, and the needle is then inserted just posterior to the external jugular vein approximately 3 to 4 cm above the clavicle and advanced at an angle perpendicularÂ to the skin plane. With the nerve stimulator connected the needle is advanced until stimulation of the brachial plexus is seen. This occurs in most patients around 1 to 2 cm in depth. The local anesthetic is then injected with intermittent aspirations to avoid intravascular injections.
