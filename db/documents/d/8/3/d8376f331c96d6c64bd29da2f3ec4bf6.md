The superior colliculus is a paired structure in the rostral midbrain that is involved in incorporating environmental stimuli and coordinating gaze shifts involving both eye and head movements. It is known as the optic tectum in other vertebrates and contains a topographic map of the contralateral visual field, as well as other inputs from somatosensory and auditory pathways.
