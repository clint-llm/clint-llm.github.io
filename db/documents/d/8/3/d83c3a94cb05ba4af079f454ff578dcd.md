The lungs are one of the few organ systems that are most challenged by stress due to its direct contact with the outside world.

Depending on the location within the lung, there are several anatomical defenses present to ward off harmful particles, such as dust, viruses, bacteria, fungi, soot, among others. The size of each particle determines how the lungs defend themselves.

Along with these anatomical barriers, the integrated stress response (ISR) becomes activated by one or more of these toxic triggers and thereby activates one of four stress-sensing kinases. The balance of these cytoprotective and damaging factors induced by the kinases leads to the negative effects on the lungs due to the environment.
