There are many causes of apnea in infants and the condition may be intermittent in presentation, and if left untreated may have undesirable consequences. Hence, healthcare workers including nurses must be aware of apnea and its clinical presentation. In general, apnea is more common in low birth weight infants and affects anywhere from 1 to 7.5% of hospitalized infants. Untreated apnea can result in failure to thrive, loss of intellect and cor pulmonale. Apnea caused by sepsis or a neurological insult carries a very high mortality rate.
