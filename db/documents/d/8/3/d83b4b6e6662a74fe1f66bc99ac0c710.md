The vast majority of congenital fifth toe deformities resolve once childhood ambulation begins.

In the rare case where operative intervention is indicated, the Butler procedure and flexor tenotomies generally provide favorable outcomes and correction of overlapping toes and congenital curly toes, respectively.
