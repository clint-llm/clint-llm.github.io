Due to the high level of potential neurologic compromise, randomized controlled trials of treatment strategies with subaxial cervical spine fractures are not feasible. Continued research in the validity of a subaxial cervical spine fracture classification system can lead to a more standardized approach and even a better idea of patient prognosis.

Depending on the level of injury and the extent of spinal cord compression, these patients need a great deal of communication between multiple specialists, including the neurosurgeon or orthopedic surgeon (specialized in spine surgery), neuroradiologist, neuro-anesthetist, intensivist, neuro nurse, and physiatrist. Early intervention with rehabilitation and mobilization once the spine has undergone stabilization is important.

These injuries require open communication and collaboration among all members of the healthcare team; this could even include chiropractors, since they may be the first to encounter these patients and take in-office radiographs, and need to understand when manipulation is inappropriate. After surgery, physical therapists may play a role in the rehabilitation process. Specialty-trained neurological or orthopedic nurses will assist in management before, during, and following any procedure, whether it is a closed reduction or surgical. All these disciplines must work together with open communication to bring about the best result with minimal disability for the patient. [Level 5]
