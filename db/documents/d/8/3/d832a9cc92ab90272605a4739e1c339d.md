Patients with a specific phobia experience high levels of anxiety along with excessive and unreasonable fear due to either exposure to a phobic stimulus, the anticipation of exposure to a phobic stimulus, and even speaking about the feared stimulus. As a result, these patients will try to avoid the anxiety-provoking stimulus to any extent possible. Many patients have a strong family history of specific phobia. However, more studies need to be conducted to rule out the nongenetic transmission of specific phobias.
