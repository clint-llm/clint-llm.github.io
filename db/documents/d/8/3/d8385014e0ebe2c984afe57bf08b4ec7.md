No trial has conclusively proven that antenatal testing lowers long-term adverse neurologic outcomes so that recommendations might have a rating level of consensus, expert opinion, but no clear evidence. The standard of care can only be a suggestion and probably varies considerably from region to region.

The prenatal nonstress test has utility in isolation in post-term pregnancies and patients with decreased fetal movement. When the non-stress test is not reactive, the testing period should extend another 20 minutes in an attempt to delineate between the fetus in a period of prolonged quiet sleep from those who are hypoxemic or asphyxiated. Vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) may be used to change fetal state from quiet to active sleep and shorten the length of the NST. If the NST remains nonreactive after 60 minutes. The fetus should undergo evaluation with an ultrasound biophysical profile.

Interpretation of the nonstress test should always take into consideration individual patient clinical condition, gestational age, and associated maternal comorbidities. The clinician should not hesitate to perform the further evaluation with the biophysical profile, Doppler ultrasound for umbilical artery evaluation, continuous fetal monitoring, consultation with maternal and fetal medicine specialists, admission to the hospital and delivery of the fetus as indicated.
