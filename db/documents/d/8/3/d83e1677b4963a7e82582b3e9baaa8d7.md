Amniotomy, also known as artificial rupture of membranes (AROM) and by the lay description "breaking the water," is the intentional rupture of the amniotic sac by an obstetrical provider. This procedure is common during labor management and has been performed by obstetrical providers for at least a few hundred years. The reasons for the intentional rupture of the amniotic sac during labor are multifold and include, but are not limited to, influencing the speed of labor, allowing for more direct monitoring of fetal status, and qualitative assessment of the amniotic fluid.
