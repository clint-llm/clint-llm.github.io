A review of indications for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is beyond the scope of this article. We present guideline recommendations for the use of the internal mammary artery (IMA) as the graft of choice for CABG.

According to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, indications for CABG using the IMA include the following

- Grafting the left anterior descending artery with left IMA (class 1, level of evidence B)

- Grafting of the left anterior descending artery with right IMA when left IMA is unavailable or unsuitable (class 2a, level of evidence B)

- When anatomically and clinically suitable, use of a second IMA to graft the left circumflex or right coronary artery to improve the likelihood of survival and to decrease reintervention (class 2a, level of evidence B)

- IMA graft to the right coronary artery when more than 90% stenosis (class 2b)
