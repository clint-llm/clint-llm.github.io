Subjects with established hypersensitivity to apremilast or any elements of the agent's formulations are contraindicated to therapy with apremilast. Reproductive studies conducted in animal models during pregnancy demonstrated an increased risk of fetal loss with apremilast therapy. No reproductive studies with apremilast treatment during pregnancy in humans have been reported to date.

Women of reproductive potential are highly encouraged for pregnancy planning and prevention.

Apremilast is a selective immunosuppressant agent and is considered a class of immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medications. As per rheumatology recommendations and guidelines, apremilast is advised to be held for one to two weeks following the administration of the COVID-19 vaccination, as it may reduce the vaccine's therapeutic efficacy.
