Mohs micrographic surgery is a tissue-sparing, precise method of skin cancer removal named in honor of the surgeon who developed the technique, Frederick Mohs. It is a surgical approach that offers high cure rates for the treatment of a variety of skin cancers, including basal cell carcinomas (BCC) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). The main advantage of Mohs surgery is that it offers precise microscopic control of the entire tumor margin while maximizing conservation of healthy tissue.

This technique was developed by Dr. Mohs in the 1930’s. The procedure was originally named “chemosurgery,” since the technique involved the application of a chemical fixative (zinc chloride) to the in-situ tumor.  After 24 hours of in-situ fixation, the tumor was excised and microscopically examined. The process was repeated until the tumor was completely removed.

Mohs surgery is appropriate for skin cancers with a high risk of recurrence and when tissue conservation is essential.
