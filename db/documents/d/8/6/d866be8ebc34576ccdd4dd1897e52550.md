Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT) is a macroreentrant tachycardia that needs an accessory pathway to bypass the regular conduction system.

Atrioventricular reentry tachycardia has a circuit that consists of two different pathways consisted of the regular conduction system through the AV node and an accessory pathway that enables communication between the atrium with the ventricle. After an extra beat of ectopic atrial or ventricular origin, these two pathways enable a difference between the refractory period and conduction time to allow tachycardia to persist

Atrioventricular reentry tachycardia and Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome are often used interchangeably. However, to be specific, AVRT is the most common type of arrhythmia associated with the Wolf Parkinson White syndrome. Other examples of arrhythmia include AVNRT, atrial fibrillation with preexcitation, and atrial flutter.
