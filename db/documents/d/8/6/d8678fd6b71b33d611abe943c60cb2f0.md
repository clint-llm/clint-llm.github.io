As previously stated, D-TGA is difficult to detect on fetal ultrasound due to the absence of differences in ventricle size.

- **Electrocardiography:**Often normal but may show right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy

- **Chest radiography:**The classic radiographic features of TGA is an “egg on a string” appearance.

- **Cardiac catheterization:**Angiography is rarely used to diagnose TGA; however, it is the gold standard for elucidating the origins of the coronary arteries. Cardiac catheterization is routinely used in D-TGA to perform a balloon septostomy in patients with severe cyanosis.
