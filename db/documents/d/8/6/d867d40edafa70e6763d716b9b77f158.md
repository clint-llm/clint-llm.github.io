Generally, there is no treatment indicated for SCH unless associated with a certain serious condition. The blood is typically resorbed over 1-2 weeks depending on the amount of extravasated blood. Recovery may take up to 3 weeks if patients are on anticoagulation. Ice packs and artificial tears can be utilized to minimize tissue swelling and provide some relief of discomfort respectively. Emergent ophthalmology consultation is warranted if SCH occurred via trauma and intraocular or additional retinal trauma is suspected. Dilute brimonidine and oxymetazoline have been indicated to improve patient comfort and decrease the incidence of SCH after intravitreal injections.
