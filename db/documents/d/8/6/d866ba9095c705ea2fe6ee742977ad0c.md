The decision to incorporate drug-assisted intubation into any EMS system must be individualized based on the needs of the community and the resources available to the EMS organization. In addition to the above pros and cons, factors unique to each EMS system such as training, staffing, and transport times must be considered. Additionally, the pros and cons of DAI for each patient must be weighed carefully. Knowing when not to do something is just as important as being proficient at it. A policy statement by the American College of Emergency Physicians, American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma, and the National Association of EMS Physicians advocates neither for nor against prehospital DAI. The statement acknowledges that prehospital airway management is extremely important, and that “the scope of prehospital care may include drug assisted intubation (DAI) to facilitate ETI,” if EMS systems have “a specific need for the procedure and possess adequate resources to develop and maintain a prehospital DAI protocol.” There are many pros and cons of DAI in the prehospital setting, both literature-based and theoretical. Overall, the preponderance of the literature has not shown an outcome or mortality benefit to prehospital DAI. Much of this data focuses on traumatic brain injury patients. More research is needed to specify in which clinical situations DAI will provide a benefit.
