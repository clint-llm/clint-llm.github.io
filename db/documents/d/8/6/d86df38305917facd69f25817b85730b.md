Symptoms of atenolol toxicity may include bradycardia, lethargy, hypotension, respiratory drive disorders, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and/or seizures. Treatment of beta-blocker toxicity is primarily supportive. Any unabsorbed drug (if administered orally) is removable by gastric lavage or activated charcoal (within 1 to 2 hours), while hemodialysis can remove atenolol from general systemic circulation.

Inotropes and chronotropes, such as intravenous epinephrine and atropine, are recommended for treating severe bradycardia. Usually, atropine is administered as a 0.5 mg IV or IO bolus and repeated every 3 to 5 minutes to a total dose of 3 mg. In addition, a transvenous cardiac pacemaker may be used in refractory cases or for treating second or third-degree heart block.

A titrated glucagon bolus at a dose of 50 mcg/kg can improve myocardial contractility and atrioventricular conduction and increase heart rate in patients. Blood pressure must undergo continuous monitoring, and in cases of hypotension, vasopressors such as levarterenol are an option. For patients with bronchospasm, a beta-2 agonist such as aminophylline or isoproterenol may be used to alleviate symptoms. In cases refractory to the usual treatment,high-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy at 1 unit/kg bolus followed by 1 unit/kg per hour drip may be used to treat overdose in consultation with a toxicologist.

In cases of asymptomatic beta-1-blocker overdoses, the recommendation is to monitor the patient for at least 6 hours.
