Several hypotheses have been postulated with rhinitis medicamentosa, although the exact pathophysiology is still unknown

- Hypothesis 1: Chronic vasoconstriction leads to ischemia of the nasal mucosa, which predisposes to interstitial edema

- Hypothesis 2: Fatigue of the constrictor mechanisms occurs resulting in reactive hyperemia and congestion; this subsequently correlates with reduced sensitivity to endogenous catecholamines, where the adrenoreceptors become refractory to nasal decongestants, necessitating higher dosage of medication (tachyphylaxis)

- Hypothesis 3: Alteration in vasomotor tone results in increased vascular permeability and edema

- Hypothesis 4: The beta-adrenoreceptor activity may outlast the alpha effects leading to rebound vasodilatation
