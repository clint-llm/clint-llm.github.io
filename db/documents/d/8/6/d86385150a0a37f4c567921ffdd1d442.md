African trypanosomiasis, also known as human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and sleeping sickness, is caused by 1 of 2 Trypanosoma brucei protozoa transmitted by the tsetse fly in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is considered a neglected tropical disease and remains a nearly universal fatal disease if not treated. However, most healthcare workers in North America are unlikely to see a case in their lifetime. But it is still important to consider this disorder in the differential in a patient coming from the tropics. The best advice is to immediately consult with infectious disease on how to make the diagnosis and manage the patient.
