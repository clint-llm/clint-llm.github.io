Noonan syndrome (NS) is a pleomorphic autosomal dominant inherited disease. Thus, parents who have Noonan syndrome have a 50% chance of passing the mutation on to the children. Noonan syndrome has been associated with advanced paternal age. Noonan Syndrome can also occur via de novo mutation or sporadic mutation. The mutated genes are involved in the RAS/MAPK cell signaling pathway. For more information on the RAS/MAPK pathway, please refer to the pathology section.
