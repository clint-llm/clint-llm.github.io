Recent research has demonstrated that insufficient physical activity in all age groups leads to increased all-cause mortality, cancer risk, metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, falls among the elderly, depression, and cognitive impairment. Therefore, there is a need to implement guidelines and strategies to enable people of all ages to intensify their investment in physical activity.

Traditionally, continuous exercise at a moderate to vigorous intensity was the primary recommendation. Current research, however, clearly identifies the superiority of accumulated "bouts" of physical activity performed throughout the day in short intervals.

The current guidelines state that "bouts" of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity promote health benefits regardless of the duration and, therefore, can count towards meeting the key guideline goals.
