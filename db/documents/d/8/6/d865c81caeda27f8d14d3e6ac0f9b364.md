A referring physician typically orders the exam. This physician should know the indications and contraindications for the arthrogram procedure and any risks or benefits for the patient to undergo the examination. The physician should discuss this with the patient. A physician/radiologistÂ is responsible for all aspects of the study, which include reviewing indications for the arthrogram with MRA or CTA, specifying the performed pulse sequences, the interpretation of images acquired, making the final reports, and assuring both the quality of the images and the interpretation of such.

The radiologist should apply the current knowledge about the gamut of MRI contrast agents to include the composition, choice, risks, and benefits of the agent to be used and appropriate dosing. The radiologist will perform the arthrogram at hand. A physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or registered radiologist assistant who is certified as an advanced level radiographer can perform patient assessment, management, and selected examinations, including arthrograms, under radiologist supervision. The radiology technologist participates directly in assuring the patient's comfort and safety, preparing and positioning the patient to undergo the MRI, and obtaining the MRI data for interpretation by the radiologist.
