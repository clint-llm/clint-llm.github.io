HIVAN is classically manifested as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The natural course of the condition is rapid progression to end-stage renal disease in 2-4 months. Combined antiretroviral therapy is the mainstay treatment because it hastens progression and improves renal survival. Currently, other etiologies of kidney disease, such as hypertension and diabetes, are more common than HIVAN due to the advent of cART and improved survival in patients infected with HIV.
