There are several absolute and relative contraindications that the practitioner should be aware of before initiating thoracic HVLA treatment on a patient.

**Absolute Contraindications**

- Bony compromise (tumor, infection, trauma, inflammation)

- Neurological issues (acute myelopathy, spinal cord compression, cauda equina syndrome, nerve root compression)

- Vascular compromise (vertebrobasilar insufficiency or cervical artery abnormalities, aortic aneurysm, angina pectoris, acute abdominal pain with guarding)

- Increased risk of harm to the patient (lack of diagnosis, lack of skill/expertise by the clinician, lack of consent from the patient)

**Relative Contraindications**

- Hypermobility

- Serious kyphosis or scoliosis

- Disc herniation or disc protrusion

- Systemic infection

- Serious degenerative joint disease

- Adverse reaction to previous HVLA manipulation

The clinician should perform a thorough history and physical examination before any osteopathic manipulative treatment.
