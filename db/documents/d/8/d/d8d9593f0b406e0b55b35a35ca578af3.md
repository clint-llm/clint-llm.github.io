Seven clinical categories are recognized as below:

- C0 No visible or palpable signs of venous disease

- C1 Telangiectasies or reticular veins

- C2 Varicose veins; distinguished from reticular veins by a diameter of 3mm or more

- C3 Edema

- C4 Changes in skin and subcutaneous tissue secondary to CVD

- C4a Pigmentation or eczema
- C4b Lipodermatosclerosis or atrophie blanche

- C5 Healed venous ulcer.

- C6 Active venous ulcer.

- S: Symptomatic

- A: Asymptomatic

The etiological classification divides into:

- Ec: Congenital

- Ep: Primary

- Es: Secondary

- En: No venous cause identified

Anatomical classification divides into four categories:

- As: superficial veins

- Ap: perforating veins

- Ad: deep veins

- An: no venous location identified

Last is the pathophysiology classification, divided into four categories:

- Pr: Reflux

- Po: obstruction

- Pr,o: reflux and obstruction

- Pn: no venous pathophysiology identifiable

In advanced CEAP classification, there is an addition of 18 named venous segments to locate the venous pathology.

- Superficial veins

- Telangiectasies or reticular veins
- Great saphenous vein above the knee
- Great saphenous vein below knee
- Small saphenous vein
- Nonsaphenous veins

- Deep veins

- Inferior vena cava
- Common iliac vein
- Internal iliac vein
- External iliac vein
- Pelvic: gonadal, broad ligament veins, other
- Common femoral vein
- Deep femoral vein
- Femoral vein
- Popliteal vein
- Crural: anterior tibial, posterior tibial, peroneal veins (all paired)
- Muscular: gastrocnemius, soleal veins, other

- Perforating veins:

- Thigh
- Calf
