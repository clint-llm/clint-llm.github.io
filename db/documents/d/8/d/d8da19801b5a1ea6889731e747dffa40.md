There is no mention of the prevalence of bagassosis in recent literature, and its sex and age distribution are unknown. It is a relatively rare disease, first described in 1941. Most of the initially reported cases were in southern American states, especially Louisiana. Few cases were reported in Europe and Asia.

Recent studies in India indicate clinically significant thermophilic actinomycetes are widely present in cane sugar mills, and Thermoactinomyces sacchari and Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula are the major species responsible for the sensitization of Indian bagasse workers.
