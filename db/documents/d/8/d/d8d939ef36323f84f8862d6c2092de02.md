For cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation, there is an interprofessional requirement for Physical therapists, occupational therapists, and all levels of clinical involvement due to the acuity of patients involved.

Incorporating home exercises that are easy and safe to perform alone allows peripheral surveillance with minimal risk.
