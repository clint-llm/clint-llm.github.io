The results of physical examination and imaging studies should guide clinical management. Patients with cerebral infarct or hemorrhage require management accordingly. Consultation with neurology and neurosurgery should take place when appropriate. Patients with mass lesions or signs of increased intracranial pressure may also require admission for medical or surgical therapy.

Patients with visual field deficits may not realize the limitations of their condition and should be advised not to drive.
