The diagnosis and management of hyperviscosity syndrome is done by an interprofessional team consisting of a hematologist, nephrologist, oncologist, internist, and intensivist. HVS is an oncological emergency, and timely treatment can prevent life-threatening complications such as thromboembolic events, myocardial infarction, and catastrophic ischemia that result in multiple organ failure.  Short-term management is directed at symptom control, whereas long-term management is directed at controlling the underlying hematologic condition. The mainstays of treatment include supportive therapy, plasma exchange or plasmapheresis, and chemotherapy. The patient must be kept well hydrated at all times to prevent complications. The more definitive short-term treatment is plasmapheresis. It can promptly reverse most clinical manifestations of HVS and is usually well-tolerated and safe. Phlebotomy may be an option when one is unable to perform plasmapheresis. The key is to treat the primary cause of HVS. A hematology/oncology consultant should administer this, and it is strongly recommended to consult with this expert as soon as HVS is identified. The outcomes for patients with HVS depend on the primary tumor and the extent of spread. If the primary malignancy is beyond control, the outlook is grim.
