Patients with group 3 PH should be educated on adherence to therapy for the underlying disease resulting in pulmonary hypertension. Patients with advanced restrictive and obstructive lung disease requiring oxygen supplementation should be counseled on the continued use of oxygen therapy to avoid periods of prolonged hypoxia. Good compliance with inhalers for patients with COPD and consideration for anti-fibrotic treatment in pulmonary fibrosis may prove to be vital to slow PH progression.

Close follow-up with pulmonologists and early referral to PH experts are crucial to detect the early disease progression and initiation of therapy. Patients should be screened and referred for evaluation of lung transplants.
