**Trigeminal Corticobulbar Lesion**

A lesion of the unilateral cortex will usually result in contralateral paralysis of the muscles; however, a unilateral cortical lesion does not affect the muscles of mastication; this is because the motor nucleus receives bilateral cortical input. Therefore, those muscles will still receive innervation from the other side of the cortex.

**Lesion or Transection of Ganglion or Nuclei**

A unilateral transection or lesion of the trigeminal ganglion or the three nuclei will result in loss of sensation to the ipsilateral face. As noted above, unilateral transection of the ganglion will not result in paralysis of the muscles of mastication due to the bilateral cortical input. However, a lesion of the spinal trigeminal nucleus will result in an “onion skin” shaped loss of sensation. Thus, a lesion in the rostral portion of the spinal trigeminal nucleus will lead to loss of sensation of the mouth and nose, whereas a lesion in the caudal portion will result in loss of sensation of the lateral face.
