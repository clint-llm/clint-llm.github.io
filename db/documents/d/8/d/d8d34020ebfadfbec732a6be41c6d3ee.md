Hypertensive crisis after tyramine ingestion, also referred to as the “cheese effect,” has become increasingly rare. Most documented cases occur in individuals receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which have largely been replaced for newer classes of antidepressants with more selectivity and fewer side effects.

Tyramine and other biogenic amines (e.g., histamine) formed from decarboxylation of amino acids have been minimized in food production by the advent of culture starters with reduced carboxylase producing organisms.
