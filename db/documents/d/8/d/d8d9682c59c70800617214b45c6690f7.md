The fundamental indication for TENS is seeking to manage pain, both acute and chronic. There is an overall divide across scientific literature regarding the efficacy of TENS application for particular types of pain or pain conditions. While a significant body of work exists which suggests that TENS is effective for neuropathic, nociceptive, and musculoskeletal pain, a notable portion of these studies were noted for methodological concerns.

A look at the three types of TENS is outlined below along with their conceptual indications.

Intense TENS is used primarily as a "counter-irritant." Aiming to target small diameter, high threshold cutaneous afferent (A-delta), this type of TENS specifically seeks to block transmission of nociceptive information in nerves while stimulating other analgesic mechanisms. Both high frequencies and intensities are used for short periods of time.

Acupuncture-like TENS (AL-TENS) is an approach at hyperstimulation and often used in patients that do not respond to conventional TENS. Titration is to low-frequency, higher intensity, longer pulse width. AL-TENS aims to stimulate small diameter, high threshold peripheral afferent (A-delta).

Conventional TENS utilizes high-frequency, low-intensity, small pulse width. The goal is to stimulate selectively large diameter, low threshold non-noxious afferent (A-beta). This approach enjoys use in the treatment of dermatomal pain distributions.
