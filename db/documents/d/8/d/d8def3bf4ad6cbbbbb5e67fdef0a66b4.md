Due to safety concerns related to hepatotoxicity reported in clinical trials, it is recommended that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphate levels are measured before initiation of treatment and are constantly monitored for the duration of treatment.

It is also noted that the consumption of alcohol when taking mipomersen should be limited to only one alcoholic drink per day. This is due to alcohol possibly causing increased hepatic fat levels, which may exacerbate liver injury. Frequent monitoring of liver-related tests is recommended.

There are no clinically relevant drug interactions between mipomersen and warfarin as indicated by clotting assays, such as activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT). There are also no pharmacokinetic interactions between mipomersen and simvastatin or ezetimibe. However, drug-specific events cannot be completely ruled out before more extensive, larger, and long-term trials are conducted.

As observed in this randomized, placebo-controlled trial of mipomersen, McGowan et al. reported instances of cardiovascular events. Furthermore, since proteinuria is a risk factor for cardiovascular events, the link between proteinuria and mipomersen must be further investigated to rule out non-specific drug interactions.

Therefore, it is recommended that continued monitoring of kidney function and health is observed. A renal panel assay will rule out potential kidney impairment or disease for the duration of taking mipomersen.
