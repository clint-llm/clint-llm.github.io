The most important physical finding is upper extremity hypertension. In neonates, there can be a history of poor feeding, evidence of shock with poor perfusion, gallop heard on auscultation, and a murmur of mitral regurgitation. In significant coarctation, the femoral and dorsal pedis artery pulsations are difficult to palpate, and there is associated brachiofemoral delay. Upper extremity hypertension is most often present, and four extremity blood pressure measurements should be performed in all children and young adults being evaluated for this condition. In older children, a systolic murmur with diastolic continuation can be heard in the left infrascapular region. This murmur can represent blood flow across the coarctation or through dilated collaterals. A systolic ejection click and systolic ejection murmur in the left upper sternal border is a consistent exam finding with a bicuspid aortic valve. It is very rare in today's era for an adult to present with aortic dissection or cerebrovascular accident from an undiagnosed coarctation of the aorta.
