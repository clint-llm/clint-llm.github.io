Lichen nitidus has definitive histopathological characteristics. The hallmark of lichen nitidus is a well-circumscribed granulomatous infiltrate of lymphocytes, macrophages, Langerhans giant cells, and multinucleated epithelioid histiocytes in the papillary dermis bordered by extensions of epidermal ridges. This sharply circumscribed inflammatory infiltrate generally spans 4 to 5 dermal papillae within the dermis, giving a "ball-in-clutch" configuration.

There have been some reports of lichen nitidus being a variant of lichen planus, but both cutaneous conditions have distinct histopathological entities. Lichen planus has more uniform lymphocytes within the infiltrate that makes up mostly T helper cells (CD4+). Both have inflammatory changes and the ball-in-claw infiltrating the stratum spinosum, a thinning epidermis, and hyperkeratotic papules, but parakeratotic papules present in lichen nitidus, and orthokeratotic papules occur in lichen planus.
