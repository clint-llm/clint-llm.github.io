Educating patients on allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) involves assisting the patient in identifying their allergic triggers. Patients must then be provided with practical behavioral modifications to help decrease the inflammatory response of this disease. For instance, in professions that require regular use of rubber gloves, it is essential that patients can identify the natural rubber allergy and choose a glove type that uses a rubber accelerator (i.e., thiurams, carbamates, mercapto compounds) towards which they do not form a reaction.

A diet low in nickel and other minerals has been said to improve symptoms in some patients.
