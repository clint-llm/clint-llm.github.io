Hypertrichosis can cause severe emotional distress for patients, especially those who do not have access to permanent laser hair removal or electrolysis. Self-confidence and quality of life may be extremely low for these patients secondary to societal scrutinization and bullying in patients of all ages. In cases of severe hypertrichosis, it is imperative to arrange mental health care for patients in addition to medical care to address the underlying cause of the hypertrichosis, if there is one. The outcome of patients with hypertrichosis depends on the cause. For those with inherited disorders, there is no cure and poor cosmesis is a lifelong issue. For those with acquired hypertrichosis, the outcomes are good once the primary condition is treated or the offending medication is discontinued.
