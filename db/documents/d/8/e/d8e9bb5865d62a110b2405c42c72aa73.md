# Continuing Education Activity

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory arthritis and extra-articular involvement. It is a chronic inflammatory disorder caused in many cases by the interaction between genes and environmental factors, including tobacco, that primarily involves synovial joints. It typically starts in small peripheral joints, is usually symmetric, and progresses to involve proximal joints if left untreated. Joint inflammation over time leads to the destruction of the joint with loss of cartilage and bone erosions. RA with a symptom duration of fewer than six months is defined as early RA, and when the symptoms have been present for more than six months, it is defined as established RA. RA, if untreated, is a progressive disease with morbidity and increased mortality. This activity describes the evaluation and management of rheumatoid arthritis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the comorbid conditions associated with rheumatoid arthritis.
- Summarize the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis. 
- Outline the use of rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies in evaluating rheumatoid arthritis.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for those affected with rheumatoid arthritis.

# Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory arthritis and extra-articular involvement. It is a chronic inflammatory disorder caused in many cases by the interaction between genes and environmental factors, including tobacco, that primarily involves synovial joints.

There is no pathognomonic laboratory test for rheumatoid arthritis, which makes the diagnosis of this disease challenging in the early stages. A comprehensive clinical approach is required to make the diagnosis and prevent debilitating joint damage.

# Etiology

The etiology of RA has a significant basis in genetics. It is thought to result from the interaction between patients' genotypes and environmental factors. In a nationwide study of 91 monozygotic (MZ) and 112 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs in the United Kingdom, the overall MZ concordance rate was 15%, and in dizygotic twins, 5%.HLA-DRB1*04, HLA-DRB1*01, and HLA-DRB1*10. These HLA-DRB1 alleles contain a stretch of a conserved sequence of 5 amino acids referred to as the "shared epitope" (SE) in the third hypervariable region of their DRB1 chain, which has been associated with the risk of developing RA.

Polymorphisms in other genes are associated with RA, including PAD14, PTPN22, CTLA4, IL-2RA, STAT4, TRAF1, CCR6, and IRF5.PSORS1C1, PTPN22, and MIR146A genes are associated with severe disease.

The term epigenetics refers to heritable changes without altering the DNA sequence. These changes may be present in chromatin or the DNA. These include DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA-mediated regulation. RA-FLS (fibroblast-like synoviocytes) overexpress tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, coded by gene PTPN11, compared to synoviocytes from osteoarthritis (OA) patients, promoting the invasive nature of RA-FLS. The enhancer region of the PTPN11 intron contained two hypermethylated sites, resulting in abnormal epigenetic regulation of the gene and alteration of the function of RA-FLS.

Cigarette smoking is the strongest environmental risk factor associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Studies have shown in anti-citrullinated protein antibody (anti-CCP) positive individuals, there is an interaction between the shared epitope (SE) and smoking that increases the risk of RA.

Other environmental triggers may play a role as a trigger for RA, which is more closely associated with seropositive RA. These include silica, asbestos, textile dust, and P gingivalis.****This suggests that external exposure to various antigens in parts of the host distant from the joints then triggers an autoimmune inflammatory response in the joints. These distant locations include the lungs, oropharynx, and GI tract.Actinobacteria, Collinsella, Eggerthalla, and Faecalibacterium. Collinsella alters gut mucosal permeability and has been related to increased rheumatoid arthritis disease severity.

**Environmental Factors Associated with an Increased Risk of Developing RA**

# Epidemiology

The worldwide prevalence of RA in the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study is about 0.24%.

The period prevalence of RA was more in urban areas (0.69%) than in rural areas (0.54%). The period prevalence of RA was higher in high-income countries (0.49%) compared to low-income countries (0.35.%).

As outlined above, there is a genetic disposition towards RA, which was demonstrated to be about 40% in a large study from Sweden in 2013.

Among modifiable risk factors, cigarette smoking has the strongest association with RA.

Obesity is another well-established risk factor for RA. There is a 30% increase in the risk of RA for patients with a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 30 kg/m^2 and a 15% increased risk for those with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m^2.

There is significant literature regarding the association of RA in patients with chronic mucosal or periodontal disease. However, no clear, consistent link has been identified in well-established studies. There is evidence that mucosal injury from occupational exposures and environmental pollutants can increase the risk of RA.

# Pathophysiology

RA, in some patients, is triggered by some sort of environmental factor in a genetically predisposed host. The best example is tobacco use in a patient with the HLA-DRB1 "shared epitope" gene and the development of ACPA-positive RA.

RA patients often have antibodies to citrullinated proteins. These antibodies have been identified in patients with RA since 1964 (antiperinuclear factor)

Anti-carbamylated protein antibodies(anti-CarP antibodies) are also found in patients with RA. Carbamlyation is the conversion of lysine to homocitrulline in the presence of urea and cyanate. Myeloperoxidase converts thiocyanate to cyanate. The molecular structure of homocitrulline is similar to citrulline; however, anti-CarP antibodies are distinct antibodies that have been associated with RA in both ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative patients.

The immune response in RA starts at sites distant from the synovial joints, such as the lung, gums, and GI tract.

Patients are genetically predisposed to develop an immune response to the modified proteins, anti-modified protein antibodies (AMPA). Citrullination is produced by the action of PAD on arginine. Isoforms PAD2 and PAD4 are most strongly implicated in RA. Anti-PAD4 antibodies are found in patients with RA, are highly specific for RA, and are associated with ACPA positivity.Porphyromonas gingivalis, which causes an inflammatory reaction. There is an influx of leukocytes that produce PAD4. P gingivalis also produces a PAD-like enzyme. These enzymes can citrullinate resident proteins, which then can act as autoantigens.

Autoantibodies appear before the onset of clinical arthritis.

Cytokines and chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) activate endothelial cells and attract immune cells within the synovial compartment.

All elements of the immune system are involved, including innate immunity and adaptive immunity, which includes the cellular (T cell) immune response and the humeral (B cell) immune response.

Resident fibroblasts-like synoviocytes (FLS) are activated by proinflammatory cytokines, PGDF, and chemokines to proliferate with invasive characteristics and produce matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and ADAMTS. Chondrocytes are activated by TNF, IL-1, and IL-17, producing matric enzymes resulting in cartilage damage. Resident mast cells produce vasoactive amines, leukotrienes, proteases, and TNF. Osteoclasts are activated by RANKL, which plays a vital role in producing bone erosions.

Adaptive immunity includes T cells and B cells which respond to antigenic stimuli. In RA, one of the main antigens triggering autoimmunity is modified proteins such as citrullinated proteins.

T cells interact with B cells, activating antigen-specific B cells to differentiate into plasma cells that produce RF and ACPA. These autoantibodies bind to their antigens forming immune complexes that can further the inflammatory response by activating the complement system.

Cytokines are produced in large amounts in the synovium and play an important role in propagating an intense inflammatory response resulting in bone erosions and cartilage loss.

**Cytokines and Chemokines (CXC) Involved in the Pathogenesis of RA**

FLS = fibroblast-like synoviocytes; MCP-1 = macrophage chemoattractant protein-1; ILC3 = innate lymphoid cell group 3; MMP = matric metalloproteinase; NO = nitric oxide; PG = prostaglandins

FLS activation and proliferation, resulting in pannus, activation of chondrocytes, osteoclasts, and endothelial cells.

# Histopathology

One of the earliest histopathologic findings in RA is new synovial blood vessel growth; this leads to the transmigration of lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the synovial fluid. Angiogenesis is required to support the highly catabolic synovium and is accomplished via proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF).

The histopathology of rheumatoid synovium reviews intense FLS activation and proliferation and subsynovial accumulation of T cells, including Th1, Th17, and Treg cells. B cells also accumulate and differentiate into plasma cells. The appearance of synovial tissue can appear similar to secondary lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes. Macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, and fibroblasts are also present in the subsynovial tissue. Rheumatoid synovial tissue becomes invasive, eroding into the bone and causing marginal erosions.

Rheumatoid nodules initially have a small vessel vasculitis phenomenon followed by a chronic inflammatory granulomatous phase. The development of rheumatoid nodules is frequent in rheumatoid arthritis, involving the dermis or subcutis in peri-articular areas. When multiple, this phenomenon can be related to methotrexate therapy and is called accelerated rheumatoid nodulosis.

# History and Physical

The most common and predominant symptoms include joint pain and swelling, usually starting insidiously over a period of weeks to months. Initial joint involvement is typically in the small joints of the hands and feet, followed by larger joints. One of the hallmarks is stiffness, particularly morning stiffness.

As discussed above, RA involves small peripheral joints, usually of the hands. The axial joints can be involved, but this is limited to the cervical spine as there are synovial joints in this part of the spine. The lumbar spine is not involved.

On physical examination, the affected joint will be painful if pressure is applied to the joint or on movement with or without joint swelling. Synovial thickening with a "boggy" feel on palpation will be noted. Joint erythema and warmth are usually absent, and wrist involvement may present with typical signs and symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. With multiple joint involvements, reduced grip strength will be seen on physical testing. The classical physical findings of ulnar deviation, metacarpophalangeal joint subluxation, ulnar deviation, swan neck deformity, Boutonniere deformity, and the "bowstring" sign are seen in advanced chronic disease. Other findings in the later stages of RA include a reduced range of motion in the shoulders, elbows, and knees. In the feet, hallux valgus is common, as well as other toe deformities.

Rheumatoid nodules are the most common extraarticular manifestations of RA.

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) affects 5 to 16% of patients with RA and is associated RA specific autoantibodies and increased mortality.MUC5B promoter variant rs35705950 is associated with ILD in patients with RA. This gene encodes mucin 5B, and this variant is a gain of function. RA-ILD compared to unaffected controls, the odds ratio is 3.8 (95% CI 2.8-5.2), and RA-ILD compared to RA without ILD, the odds ratio is 3.1 (95% CI 1.8-5.4).

Ophthalmological manifestations include secondary Sjogren syndrome with dry eyes and also dry mouth.

# Evaluation

Laboratory testing often reveals anemia of chronic disease and thrombocytosis. Neutropenia may be present if Felty syndrome is present (rare). RF is present in 80-90% of patients with RA, with a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 85%. ACPA is present in 70-80% of patients, with a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 95%.

Therefore, when a patient presents with inflammatory arthritis, serological studies should be positive. In patients who are asymptomatic or those that have arthralgias, a positive RF and especially CCP predicts the onset of clinical RA.

Synovial fluid examination usually reveals a leukocyte count between 1500 to 25,000/cubic mm and is predominantly polymorphonuclear cells. Cell counts higher than 25000/cubic mm are rare and can be seen with very active disease; however, they warrant workup to rule out underlying infection. The synovial fluid in RA will also reveal low C3 and C4 levels despite elevated serum levels.

With advanced disease, joint involvement on plain radiographs will reveal periarticular osteopenia, joint space narrowing, and bony erosions (marginal). Erosions of cartilage and bone are considered pathognomonic findings for RA, although not absolutely specific. However, these findings are consistent with advanced disease.

Due to the varied clinical presentation and lack of universal pathognomonic testing for RA, diagnosing the disease can be challenging early in the course of the disease. Traditionally the presence of at least four of the following criteria for at least six weeks would classify the patient as having RA. These criteria were: morning stiffness, arthritis of three or more joints, arthritis of the hands, symmetric arthritis, elevated acute phase reactants, elevated rheumatoid factor, and radiologic evidence of RA. These criteria separated inflammatory from non-inflammatory arthritis but were not very specific for RA. It was also not sensitive to early-stage RA, which was a significant drawback.

**2010 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria for RA**

- Number and size of involved joints
- 2 to 10 large joints = 1 point (shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles)
- 1 to 3 small joints = 2 points (metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, second through fifth metatarsophalangeal joints, thumb interphalangeal joints, and wrists)
- 4 to 10 small joints = 3 points
- Greater than 10 joints (including at least 1 small joint) = 5 points

- Serological testing for rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated peptide/protein antibody
- Low positive = 2 points
- High positive = 3 points

- Elevated acute phase reactant (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or C-reactive protein [CRP]) = 1 point

- Symptom duration of at least six weeks = 1 point

A total score greater than or equal to 6 classifies the patient as having RA. Note that these are classification and diagnostic criteria, so their primary purpose is being used in clinical studies of patients with RA, including clinical trials. It is important to note that joint involvement refers to any swollen or tender joint on examination. Imaging studies may also be used to determine the presence of synovitis/joint involvement. The 2010 ACR/EALAR criteria excluded distal interphalangeal joints, first carpometacarpal joints, and first metatarsophalangeal joints from this criteria. Also, these criteria may only be applied to those patients where the joint involvement is not better explained by other inflammatory diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or psoriasis. Specific testing must be obtained to rule out these diseases. The new criteria were noted to better predict the probability of RA, have the same sensitivity as the previous criteria for the diagnosis of RA and have a higher specificity as well as a higher negative predictive value.

# Treatment / Management

The goal of treatment in patients with RA is early diagnosis and early initiation of treatment to prevent irreversible damage to the joints. The International Task Force Guidelines published in 2014 make the following recommendations regarding the treatment of RA:

- The primary goal of treatment is to achieve long-term clinical remission and optimize quality of life with the absence of signs and symptoms associated with inflammatory disease activity.

- If clinical remission cannot be achieved, low disease activity is an acceptable alternative.

- Disease activity should be assessed every month in patients with moderate to severe disease activity.

- In patients with low disease activity or clinical remission, disease activity should be assessed every 3 to 6 months.

Multiple clinical assessment tools have been developed to assist clinicians in determining the disease activity of patients with RA. An updated recommendation from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 2019 recommended using the following assessment tools because they met the minimum standard for evaluation per their recommendation.

- Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)

- Disease Activity Score (DAS)

- Disease Activity Score 28 Joints (DAS28-ESR/CRP)

- Patient-Derived DAS28

- Hospital Universitario La Princesa Index (HUPI)

- Multi-Biomarker Disease Activity Score (MBDA score, VECTRA DA)

- Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index (RADAI)

- Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index 5 (RADAI-5)

- Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3)

- Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 5 (RAPID5)

- Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI)

Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) typically used in treating RA include methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, and leflunomide. Anti-TNF-alpha inhibitors include etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol. Other biologic DMARDs include interleukin (IL) 6 inhibitors such as tocilizumab and sarilumab, T-cell costimulation inhibitors such as abatacept (CTLA4-Ig), and the anti-CD20 B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody such as rituximab. Targeted synthetic DMARDs include Janus kinases (JAK) inhibitors such as tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib.

DMARD therapy, including biologic agents and targeted synthetic agents (tofacitinib), should be temporarily held in patients with a serious active infection. They can be resumed after the infection has resolved and antimicrobial treatment has been completed.

**Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)**

NSAIDs do not have any disease-modifying effects but are commonly used to relieve symptoms related to joint inflammation and pain. There are about 20 such drugs (depending on what country you are in) that are all effective at full doses. There is some variation in side effects and toxicities. There is a class Black Box warning for cardiovascular disease, although there is variation in the cardiovascular effects among NSAIDs.

- Efficacy: indomethacin, piroxicam

- Convenience (1-2 doses per day): meloxicam, naproxen, celecoxib, nabumetone

- Overall safety: nabumetone

- GI safety: celecoxib, nabumetone

- Renal safety: possible nabumetone

- Hematologic safety (no antiplatelet effect): celecoxib, meloxicam, nabumetone

**Corticosteroids**

Corticosteroids are commonly used in patients with RA. There are several situations in which corticosteroids should be considered. In a new patient with very active RA, corticosteroids can be used as bridge therapy while DMARD therapy is instituted. Some studies show that using corticosteroids early in RA patients improves outcomes and has disease-modifying effects, including radiographic progression.

**Nonbiologic DMARDs**

This category includes methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azathioprine (AZA), sulfasalazine, leflunomide, and cyclosporine. Methotrexate is the initial drug of choice for patients with RA. The recommended treatment plan recommends an initial dose of 10-15 mg/week of methotrexate with an escalation of 5 mg/month and a target dose of 20-25 mg/week.

**TNF inhibitors**

The TNF inhibitors include etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, and golimumab. The ACR does not recommend using TNF inhibitors until a nonbiologic DMARD has been tried.

**Rituximab**

Rituximab is a biologic DMARD that can be added for treating RA if patients have uncontrolled RA and who did not respond to TNF inhibitors.

**Abatacept**

Abatacept inhibits T-cell activation by binding to CD80 and CD86. It is administered as a monthly intravenous infusion or as a weekly subcutaneous injection. Patients with uncontrolled RA, who have shown an inadequate response to methotrexate and TNF inhibitor therapy, benefit from abatacept therapy with proven efficacy from 6 months to 5 years of therapy.

**Interleukin 6 Inhibitors**

Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor inhibitor, is indicated for moderate-to-severe active RA in adults who have had an inadequate response to TNF inhibitor therapy. These patients develop clinically meaningful improvement with the use of tocilizumab.

**Janus kinase (JAK) Inhibitors**

JAK is a group of tyrosine kinases that participate in intracellular signal transduction for hematopoiesis and immune cell function. JAK inhibitors (such as tofacitinib) are oral agents that reduce the production of cytokines and are approved as second-line agents for the treatment of RA.

**ACR and EULAR Treatment Guidelines**

- According to the ACR treatment guidelines for early RA, patients who have not taken disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy should start DMARD therapy regardless of the disease activity level.

- In patients with low disease activity and early disease, monotherapy with methotrexate is the preferred treatment.

- Leflunomide or sulfasalazine are the first-line treatment in patients with a contraindication to methotrexate or intolerance to it.

- If monotherapy with DMARD does not control disease activity (regardless of concomitant glucocorticoid use), therapy should be altered. Methotrexate can be continued or discontinued at this point. Additional therapy options after failed monotherapy with DMARD are recommended as either dual traditional/nonbiologic DMARD therapy, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, or non-tumor necrosis factor biologic agents.

- In patients with established RA, who are DMARD naive, methotrexate is the preferred agent for initial monotherapy, regardless of the disease activity level.

- If monotherapy with DMARD does not control disease activity in established RA (regardless of concomitant glucocorticoid use), dual DMARD therapy, a TNF inhibitor, a non-TNF biologic agent, or tofacitinib therapy can be added.

- If disease activity remains high on TNF inhibitor monotherapy, DMARD therapy should be added in addition to the TNF inhibitor.

- If disease activity remains high despite a TNF inhibitor switch to a non-TNF biologic agent with or without methotrexate

- If disease activity remains high despite a trial of anti-TNF and non-TNF agents, use another non-TNF biologic agent before considering tofacitinib.

- If still uncontrolled despite the above trials, use tofacitinib

- If disease activity remains high despite the above combination therapies, short-term low-dose glucocorticoid therapy should be added.

- TNF inhibitors should be avoided in patients with congestive heart failure.

- Patients with hepatitis C who have not been treated or are currently not on treatment for it should receive nonbiologic DMARD therapy rather than TNF inhibitors.

**Safety Considerations with Biologic and Targeted Synthetic DMARDs**

- Serious infections: All biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs are associated with 2 to 3 times the number of infections. Hold all agents during an active infection, hold for surgical procedures, and avoid live vaccines. Opportunistic infections, including TB and fungal infections, all patients should be assessed for latent TB.

- Herpes zoster: JAK inhibitors

- Neutropenia: IL-6 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, rituximab

- Elevated LFTs, elevated cholesterol: IL-6 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors

- Thrombosis: JAK inhibitors

- CHF: TNH inhibitors

- Cardiovascular events: JAK inhibitors (Black Box warning)

- Demyelinating diseases: TNF inhibitors

# Differential Diagnosis

- Osteoarthritis

- Psoriatic arthritis

- Systemic lupus erythematosus

- Sjogren syndrome

- Polymyalgia rheumatic

- Chronic gouty arthritis

- Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease

# Staging

**Stages of RA as Defined by the ACR**

- Stage 1: No destructive changes on X-rays

- Stage 2: Presence of X-ray evidence of periarticular osteoporosis, subchondral bone destruction but no joint deformity

- Stage 3: X-ray evidence of cartilage and bone destruction in addition to joint deformity and periarticular osteoporosis

- Stage 4: Presence of bony or fibrous ankylosis along with stage 3 features

# Prognosis

Rheumatoid arthritis has no cure and is a progressive disease associated with morbidity and increased mortality. All individuals will experience multiple exacerbations and, without treatment, tend to have poor outcomes with disability and increased mortality.

Patients with RA also develop other chronic medical conditions/complications which drastically affect their outcomes. The most notable of this correlation is the relationship between RA and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease leading to accelerated coronary artery disease.

# Complications

Complications of RA span multiple organ systems and are known to worsen clinical outcomes in patients with RA. It is imperative to monitor patients for the development of these complications and quickly alter treatment plans if applicable. Frequent recurrent serious opportunistic infections occur in patients with RA, which warrants withholding DMARD therapy until they are treated. The increased frequency of infections in patients with RA is thought to be due to underlying immune dysfunction from the disease itself and the use of DMARD therapy.

**Complications and Comorbidities Associated with Uncontrolled Systemic Inflammation**

- Chronic joint inflammation results in radiographic damage, progressive deformity, and functional disability.

- Anemia of chronic disease and Felty syndrome are well-documented complications of seropositive RA.

- The secondary form of Sjögren syndrome is associated with RA and can have a prevalence of as high as 10% in patients with RA and pulmonary disease.

- Pleuritis, bronchiolitis, and interstitial lung disease are also associated with RA. Although rare, RA treatment with methotrexate and anti-TNF agents can also lead to pulmonary injury. There is also an increased risk of pulmonary embolism in RA. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) affects 5 to 16% of RA patients and is associated with RA-specific autoantibodies and increased mortality.MUC5B promoter variant rs35705950 is associated with ILD in patients with RA. This gene encodes mucin 5B, and this variant is a gain of function. RA-ILD compared to unaffected controls, the odds ratio is 3.8 (95% CI 2.8-5.2), and RA-ILD, compared to RA without ILD, the odds ratio is 3.1 (95% CI 1.8-5.4).

- Coronary artery disease has a strong association with RA.

- Patients with RA also have a greater risk of developing lymphoma, with a higher incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in these patients. The clinical course of RA in these patients is accelerated, and diffuse B-cell lymphoma is often the most common subtype.

**Complications and Comorbidities Associated with RA Disease and Treatment**

- Premature death

- Serious infections

- Osteopenia and osteoporosis are complications of the disease itself and can also be associated with drug therapies (glucocorticoids). Compared to the general population, patients with RA have a 60% to 100% increased risk of fracture.

- There is an increased risk of venous thromboembolic disease in patients with RA, as stated above, even after adjusting for other risk factors for thromboembolic disease.

**Others**

- Depression is a significant complication of RA. It is present in patients with long-term active disease and debilitating physical dysfunction. A 2013 meta-analysis reported a 17% to 39% prevalence of depression in patients with RA.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

RA has a strong genetic component and cannot be entirely avoided; however, modifiable risk factors such as cigarette smoking and consuming a balanced diet should be addressed. Patients at risk for RA should be counseled to eat a well-balanced diet, exercise regularly, and maintain healthy body weight.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disorder with no cure. It affects many other organs and is best managed with an interprofessional team to provide comprehensive care. The key is patient education by nurses, pharmacists, rheumatologists, and primary care providers. The nurse should inform the patient about the signs and symptoms of different organ systems and when to seek medical care. The patient should enroll in an exercise program to recover joint function. An occupational therapy consult can help the patient manage daily living activities. The pharmacist should educate the patient on the types of drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and their potential side effects while checking for interactions and reporting their findings to the team for therapy modification, if necessary.

At each clinic visit, clinicians and nurses should educate the patient to stop smoking, maintain a healthy body weight, get the recommended vaccinations and eat a healthy diet. The social worker should be involved in ensuring that the patient's home is liveable and the patient has ample support systems. The patient should be encouraged to join support groups. Due to progressive disability, chronic pain, and poor quality of life, many patients become depressed and need a mental health nurse and counselor to cope with their disease. A comprehensive interprofessional team can provide a multi-faceted approach to treating RA and improving patient outcomes. [Level 5]

RA has frequent relapses and remissions. While some patients have mild disease, others may have a disease that severely affects their quality of life. Worse outcomes are usually seen in patients with a high titer of autoantibodies, HLA-DRB1 genotypes, age younger than 30 years at onset, multiple joint involvements, female gender, and extra-articular involvement on presentation. In addition, the drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis also have potent side effects, which often are not well tolerated. As the disease progresses, many patients will develop adverse cardiac events leading to death. The overall mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is three times higher than in the general population.
