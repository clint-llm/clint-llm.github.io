Known complications of the important zoonotic diseases are as follows:

- Influenza: Secondary pneumonia, myositis, myocarditis, encephalitis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome

- Salmonella: Bacteremia, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and mycotic aneurysms

- WNV: Meningitis, encephalitis, chorioretinitis, fatal hemorrhagic fever, hepatitis, and myocarditis

- Plague: Meningitis, shock, DIC, and multiorgan failure

- COVID-19: Respiratory failure, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, shock, thromboembolic manifestations, acute kidney injury, and systemic inflammation

- Rabies: Seizures, coma, respiratory failure, arrhythmias, and myocarditis

- Brucella: Arthritis, meningitis, pneumonia, orchitis, abortion, uveitis, and endocarditis

- Lyme: Bannwarth syndrome, facial palsy, meningitis, atrioventricular blocks, acrodermatitis chronica atrophica, and post-Lyme syndrome

The economic impact of zoonotic diseases is a major concern, mostly due to its notorious effect on international travel, tourism, and trade, especially about animals and animal products. For example, the avian flu 2015 outbreak has caused a $3.3 billion loss to the U.S. economy.

Many zoonotic diseases also have the potential for causing severe complex diseases in transplant patients and other immunocompromised individuals. Also, many of them can be utilized as bioterrorism weapons.
