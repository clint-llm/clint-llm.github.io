CTEPH is a potentially curable disease, and clinicians should distinguish it from other conditions that cause the presence of thrombotic and fibrotic changes in the pulmonary arteries. First of all, a differential diagnosis with idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension (IPAH) merits consideration.

Another differential diagnosis is the primary sarcoma of the pulmonary artery, which is a very rare disease with nonspecific symptoms that make it hard to differentiate from CTEPH. Sarcoma represents a solid lobulated mass in central pulmonary arteries on CT or MRI and has no response to anticoagulation treatment. Positron-emission tomography (PET-CT) with F-fludeoxyglucose can be performed to distinguish sarcoma from CTEPH.

In rare cases, right heart failure with acute pulmonary thromboembolism can mimic CTEPH. In the case of acute thromboembolism, emboli form at an acute angle with pulmonary artery wall, while in CTEPH, that angle would be obtuse. Also, the right ventricle hypertrophy is less likely to be seen in acute PE.

Other differential diagnoses include thrombosis in situ, Takayasu arteritis, congenital proximal interruption of a pulmonary artery, tumor thrombus, Von Recklinghausen disease, and Osler-Weber-Randu disease.
