At a granular level, the pathophysiology of IIC patterns is incompletely understood, although it is speculated to encompass several distinct generative mechanisms. Well-substantiated hypotheses have included abnormal synchronization of damaged neural networks, a fusion of diseased neurons through ephaptic connections, and condensation of migratory oscillatory patterns that emerge from the disruption of inhibitory cortical interneurons.

Witsch et al. demonstrated a correlation between discharge frequency and tissue hypoxia at discharge rates greater than 2 Hz following an initial increase in blood flow at rates lower than 2 Hz, suggesting inadequate compensation for increased metabolic demand.

Investigation ofÂ TBI patients with IIC patterns has revealed elevated lactate/pyruvate ratios in the local diseased milieu, with a clear association between LPDs and increased glucose metabolism on FDG-PET.
