Both of the renal arteries branch off of the aorta and divide into five segmental arteries: the posterior segmental artery, superior segmental artery, anterosuperior segmental artery, anteroinferior segmental artery, and inferior segmental artery. These segmental arteries branch into interlobar arteries which continue to become the arcuate arteries. As collecting ducts span both the cortex and medulla, more than one aspect of the renal vasculature may supply them. In the cortex, interlobular arteries branch perpendicularly off ofÂ arcuate arteries, which lie at the borders of cortical and medullary tissue. Arcuate arteries give rise to radial arteries. In the medulla, vasa recta capillaries are present (specifically around loops of Henle). The renal veins and branches follow the path of the renal arteries.

Lymph from the kidneys primarily passes through the hilar lymphatic route. This route involves lymphatic vessels traveling along the renal vasculature to reach aortic and caval nodes eventually. From these nodes, lymph proceeds to the thoracic duct.
