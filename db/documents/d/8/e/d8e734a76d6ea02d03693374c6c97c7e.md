Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy are common. Symptoms usually begin prior to 9 weeks gestation, and the majority of cases are resolved by week 20 of gestation. A minority of patients, approximately 3 percent, will continue to experience vomiting during the third trimester. Approximately 10 percent of patients with hyperemesis gravidarum will be affected throughout the pregnancy.
