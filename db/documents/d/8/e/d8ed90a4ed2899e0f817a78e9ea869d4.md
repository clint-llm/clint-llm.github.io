The majority of papillomas are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). There are over 170 subtypes of the virus. Usually, types 6, 7, and 11 are mostly associated with papillomas and are called low-risk types as they don't usually cause precancerous lesions and rarely progress into cancer. HPV has been found to cause papillomas to arise almost anywhere in the body with stratified squamous epithelium, like the skin, conjunctiva, oropharynx, larynx and upper trachea as well as the anogenital tracts.

Studies conducted have found HPV6/11 in 96% to 100% of all Genital wart lesions.

There is evidence of vertical transmission of human papillomavirus from mothers to their infants.

It is worth noting that some papillomas are non-viral in origin as in the inverted papilloma of the urinary tract which has strongly been associated with smoking.
