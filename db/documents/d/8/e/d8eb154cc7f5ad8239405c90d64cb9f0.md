Narcolepsy type 1 occurs when nearly all of the neurons that contain orexin (also called hypocretin) are lost. HLA haplotype DQB1*0602 is present in 95% of narcolepsy type 1 patients, but this is also present in about 20% of the general population without narcolepsy

In 2009 there was an increase in the number of cases of narcolepsy type 1 reported in Europe after receiving the European AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic influenza vaccine (Pandemrix) and it was initially thought that the immune response to the adjuvant might have been the cause of the disease. The same adjuvant was, however, also used in Canada but the corresponding increase in reported cases did not occur there. Additionally, there was an increase in the number of reported cases of narcolepsy in non-vaccinated patients after wild A(H1N1) pandemic influenza infection.

The mechanism of narcolepsy type 2 is less clear, but it is thought that it may be due to a similar but less severe loss of orexin neurons.

**Narcolepsy is classified as follows based on clinical features:**

- Narcolepsy with hypocretin deficiency but no cataplexy

- Narcolepsy without hypocretin deficiency but with cataplexy

- Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, narcolepsy, and deafness

- Autosomal dominant narcolepsy, type 2 diabetes, and obesity

- Narcolepsy caused by another medical disorder
