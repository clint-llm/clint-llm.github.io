When the diagnosis is suspected, it is imperative as initial work up to perform a blood gas, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram. The blood gas will reveal metabolic acidosis. The chest radiograph will show cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary markings. The electrocardiogram, typically, has nonspecific findings which include biventricular hypertrophy or right ventricular predominance. The echocardiogram will define the site of the disruption. Other imaging modalities used for the diagnosis of this entity are cardiac angiography, computed tomography angiography of the chest, and magnetic resonance angiography. These modalities are used to get a more comprehensive understanding of the lesionâ€™s anatomy before surgical repair.

In addition to the imaging studies, all patients should have a fluorescence in situ hybridization since there is a high association with chromosome 22q11 deletion, which is associated with DiGeorge syndrome. Serum calcium may be low in patients with DiGeorge syndrome.
