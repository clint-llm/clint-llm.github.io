Practice Guidelines

- Psoriasis is considered extensive if more than 10% of the body surface area involved

- Even localized disease can lead to severe impairment and mental stress (eg nail or joint disease, face, palms, genitals)

- Always start with topical therapy first for localized disease

- If the disease is extensive, consider methotrexate or cyclosporine.

- Consider biological therapy early and assess response promptly

- Women of childbearing age started on biological therapy should use effective contraception

- Live vaccinations should not be given to mothers who receive biological therapy

- TNF antagonists should not be used in patients with demyelination disorders, heart failure

- Phototherapy can be used as monotherapy. Short term psoralen plus UV light is more effective than light therapy alone.

- Genitals should be protected when using ultraviolet therapy

- Folate supplementation is recommended for women of childbearing age receiving light therapy
