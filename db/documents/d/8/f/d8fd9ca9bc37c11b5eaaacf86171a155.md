**Surgery in Adults with Congenital Heart Disease**

Except for the Bicuspid aortic valve, many patients with congenital heart defects, if they remain untreated, die in infancy or early childhood.

A multidisciplinary approach is the essence of The preoperative evaluation of patients with CHD undergoing noncardiac surgery. The latest guidelines of the task force for safe delivery systems for patients with CHD recommend that the management of these patients should occur in an adult congenital heart disease center.

Adults with CHD are usually psychologically affected due to previous exposure to anesthesia and complex cardiac surgeries. Premedication with anxiolytics and hypnotics should be done cautiously in the preoperative period. The American Heart Association's recent guidelines state that only patients with cardiac defects or conditions associated with a high risk for fatal outcomes should continue antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery.

Utilizing conventional anesthetic techniques can easily manage adults with CHD if they have complete anatomic repair and have no evidence of functional deterioration. In contrast, patients with complex CHD and palliative or interventional procedures require specific intraoperative management. Anatomical and physiological concerns of specific palliative repairs are essential for choosing appropriate intraoperative monitoring. These patients have difficult vascular access due to previous vessel catheterization, and central venous access can be complicated with complex CHD. Transesophageal echocardiography might be helpful in adults with CHD undergoing noncardiac surgery to monitor intravascular volume status and ventricular function.

The anesthetic management of patients with CHD for noncardiac surgery has no specific recommendations. Due to the enormous scope of CHD abnormalities, it is impossible to propose a single approach that may address each cardiac defect.

The primary goal of intraoperative management is to promote optimal tissue oxygen delivery, the balance between systemic and pulmonary circulations, and the optimization of hematocrit. Knowledge of anesthetic agents is necessary to choose a specific volatile or intravenous anesthetic agent based on the patient's physiology and the overall intraoperative management goals. The use of etomidate and ketamine is well studied in these patients for induction of anesthesia as it maintains peripheral vascular resistance and ventricular performance.

Anesthetic management is greatly affected by shunting. Patients with intracardiac shunts are prone to air embolization due to right-to-left shunting, so in that case, all intravenous lines should be de-aired before use. Anesthetic management aims to balance systemic and pulmonary blood flow by meticulously managing the hemodynamic effects of ventilation, positioning, pharmacological agents, and blood loss.

Cardiac intensive care units should postoperatively manage these patients with CHD and high-risk surgery. The significant risks during the postoperative period are bleeding, dysrhythmias, and thromboembolic events.
