Viloxazine was first discovered when scientists tried to synthesize compounds with propranolol-like structures with CNS modulating properties.

The history of viloxazine began in 1970 when it was first marketed to adults in Europe and the United Kingdom in an immediate-release formulation as an antidepressant medication used to treat depression. Viloxazine has since been reformulated as an extended-release formula. Most recently, the drug has received FDA approval for use in the pediatric population between the ages of 6 to 17 to treat attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD).

The exact mechanism of action of viloxazine is unclear, but research suggests it may behave as a serotonin-norepinephrine modulating agent.

Viloxazine was shown to have some epileptogenic properties in some patients. Caution should be used when prescribing to patients with a history of seizures or neurological disorders. Numerous studies have shown the lack of anticholinergic side effects in viloxazine compared to other tricyclic antidepressants. The lack of anticholinergic side effects makes this a possible candidate for treating depression in older populations.

This article focuses on the FDA-approved extended-release formulation, which was approved by the FDA for ADHD therapy in April of 2021.
