The management of patients with giant cell tumor of bone is best when utilizing an interprofessional team that includes primary care doctors, radiologists, pathologists, surgery oncologists, and orthopedists. Oncology trained nurses, pharmacists, and physical therapists should also assist in the case. The patient will often present to his or her primary care doctor for pain or swelling, which should prompt imaging that may identify the lesion. If suspicious for a malignant lesion, a biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis. After treatment, patients require long term follow-up to evaluate for recurrence. Depending on the location of the lesion, the patient's treatment may vary. If denosumab therapy is necessary, the oncology board-certified pharmacist should consult on the dosing and duration of treatment. If there is excision of bone, rehabilitation is required to regain muscle and joint function. The pharmacist and a pain specialist may manage the pain. Irrespective of the direction of treatment, the oncology specialty nurse will play a significant role, from patient workup, coordinating referrals, assisting in procedures, and counseling patients, while also monitoring progress and reporting to the treating clinician any concerns that arise. Physical therapy may be required to help with ambulation. Open communication between the interprofessional team members is vital to improving outcomes. [Level 5]
