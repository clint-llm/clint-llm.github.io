LP is a rare genetic disease that requires interprofessional collaboration for optimal patient care. Patients with suspected LP should undergo a comprehensive workup with several specialists, including a dermatologist, neurologist, psychiatrist, otolaryngologist, dentist, and geneticist. It is important to assess disease burden and to evaluate for any possibly life-threatening manifestations. Patientsâ€™ symptoms and quality of life should be assessed frequently. Additionally, genetic counseling may offer patients a better understanding of their condition and its mode of inheritance.
