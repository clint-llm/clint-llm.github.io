Chickenpox or varicella is a contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The virus is responsible for chickenpox (usually primary infection in non-immune hosts) and herpes zoster or shingles (following reactivation of latent infection). Chickenpox results in a skin rash that forms small itchy blisters which scab over. This activity describes the cause, presentation, and pathophysiology of chickenpox and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the treatment and prevention of this infection.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of chickenpox.
- Review the presentation of chickenpox.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for chickenpox.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with chickenpox.
