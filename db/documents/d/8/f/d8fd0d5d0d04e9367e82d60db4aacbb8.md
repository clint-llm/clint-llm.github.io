Sea urchin envenomation occurs when a sea urchin spine penetrates the soft tissue of the victim. Frequently spines break off and remain in the soft tissue, causing tenosynovitis, granulomas, or systemic symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, paresthesias, weakness, abdominal pain, syncope, hypotension, and respiratory distress. This activity examines how to properly evaluate and manage sea urchin envenomation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of sea urchin envenomation.
- Describe the evaluation of sea urchin envenomation.
- Outline the management options for sea urchin envenomations.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies to enhance the prevention and management of sea urchin envenomation in order to improve patient outcomes.
