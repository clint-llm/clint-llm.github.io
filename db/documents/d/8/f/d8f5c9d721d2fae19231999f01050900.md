Multiple organ systems can have involvement following a penetrating injury to the groin. A spectrum of arterial and/or venous injuries are possible, presenting acutely as life-threatening hemorrhage, expanding hematomas, or pulse deficits; conversely, injuries may be occult initially with subsequent development of pseudoaneurysms or traumatic arteriovenous fistulas. The most common injured vascular structures are the superficial and common femoral arteries, with iliac artery, iliac vein, femoral vein, profunda artery/vein, and great saphenous vein injuries possible. Neurologic injury may occur, including injuries to the femoral and sciatic nerves. Wounds to the proximal groin can result in small bowel or colon injuries, and clinical suspicion must remain high. Bladder or urethral injuries may be present. Orthopedic trauma such as pelvic or femoral fractures from the projectile impact may result.
