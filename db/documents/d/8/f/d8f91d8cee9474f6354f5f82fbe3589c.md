Bell palsy is the commonest cause of unilateral facial paralysis. While benign, the condition does have moderate morbidity and can lead to loss of vision. Thus, the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team.

The cause of Bell palsy remains unknown, and its treatment remains controversial. While steroids and/or antiviral medications are often prescribed, there are no randomized clinical trials to determine which is better or effective. The problem is compounded by the fact that the majority of cases resolve spontaneously. However, in individuals with long-standing facial paralysis accompanied by poor speech, incomplete eyelid closure or poor aesthetics, treatment needs to be addressed by an interprofessional team. Because the disorder affects different organ systems, a multidisciplinary team of clinicians has proven effective. The most important feature of the treatment is to be patient-focused rather than symptom focus.

In any case, all clinicians including the pharmacist and nurse practitioner must educate the patient on eye protection and lubrication. Eye dryness should be prevented at all costs using tears and other liquid preparations.
