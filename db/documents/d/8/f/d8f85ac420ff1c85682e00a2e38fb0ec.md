Usually, the disease will remain localized with slow peripheral extension. There can be central scarring. The early lesion can occasionally be an ulcer.Â  After months or many years, large hyperkeratotic masses have formed. They can be as large as 3 cm thick. Secondary ulceration can occur; however, the lesion is usually painless. Satellite lesions result from scratching. In some cases, there can be lymphatic spread resulting in the sporotrichoid pattern. Hematogenous dissemination is very rare, but brain abscesses can occur.
