In the United States, 2.5 percent of the population is short. The Utah Study, a population-based survey of growth in children, concluded that endocrine disorders constitute only a small number of cases with short stature. People of both sexes are affected, but males are more likely to be brought to medical attention because of the prevalence of social expectations.

Different ethnic groups have different average statures, which are essential to take into consideration while comparing mean parameters. Because these variations exist, it is recommended to compare the height of an individual with people from the same population only, if specific growth charts are availableÂ . Malnutrition is a notable etiology of retarded growth in kids, especially in developing countries. Many efforts have been in process by the government and non-profit organizations to curb this.
