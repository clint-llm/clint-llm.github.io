To understand the indications for performing otoplasty, one must appreciate facial analysis.  The pinna is ideally positioned approximately 15 to 20 mm from the helical rim to the scalp. Prominauris, which is the main indication for performing otoplasty, is seen when the auriculocephalic angle is greater than 30 degrees.  The ideal auriculocephalic angle ranges from 20 to 30 degrees. Additionally, the vertical height of the ear should be approximately six centimeters.

Innervation of the external ear is elaborate and involves multiple cranial nerves which include: auriculotemporal nerve from the trigeminal nerve, facial nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve, Arnold’s nerve from the vagus nerve, and nerves from the second and third cervical plexus.
