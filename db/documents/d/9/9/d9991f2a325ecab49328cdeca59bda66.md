The prognosis largely depends on the size of the defect and associated congenital anomalies and syndromes. As such, large omphalocele with associated abnormalities have a higher mortality rate. Also, neonates with liver protrusion through the defect appear to have a poorer prognosis. The overall survival rate is close to 80%, which reflects the efficacy of prenatal diagnosis and the decision taken by many families to terminate pregnancies with severe anomalies.
