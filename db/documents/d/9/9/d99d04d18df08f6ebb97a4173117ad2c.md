Besides physicians, the pharmacist, nurse, and physical therapist's role are critical in managing hypercholesterolemia. The nurse is ideal for educating the patient about lifestyle changes, eating a healthy diet, and resuming an active lifestyle. The pharmacist should ensure compliance with the statin medications and offer antismoking aids. Furthermore, the pharmacistÂ should also be aware of statins' side effects like muscle pain and liver damage; and ensure that regular blood work is performed.

The patient should enroll in an exercise program and achieve healthy body weight.
