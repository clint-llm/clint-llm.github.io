Psoas syndrome is a rare injury to the iliopsoas muscle, typically seen in athletes, often runners, dancers, and high jumpers. It usually results from overuse or trauma. It is frequently known as jumpers hip or dancers hip. It is a frequent cause of groin pain in athletes, especially in kicking sports or adolescent athletes during a growth spurt. Furthermore, iliopsoas tendonitis following total arthroscopic hip replacement iliopsoas syndrome can be reasonably commonplace. Psoas syndrome can often be secondary to iliopsoas bursitis, as well as a variety of other musculoskeletal disorders. Most patients respond to conservative management, but refractory cases may require advanced imaging to aid in the diagnosis, plus corticosteroid injections or surgical intervention for pain relief. Providers should keep psoas syndrome on their differential diagnosis for patients presenting the anterior hip or groin pain with a history and physical suggestive for iliopsoas injury. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of psoas syndrome and explains the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of psoas syndrome as a medical condition.
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of psoas syndrome.
- Outline the management options available for psoas syndrome.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance psoas syndrome and improve patient outcomes.
