There are three embryological theories mechanism tracheal bronchus formation.

- The reduction theory suggests it results from the reduction of a previously developed bronchus.

- The migration theory explains it to be the extension or migration of a part of the developed hyparterial branching pattern to a different location either on the trachea or bronchus.

- The selection theory postulates that local morphogenesis disturbances cause bronchial abnormalities, claiming that bronchus can arise if the bronchial mesenchyme comes in contact with the tracheal epithelium.
