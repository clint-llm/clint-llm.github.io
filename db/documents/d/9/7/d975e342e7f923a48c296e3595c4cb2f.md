Prompt detection of a bleed requires an astute clinician. A thorough history and physical will raise suspicion and requires timely intervention. Some forms of hemorrhage will present due to hypovolemia, and this can result in hypovolemic shock. Care must be taken to distinguish this entity from other etiologies of shock. Other bleeds, such as those in the brain, have very little room for the excess blood to accumulate before pressures rise and evoke mental status and neurological changes. Other differentials to consider are migraine headaches, meningitis/encephalitis, tumor, electrolyte abnormalities, stroke, myocardial infarction, intoxication/poisoning, to name a few.
