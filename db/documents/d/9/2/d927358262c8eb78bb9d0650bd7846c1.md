EPS may be challenging to distinguish from other idiopathic movement disorders. Muscle rigidity and tension are nonspecific symptoms that may be observed in neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, and other movement disorders. Chorea and athetosis are also present in Huntington disease (distinguished based on family history and genetic testing), Sydenham chorea (identified with a history of streptococcal infection), Wilson disease (adolescent-onset with a defect in copper metabolism), and cerebrovascular lesions.
