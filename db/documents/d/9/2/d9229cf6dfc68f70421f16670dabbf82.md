Autorefraction is a basic investigation to assess the refractive error in a patient presenting to the routine outpatient setting. It serves as a start point for subjective refraction and helps optometrists and ophthalmologists to pinpoint the refractive error accurately.

Patient satisfaction and outcome result fromÂ the multidisciplinary approach of the ophthalmologist and the optometry team. Autorefractors also help to reduce patient waiting time at large volume centers.
