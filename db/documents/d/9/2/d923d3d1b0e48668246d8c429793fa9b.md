Bradycardia associated with hypotension may be the first clue to diagnose beta-blocker overdose. In comparison to calcium channel blocker overdose, which may mimic beta-blocker overdose, patients with BB toxicity have hypoglycemia and altered mental status. While symptoms secondary to beta-blocker overdose usually appear early and are commonly observed within one to two hours, the risk of toxicity is greatest up to 20 hours in cases involving sotalol toxicity. The QTc prolongation secondary to sotalol may prolong up to three to four days and may warrant close observation in a unit setting. Correctable causes of QTc prolongations should be investigated, and medications that may prolong QTc should be avoided. Sustained-release preparations and beta-blockers with longer half-lives may require extended monitoring. Vital signs should be monitored, continuously and 12 lead EKG should be done at frequent intervals.
