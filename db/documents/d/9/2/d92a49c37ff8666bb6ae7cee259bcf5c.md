Prognosis at the early stage is good since steatosis or steatohepatitis lesions may be reversible after alcohol withdrawal. In the stage of cirrhosis, the lesions are irreversible, and the prognosis becomes poor. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma at this stage is imperative. Patients with a DF greater than 32 and MELD score higher than 20 predicts higher mortality with a diagnosis of severe alcoholic hepatitis. Critically ill patient has a 30-day mortality rate of more than 50%. The presence of ascites, variceal bleeding, severe encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome indicates poor prognosis.
