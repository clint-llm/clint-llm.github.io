Insufficient insulin and/or poor oral intake may lead to the development of ketosis. If not recognized and treated appropriately, ketoacids increase and cause acidosis which if severe, may require hospitalization. Rates of admission for diabetic ketoacidosis are low with most children never requiring admission, though approximately 5% of children are admitted per year, and approximately 1% are admitted multiple times each year.
