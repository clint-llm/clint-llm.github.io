The most common causes of dentoalveolar trauma include falls, especially in children, cycling, full-contact sports, traffic accidents, and assault. Dental trauma most frequently occurs at home, school, and sports centers.

Anatomic features that increase the likelihood of dentoalveolar trauma include protuberant upper teeth, overjet (over 3 mm), anterior open bite, malocclusion (Class II), incompetent lips, and mouth breathing.
