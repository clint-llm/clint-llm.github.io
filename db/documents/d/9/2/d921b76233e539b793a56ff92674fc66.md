- Cardiogenic shock: Cardiogenic shock complicating anterior MI is associated with higher hospital mortality when compared to inferior MI.

- Left ventricular dysfunction

- Left ventricular mural thrombus. Left ventricular mural thrombus is a frequent complication with systolic dysfunction due to anterior MI.

- Ventricular septal rupture

- Free wall rupture

- Pericardial effusion from free wall rupture

- Acute mitral regurgitation (MR) from papillary muscle rupture

- Pericarditis

- Sudden cardiac death secondary to ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF): VT/VF that occurs after 48 hours requires an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. An ICD is indicated in patients 40 days post-MI with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% with a New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III, patients 40 days post-MI LVEF of 30% with NYHA class I, and patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), an LVEF of <40% and inducible VT on an electrophysiology study (EPS).

- Conduction abnormalities including Mobitz type II block at the level of His bundle or below His bundle and RBBB with either left anterior fascicular block or left posterior fascicular block

- Left ventricular aneurysm
