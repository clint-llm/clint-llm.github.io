HIV encephalitis is a complication of HIV infection, which presents with neurocognitive dysfunction of varying severity. Almost half of HIV-infected patients suffer from this condition during their illness. Prompt administration of antiretroviral therapy is the most effective treatment choice for this condition. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and treatment options for HIV encephalitis and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and optimally managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology and pathophysiological processes involved in the development of HIV encephalitis. 
- Outline the clinical presentation of a patient with HIV encephalitis.
- Describe the diagnostic modalities and treatment options for HIV encephalitis.
- Explain the importance of collaboration among the interprofessional team in identifying and appropriately managing patients with HIV encephalitis.
