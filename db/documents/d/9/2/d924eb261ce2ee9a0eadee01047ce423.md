Strabismus occurs when the eyes are misaligned such that an object is not focused simultaneously on the fovea of each eye. A phoria is defined as the turning of an eye in (esophoria) or out (exophoria) upon occlusion of the opposite eye.Â Phorias are often asymptomatic but may degenerate into tropias. Tropia is a spontaneous eye turn in the absence of an ocular occlusion. Tropias are often more prevalent with tiredness as phorias become more pronounced, and the ability to compensate decreases. Certain drugs can result in temporary tropias.

Amblyopia results when the vision in one of the eyes becomes reduced because the eye and the brain are not working together correctly. Strabismic amblyopia is the result of eye misalignment and is treated initially by patching the good eye to force the child to use the amblyopic eye, and may ultimately require strabismus surgery. After age five, it is difficult to reverse amblyopic vision.

Extraocular muscle paralysis can occur due to disease or injury and may involve one or multiple muscles.
