Assessment of any patients with Pilar cyst begins with members of an interprofessional team of nurses and physicians taking a thorough history and careful physical examination which is usually enough to reach the diagnosis in most of the cases. Rarely, biopsy of the lesion is needed for the diagnosis. Reassurance of the patient is very important. Patients who are interested in surgical treatment should be aware of the consequences of surgery since scar formation can be more disfiguring to the patient's image rather than the lesion itself.
