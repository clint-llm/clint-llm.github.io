Although polymyositis is a rare disease, it has been found to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality due to its associated comorbid conditions, e.g., the involvement of major vessels or gastrointestinal tract, etc. Patients with polymyositis have about 2.2% risk of having myocardial infarction as compared to the general population.

Polymyositis affects the distal musculature of the esophagus in the late stage of disease in up to 70% of the patients leading to the inability to swallow, as well as regurgitation problems that can cause aspiration pneumonia.

PM can induce a hypercoagulable state in the plasma leading to the increased incidence of thromboembolism.
