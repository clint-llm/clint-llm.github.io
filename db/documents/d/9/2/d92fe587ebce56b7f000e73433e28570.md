A variety of spinal navigation or adjunct technology can aid in the safe delivery of spinal instrumentation. These include the use of c-arm fluoroscopy, CT image guidance, robotic technology, dynamic surgical guidance, and combinations of the above technology. The decision is largely guided by the surgeon’s comfort and preference as well as realities of cost and availability. New technologies and improving technologies are emerging.

Neuromonitoring for maximal expiratory pressure, somatosensory evoked potential, and spontaneous and triggered EMG is extremely beneficial.
