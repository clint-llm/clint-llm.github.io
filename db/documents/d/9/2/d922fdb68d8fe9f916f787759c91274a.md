Similar to the SA node, the AV node has the potential to be a pacemaker. The difference in nodes is the rate with the SA node 60 to 100 bpm and AV node 20 to 60 bpm. Pacemakers cells in the nodes depolarized during diastole through Funny current Na+ and K+ channels that increase, which triggers an action potential. The action potential upstroke involves Ca2+ rushing in contrast to Na+, which is prominent in the myocyte action potential. The cell them repolarizes to its resting membrane potential due to the efflux of K+.
