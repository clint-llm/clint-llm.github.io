MEN4 is phenotypically very similar to MEN1. Therefore, the evaluation (laboratory and radiological) of MEN4 to screen for associated clinical conditions are similar to MEN1. Investigations are used to evaluate parathyroid, pituitary, neuroendocrine, and reproductive organ tumors. Carcinoid tumors and meningioma can also occur in patients with MEN4.

**Parathyroid Gland**

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common presentation. The biochemical investigations include calcium, parathyroid hormone, Vitamin D, and 24-hour urine calcium and creatinine. Once the biochemical diagnosis is confirmed, an ultrasound of the parathyroid glands is recommended. If the result of the parathyroid ultrasound is not clear, then a 99-Technetium Sestamibi scan should be undertaken. If both parathyroid ultrasound and 99-Technetium Sestamibi scan are unclear, then parathyroid four-dimensional (4D) computed tomography (CT) can be considered. It is suggested that screening for hyperparathyroidism with calcium and parathyroid hormone should be initiated at age 15 years in patients with confirmed MEN4.

**Pituitary Gland**

Evaluation of the pituitary gland is mainly limited to undertaking biochemical testing of anterior pituitary hormones. These include growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin (PRL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and thyroxine (T4). As mentioned above, acromegaly and Cushing disease are more common in MEN4. Dynamic testing like oral glucose tolerance test for growth hormone excess and overnight dexamethasone suppression test for cortisol excess, etc., can be undertaken if initial history or initial investigation is suggestive of hormone excess. Prolactinomas are rare in MEN4. Nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas can occur in MEN4. They can cause pressure effects or hypopituitarism. Visual fields may need to be assessed. Radiological evaluation of the pituitary gland includes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary. Screening investigations (biochemical and radiological) for pituitary pathology can be initiated in adolescence.

**Neuroendocrine Gastropancreatic Tumors**

Only a few cases of gastrointestinal and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are reported in MEN4. Gastrinomas are the most common functional tumors in MEN4. Screening for gastrointestinal and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors should be initiated as per MEN1.

**Others**

MEN4 can affect multiple other organs, as discussed above. However, due to the paucity of literature on MEN4, it is difficult to provide any guidance regarding the evaluation of tumors in other organs. Therefore, evaluation should be based on clinical judgment and performed on a case-by-case basis.

**Genetic Analysis**

MEN4 screening should be done in all patients with MEN1 in the absence of MEN1 gene mutation. All first-degree relatives of patients with MEN4 should be offered genetic testing.
