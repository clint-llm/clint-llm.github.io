TBM is a severely disabling condition; therefore, besides optimum medical management, it requires intensive rehabilitation to minimize disability and speed up recovery. The comprehensive rehabilitation program should be initiated while the patient is in the hospital or the intensive care unit and continue well into their homes after discharge. It should involve multimodal sensory stimulation to improve the functional recovery of the brain, scheduled posturing and positioning to prevent immobilization-related issues, passive and active range of motion to maintain muscle power, and chest physical therapy to prevent hypostatic pneumonia and aspiration. Long-term rehabilitation should be offered to all patients with residual neurological sequelae.
