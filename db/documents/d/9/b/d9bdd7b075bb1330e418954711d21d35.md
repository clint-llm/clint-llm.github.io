# Introduction

Macroergonomics is the formal study of work systems.****As applied to healthcare, the human-task/tool interface represents the "microsystem." Individuals interacting as teams or organizations represent "mesosystems," while more complex sociotechnical interactions create the "macrosystem."  Regardless of which sub-system is under evaluation, the "systems approach" to HFE will always clearly map the interventions to the macrosystem.

Quality improvement initiatives frequently employ training as a means to reach error reduction. This approach is appropriately applicable when developing/testing new techniques, practicing new techniques in a safe/low-risk environment, gaining individual experience with sensorimotor dependent techniques, or improving team processes/interactions, while practicing or testing emergency responses. It is a common misconception, however, that HFE strives to eliminate human error.  The paradigms more accurately align with creating systems that are resilient to unanticipated events by utilizing a thoughtful design process. To this end, the modification of tools and techniques creates more sustainable improvements in safety than behavior modification through training alone.

# Function

From a healthcare perspective, the primary goal of HFE becomes the optimization of technology design and care systems to achieve productivity, safety, efficiency, and quality in the care delivery process.****Secondarily, the science works to enhance the wellbeing (experience, joy, satisfaction, health, and safety) of anyone (patient, staff, or visitor) who interacts with the system.

# Issues of Concern

A recent addition to HFE research methodology is the concept of “human-centered design.  While human factors professionals amass years of expertise, the discipline incorporates multiple investigatory skill sets, and there exists no “standard” set of training criteria.

# Curriculum Development

From a "countermeasure" perspective, the avoidance, capture, and mitigation of error represent three patient safety lines of defense.  Simulation is most effective when there is adequate task alignment - the reproduction of required skills allows for the successful completion of the tasks.

From an adverse event perspective, multiple different applications of simulation have been suggested to aid in the investigation and mitigation process, including:

- Using the high-fidelity simulation of key activities, like an end-to-end major incident investigation, for emergency investigator training

- Bringing relevant participants together from multiple organizations for testing, reversing, and improving coordinated investigation to improve investigative infrastructure

- Exploring contributory factors, developing, and testing solutions through the simulated recreation of conditions/events underlying serious safety incidents.

- Probing systems vicariously to uncover latent safety issues while applying safety 1 and/or safety 2 principles

# Clinical Clerkships

Within healthcare education, human factors skills are often described as either technical or non-technical. Technical skills generally refer to the medical and procedural knowledge necessary for delivering competent patient care.

Medication prescribing is another healthcare delivery skill that is inherently error-prone, regardless of the clinical setting.  To assess the "communication- human information processing" model of HFE of medication prescribing, scenario-based simulations were integrated into a counterbalanced, crossover design study. Researchers assessed usability, perceived workload, and error frequency concerning system alerts triggered during this process.  After combining participant feedback with the efficiency linked to intrusive alerts,  the process was redesigned, and a modestly significant reduction in workload was attained.

The ability to recognize and integrate information regarding life-threatening conditions is paramount in the critical care setting.  Mixed methods studies have highlighted the benefit of utilizing simulation to evaluate clinical pattern recognition and intervention in these circumstances as well.

Recently, the following consensus definition of non-technical skills was published: "A set of social (communication and teamwork) and cognitive (analytical and personal behavior) skills that support high-quality, safe, effective, and efficient inter-professional care within the complex healthcare system."

# Procedural Skills Assessment

From an educational perspective, transfer-appropriate processing occurs when the cues available during information encoding/memorization are the same as those expected to be available at the time of memory recall. This approach requires a priori team task analysis to determine appropriate fidelity for task alignment for the taskwork skills related to individual performance, and the teamwork skills (cognitive, behavioral, and attitudinal) representing the performance of the team as a whole.

In the peri-surgical arena, the Oxford Non-technical skills (NOTECHS), which have both been used to assess team and behavior skills, and subsequently adapted for use in other environments.**.**Score improvement was noted in both simulated and actual trauma resuscitations after team training sessions. These higher scores were correlated with better performance in both simulated and actual team resuscitations, as evidenced by higher task completion rates and faster time to completion.  Notably, there was a higher intraclass correlation for video review situations than real-time assessments of either simulated and actual resuscitations (0.71 vs. 0.44 to 04.8, respectively).****This tool has subsequently been translated and validated with use in international multi-professional trauma simulations.

In the surgical environment, the observational teamwork assessment for surgery (OTAS) was used for the evaluation of non-technical skills. This was subsequently adapted to the medical resuscitation process through the development of the Observational Skill-based Clinical Assessment Tool for Resuscitation (OSCAR). With a Cronbach's alpha > 0.8: (0.736 to 0.96), the tool demonstrated high internal consistency in its ability to assess six behavioral domains of 3 separate rapid response team members (airway, team leader, and nurse). Investigators suggest this tool could be used in simulation centers, as well as simulated and authentic ward environments.****

The simulation team assessment tool (STAT) also evaluates domains of medical resuscitation: basic skills, circulation, human factors, and overall performance. Investigators were able to show excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC for overall performance equals 0.81), as well as the ability to discriminate between expert and resident teams (P < 0.01 for basic skills; p = 0.02 in circulation, human factors, and overall performance).****Recently, the NRP steering committee approved the use of a performance tool developed through simulated resuscitations.  The tool demonstrated excellent agreement, with an intra-class coefficient of 0.86**,**and was generalizable between academic and non-academic hospitals (p = 0.98).

The human factor skills for healthcare instrument represents an international, multidisciplinary collaboration to improve the assessment of human factors in the clinical setting. After undergoing an iterative approach to tool refinement, the final instrument was evaluated with 711 trainees. It was found to be valid and reliable in its ability to assess self-efficacy in non-technical skills across multiple clinical professions.

# Medical Decision Making and Leadership Development

Leaders of high-performance teams rely on the critical skill of Situational awareness (SA). Three cognitive levels of SA include the perception of available information, the comprehension/interpretation of the perceived information, and anticipation of future events based on this comprehension/interpretation. When used in the simulated setting, the Situation Present Assessment Method (SPAM) process is a validated and reliable method used to assess SA through the evaluation of latency periods. After warning the participant of a pending "query," the latency between this warning and its acknowledgment is considered a measure of cognitive workload. The latency between the query and the answer, however, is considered a proxy measure of SA.  By carefully crafting the timing and the content of the queries, each level of SA can undergo assessment.

The ability to facilitate effective communication is another crucial leadership skill.  Of ten human factor foci considered most relevant for patient safety, the WHO identified "communication failure" as a significant and recurrent contributor to adverse events. They assert that there is a clear relationship between communication skills, teamwork, and simulation-based medical education.

Additional communication-related topics ripe for clarification include "outer-loop" communications. This includes how team members decide what items are "relevant" to the team leader, or when the appropriate timing for team leader updates would be**.******In one study utilizing inter-professional simulation to evaluate the response to neurologic emergencies, investigators identify concepts of clear communication. Approaches such as "stating the obvious," "announcing what you are doing," and "repeating information back" to ensure its accuracy were highlighted.  Further, while the development of a "flat-hierarchy" was considered conducive to all team members being "heard," assertive communication was a requisite expectation of each team member's role to best support error prevention and other patient safety principles.

# Clinical Significance

Simulation-based CRM can provide results translatable to patient outcomes.  This fact is exemplified in the results of the prospective evaluation of the Medical Team Training program utilized by the Veterans Administration.  Investigators identified a dose-response relationship between training and mortality**.**For every three months of training, there was a commensurate reduction of 0.5 deaths per thousand operations.

In an observational study of the impact of ward culture on the escalation of care, debriefing sessions revealed that explicit"permission to act" empowered staff to facilitate this process. By protecting training time, participant attendance at these sessions was greater than 95%.  The cost-benefit analysis revealed a reduction in PICU bed associated costs by £801,600 per year (£2400 per day x 334 PICU bed days).  Furthermore, these savings substantially exceeded the costs of regular team training. Investigators suggested that future research should include the financial impact on providers of "failure to rescue."****

In a multicenter study evaluating training for IHCA response, survival rates were significantly higher for patients in hospitals with more active participation in simulation training (42.8% versus 31.8%; P less than 0.0001). This effect was true for large and medium-sized hospitals and did not significantly change after adjusting hospital expected mortality through logistic regression. The adjusted OR of 0.62 (CI 0.54- 0.71; P less than 0.001), represented an additional 151 potential lives saved - a substantial benefit given a cost of only 1.1 additional simulation/100 beds/year/life saved.

# Pearls and Other Issues

The human factors have demonstrated  important role in the development of simulation to optimize performance. Therefore, the principles of human factors and ergonomics can be applied to improve human and system performance.

The human factors should be integrated into simulation-based education to make it more relevant to clinical practice.

The human factors are more relevant in emergency medicine simulation, particularly when there is limited time to think and therefore can significantly influence outcome.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Leadership can support the establishment of "a culture of habitual excellence" through the use of briefings and debriefings to demonstrate transparency and sharing of problems. Thoughtful crafting and/or facilitation of the debriefing process is demonstrated by the ability to establish the following essential elements: psychological safety, debriefing stance/basic assumption, debriefing rules, and a shared mental model. In a meta-analysis of factors moderating the efficiency and effectiveness of debriefing, researchers revealed that a general discussion of overall performance is enhanced when reflecting on specific past events couples with cue-strategy associations. This allows participants to examine actions and their underlying cognitions more deeply. Periods of silence allow for active listening and support transitions between difficult topics. This approach also provides an opportunity for facilitators to evaluate non-verbal communication and determine if participants are "ready to learn."

Through the simulation design process, contextual factors are augmented to optimize workflow representation, thus promoting the natural execution of tasks.**.******Functional task alignment can be confirmed by measuring participants' immersion in the simulation session.****As previously noted, the incorporation of global rating or behavioral assessment tools into the debriefing session allows for discussion of roles and expectations of the team as a whole**.******Finally, by asking open-ended questions, and confirming that learning objectives have been addressed, this critical component of successful healthcare simulation delivery optimizes the reflective experience of the participants.****By enabling teams and individuals to experience the appropriate conceptual, emotional, and physical fidelity of high-risk situations without the potential for patient injury, high fidelity simulation is well suited to HFE********through CRM.
