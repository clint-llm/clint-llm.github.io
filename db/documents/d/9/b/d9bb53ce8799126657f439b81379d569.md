This condition is typically a result of nerve injury secondary to compression, traction, or direct trauma, causing a process of local swelling, edema, or even partial or complete laceration. The compression and/or traction often occur secondary to repetitive motions causing inflammation or architectural changes to the surrounding tissue. There are varying degrees of nerve damage severity. In mild cases, the compression of the nerve causes no permanent damage to the nerve, and the nerve sheath fully recovers. More severe cases can cause permanent damage to the nerve and/or nerve sheath, causing persistent deficits.

Multiple classification systems exist to categorize nerve injury grading. A popular one is the Sunderland Classification which is detailed as follows:

- 1st degree

- mild neurapraxia (traction/compression)
- At most in early/low-grade nerve injuries, the myelin sheath is compromised

- 2nd degree

- only the myelin sheath and axon are injured or disrupted

- 3rd degree 

- injury with endoneurial scarring; all components of the peripheral nerve are injured except the perineurium and epineurium
- most variable degree of ultimate recovery

- 4th degree

- the nerve in continuity, but at the level of injury, there is complete scarring across the nerve; only the epineurium remains intact

- 5th degree

- included within Seddon's neurotmesis

Correlating Sunderland and Seddon's classification systems with one another:

- Seddon first degree neurapraxia is the same as Sunderland 1st degree injury

- Seddon second degree axonotmesis is the same as Sunderland 2nd degree injury

- Seddon third-degree neurotmesis injuries span Sunderland 3rd, 4th, and 5th-degree injuries
