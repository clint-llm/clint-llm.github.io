The talus receives its blood supply from three main arteries, the posterior tibial artery, peroneal artery, and anterior tibial artery (transitioning as the dorsalis pedis artery). The posterior tibial artery runs inferiorly and splits into posterior tubercle branches, which form a vascular plexus that supplies the medial and lateral tubercles. The posterior tibial artery continues inferiorly then breaks into the tarsal canal artery, which runs through the tarsal canal. The deltoid branch of the tarsal canal artery supplies the medial third of the talus body, while the rest of the talar body receives supply directly by the tarsal canal artery. The dorsalis pedis artery runs inferiorly, and it gives off the lateral tarsal artery, which forms anastomoses with the peroneal artery, from which the tarsal sinus artery originates. The tarsal sinus artery forms an anastomosis with the tarsal canal artery, where the tarsal canal artery enters the sinus tarsi. The medial tarsal branches of the dorsalis pedis artery supply the superomedial half of the talar neck, while the inferior talar neck branches of the tarsal sinus artery or tarsal canal artery supply the inferolateral half of the talar neck.
