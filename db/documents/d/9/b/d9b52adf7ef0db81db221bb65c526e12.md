- The most common presentation with common peroneal nerve injury or palsy is acute foot drop, although symptoms may be progressive and can include sensory loss or pain.

- Weakness in foot eversion may occur if the superficial peroneal nerve component is involved.

- Weakness in dorsiflexion of the foot and great toe extension suggests deep peroneal nerve involvement.

- The pattern of sensory loss suggests either superficial or deep peroneal nerve involvement or both.

- The prognosis for common peroneal nerve injury is good following end-to-end suture repair as well as grafting.
