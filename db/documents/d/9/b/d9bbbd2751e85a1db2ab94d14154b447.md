Although it may take time to obtain control of the symptoms, the prognosis for most patients with brucellosis is excellent. The overall risk of relapse is very low. However, in patients with comorbid disorders like heart or lung disease, the condition can be disabling. The prognosis is poor in patients who present with congestive heart failure due to endocarditis. Unlike many other infection disorders, the condition tends to improve with physical activity rather than bed rest. The recovery usually takes 3-6 months. When recurrence does occur, it may be either local or systemic. Overall mortality in acute or chronic cases of brucellosis is very low, certainly less than 5% and probably less than 2%.
