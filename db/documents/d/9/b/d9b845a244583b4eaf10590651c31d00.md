Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome management requires an interprofessional team approach with the involvement of multiple specialties. Primary care physicians play the most important role in identifying patients with APLS. Hematologists and rheumatologist play a crucial role in the diagnosis, management, and follow up. Involvement of other specialties such as neurology, nephrology, cardiology, dermatology may be needed if the specific organ system is involved. Anticoagulation clinics can play a significant role in monitoring therapeutic warfarin levels, and INR with close follow up. Pharmacists can assist in the management of these patients, especially by identifying drug interactions because the metabolism of warfarin is affected by several medications. Close communication between the interprofessional team with close monitoring of the patient is vital in the management of APLS.
