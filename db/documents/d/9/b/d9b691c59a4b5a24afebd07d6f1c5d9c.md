Strangulation injuries occur when external forces are applied to the neck leading to a variety of traumatic pathology. If the injury is severe enough cerebral perfusion and oxygen delivery is threatened and can lead to asphyxia and rapid neuronal death. These injuries can be encountered in various clinical scenarios and may be present in suicide attempts, sports injuries, motor vehicular trauma, and may have implications in the fields of criminology and forensic pathology. This activity describes the etiology, pathophysiology, and management of strangulation injuries, and stresses the role of the interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the causes of strangulation injuries.
- Describe the pathophysiology of strangulation injuries.
- Summarize the treatment options for strangulation injuries. 
- Explain a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by strangulation injuries.
