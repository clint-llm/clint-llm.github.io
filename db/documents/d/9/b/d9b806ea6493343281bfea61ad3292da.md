Currently, there is no widely accepted gold standard diagnostic technique.

Radiographs, including anteroposterior, lateral, and skyline views, are recommended to exclude any acute bony injuries or pathologies. Radiographic changes on the tendon might be noted, such as elongation of the involved pole of the patella, calcification, inferior traction spur known as enthesophyte in chronic cases, and increased density within the patellar tendon matrix. However, these changes are rare in the first six months of symptoms. MRI scans would be indicated in chronic cases and for surgical planning. It can show thickening of the patellar tendon, which is more diagnostic than the presence of edema. Foci of increased signal intensity in both T1 and T2  images have been observed. In chronic cases, MRI scans may reveal the absence of the posterior border of the fat pad. It is often the proximal part of the tendon which is affected and thickened.
