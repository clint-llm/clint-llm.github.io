Treatment is usually not recommended for patients with MGUS. As there is a risk of progression to lymphoproliferative malignancy long-term follow-up is advised.

If a patient has an IgM M-protein, bone marrow biopsy and computed tomography (CT) scanning of the abdomen may be helpful in detecting Waldenström macroglobulinemia or other lymphoproliferative disorders.

MGUS-associated neuropathies are usually not treated, except in the case of a disabling IgM monoclonal gammopathy or IgG/IgA MGUS associated with chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP). About 80% of patients with IgG/IgA MGUS CIDP respond to one of the typical CIDP treatments and some patients stabilize without therapy. MGUS patients with associated osteopenia or osteoporosis may benefit from treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates.

The intensity of follow-up in patients with MGUS is guided by risk stratification. Initial follow-up at six months is recommended, with subsequent visits scheduled according to the level of risk. If clinical trials of preventive strategies are available, patients at high risk for progression should be encouraged to participate.
