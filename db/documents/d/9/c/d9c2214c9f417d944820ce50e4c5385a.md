The sensory homunculus is a topographic representation of the sensory distribution of the body found in the cerebral cortex. This topograph usually has body parts illustrated along the surface of the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe. The topography of the sensory homunculus corresponds to the contralateral side of the body. Starting from the medial aspect of the postcentral gyrus, this area corresponds to the sensory territory of the genitals and lower extremities. Moving more laterally along the postcentral gyrus, the superior to superolateral regions of the gyrus corresponds to the neck, shoulder, and torso. While along the lateral side of the postcentral gyrus, this region corresponds to the upper extremity and hand. The inferolateral region of the postcentral gyrus corresponds to the facial and bulbar structures. Interestingly, the face is the structure that takes up the most area of the sensory homunculus.

The sensory homunculus is a map along the cerebral cortex of where each part of the body is processed. The sensations occur all along the body. The impulses from the body will be sent into the spinal cord and eventually back to the brain to be processed. While the trigeminal nerve carries the face's sensations. The thalamus processes all these sensory impulses, and then the thalamus will send it to the cerebral cortex. The final destination of the sensory impulses is along the postcentral gyrus. This sensory map is what the sensory homunculus illustrates.
