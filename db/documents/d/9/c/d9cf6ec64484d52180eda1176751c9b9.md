The pooled worldwide prevalence of diabetic foot ulceration was 6.3%. North America had the highest prevalence of 13%; Oceania had the lowest prevalence of 3%. The prevalence in Africa was 7.2% which was higher than Asia 5.5%. Diabetic foot ulceration was more prevalent in male patients with diabetes mellitus, 4.5%, than female patients, 3.5%. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) had a higher prevalence of ulceration at 6.4% compared to patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), 5.5%.

In a systematic review and meta-analysis by Zhang et al. published in 2016, patients with diabetic foot ulceration had the following characteristics: older age (61.7 plus or minus 3.7 versus 56.1 plus or minus 3.9), longer diabetic duration (11.3 plus or minus 2.5 versus 7.4 plus or minus 2.2), lower body mass Index (BMI, 23.8 ± 1.7 versus 24.4 plus or minus 1.7), higher percentage of smokers (29.1%, 95%CI: 18.3% to 39.8% versus 17.4%, 95% CI: 12.4% to 22.4%), hypertension (63.4%, 95%CI: 49.4% to 88.3% versus 53.1%, 95%CI: 33.8% to 72.5%), and diabetic retinopathy (63.6%, 95%CI: 38.8% to 88.3%% versus 33.3%, 95%CI: 13.8% to 52.7%) than patients that did not develop diabetic foot ulceration.
