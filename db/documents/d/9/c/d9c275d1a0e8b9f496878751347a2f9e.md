Treatment of pectus carinatum typically falls into one of three categories: non-surgical bracing, surgical correction, or cosmetic concealment.  Orthotic braces are the first option for treatment as acceptable results are often achievable, and the use of the external brace does not preclude surgical intervention if it is unsuccessful.

Surgical repair has been classically performed using the technique developed by Ravitch in 1949.

Some patients not seeking medical treatment for correction have turned to bodybuilding to sculpt the musculature around the chest wall deformity in a way that minimizes the appearance of the protrusion.  While this does not correct the abnormality, it can improve self-esteem and confidence.  For female patients, breast augmentation has also been used to alter the physical appearance of the chest to make the pectus carinatum less apparent.
