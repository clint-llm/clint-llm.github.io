Microspherophakia is often present in association with different other developmental anomalies. This has also been well recognized as part of syndromic associations like Weil Marchesani syndrome. The prevalence for Weil Marchesani has been estimated at 1 in 100,000. Though isolated microspherophakia has been identified in different ethnic groups, its prevalence is not much studied. A study from India reported the prevalence of microspherophakia as 1.2% among children presenting with some lens abnormalities to the clinic.
