An annular fissure can be concentric, transverse, or radial in orientation and may involve some or all layers. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2 sequence, the annular fissure is hyperintense (bright) compared to the rest of the annulus fibrosus (which is normally hypointense or dark) due to the relative increase in water content at the fissure compared to the normal annulus fibrosus.

If there is herniation of intravertebral disc material, there must be incompetence of the annulus fibrosus, and thus, an annular fissure or annular tear must be present even if not specifically visualized on the imaging. Thus, an annular fissure or annular tear can be implicated any time intravertebral disc herniation is identified.

If a patient is unable to have an MRI, a computed tomogram (CT) myelogram may show nerve root or cord compression from a disc protrusion. The CT scan can not identify the edema of an annulus fibrosus tear or fissure and thus, it is less sensitive than MRI.
