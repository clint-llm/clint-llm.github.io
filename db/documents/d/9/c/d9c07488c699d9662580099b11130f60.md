Prognosis is entirely dependent on the pathologic etiology underlying the tumor. Benign pathology requires surgical intervention if mass effect from the tumor causes pain, neurovascular entrapment, or cosmetic complaints. These patients with surgical resection have a good prognosis. However, patients with a malignant pathology have a guarded prognosis. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary; yet, metastatic disease has a comparatively poor prognosis.
