Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic technique useful for noninvasive visualization of organs and soft tissue structures.

A major advantage of MRI is the ability to produce high-quality images with superior soft-tissue contrast without using ionizing radiation. The magnet generates images based on the specific and unique magnetic properties of the tissues driven by the spin properties of hydrogen molecules.

MRI does not exist without hazard – the magnetic field can be dangerous and strict parameters are in place to ensure patient safety. Pre- imaging screening protocols are in place to assess the patient’s risk factors ranging from occupational exposures to surgically implanted devices determined to be incompatible with the magnetic field. Though many of the newer generation implanted devices are MR compatible, it is crucial to consult with both the radiologist and MR technologists. The magnetic field can alter implanted devices and result in loss of function, positioning, and temperature changes. Additionally, while some prosthetic devices- like heart valves, stents, and artificial joints- are MR safe, they may cause signal artifacts that limit the diagnostic quality of the exam.
