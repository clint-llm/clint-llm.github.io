A mutation of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2) along with increased expression of interleukin-1-alpha is considered an important factor in the pathogenesis. Other possible factors include gamma-secretase and filaggrin. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of somatic mutations in NEK 9 in nevus comedonicus. NEK9 has been postulated to be important in the regulation of follicular homeostasis. The NEK 9 mutations are associated with increased phosphorylation at Thr210, indicating activation of NEK9 associated kinase. The formation of the comedones in nevus comedonicus also has been associated with other changes such as loss of markers of follicular differentiation and ectopic expression of keratin 10. A recent study has suggested a role for upregulation of ABCA 12 in nevus comedonicus.
