Often, low-grade pelvic organ prolapse can easily be managed by a single general obstetrics and gynecology provider. More advanced cases may require referral to a urogynecologist for more aggressive intervention. Pelvic organ prolapse associated with comorbid disorders, including stress urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, defecatory dysfunction, or alternative abnormalities in the lower urinary tract, may benefit from an interprofessionalÂ team as depicted by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).
