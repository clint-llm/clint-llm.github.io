Arginase deficiency (argininemia) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by hyperammonemia secondary to arginine accumulation. The disorder is rare and is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a pediatrician, geneticist, endocrinologist, and dietitian. The disorder is sometimes identified during the screening of the newborn. The ammonia levels can vary according to the patient’s age and status, presenting initially with a reduction of growth and moving to milestone development and cognition. Sometimes when not treated, the disorder leads to regression.

Often diagnosed at birth through newborn screening (NBS), affected newborns are found to have elevated levels (up to 4 times) of arginine. Its management corresponds classically as another urea cycle defect, with mild or absent hyperammonemia and, if present, responds adequately to reductive ammonia actions. Chronic treatment consists of protein restriction along with nitrogen-scavenging medications.
