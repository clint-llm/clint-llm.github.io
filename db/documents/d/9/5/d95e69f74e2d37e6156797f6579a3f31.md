Patient satisfaction and relief of symptoms are very valuable to caregivers in the age of medicine. Managing the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation has become a challenge and is encountered more often by clinicians with new treatment regimens and prolonged survival of oncology patients. The incidence of peptic ulcer disease is also on the rise, with population migration from regions endemic to Helicobacter pylori, lifestyle changes, and overuse of pain medications like NSAIDs, particularly with the move away from opioids. Understanding and using drugs like sucralfate requires the effort of an interprofessional healthcare team, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, and mid-level practitioners), nurses, and pharmacists can provide the best patient outcomes with the fewest adverse events.

Interprofessional team coordination can take on several forms. Clinicians will order or prescribe the medication. Nursing can provide patient counseling, coordinate refills, and serve as the contact point for the prescribing clinician. The pharmacist is tasked with checking the dosing and frequency of administration, providing additional patient counseling regarding how to use the medication, watching for potential adverse events, and contacting the prescriber with any concerns. These are just a few examples showing how interprofessional team coordination and information sharing will optimize patient outcomes. [Level 5]
