The main issue of concern with Ohm law is that the calculations can become complex with advanced circuitry and electrochemical phenomena. For example, the overall resistance is comprised of different types of resistance, such as Ohmic resistance, mass transfer resistance, and charge transfer resistance. In optimizing the electrical performance of devices, there is a trade-off, reducing one resistance can increase another. This is a major consideration in design and optimization studies to find what values are best for a given application. Often, these different types of resistance are difficult to measure and require sophisticated machines to provide accurate values. Additionally, the resistance also changes over time as the structural integrity of a device degrades. This can also change the expected results of Ohm law if this is not considered.
