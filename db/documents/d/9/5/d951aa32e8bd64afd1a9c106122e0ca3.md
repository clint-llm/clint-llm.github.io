Doxycycline hyclate works systemically in various tissues. Compared to other tetracyclines, its high lipophilicity allows doxycycline to cross multiple membranes to reach target molecules. Tetracyclines act as cationic coordination complexes to cross the OmpF and OmpC porin channels in gram-negative bacteria. Similarly, in gram-positive bacteria, the electroneutral, lipophilic form traverses the cytoplasmic membrane. Uptake across the cytoplasmic membrane is energy-dependent and driven by the proton motive force.

The bacteriostatic action of tetracyclines, like doxycycline hyclate, is intended to stop the growth of bacteria by allosterically binding to the 30S prokaryotic ribosomal unit during protein synthesis.

Tetracyclines, such as doxycycline hyclate, present immunomodulating properties that inhibit leukocyte movement during inflammation by preventing calcium-dependent microtubular assembly and lymphocytic proliferation.

Bacterial ribosomal protection proteins Tet(O) and Tet(M) employ a variety of resistance mechanisms that include efflux, enzymatic degradation, and rRNA mutations. Tet(O) prevents tetracyclines from attaching to the primary binding site. Tet(O) and Tet(M) displace tetracyclines from the ribosome and increases the disassociation constant, Kd, and allow the aa-tRNA to bind to the A site so protein synthesis can resume.
