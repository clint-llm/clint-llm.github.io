Apocrine hidrocystoma is a benign cystic lesion that typically occurs on the face. It is a rare lesion that may be encountered by the nurse practitioner or the primary care provider. A referral to a dermatologist is highly recommended. The diagnosis may be suspected from certain clinical characteristics, but the formal diagnosis is based on histological examination. Management of apocrine hidrocystoma mainly involves surgical excision; however, other treatments such as electrodesiccation, carbon dioxide laser vaporization, botulinum toxin A, and trichloroacetic acid can be tried in multiple lesions, as in the treatment of eccrine hidrocystomas.
