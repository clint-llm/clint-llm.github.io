Ocular burns can be a true ophthalmic emergency. Prompt assessment and intervention are necessary to minimize the amount of tissue damage that occurs in the minutes to hours after the injury. After the initial insult has been appropriately managed, care must be taken to ensure appropriate specialist follow-up. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of ocular burns and highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing the potential complications from ocular burns.

**Objectives:**
- Review the types of ocular burns.
- Describe the initial management of ocular burns.
- Review the role of therapeutics in the management of an acute ocular burn.
- Explain how to optimize patient outcomes through appropriate care coordination and communication between acute care providers and ophthalmology.
