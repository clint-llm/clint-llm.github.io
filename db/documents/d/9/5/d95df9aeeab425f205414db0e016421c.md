Some adverse effects include anaphylaxis, changes in behavior, withdrawal, and central nervous system (CNS) depression. In rare situations, patients have reported tongue, larynx, or glottis swelling in the form of angioedema. Also, patients have reported shortness of breath, airway closure, nausea, and vomiting. If patients report these, do not re-administer the patient with the drug. Patients who experience closure in the throat, glottis, or larynx should be sent to the emergency department.

Changes in behavior and abnormal thinking have been reported as well. In addition, patients have shown aggressiveness and extroversion, which is abnormal for the person's usual behavior. Patients with alcohol or drug toxicities have experienced auditory and visual hallucinations associated with strange behavior and agitation. The patient was also found to experience a behavior called sleep-driving, in which the patient drives while not fully awake after intake of sedative-hypnotic with no recollection of the event. Consumption of alcohol or any other CNS depressant was found to increase these events as they enhance sedation when combined. In these cases, the drug needs to be discontinued. Patients who are depressed should also not take zolpidem as it worsens depression and suicidal ideations and actions.
