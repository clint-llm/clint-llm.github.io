Chronic alcohol consumption can have deleterious effects on the central and peripheral nervous systems. One of the most common adverse effects seen in patients with chronic alcohol use disorder is alcohol neuropathy. This commonly presents with pain, paresthesias, and ataxia in the distal lower extremities. The exact number of people affected by this condition is not known, but studies have shown that up to 66% of patients with chronic alcohol use disorder may have some form of the disease. The cause is multifactorial, from both nutritional deficiencies and alcohol metabolism's direct toxic effects on neurons. Because of the diverse effects of alcohol on the body, these patients should be managed by an interprofessional team. The management of alcoholic neuropathy is not satisfactory. The treatment rests on abstinence from alcohol and the replacement of key nutrients. Unfortunately, patient compliance is poor and the condition often progresses leading to poor quality of life. Even in patients who quit alcohol, residual neuropathy is common. (Level V)
