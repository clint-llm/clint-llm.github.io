A theatre brief is necessary at the start of the theatre session. Before the procedure begins, the surgical team should complete the WHO theater checklist.

For a fasciotomy of the leg, the patient is positioned supine. The leg should be prepped and draped to above the knee.

For a forearm fasciotomy, the patient should be positioned supine with the arm abducted to 90 on a table extension. The patient should then be prepped and draped to above the elbow.
