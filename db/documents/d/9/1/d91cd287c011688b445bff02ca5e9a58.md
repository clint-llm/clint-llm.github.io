NVG complications can be categorized as complications of the disease process and complications of the treatment modalities.

The complications of the disease process include corneal decompensation due to prolonged elevation of IOP, ectropion uvea due to contracture of the fibrovascular membrane over the surface of the iris, and angle of the anterior chamber, and loss of vision from retinal ischemia or glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

The most common complication of the surgical management of control of IOP is hyphema, which ranges from 4 to 85%.

Late complications such as phlebitis, bleb leak, endophthalmitis, though rare, can be expected in eyes undergoing trabeculectomy, irrespective of the indication of the surgery. Complications specific to GDD include erosion of the conjunctiva overlying the GDDs (up to 12.5% eyes), tube block, corneal endothelial defects due to touch with the tip of the tube (up to 3 to 14% of the eyes).

Complications of TSCPC include phthisis and scleral thinning.Â  All surgical treatments, particularly TSCPC, carry a risk of sympathetic ophthalmia.
