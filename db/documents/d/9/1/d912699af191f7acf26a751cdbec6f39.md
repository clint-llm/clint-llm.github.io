Laboratory testing should include viral hepatitis studies, autoimmune profiles, quantitative immunoglobulin levels, iron studies, alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1A) phenotype and level, Wilson disease markers, and celiac disease markers.

A definitive diagnosis will also require a biopsy. Histological markers include a predominant type and distribution of inflammation, cellular ballooning, Mallory-Denk bodies, glycogenated nuclei, foci of macrosteatosis, bile ductular proliferation, and apoptotic bodies.
