During this pandemic time, patients should avoid close contact with another patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 or having signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. Get vaccinated, wearing masks, hand washing, and social distancing are principles to reduce the risk of infection. Patients with underlying cardiac disease, hypertension, cardiac transplant patients, or patients taking immunosuppressive medications should take extra caution to avoid getting infected, considering the data we already explained above. CDC also supports these recommendations.
