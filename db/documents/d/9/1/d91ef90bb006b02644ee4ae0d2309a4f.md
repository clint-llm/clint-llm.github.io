Both IHH and hepatic CH may be clinically silent and may only be detected on ultrasonography performed for other indications, such as routine prenatal ultrasound. When of significant size, they may be detected as hepatomegaly on physical exam.

Most lesions are asymptomatic at presentation. If symptomatic, presenting features may include high output heart failure, hypothyroidism, or compression of local structures, as discussed in the pathophysiology section. In the case of CH, a mild transient coagulopathy may produce a petechial rash.

In the case of multifocal and diffuse IHH, an association has been noted between cutaneous and hepatic IH. Multiple cutaneous IHs may indicate an underlying IHH. It is recommended if 5 or more cutaneous IH are noted the infant undergoes a liver ultrasound.
