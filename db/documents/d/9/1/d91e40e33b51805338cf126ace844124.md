It is widely recognized that a stent’s metallic surface is thrombogenic; consequently, a significant feared sequel is acute vascular closure by acute stent thrombosis due to atheroma rupture, platelet activation, and tissue factor release during and after angioplasty. To prevent acute stent thrombosis, it is recommended to perform PCI under anticoagulation (AC) with the balanced risk of thrombosis and access site bleeding complication. AC can be achieved with multiple agents such as heparin (low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated), bivalirudin, P2Y12 blockers, direct thrombin inhibitors, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. However, bivalirudin is associated with lower risk of access site bleeding complication, thrombocytopenia, and mortality, but studies show that bivalirudin is associated with slightly higher risk of acute stent thrombosis than with heparin. Notwithstanding, heparin can rarely cause hHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). When a patient has previously had HIT, bivalirudin should be used for AC. Activated clotting time is used to manage periprocedural heparin use. After informed consent, the thigh or wrist area is shaved. Propofol is given intravenously to sedate the patient preoperatively. Midazolam is associated with respiratory depression, so propofol is preferred. The incision is made, and the artery is punctured via Saldinger technique, and the 5F sheath is introduced. With fluoroscopic guidance, coronaries are catheterized with use of dye.

In 5% to 10% of cases, a more complex lesion might be discovered. For example, these lesions may be very long, chronic with total occlusion and calcification, non-dilatable, and lesions with anatomical variations such as located at bifurcation or ostium. These require lesion preparation before stent implantation. The goal of lesion preparation is to facilitate optimum stent delivery and expansion and reduce the risk of distal plaque embolization. Several procedures are available to achieve this goal, such as directional or rotational coronary atherectomy, cutting balloon, FX miniRAIL catheter and arthroplasty for heavily calcified plaques. OCT guidance is necessary to implant stent in these cases accurately.
