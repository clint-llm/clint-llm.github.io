To effectively deter the course of this disease, clinicians must adequately educate patients on the potential signs and symptoms previously discussed. It is also equally important to make necessary alterations in daily life if a patient does begin to notice symptoms. Patients with established sensory neuropathy should limit their exposure to temperature extremes and monitor sudden, obvious changes in gait patterns to diminish the effects of repetitive micro-motion to their feet; modifications in shoe gear may also be necessary.

For diabetic patients, an established daily foot screening protocol should be performed daily for early detection of possible lesions. These patients should also schedule frequent visits with their podiatric physician at least every 2Â to 3 months for formal evaluation and care as part of a holistic approach to the management of their sensory neuropathy. A primary care physician or an endocrinologist also plays a vital role in the overall management of diabetes and the limitation of sensory neuropathy symptomatology.
