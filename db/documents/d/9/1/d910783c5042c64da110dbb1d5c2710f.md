The patient's axilla is prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The patient is supine with the arm of the affected side at 90 to 100 degrees of abduction on an arm board. The landmark used superficially for the axillary incision is the inferior axillary hair line. An oblique incision is made, and electrocautery is typically used to dissect through the subcutaneous tissue to access the axillary fat pad once the clavipectoral fascia is incised. Once this is identified, many surgeons will identify the axillary vein and begin dissection inferior to this. Retraction is used to elevate the pectoralis muscles to dissect out the level two lymph nodes. Typically, most of this dissection can be performed bluntly. The axillary specimen is usually removed en bloc. The cavity is examined, and hemostasis is achieved as necessary, taking care to not injure any of the surrounding nerves or major vessels. A small drain may be left in place, with the exit point at a site other than the incision. The drain is sutured in place. The axillary incision is closed based on surgeon preference. Some sort of compressive dressing can be used postoperatively to provide some support and decrease seroma formation in addition to the drain.
