The proximal blood supply to the maxillary nerve and the mandibular nerve at the region of the pons is the anterior inferior cerebellar arteries.

The lymphatic drainage of the alveolar nerves and their sensory territories is toward the submental lymph nodes, the submandibular lymph nodes, and the preauricular lymph nodes. The lymph fluid will eventually be drained back into the right lymphatic duct and the thoracic duct. The right side of the face will drain into the right lymphatic duct, and the left side of the face will empty into the thoracic duct. Finally, the lymph in the right lymphatic duct and the thoracic duct will drain back to the central circulation.
