Underlying etiology risk factors expose endothelial cells to injury through various mechanisms. Endothelial injury and dysfunction contribute to atherosclerosis and its complications by the following:

- Enhanced expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules

- Increased inflammatory cytokines

- Reduced production of nitric oxide

- Increased superoxide anion formation

- Hindrance of cell function from increased serum free fatty acids and insulin

- Increased production of endothelial vasoconstrictors

- Vascular smooth muscle dysfunction and loss of integrity

- Increased expression of prothrombotic factors
