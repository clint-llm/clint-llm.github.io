Hypokalemia in a hypertensive patient is the most common clue for primary hyperaldosteronism. However, normal serum potassium may be present in up to 38% of patients, especially in patients with adrenal hyperplasia or familial aldosteronism.

Blood work will reveal hypokalemia, hypernatremia and metabolic alkalosis due to the actions of aldosterone on the distal convoluted tubule.

- Urinary potassium excretion is elevated (more than 30 mmol/day).

- Diagnosis depends on the demonstration of expanded extracellular fluid (ECF) volume (suppressed plasma renin) and non-suppressible aldosterone secretion.

- ARR (aldosterone: renin ratio): The lack of uniform assay method and diagnostic protocols in assessing the results creates a high variability in cut-off values among various investigators. A ratio of 40 or more (20 ng/dL/h to 40 ng/dL/h) or more than 135 (68 pmol/mU to 135 pmol/mU) has a sensitivity of 73% to 93% and a specificity of 71% to 84%, indicating the need for further confirmatory studies with salt-loading (failure to lower plasma aldosterone level less than 10 ng/dL), fludrocortisone suppression test, or captopril suppression test. The Endocrine Society's clinical practice guidelines do not specify which of these confirmatory tests should be regarded as the gold standard to confirm or exclude the diagnosis; therefore, different tests are performed by different centers.

- Once autonomous aldosterone production is established, the next step is to evaluate for possible adenoma. CT scan may show an adenoma that accounts for 70% cases, but as milder forms are being recognized now, idiopathic hyperaldosteronism is the most common cause. However, CT may provide incorrect diagnosis because of the common occurrence of non-functional adrenal adenomas (incidentalomas) that may be present in 4% of the general population.

- The studies to confirm unilateral nature of adrenal hypersecretion (lateralization) either by adrenal venous sampling (invasive, difficult and possible complications) or byiodocholesterol adrenal scan have limitations.

- Plasma 18-hydroxycorticosterone is elevated in adenoma and normal in adrenal hyperplasia.

- A plasma aldosterone response to a two-hour upright position shows a normal increase in adrenal hyperplasia but a paradoxical decrease in adrenal adenoma.

Prior to measuring aldosterone levels it is important to know the diurnal rhythm of the hormone. The lowest levels of aldosterone are observed around midnight and the highest values are seen in the morning between 7-8 am. This diurnal rhythm is preserved in patients with Conn syndrome but rare in idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia.

When to screen?

- Patients with stage 2 or stage 3 hypertension

- Resistant hypertension

- Hypertension with spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia

- Hypertension with adrenal incidentaloma

- Hypertension with a family history of early-onset hypertension or cerebrovascular disease

- Patients with first-degree relatives diagnosed with Primary aldosteronism

- Any patient with suspected secondary hypertension
