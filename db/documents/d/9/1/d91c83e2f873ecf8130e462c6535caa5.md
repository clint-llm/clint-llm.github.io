Patients with renal failure have a variety of different clinical presentations as explained in the history and physical exam section. Many patients are asymptomatic and are incidentally found to have an elevated serum creatinine concentration, abnormal urine studies (such as proteinuria or microscopic hematuria), or abnormal radiologic imaging of the kidneys. The key laboratory and imaging studies to be ordered in patients with renal failure follow.

**Laboratory Tests**

- Urinalysis, dipstick, and microscopy

- Dipstick for blood and protein; microscopy for cells, casts, and crystals

- Casts: Pigmented granular/muddy brown casts-ATN; WBC casts-acute interstitial nephritis; RBC casts-glomerulonephritis

- Urine electrolytes

Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) = [(UNa x PCr)/ (PNa x UCr)] x 100, where U is urine, P is plasma, Na is sodium, andCr is Creatinine. If FeNa less than 1, then likely prerenal; greater than 2, then likely intrarenal; greater than 4, then likely postrenal

If the patient is on diuretics, use FEurea instead of FENa. Complete blood count, BUN, creatinine (Cr), arterial blood gases (ABGs)

- Calculate Cr clearance to ensure that medications are dosed appropriately: Cockcroft-Gault equation Cr clearance (mL/min) = (140-age) x (weight in kilograms) x (0.85 if female)/(72 x serum creatinine)

**Special Labs**

- Creatinine Kinase (CK)

- Immunology antibodies based on the clinical scenario

**Imaging**

- Renal ultrasound (US)

- Doppler-flow kidney US depending upon the clinical scenario

- An abdominal x-ray (KUB): Rules out renal calculi

More advanced imaging techniques should be considered if initial tests do not reveal etiology:

- Radionucleotide renal scan, CT scan, and/or MRI

- Cystoscopy with retrograde pyelogram

- Kidney biopsy
