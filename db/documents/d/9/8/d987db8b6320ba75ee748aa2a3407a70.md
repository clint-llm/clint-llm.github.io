It is now clear that HBO therapy does have detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system. However, this appears to be true after repeated sessions and there is little evidence to show that a single session can affect the cardiovascular system. Thus, patients who undergo repeated HBO treatments need to follow up with a cardiac nurse, cardiologist, and the internist to assess for cardiac symptoms. The preventable risk factors for cardiac disease should be minimized and the patient encouraged to eat healthy, participate in exercise and avoid smoking. Healthcare workers should not empirically prescribe HBO treatment without a valid reason, and all members of the interprofessional team ned to be on the same page when it comes to using this therapy.
