Prevention is preferable to late interventions. Patients need to be educated about their systemic illnesses and how to prevent complications. Some conditions leading to unconsciousness may allow interventions prior to the development of a coma. Closer monitoring and education of patients with poorly controlled diabetes might be an opportunity for prevention. For those patients at risk for drug overdoses or illicit drug use intoxication, early intervention and counseling will prevent many complications. Patients can be educated to establish wishes regarding life decisions in the case that they become unconscious.
