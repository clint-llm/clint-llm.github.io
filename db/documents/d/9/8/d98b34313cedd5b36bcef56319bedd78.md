Many patients who could benefit from a CPB have comorbidities and underlying processes that must be considered before performing this block. For example, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatments may be immunocompromised and highly susceptible to infection secondary to injection. In addition, patients may be coagulopathic or thrombocytopenic, posing an increased risk of significant bleeding. Using computed tomography guidance or fluoroscopic techniques does not eliminate the risk of vascular injury or trauma to surrounding tissues; in patients with cancer, the presence of metastatic disease must always be considered.

Contraindications to CPB include patient refusal or inability to consent, coagulopathy or anticoagulation use, ongoing infection, and abnormal anatomy obscuring the trajectory of the needle and making it difficult or near impossible to target the appropriate structures.
