The pelvic joints can potentially develop arthritis, malignancy, trauma, fracture, dislocation, inflammatory conditions, and pregnancy symptoms. One prevalent complaint is pelvic joint pain. For instance, the lumbosacral joint is prone to injury due to herniation of the L5/S1 intervertebral joint, fracture, trauma, or degenerative changes. The lumbosacral joint can be a source of pain, mainly due to the ligaments that cover it. If deformed by an alteration of the morphology and articular biomechanics, the latter can send pain signals, especially for movements such as extension and ipsilateral bending.

The sacroiliac joint can be a source of pain that explains about 15% to 30% of all causes of back pain. The sacroiliac joint is a significant source of pelvic joint pain due to inflammation or sacroiliitis. The nerve fibers carrying are via L4 to L5 or L5 to S4 spinal nerves.

The pelvis is also rich with many large nerves, which, if compressed or irritated, can lead to radicular pain. Neither a CT scan nor MRI is sensitive enough to identify disorders causing pain in the pelvis. Some experts recommend a PET scan, but this imaging study is not always available and tends to be prohibitively expensive. Diagnosing many pelvic joint disorders means ruling out other pathologies and using clinical judgment. Treatment may include rest, NSAIDs, exercise, ice or heat, surgical repair, or nerve blocks. Unfortunately, many patients remain dissatisfied with treatment.
