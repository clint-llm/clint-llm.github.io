Acne occurs on centrofacial areas of the back, upper trunk, and deltoid region. Acne presents as polymorphic lesions starting with comedones.

- Grade 1: Comedones. They are of two types, open and closed. Open comedones are due to plugging of the pilosebaceous orifice by sebum on the skin surface. Closed comedones are due to keratin and sebum plugging the pilosebaceous orifice below the skin surface.

- Grade 2: Inflammatory lesions present as a small papule with erythema.

- Grade 3: Pustules.

- Grade 4: Many pustules coalesce to form nodules and cysts.

Acne can leave various scars after healing, which may present as depressed scars or hypertrophic and keloidal scars. Depressed scars may be gentle contour (boxcar scars) or ice pick scars, which are deep pits. Acne is associated with seborrhoea and in the case of hyperandrogenism associated with hirsutism, acanthosis nigricans, irregular menstrual period, and weight gain.
