There is no consensus regarding prophylactic anticoagulation. More recent studies have shown little benefit for prophylactic treatment; however, using low molecular weight heparin in selected groups of patients may be worthwhile. Misplacement of the catheter tip in the superior vena cava should be identified and corrected. Left-sided catheter insertion should be avoided if possible. Patients should be educated on risk factors that may increase the risk of thromboses, such as smoking, pregnancy, and obesity, to name a few.
