The management of macrocephaly is dependent upon the exact etiology. If hydrocephalus is present, then referral to neurosurgery for surgical intervention may be required. Urgent neurosurgical intervention may be lifesaving in children with hydrocephalus and concurrent symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Drainage of CSF to reduce the fluid volume and reduce the raised intracranial pressure can be performed by placement of an extraventricular drain (EVD) or a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. In cases without hydrocephalus, a referral to genetics, developmental pediatrics, or pediatric neurology may be required. Macrocephalic children with epilepsy may require treatment with antiepileptic drugs. If dealing with benign familial macrocephaly, no intervention may be needed at all other than serial monitoring of head circumference and reassurance.
