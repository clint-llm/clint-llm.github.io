The etiology of caustic ingestion is either accidental ingestion (often the case in children) or intentional (such as suicidal acts in the adult). Children often ingest household substances such as bleach or ammonia. Most caustic exposures involved oral ingestion (76 percent) and occur in the home (93 percent of cases). The majority of these ingestions were unintentional (greater than 80 percent). Ingestions usually involve either an acid or an alkali. Each of these categories is unique in its pathophysiology and treatment approach.
