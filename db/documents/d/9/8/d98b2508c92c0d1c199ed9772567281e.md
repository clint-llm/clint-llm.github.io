Cryptococcus is an invasive fungus, transmitted through the inhalation of spores and causes cryptococcosis, an infection commonly associated with immunosuppressive individuals. Patients present with fever, headache, malaise, photophobia and neck stiffness as cryptococcal meningitis sets in. This activity describes the evaluation and management of cryptococcosis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the cryptococcal species in the etiology of cryptococcosis.
- Describe the typical patient history and physical exam findings in cryptococcosis.
- Outline the use of cerebrospinal fluid analysis in the evaluation of cryptococcosis.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to provide prophylactic treatment for cryptococcal infection to improve outcomes in immunocompromised patients by preventing cryptococcosis.
