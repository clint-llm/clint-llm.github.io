To provide the best outcome for patients, healthcare teams must work together in educating the patient regarding the importance of disclosing all medications and over-the-counter supplements and their dosages. This includes medical assistants, nurses, mid-level providers, physicians, and pharmacists, all taking responsibility for reviewing and updating patients' medication records. When there are multiple providers recommending different medications or treatments, drug-drug interactions and toxicity may result, leading to poor patient outcomes. A systematic review article determined that having involvement with a pharmacist in a healthcare team improved the effectiveness of the drug regimen, safety profiles, and hospitalization outcomes.

A pharmacist's involvement in these healthcare teams has also been shown to improve physicians' and nurses' knowledge about medications and their interactions.
