Patients with serviceable hearing can be observed or fitted with a conventional hearing aid. However, many patients completely lose serviceable hearing in the affected ear and may be candidates for aural rehabilitation. Interventions may include bone conduction implants or contralateral routing of signals (CROS) hearing aid, but this is only possible in those with an intact cochlear nerve.

Facial nerve paralysis is another potential complication that may require long-term management. Maximal recovery may occur within the first six months.

Severe chronic imbalance resulting from tumor progression or intervention is not common but can increase the risk of a fall. A balanced assessment and balance therapy may be appropriate for patients with chronic vestibular deficits.
