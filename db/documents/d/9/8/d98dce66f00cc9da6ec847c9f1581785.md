Infants born with a disorder of sex development (DSD) prompt multiple medical, surgical, ethical, psychosocial, and physical issues for patients and their parents. The previous terms, such as intersex, hermaphroditism, pseudohermaphroditism, etc., are outdated and are replaced by the term disorders of sexual development (DSD).
