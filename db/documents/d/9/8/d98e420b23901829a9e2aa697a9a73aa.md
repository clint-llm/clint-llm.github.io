Despite the significant load of comorbidities among the patients being treated, TEER is a very safe operation with a low likelihood of major consequences.

Table 7 provides a summary of the most common complications and their relative occurrence rates.

The increased risk of leaflet perforation, tear, or SLDA in patients with long-standing secondary mitral regurgitation, and calcified leaflets is a particular cause for worry. Percutaneous retrieval of embolized devices may be difficult, especially if larger clips are involved

The indication for MV surgery or re-intervention must be reviewed by the multidisciplinary team in the event of residual or recurrent mitral regurgitation. In order to comprehend the underlying disease, identify the residual leaflet anatomy for the implantation of further devices, and determine the likelihood that the patient would experience significant mitral stenosis, a transesophageal echocardiogram must typically be repeated. In case series with limited safety information, alternative interventional strategies for the therapy of considerable para-clip or inter-clip residual mitral regurgitation have been described. Examples include inserting an Amplatzer vascular plug (Abbott), which was initially intended to embolize the peripheral vasculature
