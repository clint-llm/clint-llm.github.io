An accessory FPL muscle head may originate from either theÂ FDS muscle, coronoid process of the ulna, or medial epicondyle of the humerus. The accessory head subsequently inserts into the ulnar aspect of the FPL or FDP muscles. Referred to as Gantzer's muscle, it was long viewed as an anatomical variation; however, many recent studies have shown its presence in up to two-thirds of the population.

The Linburg-Comstock anomaly is a tendinous interconnection between FPL and the FDP of the second digit.
