Administration of baclofen with any other central nervous system depressants requires close monitoring. Patients with epilepsy should be monitored with a regular electroencephalogram due to deterioration in seizure control when receiving baclofen.

Monitor for signs and symptoms of baclofen withdrawal if the dose is reduced or discontinued.

Intrathecal baclofen use requires careful attention to program the infusion pump and monitor its function, pump alarms, and refill schedules.

Closely monitor when the initial phase of pump use and when adjusting the dosing rate and/or the concentration in the reservoir as small errors can result in subtherapeutic level or toxic levels.

Monitor for signs or symptoms of overdose which may occur suddenly, especially in the initial screening phase, dose-titration phase, and reintroduction of therapy after temporary cessation of treatment.
