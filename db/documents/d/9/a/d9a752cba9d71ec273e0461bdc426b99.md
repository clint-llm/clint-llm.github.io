Algor mortis is translated from Latin as “cold death” and describes the postmortem temperature change after someone has died. After death, individuals no longer produce body heat or cooling mechanisms and the decedent temperature slowly approaches ambient temperature. This variable is based on the assumption that body temperature was normal at the time of death and includes both temperatures above and below normal living body temperature, 98.7 F. Rectal temperatures are commonly used as the standard to determine the decedent temperature and algor mortis.
