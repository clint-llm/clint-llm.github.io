Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia is a severe form of thrombocytopenia with reduced or absent megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. It can be congenital or acquired.

**Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT)**is a rare, severe form of thrombocytopenia with reduced or absent megakaryocytes in the bone marrow since birth, especially seen in the neonatal period. There is an eventual progression to impaired production of all three cell lines and should be considered inherited pancytopenia.

**Acquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (AAMT)**is seen in later years of life and is again characterized by diminished or absent megakaryopoiesis with otherwise normal bone marrow.
