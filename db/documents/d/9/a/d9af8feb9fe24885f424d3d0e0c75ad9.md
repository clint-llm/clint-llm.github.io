**Pre-operatively**

PPH frequently comes to medical attention when symptomatic and usually large, which carries an increased risk of gastric volvulus and incarceration, which could result in ischemia and bowel obstruction depending on the contents of the hernia. Early diagnosis is important to prevent the strangulation and necrosis of the gastric fundus that may occur if it remains unrecognized.

**Intra-operatively**

Damage to pleura causing pneumomediastinum is not uncommon after any esophageal surgery and usually resolves within 24 hours without any sequelae. Tension pneumothorax is rare (1 to 2%), major bleeding has been noticed in 2% of cases, gastric and oesophageal injuries are uncommon (1%). The dead space created within the thoracic cavity following excision of sac will be re-occupied by the lungs over a period of time but can present with fluid collection (seroma), which can get infected; it is more likely if the sac is not excised fully. In the absence of any infection, these collections can be observed without any intervention; otherwise, it would merit interventional radiology-guided drainage and appropriate antibiotics.
