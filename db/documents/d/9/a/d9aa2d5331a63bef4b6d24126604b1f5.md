Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by episodes of complete collapse of the airway or partial collapse with an associated decrease in oxygen saturation or arousal from sleep. This disturbance results in fragmented, nonrestorative sleep. OSA has significant implications for cardiovascular health, mental illness, quality of life, and driving safety. This activity reviews the cause and pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea.
- Review the presentation of a patient with obstructive sleep apnea.
- Summarize the treatment options for obstructive sleep apnea.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by obstructive sleep apnea.
