Surgery is the treatment of choice for hydrocele, and it is warranted when hydrocele becomes complicated or symptomatic.Â For congenital hydroceles, herniotomy is performed, provided they do not resolve spontaneously. On the other hand, acquired hydroceles subside when the primary underlying condition resolves.

There are two common surgical approaches available for hydrocelectomy:

**1. Plication:**This technique is suitable for thin-walled hydroceles. As there is minimal dissection, the risk of hematocele or infection is significantly reduced. Lord plication involves the tunica being bunched into a ruff by applying a series of multiple interrupted chromic catgut sutures for the sac to form fibrous tissue.

**2. Excision and Eversion:**This technique is suitable for large thick-walled hydroceles and chyloceles.

**Aspiration**

This is another method to treat hydrocele, particularly in patients who cannot tolerate surgery. However, hydrocele fluid almost always reaccumulates within a week or so.

**Complications of Surgery**

- Reactionary hemorrhage

- Pyocele

- Infection

- Sinus formation

- Recurrent hydrocele
