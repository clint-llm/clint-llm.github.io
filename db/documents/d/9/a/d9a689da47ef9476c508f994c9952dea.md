The pathway of autonomic innervation via the celiac ganglia to the gut parenchyma first involves nerves emerging from the lateral horn of the spinal cord. Then, a neuronal axon exits the spinal cord via the ventral root. Next, the signal exits the spinal nerve via the white ramus at the level of the sympathetic trunk and passes through a sympathetic ganglion (also called paravertebral ganglion); however, there is no synapsing on any cell body in the paravertebral ganglion.
