Metatarsus adductus is attributed to intrauterine positioning, and defined as angulation of the metatarsals toward the midline, giving the appearance of a "C" shaped foot.

The tibia is normally internally rotated at birth, but there are wide variations in the amount of angulation.

Femoral anteversion is also brought about by increased intrauterine pressures, causing undue pressure in areas of growth. In these cases, the neck of the femur is rotated inwards, which rotates the greater trochanter posteriorly. The resulting in-toeing becomes more evident with age, as there is a physiologic external rotation of the hip during toddler development.
