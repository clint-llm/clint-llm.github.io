Renal cell carcinoma, of which clear cell carcinoma is the most common histological subtype (80 to 90 percent), comprises 90 percent of all Kidney tumors.

The cancer-specific 10-year survival ranges from 71 percent in clear cell cancer to 91 percent in papillary cancer, 88 percent in chromophobe cancer, and 33 percent in collecting duct cancers.

Clear cell tumors have the propensity to spread hematogenous, with direct extension into the major vessels – namely the renal veins and the inferior vena cava.
