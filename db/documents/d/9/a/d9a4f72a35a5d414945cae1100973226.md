Adverse effects of nitrous include:

- **Respiratory Depression**: When used alone, nitrous has limited respiratory effects, but when used in combination with other sedatives, hypnotics, or opioids, it can potentiate the respiratory depressant effects of these agents.

- **Diffusion hypoxia**: Following discontinuation of nitrous oxide, the concentration gradient between the gases in the lung and alveolar circulation rapidly reverses, leading to rapid oxygen dilution in the alveoli and subsequent hypoxia, and 100% oxygen administration should follow nitrous oxide cessation.

- **Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting:**Nitrous has an increased risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) compared with other agents, but this is controllable with prophylactic anti-emetics.

- Fever, pulmonary atelectasis, and infectious complications

- **Hyperhomocysteinemia:**Nitrous oxide irreversibly oxidizes the cobalt atom of vitamin b12 and reduces the activity of vitaminb12 dependent enzymes such as methionine synthetases which can also lead to megaloblastic anemia.

- **Subacute myeloneuropathy:**Nitrous oxide use disorder can cause a severe but potentially reversible myeloneuropathy characterized by axonal sensorimotor neuropathy.
