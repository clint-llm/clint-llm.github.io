For the most part, akathisia is associated with the use of antipsychotic medications. Once the movement disorder has started, treatment is not always easy. Discontinuation of the drug is not always the solution since these patients rely on the medication for their primary mental health disorder. Mental health nurses, pharmacists, and primary care physicians who encounter akathisia should immediately refer the patient to the psychiatrist for definitive care. Unfortunately, once akathisia has developed it can take months for the disorder to subside. Case reports exist indicating that this movement disorder also increases the risk of suicidality. Hence, all patients with akathisia need to be closely monitored and the family should be educated about the potential for suicide.
