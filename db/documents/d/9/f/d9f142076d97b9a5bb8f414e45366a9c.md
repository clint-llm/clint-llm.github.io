Cardiac ultrasound, or echocardiography, is a procedure that the interprofessional team should perform as needed to evaluateÂ patients. It is a non-invasive diagnostic modality that can provide detailed hemodynamic information in a short period at the patient's bedside. Nurses should be prepared to assist the provider in point-of-care ultrasound applications spanning from head to toe. [Level V]
