Management of complex coronary artery lesions requires an interprofessional team approach. Emergency medical personnel are often first responders and must be able to adequately screen for acute coronary syndromes. Nurses must be able to effectively recognize symptoms and decompensation of these patients at the bedside. Nurses and pharmacists are also needed to prepare, dispense, and efficiently administer various medications which may be necessary during these processes. Cath lab staff also play an essential role. Cath lab techs, as well as nurses, must be readily available to efficiently and effectively deliver care when acute coronary syndromes occur. And, of course, interventional cardiologists play a vital role. Interventional cardiologists must be readily available to diagnose and treat those with complex coronary lesions. At times, interventional cardiologists may need to utilize advanced techniques in high-risk patients. [Level 5]
