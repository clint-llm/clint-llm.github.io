Cat scratch disease is not uncommon in North America. The majority of patients present to the emergency department, and because of its varied presentation, the disorder is best diagnosed and managed by an interprofessional team that includes an infectious disease expert, neurologist, surgeon, ophthalmologist, and internist. The outcomes for immunocompetent patients with cat scratch disease are excellent. However, those who have involvement of the peripheral or central nervous system may develop some neurological deficit that may persist after treatment. Death in immunocompetent patients is rare. The lymphadenitisÂ often takes several months to resolve, but most patients develop lifelong immunity to the infection. The prognosis in patients who are immunocompromised is guarded.
