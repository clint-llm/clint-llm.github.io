When patients present with meteorism, the onus is on the healthcare worker to first rule out an organic disorder like inflammatory bowel disease, bowel obstruction, colon cancer, strangulated hernia, or volvulus. The laboratory blood work is chiefly done to rule out other pathologies. Usually, no imaging is necessary to make a diagnosis of meteorism, but if the abdominal exam reveals marked tenderness or pain, then one should obtain plain x-rays to look for dilated bowel loops, air-fluid levels, or free air. Other tests depend on the presentation and physical exam.
