Loop diuretics are medications used in the management and treatment of fluid overload conditions such as heart failure, nephrotic syndrome or cirrhosis, and hypertension, in addition to edema. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for loop diuretics as a valuable agent in managing fluid overload and hypertension. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with fluid overload and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of loop diuretics.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of loop diuretics.
- Review types of loop diuretics and understand when to use which particular agent and which side effects belong to which drug.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients receiving loop diuretics.
