# Continuing Education Activity

Enuresis refers to the involuntary loss of urine during sleep that occurs at least twice a week in children older than 5 years of age (or the developmental equivalent) for at least 3 months, and it is the most common urologic complaint in pediatric patients. Primary enuresis is that which occurs in a child who has not been dry for at least 6 months, whereas secondary enuresis is the one that has an onset after a period of nocturnal dryness of at least 6 months. Also, the enuresis is classified as monosymptomatic or non-monosymptomatic, with the latter correlating with daytime incontinence or other lower urinary tract symptoms like urgency. This activity reviews the definition, pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of enuresis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in identifying and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of enuresis. 
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of enuresis.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for enuresis.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance enuresis and improve outcomes.

# Introduction

Enuresis refers to the involuntary loss of urine during sleep that occurs at least twice a week in children older than 5 years of age (or the developmental equivalent) for at least 3 months, and it is the most common urologic complaint in pediatric patients.

To avoid confusion, the International Children’s Continence Society has defined enuresis as wetting that occurs at night, whereas they no longer refer to daytime incontinence as diurnal enuresis.

Nocturnal enuresis is not a benign disorder; it has severe repercussions for the child and the family. Children are often punished and are at risk for physical and emotional abuse. Many children become isolated, lack self-esteem, and have poor academic performance. This activity highlights a detailed understanding of this very common yet misdiagnosed condition.

# Etiology

Enuresis is considered a multifactorial entity with a strong genetic component that may be influenced by comorbidities and immaturity of the central nervous system bladder control mechanisms.

Once thought to play a causal role, psychological or psychiatric factors are now considered to be either a consequence of enuresis or comorbidity.

Other Conditions associated with nocturnal enuresis include:

- Constipation

- Urethral obstruction

- Ectopic ureter

- Cystitis

- Diabetes insipidus

- Disorders of sleep arousal

- Small bladder capacity

- Overactive bladder

# Epidemiology

The prevalence of enuresis is similar across cultures.

Additionally, 20 to 30% of patients with enuresis also suffer from at least one psychological, behavioral, or psychiatric disorder, a rate twice as high as that of the general population.

Also, there is an association between sleep-disordered breathing and enuresis.

Patients with sickle cell disease also show a higher incidence of enuresis.

# Pathophysiology

Researchers suspect several factors to be involved in the pathophysiology of enuresis, with each patient exhibiting different combinations of these, thus explaining why some individuals respond to specific therapies that are unsuccessful in others.

The main pathophysiological mechanisms involved are nocturnal polyuria, bladder dysfunction, and high arousal thresholds.

# History and Physical

The history and detailed physical examination are key to diagnosing this condition. The initial step in the evaluation of nocturnal enuresis is obtaining a history. It is essential to determine whether the enuresis is primary or secondary, its pattern (number of episodes in one night and number of nights per week), and caffeine and evening fluid intake. Also, it is just as important to determine the presence of nocturnal polyuria (elicited by asking the parents if the enuretic episodes involve large amounts of urine), polydipsia, dysuria, urgency, frequency, daytime incontinence, abnormal urinary stream, and constipation.

The physical exam is unremarkable in most affected children. Clinicians should look for distended bladder, rectal exam consistent with fecal impaction,

# Evaluation

The laboratory tests besides a urinalysis are usually unnecessary since this test will show alterations in specific gravity in diabetes insipidus, glycosuria in case of diabetes mellitus, and the presence of nitrites leukocyte esterase, leukocytes, or bacteria in case of infection.

# Treatment / Management

The treatment of this common condition can be tailored according to the patient's underlying cause, and monitoring of treatment plays a crucial role in a successful response. After identifying the term, it should ideally be treated early, preferably no later than age 6 years.

By a slight difference over desmopressin, the most effective therapeutic modality is the alarm system.

Pharmacologic therapy is used to help treat the disorder while awaiting natural resolution rather than as a curative measure.

The initial choice is desmopressin acetate,

Also, combining the desmopressin and alarm system can lead to response rates close to 100%.

Anticholinergic agents are suggested as an add-on therapy to non-responders to desmopressin.

Furthermore, imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is another pharmacological option that should be reserved for older non-responders to first and second-line treatments. Its mechanism of action has been proposed to involve a central effect at the brainstem level promoting arousal and inhibiting urination, a weak anticholinergic and detrusor antispasmodic effect, increasing ADH release, and suppressing REM sleep.

# Differential Diagnosis

The most important to exclude conditions before diagnosing enuresis include

- Bladder dysfunction from infection or neurological conditions,

- Incontinence due to anatomical abnormalities, and

- Polyuria secondary to diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, excessive fluid or diuretic intake, or drugs.

# Staging

DSM 5 Criteria

- Recurrent episodes of enuresis, whether intentional or involuntary

- The behavior occurs at least twice a week for a minimum of 3 consecutive months

- The enuresis is associated with significant social distress and poor functioning in school

- The behavior occurs in a child who is at least 5 years

- Behavior is not attributed to any medical condition or medication

# Prognosis

Enuresis tends to self-resolve spontaneously, with 15% of affected individuals becoming continent per year.

However, the condition is associated with enormous morbidity. The children are susceptible to emotional and physical abuse. The child often has low self-esteem and has poor academic performance.

Of all the treatments, alarm therapy and treatment with imipramine and desmopressin have the highest success. However, the response is slow and as many as 20% will continue to have enuresis as adults.

# Complications

Enuresis has been found to negatively impact the child’s and family’s quality of life,

# Consultations

Referral to a specialist should be a strong consideration for patients with non-monosymptomatic enuresis since they are more likely to fail standard therapy. Suggestions are that patients who do not respond to treatment after three months should obtain a referral to a specialist.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Families should receive counseling on what are the appropriate and inappropriate behavioral interventions for enuresis. Caregivers should also be informed about the natural history of the condition, the different therapeutic options, and the complications associated with delaying treatment.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Nocturnal enuresis is a very common problem in children, leading to embarrassment, social isolation, and loss of self-esteem. Because many people do not admit to the problem for fear of embarrassment, the exact incidence remains unknown. Because of its significant negative repercussions on the child, the condition is best diagnosed and managed by an interprofessional team. Nurses can assess the effectiveness of therapy, medication compliance and counsel the family or caregivers. Pharmacists can verify dosing and counsel on proper administration. Concerns in these areas require communication with the rest of the healthcare team. Only through this type of interprofessional collaboration can patient outcomes achieve their optimal potential.

Healthcare providers should actively ask about enuresis during well-child visits since many families still see it as a disciplinary issue instead of a medical condition. Parents need to understand that punishment has no role in the treatment of this condition and may make the enuresis worse.  The nurse should educate the caregiver on alarm therapy, and the pharmacist should provide information about the drugs, their benefits, and their adverse effects.

The children should be evaluated every few months to monitor progress.

An interprofessional approach involving the primary care provider, a urologist in the setting of refractory or non-monosymptomatic cases, nurses, and different specialists in case of comorbidities, including mental health professionals, is the ideal line of action to achieve better outcomes.
