Because of the complexity of facial anatomy, there is the potential for myriad different complications to arise when major lacerations occur. Numerous specialists may be required to manage more complex injuries: oculoplastic surgeons and ophthalmologists can address periorbital and lacrimal duct injuries, neurosurgeons will repair violations of the cranial vault, and plastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons, or otolaryngologists manage facial nerve and parotid duct injuries a well as performing complex soft tissue repair. Patient satisfaction with facial laceration management is mainly dependent on cosmesis, and poor cosmesis can have a negative psychological impact; for this reason, early involvement of an interprofessional team is crucial.

Surgeons do not work alone but rather partner with skilled staff who monitor the patient before and after the procedure and reiterate postprocedural care instructions upon discharge. Case managers address psychosocial sequelae and patient needs after facial laceration repair, particularly when the lacerations occur in the context of polytrauma or in patients who require assistance accessing healthcare. Collaboration among all interprofessional healthcare team members is essential to provide optimal patient care, promote aesthetically pleasing wound healing, and minimize complications. [Level 5]
