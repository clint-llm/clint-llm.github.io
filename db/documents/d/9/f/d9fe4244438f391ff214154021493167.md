Acid phosphatase (AP) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphate esters in an acidic environment. This chemical reaction is essential to different metabolic processes. Therefore, AP exists in several biological kingdoms, including plants, animals, fungi, and even bacteria. Research has shown AP to play a pivotal role in different physiological processes in humans, including bone resorption, immune defenses, pathogen clearance, epithelial growth regulation, and iron transport, among others.
