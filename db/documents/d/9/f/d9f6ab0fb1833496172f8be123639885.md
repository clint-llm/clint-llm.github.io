The causes of steatorrhea are numerous and subclassified under three broad categories:

- Conditions leading to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI)

- Bile acid deficiency states

- Diseases affecting the small intestine.

Most notable disorders in each category are given below

- EPI due to chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis (CF), and conditions resulting in pancreatic duct obstruction or resection of the pancreas (e.g., pancreatic tumors)

- Bile acid deficiency either due to cholestasis e.g. primary biliary cirrhosis, currently referred to as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), or inability to absorb bile acids in the distal ileum resulting in diminished bile acid pool e.g. ileal resection or Crohn disease of the ileum or deconjugation of bile acids e.g., small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)

- Diseases affecting proximal small intestines such as celiac disease, tropical sprue, giardiasis, Whipple disease, lymphoma, amyloidosis, SIBO, and HIV enteropathy

Other rare causes of steatorrhea include lipase inhibitors such as orlistat, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (increased production of gastric acid inactivates the pH-sensitive pancreatic lipases), and graft-versus-host disease.
