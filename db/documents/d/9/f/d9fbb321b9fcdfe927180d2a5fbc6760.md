The majority of patients with mastitis will recover with appropriate treatment. The recurrence rate for each type of mastitis varies as follows:

- Lactational mastitis: 8%-30%

- Periductal mastitis: 4%-28%

- Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis: 20%-78%

One study reported that 38% of patients with IGM reported significant scarring, and 29% reported long term pain.
