The anterior neck region is made up of many structures that are crucial in maintaining essential functions for life. The skin is the most superficial organ in the neck region, and it functions as a barrier to the underlying structures. The fat in the neck region acts as cushioning for the surrounding structures. As for the anterior neck muscles, they manifest movements to the head and neck. The muscles in the anterior neck region can further separate into the suprahyoid muscles and the infrahyoid muscles. The hyoid bone demarcates these muscles into a superior group and an inferior group. Contraction of the suprahyoid muscles will elevate the hyoid bone while contraction of the infrahyoid muscles will depress the hyoid bone. These muscles contract in the different phases of speaking, chewing, and swallowing. But both the suprahyoid muscles and the infrahyoid muscles also act as a barrier to protect the trachea, thyroid gland, and the esophagus.

One of the muscles grouped into the infrahyoid muscles is the sternohyoid muscle. The first root word of sternohyoid is "sterno," this equates to the sternum while the last root word is "hyoid," which references the hyoid bone. The simplicity of the name of this muscle is that its name explains the regions that it originates from and to which it attaches. As for the actions of the sternohyoid muscle, it contributes to the depression of the hyoid bone.
