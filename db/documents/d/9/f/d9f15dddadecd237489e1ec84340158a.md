Segmental lung resection is the removal of the sublobar anatomic portion of pulmonary parenchyma. The current guidelines for lung cancer are for lobar resection, but certain patients may benefit from the removal of less tissue. There is increasing interest and investigation into the efficacy of segmental lung resection in early-stage lung cancer treatment. This activity reviews the indications and approaches to segmental lung resection and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in performing this operation and caring for patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for segmental lung resection.
- Describe the technique in regards to segmental lung resection.
- Review the potential complications of segmental lung resection.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies that can lead to improved outcomes for patients who require segmental lung resection.
