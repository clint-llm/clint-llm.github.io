Suspicious clinical features involving different organ systems should be reviewed;

- Pulmonary: Newborns may suffer from respiratory distress, but the primary manifestations of bronchiectasis present in later life

- Rhinosinusitis: Nasal polyps and chronic sinusitis, which may also present with chronic cough

- Chronic otitis media with recurrent acute otitis media is present in childhood and adolescence.

- Fertility: MenÂ often have living but immotile spermatozoa, which results in infertility, although some have motile spermatozoa and immotile cilia, while others are azoospermic - women may also have decreased fertility, with fewer than 50 percent successful pregnancy completions.
