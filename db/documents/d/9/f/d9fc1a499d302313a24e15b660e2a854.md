One medical application of the properties of HbF is in the management of sickle cell anemia. At baseline, HbF accounts for 2% to 20% of hemoglobin in sickle cell disease, depending on various patient-dependent factors, and this elevation appears to be due to the greater oxygen affinity of HbF; therefore, HbF is less likely to deoxygenate, sickle, and cause pain crises in these patients. Indeed, sickle cell disease patients do not manifest symptoms in infancy due to elevated HbF, but as HbF decreases, patients may become symptomatic. HbA shows a decreased half-life in sickle cell disease because vaso-occlusive crises that occur during sickling and deoxygenation induce hemolysis. Through an unknown mechanism, the pharmacologic drug hydroxyurea increases the fraction ofÂ HbF found in adults. Treatment with hydroxyurea is indicated in patients that have frequent pain crises, acute chest syndrome, or severe anemia. By increasing HbF, hydroxyurea reduces the requirement for transfusions in patients with sickle cell anemia.
