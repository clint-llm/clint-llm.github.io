There is a debate on whether there is a need for orbital biopsy since typical idiopathic orbital inflammation cases can be treated with systemic corticosteroids without a biopsy.

Histopathologic examination through either fine-needle aspiration biopsy or incisional/excisional biopsy is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis.

Research has described five patterns of acute inflammatory pseudotumor: anterior and diffuse acute pseudotumors, anterior or diffuse orbital infiltration, lacrimal involvement, posterior or apical involvement, and myositic infiltration.

On histopathology, there is a pleomorphic inflammatory cellular response consisting of pleomorphic response by lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and eosinophils.

The presence of granulomatous inflammation, vasculitis, or necrosis generally excludes the diagnosis of IOI.
