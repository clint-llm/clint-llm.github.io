The occurrence of coronary sinus thrombosis is rare, or at least rarely reported. However, out of the published cases, acute ones are substantially more common (more than 80) than chronic ones. Considering the high number of the patients who undergo ventricular pacing via the coronary sinus with ventricular pacemakers, the lack of reports of coronary sinus thrombosis is often surprising. Because ventricular pacemakers are usually implanted in reasonably sick patients with severe cardiomyopathy, sudden death is unlikely to be investigated with a postmortem study. In at least few of these, the possibility that thrombosis of the coronary sinus couldÂ be associated with cardiac death remains unanswered.

There is no clear male or female predominance reported. It is likely that coronary sinus thrombosis is under-recognized because of the rapid deterioration of these patients and limited overall clinical experience of cardiologists with this condition. Most acute cases are usually fatal and often diagnosed on autopsy, and this curtails the reported incidence and prevalence of this condition.
