Xerostomia is linked to multiple etiologies. However, it most frequently develops as an adverse effect of medication, secondary to head and neck radiation therapy, and due to Sjogren syndrome. A wide variety of drugs have the potential to affect salivary gland function and induce oral dryness, which is dependent on the dose and the number of drugs being taken.

Multiple classes of drugs show a correlation with xerostomia.

- Anticholinergic agents: atropine, belladonna, oxybutynin

- Antidepressant and antipsychotic agents: citalopram, haloperidol, phenelzine

- Diuretics: furosemide, chlorothiazide, hydrochlorothiazide

- Antihypertensive agents: captopril, lisinopril, enalapril

- Sedative and anxiolytic agents: alprazolam, diazepam, triazolam

- Muscle relaxants: tizanidine, cyclobenzaprine, orphenadrine

- Analgesic agents: opioids and NSAIDs

- Antihistamines: astemizole, loratadine, brompheniramine

Xerostomia develops in most patients undergoing head and neck radiation therapy for cancer treatment when the major salivary glands are in the radiation path.

Xerostomia is commonly attributed to Sjögren syndrome, characterized by oral and ocular dryness

Other potential causes for oral dryness may include autoimmune system disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), thyroid disease, and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), patients with a history of mouth breathing, dehydration, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, nerve damage from head or neck injury, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), graft versus host disease (GVHD), and HIV/AIDS.
