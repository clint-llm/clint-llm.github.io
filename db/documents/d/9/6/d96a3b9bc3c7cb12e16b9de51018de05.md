Any delay in the prompt diagnosis and timely treatment of a prostatic abscess can lead to severe complications with significant morbidity and mortality. The infection can spread locally to adjacent perineal areas, which could necessitate more invasive interventions with long-term complications involving genitourinary functions.Â Bacteremia and sepsis subsequently causing septic shock and multi-organ failure can occur in severe cases, increasing mortality.
