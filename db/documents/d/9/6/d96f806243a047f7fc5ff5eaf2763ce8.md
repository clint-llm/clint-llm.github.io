PET-CT involves radioactive material, and exposure to radiation is there. 18F-FDG has an effective radiation dose of 14 mSv. Potential side effects of radiation as they hold for other imaging modalities are seen in PET scan also. In a standard PET scan amount of radiation is quite less, of the range of 8 mSv, about equivalent to that received from natural sources like the sun. PET-CT uses higher levels of radiation of the range of 24mSv. Pregnant ladies shouldn’t undergo a PET scan unless absolutely necessary as radioactivity can affect the fetus. A breastfeeding woman should limit close contact with infants or pregnant women for up to 12 hours. Breast milk may be discarded until 12 hours & after about 24 hours, it is considered safe to breastfeed again.
