Preserving the original structure of mucus is an essential aspect of histological fixation. Tissue fixation significantly impacts the intestinal mucus layer visualization, and due to its unstable structure, the histological fixation of intestinal mucus is difficult. In piglets, the original state of the tissue samples was preserved, and mucus position between epithelium and intestinal content was preserved in cryo-preservation with liquid nitrogen, except for partial preservation observed in jejunal samples. However, chemical fixation in piglets did not find samples with sufficiently preserved mucus. Cryo-preservation followed by AB-PAS staining would then enable the evaluation of mucus thicknessÂ in the colon of pigs.
