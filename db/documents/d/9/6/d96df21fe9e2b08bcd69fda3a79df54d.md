Statins are usually well-tolerated, with myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, and diabetes mellitus being the most common adverse reactions. The incidence of myopathy is dose-dependent and may present as diffuse myalgias or otherwise unexplainable muscle tenderness or weakness with reversal upon medication discontinuation. Rhabdomyolysis is the most serious complication of statin use, but its occurrence is rare. Rarely elevated hepatic transaminases can occur. This elevation is usually a transient effect and resolves with continued therapy or after a brief therapy interruption. Patients with statin-induced hepatotoxicity have hepatocellular rather than cholestatic or mixed liver injury. Cholestatic/mixed hepatic injury appeared to be more predominant in patients taking atorvastatin.

Statin-associated cognitive dysfunction is a rare adverse drug reaction; changing lipophilic to hydrophilic statins may resolve cognitive impairment.

**Drug-Drug Interactions**

Gemfibrozil-simvastatin: Reduced metabolism of simvastatin leads to increased concentration and increased risk of myopathy. Avoid combination.

Gemfibrozil-pravastatin: Reduced metabolism of pravastatin leads to increased concentrations and increased risk of myopathy. Avoid combination.

Coadministration of a statin with a fibrate may be required to treat complex dyslipidemias or hypertriglyceridemia; fenofibrate is preferred due to the reduced incidence of drug interactions compared with statin-gemfibrozil therapy. (The rate of gemfibrozil-associated rhabdomyolysis is approximately ten times higher than fenofibrate).

Amiodarone-lovastatin: Limit the dose of lovastatin to 40 mg daily.

Amiodarone-simvastatin: Limit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg daily.

Conivaptan-simvastatin: Reduced metabolism of simvastatin leads to increased concentrations and increased risk of myopathy.

Cyclosporine/tacrolimus/everolimus/sirolimus with lovastatin/pitavastatin - Avoid combination.

Atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin are primarily metabolized by CPYP3A4. Therefore, closely monitor when administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as amiodarone, amlodipine, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fluoxetine, sertraline, TCAs,  isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, midazolam, nefazodone, posaconazole, protease inhibitors, ranolazine, tacrolimus, ticagrelor, verapamil, and voriconazole.

Fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9. Monitor for drug interactions when administered with amiodarone, etravirine, fluconazole, fluvoxamine, fluvastatin,ketoconazole, metronidazole, miconazole, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, voriconazole, zafirlukast.

Atorvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, and simvastatin are substrates if P-gp: Monitor for drug interactions when given with P-gp inhibitors like amiodarone, azithromycin, captopril, carvedilol, cimetidine, clarithromycin, colchicine, conivaptan, cyclosporine, diltiazem, dipyridamole, dronedarone, erythromycin, felodipine, grapefruit juice, itraconazole, ketoconazole, mefloquine, nicardipine, omeprazole, protease inhibitors, quinidine, ranolazine, sertraline, tacrolimus, verapamil. It is important to recognize that atorvastatin, pitavastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin are both P-gp substrates and P-gp inhibitors.

OATP1B1 is involved in statin uptake and metabolism of atorvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin. Therefore, monitor drug interactions when these drugs are given with carbamazepine, clarithromycin, erythromycin, gemfibrozil, protease inhibitors, rifampin, sildenafil, sacubitril, and telithromycin.

OATP1B3 is involved in statin uptake and metabolism of fluvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin: Monitor for drug interactions when given clarithromycin, cyclosporine, erythromycin, rifampin, roxithromycin, rifampin, sacubitril, telithromycin. OATP inhibitors may increase concentrations of statins, consequently increasing the rate of adverse drug reactions, including myopathy.

Diltiazem is frequently prescribed with statins. Rhabdomyolysis has been reported in a patient taking atorvastatin after diltiazem.
