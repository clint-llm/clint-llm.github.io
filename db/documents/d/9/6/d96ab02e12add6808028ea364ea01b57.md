The hallmark of subclinical hypothyroidism is an elevated TSH with a normal T4. However there are several non-thyroidal factors which can cause elevation of TSH, and they need to be ruled out before a diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism is made. Recommendations are that TSH and T4 need to be repeated at least once after 2-3 months. TPO antibodies which indicate an autoimmune etiology of hypothyroidism should be measured. They correlate with a two-fold increased risk of progression of subclinical hypothyroidism to overt hypothyroidism. The TPO antibody titers decrease with time and do not need repeating. An ultrasound would show a hypoechoic and heterogenous thyroid gland in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.

Since subclinical hypothyroidism has potential associations with cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure, and cognitive decline patients should be evaluated for their risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and other risk factors.
