Common primary causes of nephrotic syndrome are intrinsic kidney diseases, such as membranous nephropathy, minimal-­change nephropathy, and focal glomerulosclerosis. Secondary causes may include systemic diseases, such as lupus erythematosus, diabetes mellitus, and amyloidosis. Congenital/hereditary focal glomerulosclerosis could occur because of genetic mutations in podocyte proteins, such as podocin, nephrin, or the cation channel 6 protein.

Secondary causes of nephrotic syndrome include the following:

- Diabetes mellitus

- Immune: lupus erythematosus, antibody vasculitis, Berger disease, glomeruli acute post-infectious nephritis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic neutrophils (ANCA), Goodpasture syndrome, extramembranous or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, thrombotic microangiopathy, alloantibodies from enzyme replacement therapy, or toxicity  of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or gold salts

- Infection: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B1, preeclampsia, toxoplasmosis, amyloidosis, and paraproteinemias

The most common cause in children is minimal change glomerulonephritis. In White adults, nephrotic syndrome is most frequently due to membranous nephropathy, whereas in populations of African ancestry, the most common cause of the nephrotic syndrome is focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

One more scenario where nephrotic-range proteinuria can occur is in the third trimester of pregnancy, a classical preeclampsia finding. However, it may start de novo or be superimposed on chronic kidney disease from before. There would have been preexisting proteinuria in the latter, which worsened during pregnancy.

Medication may also cause nephrotic syndrome. This includes the following:

- The infrequent occurrence of minimal­-change disease with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

- The occurrence of membranous glomerulonephritis with gold, bucillamine, and penicillamine use, which are used for rheumatic diseases

- Focal glomerulosclerosis may occur due to bisphosphonates

- Lithium and interferon therapy has been found to be associated with focal glomerulosclerosis
