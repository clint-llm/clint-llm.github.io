**Biopsy**

Initial investigations include a tissue biopsy of the oral lesion. If tolerated and easily accessible many lesions can be biopsied in an outpatient clinic. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) may be carried out if there is associated lymphadenopathy. For tongue base or more posterior lesions, an examination under general anesthetic (EUA) should be performed in order to obtain a tissue sample for histology.

**Endoscopy**

In addition to simple nasendoscopy in the clinic, panendoscopy should be performed under general anesthetic to look for concurrent tumors of the pharynx and larynx.

**Imaging**

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the modality of choice in evaluating the tumor itself, soft tissue involvement, and local perineural invasion. Computed tomography (CT) scans should be requested to assess the involvement of the bone, lymph nodes, and chest. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans may be used for assessment in cases where the location of the primary cancer is unclear.
