Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) is an investigative technique that uses a collimated laser beam for imaging the eye. It provides tomographic imaging of ocular structures in vivo. The use of coherent light sources also improves axial resolution. Newer applications of SLO, like multicolor and wide-field imaging, have revolutionized the diagnosis and management of retinal diseases. SLO also provides reproducible optic nerve head measurements in patients with glaucoma. Understanding the basic principles will help the clinician employ techniques in specific clinical scenarios. This activity summarises the basics of SLO, its advantages in day-to-day practice, and its diagnostic applications.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the principle and mechanism of Scanning laser ophthalmoscope.
- Outline the various non-invasive and invasive dye base imaging techniques performed using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope.
- Summarize the indications and utility of Scanning laser ophthalmoscope in day-to-day practice.
- Review the clinical significance of scanning laser ophthalmoscope.
