Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for non-lymphoma palatal tumors. A Transoral approach can be used for the majority of small, superficial palate malignancies. If the tumor involves the hard palate or alveolus bone, resection of the maxilla will be necessary for oncologic clearance. The extent of resection would depend on the tumor's extent, ranging from a central or partial palatectomy to some form of infrastructure maxillectomy. The resulting defect may be rehabilitated with a removable obturator or prosthesis to facilitate oncologic surveillance in the future, or it may be repaired with a local, regional, or free tissue transfer.

For more extensive tumors or those involving the infratemporal fossa, pterygopalatine fossa, parapharyngeal space, masticator space, or nasopharynx (areas where a transoral approach will not be sufficient), an external approach such as an Upper Cheek flap, Lateral rhinotomy, Weber-Ferguson approach (upper lip-split incision extending along the nasal base into the nasomaxillary groove) or paramedian mandibulectomy may be required for adequate access.

For extensive palatal tumors requiring palatectomy and/or maxillectomy, a defect between the nasal and oral cavities can lead to difficulties with talking, chewing, and swallowing. Reconstructive options for these defects include temporary prosthetic obturators, rotational flaps (such as buccal myomucosal flaps, temporoparietal fascia or temporalis muscle flap and facial artery myomucosal flaps) for smaller defects, and free-tissue transfer flaps (such as fibula, iliac crest, scapula, radial forearm, rectus abdominus, or anterolateral thigh free flaps) for larger defects.

Studies have shown that surgical intervention for palatal malignancies provides higher disease-free survival compared with non-surgical approaches.

Cervical metastasis of hard palate SCC was historically thought to be low, and many surgeons did not perform elective neck dissection for N0 disease. However, recent studies have shown that cervical metastasis rates range from 13.7% to 40%, with an occult nodal metastasis rate of 21.7% to 26%, both of which are comparable to other subsites of the oral cavity.

Wide local excision with negative margins is the treatment of choice for AdCC, MEC, PLGA, LGPA, acinic cell carcinoma, and mucosal melanoma.

Cryotherapy with curettage has been proposed in the literature as an adjuvant treatment for patients with extensive Kaposi’s sarcoma who do not have adequate cosmetic improvement with chemotherapy.
