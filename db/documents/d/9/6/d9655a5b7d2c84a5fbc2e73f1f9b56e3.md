To reiterate, the primary structure of a protein is defined as the sequence of amino acids linked together to form a polypeptide chain. Each amino acid is linked to the next amino acid through peptide bonds created during the protein biosynthesis process. The two ends of each polypeptide chain are known as the amino terminus (N-terminus) and the carboxyl terminus (C-terminus).Â Twenty different amino acids can be used multiple times in the same polypeptide to create a specific primary protein structure sequence.
