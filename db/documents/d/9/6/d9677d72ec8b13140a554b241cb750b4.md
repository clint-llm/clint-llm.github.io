Far and away, the most commonÂ symptom of venous sinus thrombosis is a headache.

For patients presenting due to elevated intracranial pressure, a typical history that is suggestive of dural sinus thrombosis is elevated intracranial pressure in a patient that does not have an offending medication, and that does not fit the typical profile for Idiopathic intracranial hypertension. These patients will describe headaches generally worse lying down, pulsatile tinnitus, transient visual obscurations (blurred vision for several seconds). Patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) will tend to be obese, female predominant, and young. The patients should be screened for the use of medications provoking IIH such a tetracycline, vitamin A derivative, and growth hormone. On ophthalmic examination, optic nerve edema is usually present. The edema can be symmetric asymmetric or unusually absent. The absence of spontaneous retinal venous pulsations in patients with known spontaneous venous pulsations is another sign of ICP.

Cavernous sinus thrombosis results will result in acute cranial nerve (CN) III, IV, V, and VI palsies. The palsies will usually be concurrent, but it is possible to have isolated CN palsies. The pupil may be involved or spared. Cavernous sinus thromboses most commonly occur in the setting of infection, usually orbital cellulitis, sinusitis, or dental infection.
