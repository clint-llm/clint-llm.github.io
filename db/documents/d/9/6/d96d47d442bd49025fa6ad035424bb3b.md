Gaucher disease can present with several signs and symptoms, depending on the underlying type. Commonly seen presenting symptoms are as follows:

- Painless hepatomegaly and splenomegaly

- Hypersplenism and pancytopenia

- Severe joint pains, most frequently affecting hips and knees.

- Impaired olfaction and cognition (Type I)

- Serious convulsions, hypertonia, intellectual disability, and apnea (Type II)

- Myoclonus, seizures, dementia, and ocular muscle apraxia (Type III)

- Parkinsonism

- Osteoporosis

- Yellowish-brown skin pigmentation

The diagnosis of Gaucher disease depends upon finding a low GBA1 enzyme level in peripheral blood leukocytes as well as establishing the presence of mutant alleles in the GBA1 gene. Despite the fact that only a blood sample is needed to diagnosis Gaucher disease, some patients undergo unnecessary invasive bone marrow or liver biopsy before making a correct diagnosis. Physician awareness of the signs and symptoms of Gaucher disease can help avoid such mishaps. Moreover, before an accurate diagnosis is made, many patients with an enlarged liver or spleen are told they could have cancer.
