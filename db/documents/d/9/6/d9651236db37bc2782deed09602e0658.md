CB patients cannot go through their normal activities. On top of that, treatment is also very time-consuming, and the result may not be satisfactory. All these together create mental pressure, which can cause depression and other psychiatric problems. So patient education is a major part of the treatment, and as is rehabilitation, these should not be ignored. For this, trained counselors should be appointed. Regular counseling of both patients and their family members helps overcome these problems and improve the quality of life of patients and their caregivers.
