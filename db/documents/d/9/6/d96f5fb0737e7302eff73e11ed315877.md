While most C. sinensis infections are asymptomatic with a parasite load of approximately 100, acute infections require a more detailed and rigorous management strategy with several medical teams on board. Patients with a heavy parasite load of approximately 20,000 are at a higher risk for chronic, long-term issues. Such risks include ascending cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma, and hepatitis. Once it has become clear that a parasitic liver infection has developed, an interprofessional healthcare team including gastrointestinal (GI)/surgery, internal medicine, and infectious disease specialists must have a clear line of communication to begin therapy as soon as possible.

Specialty trained nurses in infection control and gastroenterology should provide patient and family education, monitor patients and provide status reports to the interprofessional team. Pharmacists evaluate the appropriateness of medications prescribed, assess drug-drug interactions, and participate in education. It is also important to accurately diagnose which parasite is the culprit of the current disease as there are several types of different parasitic liver infections. Clear communication between all involved specialties is vital to ensure that the patient and any close contacts are treated quickly and appropriately to avoid severe consequences.
