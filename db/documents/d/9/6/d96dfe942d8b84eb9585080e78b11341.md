Lumbar disc herniations (LDH) are a relatively common and early manifestation of degeneration of the lumbar spine. The reported incidence of LDH is 2% ~3% and the prevalence is around 12%.

The first description of a disc herniation causing sciatica was made as early as 1934.

The first documented experience with the micro-lumbar discectomy (MLD) technique using an operating microscope was in 1977, independently by both Yasargil and Caspar in Europe.

Today, microdiscectomy with its smaller incision, less traumatic approach, and better visualization of the operative field than standard open discectomy is considered the gold standard for removing most lumbar disc herniations. Because of its collinear light and magnification, an operating microscope is preferred; however, magnifying loupes and a headlight may also be used. Most procedures are now done in the outpatient setting.

The major advantage of MLD compared to open/standard (SD) is the minimal trauma to the multifidus and reduced risk of post-operative peridural fibrosis.
