The anterior compartment of the lower limb receives its blood supply from the anterior tibial artery, a branch of the popliteal artery. The blood supply of the lower limb originates at the popliteal artery before splitting into the anterior tibial artery and posterior tibial artery. The posterior tibial continues down the posterior aspect of the leg to supply the posterior compartment muscles as well as giving off the peroneal artery, while the anterior tibial artery courses anteriorly between the tibia and fibula, passing through the interosseous membrane to supply the anterior muscles of the lower limb. It courses inferiorly down the leg and into the foot where it eventually becomes the dorsalis pedis artery, which supplies the tarsal bones and the dorsal aspect of the metatarsals. The dorsalis pedis artery eventually anastomoses with the lateral plantar artery to form the deep plantar arch.
