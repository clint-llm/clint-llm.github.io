Herpangina itself is generally a mild condition, but some causative microorganisms, such as enterovirus 71, may result in severe complications, including the following:

- Brain stem encephalitis

- Acute flaccid paralysis

- Aseptic meningitis

- Myocarditis

Such patients are generally deemed critical and necessitate hospitalization. ICU care is advised in some cases.
