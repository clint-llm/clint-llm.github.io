Podiatric fluoroscopy is a useful tool for the identification of injuries and diagnostic or treatment injections. Communication with the patient on the positioning is important, and it is beneficial to have an assistant to help during injections. Healthcare team outcomes are enhanced with good interprofessional communication between nurses, clinicians (including mid-level practitioners), and X-ray technicians. These teams must coordinate to limit radiation exposure and obtain proper imaging. Using fluoroscopy in the clinic as well as intraoperatively has shown to help with clinical diagnosis and prediction of postoperative alignment. When done properly with a coordinated team, fluoroscopic radiographs have been shown to have high reliability.
