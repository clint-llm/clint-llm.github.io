For patients with mild cases of dermatitis artefacta associated with common stressors like pressure, anxiety or depression, the prognosis is good. However chronic cases of dermatitis artefacta that are associated with medical problems and chronic skin damage usually have a guarded outcome. These people usually cannot be cured, and relapses are very common. When the condition is left untreated, it can lead to severe self-mutilation and poor aesthetics with disfiguring scars. Tragically, suicide is also a real potential outcome in some of these patients.
