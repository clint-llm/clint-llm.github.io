Vascular surgeons are familiar with the most common anatomic variants, which help them decide on the best surgical approach. CTA is an iodine-rich contrast-enhanced visualization, which surgeonsÂ often uses to detail the vasculature and visualization of the morphology and location of the lesion. Vascular surgeons have the challenge of deciding whether to intervene surgically and the right tempo and approach to take. They typically prefer early intervention (within 2 weeks of stroke onset). A retrospective analysis contrasted early (less than 2 weeks) with delayed (2 to 8 weeks) carotid endarterectomy intervention results for minor and moderate strokes of the MCA. Both early and delayed interventions had satisfactory outcomes, although early endarterectomy seemed to avoid recurrent strokes best.
