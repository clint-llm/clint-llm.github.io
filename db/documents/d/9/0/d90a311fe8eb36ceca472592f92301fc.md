The most common adverse effects accompanying albendazole use are headaches and elevated liver enzymes, with 10% to 20% of patients experiencing elevated liver enzymes.

Other serious side effects includeÂ leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia, with patients who have preexisting liver damage or dysfunction at the highest risk for developing these conditions.

Patients with neuro-helminth infection may experience symptoms such as focal neurologic deficits, seizures, and headaches more frequently compared to other parasitic infections due to the destruction of helminthic larvae and cysts in the brain. They also may experience meningeal signs and increased intracranial pressure due to the local inflammatory reaction from parasite death. Mitigating these symptoms is possible with the coadministration of steroids and anticonvulsant medication.
