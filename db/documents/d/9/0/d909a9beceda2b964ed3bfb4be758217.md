Because of its location in the popliteal region of the knee, it is crucial to know the location of the popliteal vein in a posterior approach to the knee. The posterior approach to the knee is not a common technique, and its most common utility is in the repair of the neurovascular bundle in trauma cases. Though less common, it also has utility in the repair of avulsion fractures from the posterior cruciate ligament attachment on the tibial plateau, Baker cyst excision, gastrocnemius muscle recession secondary to contractures, and hamstring lengthening.

It is essential to have a complete understanding of the normal anatomy as well as the anatomical variants of the popliteal vein and the rest of the neurovascular bundle in the popliteal fossa as an injury to these structures could result in significant neurovascular compromise to the lower extremity. When performing deep dissection using the posterior approach, blunt dissection is suggested near the neurovascular bundle to minimize the risk of injury.

In traumatic popliteal injuries, the popliteal artery and vein are both at risk. Though anÂ injury to the popliteal artery carries an increased risk of lower leg ischemia and subsequent amputation, cases in which both the popliteal vein and artery are compromised carry have not been found to increase the rates of amputation versus arterial injury alone.
