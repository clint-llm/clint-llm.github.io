Apoptosis is an energy-dependent, biochemically-mediated process of programmed cell death. Apoptosis is essential for many processes, including the elimination of infected or transformed cells, a properly functioning immune system, organismal development, and maintaining homeostasis and normal cell turnover in the body. The two main branches of apoptotic pathways are the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis, in which the signals initiating cell death originate from within or outside the cell, respectively.

The intrinsic pathway initiates from intracellular sensors that detect DNA damage, the presence of viral pathogens, or in response to the lack of survival signals provided externally from other cells. In contrast, the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis initiates with a pro-death signal originating from outside the cell, most often by Natural Killer (NK) lymphocytes or CD8-positive Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).
