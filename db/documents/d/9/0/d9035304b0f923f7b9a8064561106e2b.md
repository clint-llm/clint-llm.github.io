The rectus abdominis and pyramidalis muscles are contained within the rectus sheath as paired, midline abdominal wall muscles. The pyramidalis muscle can be absent in 20% of people. Contraction of the rectus abdominis and pyramidalis muscles causes flexion of the lumbar spine. Abdominal wall muscles also play a significant role in intra-abdominal pressure and provide support to the axial skeleton.

One recent study noted the transversus abdominis muscle within the rectus sheath, especially superiorly near the costal margin. The presence of the transversus abdominis muscle in the posterior rectus sheath decreases as the sheath descends caudally.
