The innervation of the muscles of the hand is by the ulnar, median, and radial nerves. The ulnar nerve arises from the medial cord of the brachial plexus. The nerve originates from the ventral rami of the C8 and T1 nerve roots. The median nerve arises from the convergence of the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus. The nerve originates from the ventral rami of the C5 through T1 nerve root.Â The radial nerve originates from the ventral rami of the C5 through T1 nerve root and is a terminal branch of the posterior cord.
