An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach to acute and post-acute care of patients with transverse myelitis can help achieve the best possible outcomes. Essential to good outcomes in TM is physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT). Early integration of therapies in acute inpatient stay and continuation of this during the rehabilitation phase can help improve outcomes. In patients who are going to make a meaningful recovery, independence is best achieved with intensive PT and OT to regain lost function. Coordination of care from in-hospital services to out of hospital services allows for a smooth transition of care. Consultation with a social worker can help with arranging appropriate durable medical equipment (DME) at home prior to discharge. Pharmacists can help with counseling of medication side effects and reviewing drug interactions.
