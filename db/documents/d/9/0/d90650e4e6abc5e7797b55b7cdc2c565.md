The digestive system is the primary site of action for most GI hormones and related polypeptides. The stomach is the primary site of gastrin production with some D-cells also populating the duodenum. Somatostatin and histamine are also produced in the stomach by enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, which is an enteroendocrine cell subtype. The small intestines, namely the duodenum and jejunum handle secretion of CCK, secretin, GIP, and motilin.
