Equipment for subclavian access depends on the type of access necessary. Kits are available for many different needs and include triple lumen central lines, large bore catheters for dialysis, large bore single lumen "trauma" lines, permanent subcutaneous port kits and tunneled catheters. General supplies for all catheter placements include a needle, guide wire, knife, dilators, and the catheter itself. One will also need all supplies to ensure sterile technique throughout the procedure including skin prep, personal protective equipment, sterile draping, and dressings.

There are also differences in catheters themselves. Simple triple lumen catheters can have different sized lumens and can be impregnated with antimicrobial substances to prevent infection. More permanent tunneled catheters often have a cuff that is buried subcutaneously to prevent catheter dislodgement. Subcutaneous ports also have different features, for example, power port capabilities to allow for rapid injection of contrast before CT scanning.

It is important to understand the indication for the central venous catheter placement so that the correct catheter is chosen for the patient's needs.
