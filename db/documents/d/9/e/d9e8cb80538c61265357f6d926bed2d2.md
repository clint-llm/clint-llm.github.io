X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers. In the setting of diagnostic radiology, X-rays have long enjoyed use in the imaging of body tissues and aid in the diagnosis of disease. Simply understood, the generation of X-rays occurs when electrons are accelerated under a potential difference and turned into electromagnetic radiation.

Once the high kinetic energy electrons finally reach the anode target, this initiates the process of X-ray production. Tungsten is often the usual anode target, although other material targets are also employed. Electrons come extremely close to the nucleus of the target, causing a deceleration and change in direction, converting the kinetic energy to electromagnetic radiation in a process known as “breaking radiation” or bremsstrahlung.

Before understanding the final production of an X-ray image, it is essential to understand the interaction of X-rays with individuals exposed to X-rays. There are three important types of interactions that occur between X-rays and the tissues of our body. The “classical” or “coherent” interaction occurs when an X-ray strikes an orbital electron and subsequently bounces off and changes direction.

Image detectors come in the form of digital and analog film detectors.
