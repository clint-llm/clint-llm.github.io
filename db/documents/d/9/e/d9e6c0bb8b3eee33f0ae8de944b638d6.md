Palatoplasty may be challenging and complex in patients with certain clefts when the defects are wide or bilateral. Cleft palate repair objectives must be defined before undertaking an operative intervention to achieve good outcomes. The preoperative evaluation must be comprehensive and include a thorough oral cavity examination by the reconstructive surgeon and a middle ear assessment by an otorhinolaryngologist with or without an audiologist.

Evidence-based guidelines regarding the best approach for cleft palate repair are not available because of the heterogeneity of cleft palate types, heterogeneity of technique, heterogeneity of follow-up (because patients with palatal clefting may experience lifelong sequelae despite early surgical management), and patient characteristics (non-syndromic vs. syndromic, etc.)

In the postoperative period, nurses' role in the recovery unit is critical. They monitor the patient for airway obstruction, bleeding, and pain. Some patients may struggle to maintain adequate oral intake postoperatively; to prevent dehydration and malnutrition, these patients will likely require care from nurses, speech and swallowing therapists, lactation consultants, pediatricians, and surgeons. In patients with multiple comorbidities, particularly syndromic patients, the need for meticulous planning and inclusion of multiple different specialists on the healthcare team is critical for optimizing outcomes and minimizing complications.
