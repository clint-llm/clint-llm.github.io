Hurthle cell carcinoma shares many clinical and histological features with other types of thyroid cancers, in particular with follicular thyroid carcinoma.

Compared to follicular thyroid carcinoma, Hurthle cell carcinomas tend to be larger, multifocal, have a higher rate of local thyroid invasion, lymph node metastases, and distant metastases.

Rapidly growing thyroid carcinomas should always be evaluated for anaplastic thyroid carcinoma as these tumors carry a significantly worse prognosis and need immediate treatment with systemic chemotherapy and sometimes combined with radiation of the neck.
