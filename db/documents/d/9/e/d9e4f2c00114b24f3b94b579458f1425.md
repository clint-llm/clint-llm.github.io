Postmenopausal bleeding is always considered abnormal, and further investigation is needed for the diagnosis. The first line diagnostic test in postmenopausal women is transvaginal ultrasound. The normal endometrial thickness is less than 4mm, and the thickening of the endometrium of more than 4mm should be further investigated with the help of endometrial biopsy. Transvaginal ultrasound has low sensitivity in premenopausal women due to the presence of variations in endometrial thickness during the menstrual cycle. In premenopausal women, endometrial biopsy should be considered as the first-line investigation.

An endometrial biopsy isÂ obtained with the help of dilation and curettage, and the biopsy is then evaluated by a histopathologist for the presence of hyperplasia, dysplasia, or carcinoma. Uterine sarcomas may be detected on transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound, but a definitive diagnosis is only made on the microscopic examination of the tumor cells. There is no evidence that the screening for endometrial cancer in asymptomatic patients is of any benefit.
