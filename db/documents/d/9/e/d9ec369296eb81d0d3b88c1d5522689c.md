Two uncommon variants of pityriasis alba have been described. The lesions of pigmenting pityriasis have a central zone of bluish hyperpigmentation surrounded by a hypopigmented halo. These are often associated with dermatophyte infection and are found primarily in darker skin types from South Africa and the Middle East. Extensive pityriasis alba is characterized by widespread, symmetrical, and more persistent involvement of the skin, lesions distributed predominantly on the trunk rather than on the face, a higher female-to-male ratio, and the histologic absence of spongiosis.
