Melanoma develops from a malignant transformation of melanocytes. Even though the exact pathophysiology of mucosal melanomas is yet to be determined,Â some pathways have been identified.

**Mutations in c-KIT**

Recent data indicates that c-KIT (CD117) is overexpressed in many mucosal melanoma cases. This pathway is important and common in acral and mucosal melanoma, melanomas unrelated to sun exposure.

**Mutations in BRAF**

Bioinformatics Resources and Applications Facility (BRAF) protein mutations are uncommon in mucosal melanoma and found in less than 10% of cases. However, in cutaneous melanoma, BRAF mutations are found in up to 80% of cases. Dabrafenib and vemurafenib are used for patients exhibiting BRAF mutation-positive melanoma.
