Diclofenac is an FDA-approved drug used in the treatment and management of acute and chronic pain associated with inflammatory conditions, especially those involving the musculoskeletal system. These include osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Topically, it can treat actinic keratosis.

Diclofenac has been used off-label to treat biliary colic, corneal abrasion, fever, gout, migraine, myalgia, and post-episiotomy pain. Diclofenac 1% gel was approved for over-the-counter distribution in February 2020 for the management of arthritic pain. Otherwise, diclofenac is only available via prescription.

Studies have also elucidated the benefits of using diclofenac post-operatively to reduce the need for rescue analgesia in patients after surgery.
