The strength by which oxygen binds to hemoglobin is affected by several factors and can be represented as a shift to the left or right in the oxygen dissociation curve. A rightward shift of the curve indicates that hemoglobin has a decreased affinity for oxygen, thus, oxygen actively unloads. A shift to the left indicates increased hemoglobin affinity for oxygen and an increased reluctance to release oxygen. Several physiologic factors are responsible for shifting the curve left or right, such as pH, carbon dioxide (CO2), temperature, and 2,3-Disphosphoglycerate.

**pH**

A decrease in pH (acidity) shifts the dissociation curve to the right while an increase in pH (alkalinity) shifts the dissociation curve to the left. At greater concentrations of hydrogen ions, hemoglobin stabilizes in the deoxygenated T-state. Therefore, as the pH decreases, and the CO2 increases, the hemoglobin affinity for oxygen will decrease. This inverse relationship is known as the Bohr effect and is evident when metabolically active tissue metabolizes glucose and oxygen into CO2 and organic acids. The hemoglobin then has a reduced affinity to oxygen and helps to deliver it to tissues in need.

**Carbon Dioxide**

Carbon dioxide affects the curve in two ways: the Bohr effect and through the accumulation of carbamino compounds that are generated by chemical interactions. These compounds form carbaminohemoglobin, which in return stabilizes the T state, lowers affinity for oxygen, and induces oxygen unloading. Only a small portion of carbon dioxide gets transported in this manner. The majority of carbon dioxide is carried in the bicarbonate buffer system. Upon entrance into red blood cells, carbon dioxide is quickly converted to carbonic acid by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic acid immediately dissociates into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. As previously stated, an increase in hydrogen ions stabilize the hemoglobin in the T-state and induces oxygen unloading which leads to shifting of the dissociation curve to the right.

**2,3 Diphosphoglycerate (DPG)**

2,3-Diphosphoglycerate (DPG) is an intermediate product of glycolysis that is produced within the red blood cell that affects hemoglobin’s affinity for oxygen. High concentrations of 2,3-DPG will shift the dissociation curve to the right whereas low concentrations will shift the curve to the left.

**Temperature**

The effect of temperature on the curve is relatively straightforward. Oxygen unloading is favored at higher temperatures which will cause a rightward shift. On the other hand, lower temperatures will cause a leftward shift in the dissociation curve. A notable example of this is exercise, where the temperature of muscle increases secondary to its utilization, thus shifting the curve to the right and allowing oxygen to be more easily unloaded from hemoglobin and deliver to tissues in need.

**Carbon Monoxide**

Hemoglobin binds carbon monoxide (CO) 200 to 300 times more than with oxygen, resulting in the formation of carboxyhemoglobin and preventing the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin due to the competition of the same binding sites. The binding of one CO molecule to hemoglobin increases the affinity of the other binding spots for oxygen, leading to a left shift in the dissociation curve. This shift prevents oxygen unloading in peripheral tissue and therefore the oxygen concentration of the tissue is much lower than normal. Thus in the presence of carbon monoxide, a person can experience severe tissue hypoxia while maintaining a normal PaO2.

**Fetal Hemoglobin**

Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is structurally different than adult hemoglobin because it is composed of two alpha and two gamma chains. The gamma chains of HbF have a reduced affinity for 2,3-DPG, thus allowing HbF to have a higher affinity for oxygen at lower levels of partial pressure and resulting in a leftward shift of the dissociation curve. This state is advantageous in the womb, as the fetus can pull oxygen from maternal circulation with greater ease.  At the level of the placenta, 2,3-DPG interacts more readily with adult hemoglobin, inducing oxygen unloading. Whereas, fetal hemoglobin is unaffected by the 2,3-DPG and can bind oxygen easily.
