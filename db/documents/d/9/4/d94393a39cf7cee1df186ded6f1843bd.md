First, the nail should be cleansed by having the patient wash their hands if there is visible debris on the hands and nails. Additional cleansing with alcohol (or acetone, in some cases, as in nail polish) may be required to ensure the appropriate ability to examine the nails.

Dermoscopy with nonpolarized light ensures better visualization of surface irregularities, such as pits and ridges, whereas polarized light blunts surface irregularities and enables visualization of deeper structures, such as nail bed details. For better visualization of the nail apparatus, an interface or immersion medium is recommended, usually with ultrasound gel. Transillumination can be used to evaluate the extent of a nail tumor, such as a glomus tumor.
