Magnesium use is indicated for a variety of diseases. This is due to the variety of effects magnesium has within the body. Administration of magnesium can be divided into FDA versus non-FDA approved. Also, magnesium is commonly used in over-the-counter products.

**Hypomagnesemia: Magnesium Concentration of Less Than 1.8 mg/dL**

- Magnesium depletion can result from inadequate intake, decreased renal absorption, or impaired gastrointestinal (GI) absorption.

- Risk factors for hypomagnesemia include those with GI disease, chronic diarrhea, proton pump inhibitor therapy, alcohol use disorder, and diuretic use, both loop and thiazide. It is common to see hypomagnesemia along with low levels of other electrolytes, such as hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. In patients with refractory hypokalemia or hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia may be the reason. It is difficult to correct these electrolyte imbalances without first treating the magnesium imbalance.

- Symptoms of hypomagnesemia correlate with the development of concurrent hypocalcemia. The signs include Trousseau sign, Chvostek sign, hyperreflexia, tremor, and muscle fasciculations. Patients may also experience vague symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and weakness. Severe hypomagnesemia, less than 1.25 mg/dL, can result in generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

**Eclampsia or Severe Pre-Eclampsia**

- Magnesium is given to those with severe pre-eclampsia to prevent seizures and those with eclampsia to control seizures.

**Constipation**

- Over-the-counter laxatives, such as Milk of Magnesia, commonly contain magnesium.

**Pre-Term Labor (Off-Label Use)**

- Magnesium can be given as a tocolytic to stop the progression of pre-term labor.

**Arrhythmias (Off-Label Use)**

- Administration of magnesium is recommended in certain arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes, digoxin-associated arrhythmia, ventricular arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia.

**Asthma: Acute Severe Exacerbation (Off-Label Use)**

- Magnesium is recommended as adjunctive therapy for patients with severe, life-threatening exacerbation or refractory cases after 1 hour of intensive conventional therapy. Magnesium allows bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, which aids in patients with status asthmatics.

**Migraines: Over the Counter Supplementation**

- The use of magnesium in migraines is limited at this moment. Hypomagnesemia has been found in patients with migraines. Supplemental magnesium is considered an inexpensive, simple preventive treatment option for some. However, the dosage required is above the daily requirement, thus potentially leading to hypermagnesemia. The American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society have stated that magnesium therapy is “probably effective” for migraine prevention.
