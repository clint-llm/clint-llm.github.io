Identification of high-risk patients for refeeding syndrome is crucial for the prevention of refeeding syndrome development and complications. High-risk features are discussed previously in this article. NICE has established guidelines for the prevention of refeeding syndrome following the identification of a high-risk patient. These guidelines include incorporating a nutritional assessment before replenishment, checking baseline electrolyte levels and monitoring for two weeks in this setting, and screening for recent weight changes, alcohol use, or nutritional changes. Further education surrounding the etiology and characteristics of refeeding syndrome may be beneficial for providers, especially in the ICU environment.
