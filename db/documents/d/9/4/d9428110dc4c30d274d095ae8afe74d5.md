Because YNS involves multiple organ systems, complications depend on which specific symptoms the patient exhibits. Dystrophic and discolored nails can cause psychological distress from embarrassment, and onycholysis can be painful.

**Pulmonary**

Large and persistent pleural effusions are uncomfortable and can cause a significant decline in functional status. Effusions are associated with other potentially fatal complications, such as infection and respiratory distress.

**Lymphatic**

Significant edema usually affects the bilateral lower extremities leading to difficulty with ambulation and deconditioning. Furthermore, longstanding lymphedema leads to changes in skin texture and color, which can be esthetically unappealing and can lead to cellulitis and other infections.
