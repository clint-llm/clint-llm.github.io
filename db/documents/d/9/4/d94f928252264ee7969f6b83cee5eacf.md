Based on the acuity of the clinical condition, the PPV may be emergent with less time for preparation. The most important part of the preparation is determining what the indication is for the PPV. Therefore, a thorough ophthalmic exam with indirect ophthalmoscopy is needed to determine the structures involved. An ultrasound exam of the vitreous and retina may be necessary if vitreal opacities exclude a clear view of the retina. The ultrasound can pick up vitreal and/or retinal detachments in these circumstances. These measures not only determine the urgency of the procedure but also determine the type of procedure as well. Once the type of procedure has been scheduled, standard pre-operative measures ensue. The eye requires dilation before surgery.
