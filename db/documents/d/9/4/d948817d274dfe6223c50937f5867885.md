TIA symptoms have often resolved by the time the patients presented to her doctor or emergency department. The history of present illness should include onset, duration, timing, complete neurological symptoms, associated symptoms, and any aggravating or relieving factors. The clinician should also try to identify the associated risk factors such as coronary artery disease, smoking, drug abuse, obesity, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, as well as personal or family history of hypercoagulability disorders, stroke, or TIA. The history should include etiological clues such as a history of atrial fibrillation, recent myocardial infarction to suggest a cardioembolic source, transient loss of vision like a curtain rising or descending will suggest an internal carotid artery problem. The presence of any cortical symptoms such as language disturbance or visual field loss will point to a cortical TIA rather than a lacunar syndrome.

Physical examination should focus on identifying focal neurological deficits and speech disturbances which are the most common presenting symptoms in patients with TIA. Cranial nerve examination can yield findings of monocular blindness, disconjugate gaze, facial droop, hemianopia, diplopia, abnormal tongue movement, difficulty swallowing, and auditory dysfunction. Some of the motor findings include unilateral weakness in the upper or lower extremities, face, and tongue, increased tone, clonus, rigidity and also abnormal reflexes that could occur with TIA. Cardiac examination and carotid auscultation for a carotid bruit are very important. Fundoscopy is important to look for any fundoscopic evidence of vascular changes as a result of hypertension or diabetes. It may also show a Hollenhurst plague which will indicate an underlying internal carotid artery disease.
