The mechanism of action of topical corticosteroids is vast, consisting of anti-inflammatory, anti-mitotic, and immunosuppressive effects.

The anti-inflammatory effect of topical corticosteroids consists of vasoconstriction, inhibition of the release of phospholipase A2, and a direct inhibitory effect on DNA and inflammatory transcription factors.

The anti-mitotic effect of topical corticosteroids play a great role in the treatment of psoriasis;Â it is proposed that this decrease in epidermal mitosis is secondary to an increase in lipocortin, an endogenous glucocorticoid-regulated protein. An anti-mitotic effect is also present in the dermis which inhibits cell proliferation and collagen synthesis.

The immunosuppressive effects of topical corticosteroids involve the inhibition of humoral factors involved in the inflammatory response as well as suppression of the maturation, differentiation, and proliferation of all immune cells.
