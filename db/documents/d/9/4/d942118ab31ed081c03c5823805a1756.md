The Sylvian fissure has different anatomical variants. Yasargil proposed a classification of the Sylvian fissure in four categories according to the intraoperative observation.

- Sylvian Fissure Category I: straight wide or narrow

- Sylvian Fissure Category II: wide fissure, herniation of the temporal or frontal lobe

- Sylvian Fissure Category III: narrow fissure, herniation of the temporal or frontal lobe

- Sylvian Fissure Category IV: herniation of the temporal and the frontal lobes

The Yasargil classification of the anatomical variants of the Sylvian fissure has a great significance for preoperative planning of pterional approaches to aneurysms. The extension and the directionÂ of the Sylvian fissure splitting should be based on this configuration, and categories II-IV can be particularly challenging.
