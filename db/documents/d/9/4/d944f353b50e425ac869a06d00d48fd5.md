Providing care to patients undergoing facial reinnervation procedures involves a comprehensive clinical team that typically includes a plastic surgeon, facial plastic surgeon, neurotologist or otolaryngologist, and a physical therapist to provide postoperative rehabilitation. In addition, a clinical photographer may be helpful for regular photodocumentation of progress, and if botulinum toxin injections are required to manage synkinesis, a nurseÂ or advanced practice provider may provide them. In many cases, the etiology of the paralysis also necessitates the involvement of other specialists, such as a surgical oncologist, radiation oncologist, medical oncologist, radiologist, audiologist, ophthalmologist, and wound care nurse. Nursing care is particularly vital for these patients who need perioperative care, support, and education.

The outcomes of facial reinnervation depend on the timing of surgery and the rehabilitation process.
