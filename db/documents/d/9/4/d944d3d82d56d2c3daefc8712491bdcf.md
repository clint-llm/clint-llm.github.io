**Atlantoaxial Dislocation/Subluxation**

Most of the time, atlantoaxial dislocation or dissociation (AOD) is due to high-energy trauma such as motor vehicle accidents. These injuries are affiliated with high mortality rates due to proximity to the brainstem and potential vascular structures. There are three types of AOD, and all three are believed to all share the same mechanism of injury of extreme hyperextension followed by lateral flexion. It is important to note that the method for detecting an AOD on imaging is to look for the basion-dens distance. If greater than 10 mm, this is highly likely of an atlantoaxial dissociation.

**Type I - Ventral Dislocation**

- Most common

- Ventral dislocation of the occiput

**Type II - Longitudinal Distraction**

- Most unstable

**Type II - Dorsal Dislocation**

**Nontraumative Subluxation**

Certain disease states carry an increased incidence of atlantoaxial joint instability. This is primarily due to ligamentous laxity, which carries a higher risk for subluxation. Some of these conditions include spontaneous hyperemic dislocation, nasopharyngeal torticollis, also known as Grisel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, trisomy 21, Morquio syndrome, and Marfan syndrome.

**Traumatic Rotatory Subluxation**

Age-related bony architecture plays a role in tendencies for trauma. In elderly populations, there is more pronounced bony degeneration and decreased bone density, which also leads to cartilaginous loss. This may account for a thinner joint space and predispose the patient to endure a life-threatening injury if they sustain an atlantoaxial distraction or subluxation. Also, children tend to have a higher likelihood of having hypermobility in their joints and ligaments. Therefore, traumatic rotational subluxation due to hyperflexion and rotational forces may be seen more often in pediatric populations.

**Fractures of the Atlas with Subsequent Transverse Ligament Rupture**

Jefferson fracture is the name given to describe atlas fracture. When the weakest portion of the vertebral body is impacted with intense axial loading, the anterior and posterior arches are usually affected. This type of fracture is often seen when a patient has a history of diving headfirst into shallow water. Specific subtypes of the atlas due to high-intensity axial loading can be classified into 3 subtypes: posterior arch, burst, and lateral mass injuries. Sometimes, the transverse and alar ligaments may be torn without fracture to the atlas. These injuries are best evaluated by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

**Dens Fractures**

- **Type I -**avulsion fracture of the odontoid tip at the alar ligament insertion site

- **Type II -**a fracture at the base of the odontoid process

- **Type III -**a fracture that extends into the axis body

**Cervicogenic Headache**

This is a subtype of chronic headaches, which is likely a secondary headache stemming from pathology in the upper cervical joints or the atlantooccipital joint. With ipsilateral, pericranial muscle pain being the main symptom of a cervicogenic headache, the C1-C3 nerve roots are thought to be a nociceptive origin for referred pain up to the occiput. It is important to distinguish a cervicogenic headache from other headache subtypes and more ominous pathology such as cervical artery dysfunction, intracranial pathology, and cervical myelopathy.

**Occipital Neuralgia**

The posterior cervical plexus, also known as Cruveilhier’s plexus, can be entrapped by a collection of muscle fibers. As the nerve fibers from the posterior rami of C1-C3 exit, hypertonic suboccipital muscles and even the superficial muscles such as the trapezius and splenius capitis can compress and ensnare the surrounding nerve structures. Hypertonic muscles can subsequently inhibit the functions of the nerve fibers leading to inflammation, injury, and severe piercing or throbbing-like sensation in the upper heck and occiput. This condition is known as occipital neuralgia.
