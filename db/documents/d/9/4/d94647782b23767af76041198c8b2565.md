Connective tissue is one of the basic tissue types of the body. As its name implies, "connective tissue" is a term given to several body tissues that connect, support, and help bind other tissues. While the various connective tissues of the body are diverse, they share numerous structural and functional features that explain why they are subsumed into a single tissue category. Connective tissue can be broken down into two primary categories: connective tissue proper and specialized connective tissue. Connective tissue proper is further subdivided into loose and dense connective tissues. Specialized connective tissues are diverse as they are composed of varying specialized cells and ground substance. Specialized connective tissues include adipose, cartilage, bone, blood, and reticular tissues.
