Currently, effective treatment for the complete cure for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy has not been found. Although drugs such as cidofovir, cytarabine, and mefloquine have been investigated, they have not shown to be clinically beneficial in the treatment of PML.

At present, treatment is guided by efforts made to boost the adaptive immune response, and the methods to achieve this goal varies depending on the clinical setting.

In HIV patients, prompt initiation of HAART is advised. In transplant patients, the use of multiple immunosuppressive therapies may be limited while weighing the risks of graft rejection. In PML induced by natalizumab use, cessation of therapy and resorting to plasma exchange therapy as a means of treatment have been advised.

Certain studies have explored the benefits of bolstering the adaptive immune response using dendritic cell vaccines.

With regard to the treatment of PML IRIS, improvement in neurological status has been observed with the cessation of ART therapy. Certain studies have shown favorable outcomes with steroid treatment.
