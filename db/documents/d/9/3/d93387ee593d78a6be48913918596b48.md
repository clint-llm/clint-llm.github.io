General surgeons, oncologic surgeons, and breast surgeons are capable of performing sentinel lymph node biopsies for breast cancer. Sentinel lymph biopsy is typically performed under general anesthesia or deep sedation. If using a radiotracer, placement generally is by a radiologist into or adjacent to the tumor bed, or in the subareolar tissue, before the procedure.
