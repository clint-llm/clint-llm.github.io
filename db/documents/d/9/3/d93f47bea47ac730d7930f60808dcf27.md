Laboratory studies to detect a pathological increase in circulating catecholamines due to adrenal neoplasm, pheochromocytoma utilizes the normal excretion of metanephrines through the renal system. Increased levels of urinary or plasma metanephrines, the normal breakdown product of catecholamines, is a highly sensitive screening test for pheochromocytoma. Measuring VMA levels in a 24-hour urine collection is a highly specific test in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. CT, MRI, or PET imaging commonly follow a biochemical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma via urine studies to visualize the extent of the neoplastic process. Additional serum, imaging,Â and genetic investigations may be indicated preceding the diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma due to its association with familial multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.
