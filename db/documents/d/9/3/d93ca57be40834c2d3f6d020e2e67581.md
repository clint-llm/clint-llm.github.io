A clear watery discharge from the nose or ears, usually in the setting of recent trauma or surgery, is the most common presentation of cranial CSF leaks. In some cases, headaches can be associated with a clear watery discharge, which occurs due to intracranial hypotension due to the loss of CSF. This headache is positional in most cases, increasing in an upright position and relieved on lying down. Anosmia in patients with CSF leak should point towards a traumatic cause, usually involving injury to the ethmoid bone.

Depending on the injury site, some patients might even present with hearing loss that might be conductive or sensorineural. Spinal leaks are usually associated with postoperative wound complications, and they also present with symptoms attributable to intracranial hypotension similar to cranial CSF leaks.
