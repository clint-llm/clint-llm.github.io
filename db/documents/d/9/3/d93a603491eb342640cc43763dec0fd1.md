The exact prevalence is unknown. There have been fewer than 500 cases worldwide that have been reported in the literature. It is difficult to determine the prevalence, as some patients were reported more than once. Also, due to the phenotypic variability, mildly affected individuals are largely unrecognized or unreported.

There is no race predilection. All age groups can be affected. However, the onset of the disease is typically after birth and under the age of five.
