The prognosis of spinal dysraphism varies from case to case. It depends on many factors, such as the extent of neurological defect, presence of congenital malformations, time to treatment, and level of care. Usually, lower and less severe lesions have a better outcome as compared to higher lesions with hydrocephalus. Patients with lower and smaller lesions can be ambulatory.Â The majority of patients with myelomeningocele have normal intelligence, although 60% have some learning disabilities.

The life expectancy of patients suffering from spinal dysraphism depends on the size of the lesion. Patients with large complex defects have a shorter life expectancy. According to statistics, 40% to 50% of children with severe defects die as infants. Patients with higher and smaller lesions and no hydrocephalus have a longer life expectancy. Renal failure is the most common cause of death among these patients.
