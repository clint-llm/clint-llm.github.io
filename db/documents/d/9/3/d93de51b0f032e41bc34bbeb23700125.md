Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disease that may affect almost every organ system. It involves mutations in genes (TSC1 and TSC2) that are responsible for the production of proteins that regulate cell division and growth in the body. When this balance is disrupted by the gene mutations, hamartomas may grow in the brain, skin, heart, kidney, liver, and lungs, affecting the function of these organs.

**TSC1 and TSC2 Gene Mutations**

There are two specific gene mutations:

- TSC1 mutation occurs on chromosome 9 and is related to hamartin protein production.

- TSC2 is on chromosome 16 and affects tuberin protein production.

It is these genes that are thought to cause the characteristic tumors of the condition. The gene mutation may be inherited or may occur spontaneously. Most cases present sporadically, with no known family history but approximately 1 in 3 patients inherit a defected TSC1 or TSC2 gene. If a parent has tuberous sclerosis, their children will carry a 50% risk of inheriting the disease. It follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, and males and females are equally affected.

**Hamartin and Tuberin Protein**

Hamartin and tuberin play a role in a complex that controls cell growth and division in the body. The exact mechanism of pathology that leads to unregulated cell growth and the appearance of tumors is not clear, but it is thought to be due to changes in the signaling of mTOR. The proteins hamartin and tuberin are thought to modulate gene transcription and suppress tumor growth.

**Affected Areas and Organs**

Tuberous sclerosis causes tumors to grow in multiple locations. This results in a variation of the severity of the condition between individuals.

- Skin or nail lesions do not usually cause serious problems but can result in aesthetic effects.

- Tumors of the brain often cause seizures or developmental delays.

- Angiomyolipoma and cysts in the kidneys may affect renal function and renal failure may result. Some patients have symptoms similar to polycystic kidney disease, which has similar genetic characteristics.

- Cardiac rhabdomyomas that present in adults are not usually large enough to cause significant damage but they can be fatal in newborn infants.

- Pulmonary cysts andÂ lymphangioleiomyomatosis can affect the lungs and are the most common cause of fatality for patients that exhibit evidence of lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
