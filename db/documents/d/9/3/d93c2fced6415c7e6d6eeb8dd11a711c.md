Intravenous application is the preferred agent in inpatient settings for the management of flash pulmonary edema and treatment-resistant forms of edema. Ethacrynic acid may be administered via IV at 0.5 to 1 mg/kg. Oral forms are also available at doses of 20 mg to 400 mg given one to four times daily, though typical doses are 50 to 200 mg daily. The onset of action of the oral form occurs with peak diuresis at about 2 to 4 hours, showing complete diuresis within 6 to 8 hours. However, the onset of action intravenously is approximately 5 minutes, with a peak of activity occurring at 30 minutes.
