Gunshot wounds typically consist of the permanent tract or cavity, surrounded by a perimeter of abraded tissue called the abrasion rim. The wound also contains a grease collar, resulting from the accumulation of lubricant on the tissue during penetration by the projectile.

In addition to the wound proper, other characteristics that may present include the presence of muzzle burns in contact wounds, flame burns in near-contact or close-range injuries, and soiling (enveloping of surrounding skin by smoke and gas) and tattooing (embedding of unburnt particles and metal scraps in surrounding skin) in mid-range or intermediate-range wounds.
