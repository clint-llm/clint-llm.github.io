- It usually requires 6 to 8 weeks for AZA to work. The recommendation is to consider stopping the medication if there is no improvement in 3 months.

- Checking TPMT activity is suggested before starting the medication. Misclassification of TMPT phenotype can occur by prior blood transfusion.

- Test the patient for hepatitis B and C and PPD. A pregnancy test before treatment initiation is also a recommendation.

- Complete blood count (CBC) and liver function test (LFT) monitoring weekly are recommended initially for the first 4 to 8 weeks. CBC and LFT should get checked every three months for the rest of the treatment once the maintenance dose is achieved. However, it is advisable to check CBC and LFT more frequently in patients with kidney or renal diseases or elderly patients on high dosages of AZA or low TPMT activity. If labs show leukopenia (WBC less than 3 x 10^9/L), thrombocytopenia (platelet less than 120 x 10^9/L), or transaminitis (liver biochemistry more than half of the normal upper limit), the medication should be stopped.

- If patients have abdominal pain or severe nausea/vomiting, serum amylase requires checking to rule out pancreatitis. Lymph node and skin examination should be biannual.

- Some studies suggested monitoring the level of AZA metabolites (e.g., 6-TGN and 6-MP) to avoid specific complications.
