The following steps may be performed while evaluating a patient with suspected hyponatremia

**Step 1: Plasma Osmolality (275 mOsm to 290 mOsm/kg)**

- It can help differentiate between hypertonic, isotonic, and hypotonic hyponatremia.

- True hyponatremic patients are hypotonic.

- If the patient is hypotonic, then go to step 2.

**Step 2: Urine Osmolality**

- Urine osmolality less than 100 mOsm/kg indicates primary polydipsia or reset osmostat.

- Urine osmolality greater than 100 mOsm/kg usually indicates a high ADH state, go to step 3.

**Step 3: Volume Status (ECF status)**

- Hypovolemic vs euvolemic vs hypervolemic.

- If the patient is hypovolemic, then proceed to step 4.

**Step 4: Urine Sodium Concentration**

- Urine sodium less than 10 mmol/L indicates extrarenal loss of fluid (remote diuretic use and remote vomiting).

- Urine sodium greater than 20 mmol/L suggests renal loss of urine (diuretics, vomiting, cortisol deficiency, and salt wasting nephropathies).

Other tests that might help in differentiating the causes include

- Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)

- Serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)

- Serum urea

- Liver function tests

- Chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest

- CT scan of the head
