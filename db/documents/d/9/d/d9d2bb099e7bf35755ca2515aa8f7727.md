The majority of isolated cases of breast abscess have good outcomes, but it can lead to pain, scarring, and a poor quality of life in women with recurrent infections.

Most patients have recovery within 2-3 weeks following mastitis. Any patient that continues to have features of mastitis after 5 weeks should be evaluated for malignancy or infection.

The majority of breast abscess tend to occur in the postpartum period, and if it is seen in a nonlactating female, the onus is on the clinician to rule out inflammatory breast cancer, new-onset diabetes, or infection with mycobacterium.
