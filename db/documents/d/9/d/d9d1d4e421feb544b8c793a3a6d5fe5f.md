A DLT is indicated for surgeries or procedures requiring lung isolation.

**Absolute Indications**

- Preventing damage or contamination of the healthy lung

- Prevent spillage of contamination from a lung abscess
- Prevent spillage of blood from one lung to another in pulmonary hemorrhage

- Control of distribution of ventilation

- Reduction of flow through a broncho-pleural or broncho-pleural cutaneous fistula where low resistance to flow from one lung may make it difficult to ventilate another lung.
- Bronchial disruption from trauma

- Severe unilateral lung disease: Major cyst or bulla

- Surgical exposure in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)

- Single lung lavage: Treatment for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis or cystic fibrosis

**Relative Indications**

- Deflation of one lung to provide motionless field and better surgical exposure for: 

- Thoracic aortic surgery
- Mediastinal surgery
- Esophageal surgery
- Open pulmonary resection (lobectomy or pneumonectomy)
