Opioid addiction afflicts individuals from all socioeconomic and educational backgrounds. Four million people admit to the nonmedical use of prescription opioids. Perhaps more concerning, 400,000 people had used heroin in the past month based on data from 2015 through 2016. Roughly 80% of new heroin users in the United States report pills as their initiation to opioid use and subsequent OUD.

From 2002 through 2011, approximately 25 million people in the United States began nonmedical use of pain relievers. More than 11 million misused the medications.

Emergency department visits due to complications and overdose have increased annually since 2010. Rates of ED visits involving opioids more than tripled from 1999 through 2013.

In 2017, opioid overdose was declared a national emergency in the United States.
