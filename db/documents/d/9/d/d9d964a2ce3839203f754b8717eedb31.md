Management of muscular hematomas requires the careful collaboration of all members of the healthcare team and a well-rounded interprofessional approach that considers the patient's unique history and needs to achieve the best outcomes. Traumatic muscular hematomas are often the result of a traumatic injury, and therefore should be met with thorough evaluation for traumatic injuries by an appropriate provider. A comprehensive secondary examination can be an effective way to identify less obvious injuries, and radiography is a good initial screening tool. In the setting of trauma, it is important for emergency room staff, nurses, and all consulting physicians to be aware of the potential for unidentified injuries and respond rapidly and appropriately.

Spontaneous muscular hematomas similarly require an interdisciplinary approach to achieve the best outcomes. As spontaneous muscular hematomas frequently present in the elderly with anticoagulation therapy, providers must work in conjunction with the patient's primary care provider to provide appropriate treatment. For example, stopping anticoagulation therapy may be suitable for the management of a patient's spontaneous muscular hematoma but is not reasonable from the perspective of his or her other medical comorbidities. Therefore, all providers involved in the care of this patient must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of any intervention, with consideration given to all medical comorbidities. [Level 5]
