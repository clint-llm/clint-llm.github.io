All blood vessels are made up of two distinct cell types, ECs and mural cells, with the latter composed of vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes. While ECs are the main component of the BBB, allowing for high selectivity, the interactions between ECs and mural cells allow for induction and maintenance of the BBB. Other vital interactions include ECs and immune cells, neural cells, and glial cells.

**Endothelial Cells**

ECs are modified simple squamous epithelial cells derived from mesoderm, which form the walls of blood vessels. ECs of the CNS have unique properties allowing for tight regulation of the movement of molecules, cells, and ions between the blood and the brain. In addition, the tight junctions which hold CNS ECs together are responsible for the limitation in the paracellular flow of solutes.

**Mural Cells**

Mural cells include vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes (PCs), which incompletely cover the endothelial walls of the microvasculature. PCs extend long cellular processes along the abluminal surface of the endothelium that contain contractile proteins, allowing them to contract and control the capillary diameter.

While PCs in peripheral tissues are derived from the mesoderm, CNS PCs form from the neural crest. This critical difference gives CNS PCs unique properties, making them essential in the regulation and formation of the BBB during development. They also maintain the function of the BBB in adulthood and throughout the aging process.
