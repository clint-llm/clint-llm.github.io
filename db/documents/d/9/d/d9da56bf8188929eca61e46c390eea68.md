The scalp is a descriptive anatomical term that refers to the subcutaneous tissue that covers the cranium and is comprised of five layers: skin, dense connective tissue, epicranial aponeurosis, loose areolar connective tissue, and the periosteum. The first three layers move as one unit as they are tightly bound together. The veins of the scalp are present within the dense connective tissue, which also contains nerves and arteries, and the loose areolar connective tissue, which also contains emissary veins that connect to the diploic veins of the skull and the intracranial venous sinuses.

The venous drainage of the scalp divides into superficial and deep. The superficial veins of the scalp, starting anteriorly and moving posteriorly, are the supratrochlear and supraorbital veins, respectively, the superficial temporal veins and their branches, the posterior auricular vein, and the occipital vein and its branches. The deep venous drainage is via the pterygoid venous plexus.
