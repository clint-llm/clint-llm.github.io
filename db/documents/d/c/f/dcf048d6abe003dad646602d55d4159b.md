Calcium channel antagonists, also known as calcium channel blockers (CCBs), have been widely used for many indications. These agents are often classified into two major categories, either non-dihydropyridines or dihydropyridines. Cardiovascular indications include hypertension, coronary spasm, angina pectoris, supraventricular dysrhythmias, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and pulmonary hypertension. In addition to these, they are also prescribed for Raynaud phenomenon, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and migraine headaches. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of calcium channel blockade, pertinent for clinicians and other members of the interprofessional team for recognizing and being able to utilize these agents for their intended therapeutic purpose.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of both categories of calcium channel blockers.
- Review the approved and off-label indications for various calcium channel blockers.
- Describe the adverse effects and contraindications for both classes of calcium channel blockers.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patient receiving treatment with the CCB class of medications.
