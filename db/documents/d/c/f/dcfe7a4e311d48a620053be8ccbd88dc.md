Weight stigma is particularly prevalent and detrimental, especially in healthcare settings. With documented high levels of weight bias in clinicians, patients with obesity receive poorer care and have worse outcomes. This activity reviews the stigma associated with obesity and highlights tools the healthcare team may use to help destigmatize obesity and to deliver improved patient care.

**Objectives:**
- Review the stigmatization of obesity in healthcare.
- Identify at least four methods the health care team can utilize to decrease stigmatization of obesity.
- Discuss methods to improve the healthcare setting for patients with overweight and obesity.
- Describe conditions for which obesity increases the risk of developing.
