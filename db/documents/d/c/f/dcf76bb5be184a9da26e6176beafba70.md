Radio-imaging and electromyogram (EMG)/nerve conduction studies are beneficial in distinguishing this entity from other differentials. Routine blood work is often noncontributory. Other blood tests, specifically serum IgE has shown a noted increase. However, the clinical significance of this finding is not affirmative. Traditional x-rays also show nonspecific findings. Occasionally, a degeneration of C2 may be noted.

**MRI****imaging**

MRI shows a crescent-shaped lesion in the posterior epidural space of the lower cervical cord or an atrophic spinal cord, mild asymmetric cord flattening, and increased signal intensity. It is only with specialized flexion MRIs that the diagnosis can become confirmatory. Flexion MRIs have shown a distinct change in the alignment of the soft tissue structures, specifically an anterior shift of the cervical dural sac from the lamina at the C4 -C7 region allowing for chronic microtrauma, with a corresponding post-contrast enhancement of the posterior epidural venous plexus indicative of ischemia.

**Electromyogram/Nerve Conduction Study**

EMG and NCS show significant findings in the C7, C8 and T1 innervated muscles. NCS has intermittently demonstrated decreased compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude, most noticeable in the median nerve. The low ulnar/medial compound motor action potential within C7-T1 myotomes is very helpful in differentiating it from other mimics.

EMG findings indicate chronic denervation seen as a high amplitude of action potential with prolonged duration, without active denervation (absence of positive sharp waves or fibrillation potentials), and no resting fasciculations in the C7, C8, and T1  innervated muscles. Findings are increased when the temperature is decreased. SSEP is not a marker for the disease.

“Reverse split hand syndrome,” which shows decreased/absent CMAP amplitude in the abductor digiti minimi while preserved in the abductor pollicis brevis, is observed in Hirayama disease helps to differentiate it from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which shows ''reverse hand syndrome''.
