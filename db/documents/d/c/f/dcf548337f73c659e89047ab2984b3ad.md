Just as successful multi-modal pain management requires different classes of medications, enhancing team outcomes requires many different types of team members.  Some coordination may be required by a pain management doctor, anesthesiologist, pharmacists, PACU nurses, recovery nurses, and pre-operative nurses.  Successful multi-modal pain management requires a streamlined strategy from pre-op to intra-op and post-op, including regional anesthesia, patient counseling, and multiple medications, but this has been shown to reduce narcotic usage and lead to successful postoperative pain management.
