As stated earlier, isolated fractures of the fibula are quite rare, and not much literature exists on the frequency of their occurrence. While tibia fractures are most common in young males and elderly females, it is likely that most isolated fibula fractures are in the younger population, based on the injury responsible for these fractures. Young athletes, especially those involved in contact sports, and those individuals involved in motor vehicle accidents and pedestrian versus motor vehicle accidents, are likely at the highest risk.
