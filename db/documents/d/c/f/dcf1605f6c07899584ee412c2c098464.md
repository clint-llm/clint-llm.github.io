Healthcare workers should work closely with the parents to make them understand the need for vitamin K prophylaxis and the severity of the disease. The benefit of using IM vitamin K injections should be explained to the parents. For those who refuse injection, counseling about the adverse effects of vitamin K deficiency should be explained. The alternate oral dose (2 mg) should also be recommended, along with the repetition of the dose at 2 to 4 and 6 to 8 weeks of age.
