Radial head fractures are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes physical therapists and orthopedic nurses. The management for nondisplaced and mild fractures is usually conservative. Severe cases usually require surgery. An orthopedic specialty nurse can be an invaluable asset for these cases, assisting during surgery/reduction, answering patient questions, and helping coordinate therapy postoperatively, while serving as a bridge to the treating clinician and other ancillary providers.

The outlook for most patients is good after treatment but arthritis, aseptic necrosis, joint stiffness, and capsular contraction are not uncommon problems in the long run.
