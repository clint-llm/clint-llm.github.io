In addition to passing horizontally (from person to person), TORCH infections can also transmit vertically (from mother to infant). When a pregnant woman becomes infected, the infection can spread to her unborn fetus. Generally, the earlier the exposure to the teratogen, the more deleterious its effects. Infection during the first trimester is likely to cause a more severe version of the congenital defects in the growing embryo. The later in pregnancy that an infection occurs, the more likely that the fetus will develop a neonatal infection rather than develop congenital abnormalities.
