It is important to note that not all patients with MCI will progress to dementia. According to some estimates, about 30Â to 50% of patients with MCI return to normal cognitive function within one year from the initial presentation.

A study using data from the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center showed that the annual progression probability from normal cognition to MCI varied from 4 to 10% from underlying AD.

Another study investigated individuals with positive amyloid pathology and showed that there was about a 40.8% probability of transitioning from asymptomatic to MCI-AD stage with a 5.3% probability of annual reversion back to the asymptomatic stage.

Some favorable factors encouraging the possible return to normal cognition include successful treatment of depression, lack of ApoE4, higher scores on cognitive testing, and greater hippocampal volume seen on imaging.
