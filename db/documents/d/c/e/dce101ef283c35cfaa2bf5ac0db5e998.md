The anatomic structures of the head and neck derive from the pharyngeal apparatus, which is an embryologic structure that contains six distinct arches organized in a craniocaudal fashion. Each arch is composed of a central layer of mesoderm and neural crest cells surrounded internally by endoderm and externally by ectoderm. The mesodermal core of each arch forms the corresponding arteries, nerves, muscles, and skeletal structures.
