HbA1c is recommended every 3 to 6 months. The HbA1c reflects glycemic control over the previous 2 to 3 months. A typical goal HbA1c is <7.0%, with higher goals in people with frailty, cardiovascular disease/multiple comorbidities, history of severe hypoglycemia, and/or hypoglycemia unawareness. Lower goals are used when they can be achieved safely (without an increase in hypoglycemia).

Other laboratory tests include a yearly lipid profile, serum creatinine, eGFR, and urine albumin to creatinine ratio. Serum potassium should be monitored if taking an ACE-I, ARB, or diuretic, and AST, ALT,Â  TSH, celiac screen, vitamin B12, and vitamin D at least once and as indicated clinically. These tests could be repeated more frequently if the previous results were abnormal. Since people with T1D are at an increased risk of developing other autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroid disease, celiac disease, primary adrenal insufficiency, and rheumatoid arthritis, screening for autoimmune disorders should be considered when clinically appropriate.
