Incision and drainage (I&D) is a widely used procedure in various care settings, including emergency departments and outpatient clinics. It is the primary treatment for skin and soft tissue abscesses, with or without adjunctive antibiotic therapy. This activity will focus specifically on its use in the management of cutaneous abscesses. Based on 2013 data from the CDC, cutaneous abscesses accounted for about 2% of all presentations to the emergency department. The same data reports that 0.9% of all patients who presented to the emergency department underwent incision and drainage. In the pediatric population, the incidence of skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) has increased, and hospitalization due to SSTI doubled in the last 20 years.
