Videofluoroscopic swallow study uses x-rays for image study. Due to the use of ionizing radiation, there is a recognized risk of cellular damage and potential cancer induction. The risk becomes higher with greater radiation doses used.

Some individuals may have allergies to the contrast material, and it is importantÂ to obtain consent from the patient. Alternate materials, such as gastrograffin, may be used in such situations. As with other radiological investigations, pregnancy status needs to be determined before commencing the study.

As the patient is being assessed for dysphagia, the radio-opaque test boluses may enter the airway passages- i.e., aspiration. This risk is reduced when the speech and language pathologist/therapist commences the study using a material with the easiest consistency for the patient to swallow before escalating to more difficult consistencies.
