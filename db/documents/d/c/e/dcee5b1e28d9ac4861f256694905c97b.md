Artificial cornea transplantation surgery with keratoprostheses is a very complex, multi-stage procedure, and expertise, multidisciplinary teams, and resources are necessary. The ophthalmologist is the first point of patient assessment. The patient's suitability for surgery, risk factors that can influence outcomes, and information is provided to the patient and their family. If assessing for suitability for OOKP, an oral surgeon will be consulted as well. A physician canÂ assess the patient's general systemic health. A clinical psychologist can investigate for psychological morbidity, patient's coping mechanisms, expectations, adaptation to blindness, and availability of social support in place. Opthalmology specialty nurses can assist with the procedure and post-operative care. This type of interprofessional team coordination will bring about improved results from this procedure. [Level 5]
