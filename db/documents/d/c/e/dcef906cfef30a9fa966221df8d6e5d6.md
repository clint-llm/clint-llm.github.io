Plasma cells vary in size from 14 to 20 micrometers. They are round-to-ovoid cells containing abundant deep blue cytoplasm with a pale perinuclear area corresponding to the Golgi apparatus. They have a round, eccentrically placed nucleus with coarse chromatin arranged in a clock face (art wheel) pattern.
