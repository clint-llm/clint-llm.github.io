OSA diagnosis and subsequent management require the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team. This team includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nurses, and sleep specialists. Although patients are initially evaluated in the primary care office, a sleep specialist should be included in the healthcare team early on. Polysomnography with an arterial blood gas study and assessment of pulmonary function testing is recommended as soon as there is suspicion of OSA/OHS. Evaluation of other potential causes of the presentation merit consideration. Care should be coordinated with the patient, spouse, or family members to ensure adequate adherence to PAP therapy and nutritionists, nurses, and case managers in the event of hospitalization. This interprofessional approach to care will drive optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
