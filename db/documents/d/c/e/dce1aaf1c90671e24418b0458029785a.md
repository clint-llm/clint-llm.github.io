While a hematologist is almost always involved in the care of patients with lymphoma, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a radiologist, radiation oncologist, pathologist, and a surgical oncologist. The nurses are also vital members of the interprofessional group as they monitor the patient vital signs and assist with patient and family education. Having oncology trained social workers and psychologists as part of an interdisciplinary team also plays a significant role in addressing psycho-social issues pertaining to the diagnosis and management of lymphomas, especially in young patients.
