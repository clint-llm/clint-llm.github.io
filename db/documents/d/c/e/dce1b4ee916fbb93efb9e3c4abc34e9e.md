Leadership training and communication skills can easily be incorporated during group and high-fidelity simulations by identifying a simulation team leader.  The leader of the team needs to be clear with instructions, aware of what each team member is doing, and needs to be listening at all times. Communication is critical with multiple providers and requires the use of closed-loop communication to effectively and efficiently complete tasks required to help the patient.

Simulation facilitators can actively monitor team dynamics and interaction and can address any issues in the debrief or during the simulation if necessary. Medical decision making can also be improved through the use of simulated team dynamics. Communication during the simulation allows for discussions between participants to improve the knowledge base.
