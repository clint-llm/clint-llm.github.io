Untreated anemia can be life-threatening and can even cause death.

Anemia results in a decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. In the short term, the body can compensate with an increase in heart rate and respiratory rate. If left untreated, anemia can cause multi-organ failure. This can include high output heart failure, angina, arrhythmias, cognitive impairment, and renal failure, among others.  In pregnant women, untreated anemia can cause premature birth and low birth weight.
