Recent studies have shown differences in overall prognosis among patients with ALK(-) ALCL based on the presence of different chromosomal rearrangements. For instance, 30% of patients with ALK(-) ALCL have been found to have the DUSP22 rearrangement with a 90% five-year overall survival rate, which is similar to that of ALK-positive ALCL. 8% of ALK(-) ALCL patients have the TP63 rearrangement with a far worse five-year overall survival rate of 17%. Finally, the 5-year overall survival rate of patients lacking ALK, DUSP22, or TP63 rearrangement is 42%
