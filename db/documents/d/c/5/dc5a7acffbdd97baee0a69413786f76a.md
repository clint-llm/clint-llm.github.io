Posterior shoulder instability is rare compared to anterior shoulder instability and is commonly misdiagnosed or overlooked. Posterior shoulder instability may arise secondary to repetitive damage to the posterior shoulder structures in young, overhead athletes or secondary to blunt trauma with the shoulder in a provocative position as seen in contact athletes. Overhead athletes should pay particular attention to their throwing mechanics and improve deficits in their kinetic chain as dysfunction has been shown to be a risk factor for reinjury after surgical stabilization.

Young athletes should seek out an orthopedic specialist if he or she experiences the insidious onset of posterior shoulder pain, symptoms of instability, decreasing performance with throwing activities, or if similar symptoms develop after a traumatic episode. Athletes with symptoms secondary to repetitive microtrauma may benefit the most from nonsurgical treatment. Overhead athletes may be advised to avoid throwing activities for a minimum of 4 to 6 weeks and partake in an intensive rehabilitation program consisting of strengthening the muscles around the shoulder and correcting throwing mechanics.
