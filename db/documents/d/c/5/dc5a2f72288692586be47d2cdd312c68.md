Hepatic cystadenoma is considered a premalignant lesion. Although imaging findings may be suggestive, they often are overlapping and nonspecific. No published guidelines on appropriate therapy of BCAs currently exist due to the limited number of reported cases. Percutaneous ablation and unroofing techniques of BCAs are ineffective and have been shown to have recurrence rates up to 80%.
