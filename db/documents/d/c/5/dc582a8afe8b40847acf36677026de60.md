The spectrum of diseases associated with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome may has associations with various complications, commonly ocular abnormalities such as posterior embryotoxon. At least 50% of these patients develop glaucoma.

Patients presenting with congenital glaucoma (CG) have links to FOXC2 and PITX2 mutations. CG may lead to severe complications including blindness or partial vision loss in children.

Patients with mutations in FOXC1 may present hearing loss in addition to ocular and heart complications.

One study described a family of three generations with three cases of ARS and heart disease; these patients presented FOXC1 mutations suggesting that this gene may be involved in cardiac development.
