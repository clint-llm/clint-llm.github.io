5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid starts as tryptophan within cells. Tryptophan then converts to serotonin. After that, monoamine oxidase A (MAO-a) enzymatically deactivates serotonin by converting it to 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid within the synaptic cleft. Serotonin generally gets metabolized by the liver before entering the general circulation and having more downstream effects. Serotonin may also be deactivated and taken out of circulation by the lungs.
