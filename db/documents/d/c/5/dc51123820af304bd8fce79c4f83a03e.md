Presentation of thyroid storm is an exaggerated manifestation of hyperthyroidism, with the presence of an acute precipitating factor. Fever, cardiovascular involvement (including tachycardia, heart failure, arrhythmia), central nervous system (CNS)Â manifestations, and gastrointestinal symptoms are common. Fever of 104 F to 106 F with diaphoresis is a key presenting feature. Cardiovascular manifestations include tachycardia of more than 140 HR/minute, heart failure with pulmonary and peripheral edema, hypotension, arrhythmia, and death from cardiac arrest. CNS involvement includes agitation, delirium, anxiety, psychosis, or coma. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, and acute hepatic failure.

Physical examination findings may include high temperature, tachycardia, orbitopathy, goiter, hand tremors, moist and warm skin, hyperreflexia, systolic hypertension, and jaundice.
