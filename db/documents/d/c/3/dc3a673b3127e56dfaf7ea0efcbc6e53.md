Acute management consists of closed reduction and immediate immobilization. The position of immobilization remains a topic of debate. A recent systematic review did not demonstrate any benefit to immobilization in external rotation over internal rotation in the risk of redislocation and return to sports functionality.

Long-term treatment plans are tailored to patients depending on age, activity level, and history of recurrent dislocation or chronic instability. In younger patients, surgical planning should be implemented, given the high rates of redislocation.Â Age is the primary predictor of recurrence, with the highest rates seen in patients less than 30 years old.

The instability severity index score was developed to help guide treatment between an arthroscopic procedure versus an open stabilization procedure.

Controversy remains for the first-time dislocation. Some authors propose non-operative management and a rehabilitation protocol in the initial management of older patients and younger patients not involved in overhead activities.
