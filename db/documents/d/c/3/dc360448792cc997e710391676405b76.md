The literature shows several anatomical variants, in particular supernumerary head of the biceps brachii (one or two more). The same-origin of the muscle can have multiple branches; there is also a trifurcate intra-articular of the long head of the biceps tendon.

There is a rare formation, a strip of muscle which departs from the pectoralis major muscle and which inserts on the epicondyle of the humeral bone; it is called chondroepitrochlearis.

Another rare formation is the elevator muscle of the tendon of latissimus dorsi muscle, which arises from the coracoid process (with a fusiform shape and a short tendon), and inserts in a portion of the tendon of the latissimus muscle (dorsal and upper area of the tendon).

There are anatomical variants of the coracobrachialis muscle, where additional bellies may occur.

The brachialis muscle may have a fascial sheet, which could become one of the causes that compress the median nerve.

The brachial triceps muscle can have a four-headed triceps and/or receive innervation by the median nerve or the musculocutaneous nerve.
