Misfolded TTR protein forms insoluble fibers. In the heart, they occupy interstitial spaces in the myocardium, making it stiff and rigid. TTR deposition causes further myocardial fibrosis and eventually affects its mechanical function. Due to TTR deposition, the myocardium appears thickened and hypertrophied on cardiac imaging. Compromise in ventricular compliance initially causes diastolic dysfunction. In advanced stages, myocardial dysfunction can result in globally reduced systolic dysfunction.

Diastolic dysfunction causes an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and left atrial pressures.  Persistently increased left atrial pressures and left atrial dilatation increased the likelihood of developing atrial arrhythmias in these patients. Myocardial infiltration often affects the electrical conduction system as well.

The autonomic and peripheral nervous systems are common extra-cardiac sites for misfolded TTR protein deposition. It is seen that hATTR affects the nervous system more commonly, whereas cardiomyopathy is more commonly seen with wATTR-CM.
