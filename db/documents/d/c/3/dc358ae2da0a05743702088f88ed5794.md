Polyhydramnios is defined as an increase in the amniotic fluid in pregnancy and is associated with increased maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The severity of this disease process varies, but up to one in five of the neonates affected by this condition are born with a congenital anomaly. Prompt diagnosis by ultrasound and workup for the underlying cause of polyhydramnios can direct care, including the use of reductive amniocentesis or indomethacin for symptomatic severe polyhydramnios. To mitigate the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, delivery is recommended at a tertiary center. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of polyhydramnios and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing pregnant women with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of polyhydramnios
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of polyhydramnios.
- Discuss the role of new genetic testing in investigating polyhydramnios during pregnancy.
- Review the management options available for polyhydramnios.
