- Disease duration of less than and more than 6 weeks separates acute from chronic spontaneous urticaria.

- If the patient cannot recall the time course of urticarial lesions, drawing around an individual lesion with a skin marking pen is useful to document resolution or migration within 24 hours.

- Where history is unrevealing, an external cause is highly unlikely to be identified for patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria. Diagnostic workup is unrevealing.

- Skin prick test is not indicated in chronic spontaneous urticaria.

- Wheals that are painful rather than pruritic, that persist for greater than 24 hours, and/or resolve with ecchymosis or pigmentation should prompt consideration of urticarial vasculitis.

- The recommended stepwise approach to management begins with second-generation H1-antihistamines, followed by the addition of omalizumab, and subsequently ciclosporin.

- The rate of spontaneous remission in the first twelve months is as high as 80%.
