Complications classify according to the time of onset

- Early complications

- Arterial insufficiency

- Arterial thrombosis presents typically as a pale, cool and pulseless digit
- It is vital during the post-operative period to maximize blood flow through the anastomoses and prevent thrombosis


- Venous insufficiency

- Venous congestion typically presents as a purple digit with brisk capillary refill and swelling
- Concerns of possible anastomosis failure or thrombosis should prompt urgent return to theatre for salvage - in cases of venous congestion, leech therapy or anticoagulation may be considered to improve venous return


- Infection

- Late complications

- Cold intolerance
- Tendon adhesions
- Stiffness
- Bony malunion
- Altered sensation
