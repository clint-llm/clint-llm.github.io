Obtaining a sample of amniotic fluid can occur via amniocentesis after 34 weeks of gestation or from vaginal pooling in the preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). In the case of amniocentesis, an ultrasound is used to determine an adequately sized pocket of amniotic fluid that is away from the fetus. Local anesthesia can be used for the sampling site. A stylet is introduced through the abdomen under ultrasound guidance, and a syringe is attached to obtain the sample. In the case of PPROM, the sample can be collected from the vagina. However, if blood were to be present within the sample or in the vagina, the results of the L/S ratio would be invalidated.
