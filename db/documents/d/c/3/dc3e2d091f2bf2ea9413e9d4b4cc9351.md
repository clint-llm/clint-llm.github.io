**Serous Cystadenoma**

Serous cystadenomas do not have mutations in either KRAS or BRAF in contrast to serous borderline tumors and low-grade serous carcinoma. Most serous cystadenomas are polyclonal, but monoclonal cystadenomas occur. They develop as a hyperplastic expansion from epithelial inclusions.

**Mucinous Cystadenoma**

The association of mucinous cystadenomas with dermoid cysts indicates that some are of germ cell origin and an association with Brenner tumors implies a surface epithelial origin for another subset.

**Endometrioid Cystadenoma**

Morphological and molecular genetic studies have implicated endometriotic cysts and endometriosis in the development of endometrioid, clear cell, and seromucinous tumors.

**Seromucinous Cystadenoma**

According to some authors, seromucinous cystadenomas likely derive from endometriosis.
