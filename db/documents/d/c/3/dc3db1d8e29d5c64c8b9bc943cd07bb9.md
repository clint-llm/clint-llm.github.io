Prognosis is variable depending on the severity of obstruction and the in-utero sequelae. Most of the infants who survive the neonatal period go on to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD), and many have ongoing bladder dysfunction.  In a series of 75 patients with posterior urethral valves, 21% had end-stage renal failure by the end of the mean follow up of 64 months. 21.4% of patients remained in K/DOQI chronic kidney disease Stage 0, 33.3% Stage 1, 9.5% Stage 2, 7.1% Stage 3 and 28.6% in stage 5, requiring renal replacement therapy.

There were no patients in stage 4 at the time of analysis. They found the following risk factors to be significant for the prognosis of ongoing renal function: renal volume below the third percentile, elevated renal echogenicity, pathological corticomedullary differentiation, over three urinary tract infections with fever, and decreased eGFR at one year of age (P<0.001). In contrast, a renal volume greater than 88.2 ml/m squared body surface area was found to be protective against stage 5 renal failure.
