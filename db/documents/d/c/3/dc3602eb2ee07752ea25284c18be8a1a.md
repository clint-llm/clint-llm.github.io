The diagnosis of cervical disc disease is difficult because there are many causes of pain in the neck area. The disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a pain specialist, radiologist, nurse practitioner, primary physician, orthopedic surgeon, emergency department physician and a physical therapist. Once diagnosed the treatment is initially conservative. Only patients who do not respond to conservative treatment or those who continue to have neurological symptoms should be referred for surgery. Unfortunately, the results of surgery are not optimal with many patients continuing to have chronic pain which is disabling. No matter what treatment is selected, physical therapy is highly recommended.
