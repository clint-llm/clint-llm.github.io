Macroscopic: Often an unencapsulated, well-circumscribed, grey-tan firm mass. Typically ovoid or fusiform, with a pale gelatinous cut surface. Usually, no areas of degeneration, necrosis, or hemorrhage are grossly identified. There may be transected nerve fibers attached to the mass forming portion of the lesion.

**Microscopic Exam Histologic Features**

- Loose and haphazard spindled cells with poorly defined cell borders

- Background of myxoid to pale pink collagenous matrix

- Coarse collagen bundles are present and often described as “shredded carrots.”

- Low to moderate cellularity

- Mast cells commonly found within the lesion

- Small, hyperchromatic, wavy nuclei, resembling “diving dolphins,” sometimes with nuclear enlargement and smudgy chromatin

- Nuclei may also be described as “buckled” or “comma-shaped.”

- Rarely, may encounter multinucleated giant cells

- Absent to minimal mitoses

- May also occur within the nerve (intraneural localized neurofibroma)

**Localized Type**

- Well circumscribed lesion in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue 

- Dermal lesions typically unencapsulated with a "grenz zone" of uninvolved dermis between lesion and epidermis
- Subcutaneous lesions often have a true capsule

**Diffuse Type**

- Poorly defined, expansile proliferation around adnexal structures, extending into the subcutaneous tissue and infiltrating adipose

- May entrap nerves or be intraneural (intraneural diffuse neurofibroma)

- Characteristic pseudomeissnerian corpuscles, comprised of fibrillary and whorled Schwann cells

**Plexiform Type**

- Multiple intertwined hypertrophic nerve fascicles

- Serpentine pattern with multiple nodules

- May have predominantly myxoid or edematous background with thick collagen fibers

- May have atypia (nuclear enlargement, hyperchromasia) related to the degenerative change

**Variants Most Commonly Associated With Localized Type And Less Commonly Diffuse Type Neurofibromas**

- Cellular: Increased cellularity, with or without atypia, no significant increase in mitotic activity

- Pigmented: Histologically and immunohistochemically shows melanin production

- Atypical/Bizarre: Hyperchromatic, pleomorphic, atypical nuclei with degenerative change, arranged in a distinct lamellar pattern

- Epithelioid: Cohesive nests of epithelioid tumor cells

- Granular cell: Contains granular cells, eosinophilic and similar in appearance to those comprising granular cell tumors

- Lipomatous: Diffusely scattered adipocytes, intrinsic to the tumor

- Dendritic cell: Dendritic cell morphology with pseudorosettes

- Hybrid neurofibroma/schwannoma: Nodules resembling schwannoma within a typical neurofibroma

**Immunohistochemical Evaluation**

- S100 (+) in Schwann cells (approximately 50% of tumor cells)

- CD34 (+) in spindled fibroblasts with distinct “fingerprint” immunopositivity.

- The “fingerprint” is due to positive staining between whorled collagen bundles, resembling a human fingerprint - this “fingerprint,” if present in greater than 60% of the lesion, is useful in diagnosing neurofibroma and distinguishing neurofibroma from early desmoplastic melanoma

- EMA (+) in occasional perineural cells

- Myelin basic protein (+)

- Neurofilament protein (+) in intratumoral axons

- Acid mucopolysaccharides (+) in mucinous stroma
