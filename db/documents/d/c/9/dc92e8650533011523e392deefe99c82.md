The microscopic examination of a xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis lesion shows three distinct zones centered by a calyx with the following findings in each zone:

- Inner zone: Consists of leukocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes or macrophages, and necrosis.

- Middle zone: Consists of granulation tissues surrounded by hemorrhage. The pathognomonic feature is the presence of lipid-laden foamy macrophages (xanthoma cells) that gives a yellow color to the tissue.

- Outer zone: Consists of giant cells, cholesterol clefts, and fibrous tissues.

The gross pathology of the mass may show yellow tissue with necrosis and hemorrhage.
