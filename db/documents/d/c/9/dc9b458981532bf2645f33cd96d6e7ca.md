Advancements in vaccinations are responsible for the decrease in multiple different infectious diseases. When inquiring about patients' past immunizations, we always have to consider the possibility of receiving false information. A study done in 2012 involved asking patients about their tetanus vaccination, then drawing titer levels to see if they were correct. This study enrolled 163 patients, and it showed that 12.8% of patients who stated their tetanus shot is up to date were not seropositive. Twenty-six people were seronegative, and all of these patients had been to a doctor in the past year. This data shows the untrustworthy nature of the immunization history given by patients.

The usage of reminders has been a topic of study in Canada in a trial containing 8069 patients who were 20 or older and split into three groups. In one group, the physician was reminded at the office visit to assess the patient's tetanus protection; the second group was reminded via phone call, while the third group received a reminder letter. Statistics showed the most significant compliance occurred when the patients were given a letter as a reminder. With these reminder systems, researchers noted an increase in the rate of recorded tetanus vaccination, but it was well short of complete population coverage. These results show that to achieve complete population coverage, more intense intervention is necessary.

Tetanus toxoid vaccine requires an interprofessional approach to optimize its protective effects. This includes clinicians, infectious disease specialists, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists. Meticulous record-keeping is a must and understanding the patient's current vaccine status, potential contraindications, and proper scheduling are all factors that will benefit from interprofessional communication and coordination.
