Bacterial tracheitis is a bacterial infection of the trachea often preceded by a viral upper respiratory infection. The most common viruses implicated include Influenza A and B (type A being the most common), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, measles virus, and enterovirus.Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae type B (HiB), Haemophilus influenzae (non-typeable), and less commonly, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and anaerobic organisms.

The presence of a long-term tracheostomy is another potential predisposing factor for bacterial tracheitis, presumed to be a result of colonization of either a single bacterial species or multi-bacterial species from the tracheostomy tube in approximately 95% and 83% of respective cases.S. aureus, Gram-negative bacilli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Meticulous tracheostomy care, including pulmonary toilet and scheduled changes of the inner cannula and the tracheostomy tube, are required to minimize the risk in this specific population.
