Infectious endocarditis refers to the colonization of cardiac valve endocardium by virulent microorganisms. It is a rare condition that can lead to rapid and significant morbidity and mortality if not efficiently diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of infectious endocarditis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of infective endocarditis.
- Review the appropriate evaluation skills required to assess suspected cases of infective endocarditis.
- Explain the treatment and management options available for infectious endocarditis.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to allow for improved outcomes and more streamlined care for patients with infectious endocarditis.
