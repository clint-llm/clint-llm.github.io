Rapid diagnosis of ruptured ectopic pregnancy is paramount to good patient outcomes. In high socioeconomic countries, ectopic pregnancy accounts for 1% to 2% of pregnancies, and it remains a leading cause of early maternal morbidity.

Laboratory technicians need to process labwork in a timely matter, including the beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level, hemoglobin, and view fluid under microscopy. Blood blank personnel may need to be involved if the patient has hemorrhagic shock and requires blood products. Pharmacists are involved in dosing pain medications and/or tranexamic acid. Radiologists interpret ultrasound images (if ultrasound is available) to aid in diagnosis.

Consulting physicians such as obstetric/gynecologic physicians or if obstetrics/gynecology is unavailable, general surgeons, need to be on stand by for emergent surgery if a patient presents with a ruptured ectopic. Often these patients need to be monitored for several days, and the physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, and nurses' aids on the inpatient floors monitor and observe these patients. It truly takes a team to orchestrate the care for these patients, and each individual has an important role to play to ensure the best possible outcomes for these patients. [Level 1]
