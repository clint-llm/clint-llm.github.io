Fresh frozen plasma is the fluid portion of a unit of whole blood frozen in a designated time frame, usually within 8 hours. Fresh frozen plasma contains all coagulation factors except platelets. Fresh frozen plasma contains fibrinogen (400 to 900 mg/unit), albumin, protein C, protein S, antithrombin, tissue factor pathway inhibitor. It is free of erythrocytes and leukocytes.  Fresh frozen plasma corrects coagulopathy by replacing or supplying plasma proteins in patients who are deficient in or have defective plasma proteins. A standard dose of 10 to 20 mL/kg (4 to 6 units in adults) will raise factor levels by approximately 20%. An increase of roughly 10% of several factors is enough to bring about hemostasis. Also, fresh frozen plasma provides some volume resuscitation, as each unit contains approximately 250 ml.
