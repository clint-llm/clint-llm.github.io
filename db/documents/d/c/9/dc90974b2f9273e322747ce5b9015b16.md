Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE), aka epithelioid hemangioma, is an uncommon benign vasoproliferative disorder, first described in 1969 by Wells and Whimster. The pathogenesis of ALHE is not clearly understood. It usually presents with solitary or multiple papules or nodules involving mostly the head and neck region. More rarely, the lesions can appear in other sites of the body or affect extracutaneous tissues. The objective of the treatment is to attend to cosmetic issues and to allow symptomatic relief. Multiple treatment modalities have been tried, but none of them proved a reproducible success.
