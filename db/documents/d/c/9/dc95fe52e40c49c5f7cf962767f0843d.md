In the stomach, gyromitrin is metabolized to monomethylhydrazine (MMH), which is the active metabolite responsible for inhibiting many enzymatic processes, particularly by the inhibition of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), a key cofactor for many enzymatic processes. Gyromitrin directly binds to and inhibits pyridoxal phosphokinase, the enzyme responsible for transforming dietary vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) into active pyridoxal 5-phosphate. Without the cofactor pyridoxal 5-phosphate, the CNS-enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) cannot convert glutamate to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). As GABA is depleted, activation of inhibitory postsynaptic Cl- channel decreases, resulting in a relative excitatory state in the brain, leading to delayed seizures.

This inhibition of vitamin B6 activation is a similar mechanism of action to the anti-tuberculosis medication INH (isonicotinic acid hydrazide).

Other central enzymatic processes for which pyridoxine is a co-factor are:

- Formation of serotonin from tryptophan

- Formation of dopamine from DOPA

While these may be inhibited, it is usually not clinically apparent.

Hydrazines, like MMH, may also form hydrazones and hydrazides that can cause further organ damage. Hydrazones induce lipid peroxidation in the liver causing cytotoxic effects and resulting in acute liver injury. Hydrazones may also be oxidizing agents capable of inducing methemoglobinemia. Although the potential for methemoglobin formation in humans is often mentioned as a possible toxic effect of gyromitrin mushroom consumption, only a single case report in a dog exists for this.

Other reported effects of gyromitrin are detailed in studies on rats. Gyromitrin in rats acts as a mild diuretic, with properties of natriuresis and kaliuresis, which may contribute to volume and electrolyte loss in humans. In addition, rats fed gyromitrin for long periods of time develop cancers of the liver, gallbladder, and lung. No definitive human cancer risk has been determined.
