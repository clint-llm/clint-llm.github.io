When the clinician that detects early retinopathy does not discontinue CQ/HCQ therapy, the prognosis is a progressive loss of paracentral vision followed by loss of central vision and night blindness.  Even when the clinician discontinues therapy, retinopathy can progress for many years.  Progression of vortex keratopathy (VK) causes increasing haloes and blur but is fully reversible upon discontinuation of therapy.
