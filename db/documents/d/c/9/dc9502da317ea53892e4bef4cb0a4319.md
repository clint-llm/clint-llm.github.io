Left untreated, social anxiety disorder is recognized as a debilitating and highly prevalent disorder that may result in lower educational attainment, worse occupational performance, hampered social interaction, lower-quality relationships, and decreased quality of life. SAD is associated with suicidal ideation, low self-esteem, lower socioeconomic status, unemployment, financial issues, and being unmarried. Many individuals with SAD are not aware of their mental health problemsÂ and, therefore, do not seek treatment.
