The mechanism by which sensory and perceptual alteration can occur can be dueÂ to a direct insult to the brain or due to aberrant stress responses.****such as acute changes in the environment, trauma, severe illness, and surgery can cause abnormalities and can alter neurotransmitter release leading to sensory and perceptual alterations. Decreased cerebral oxidative metabolism can cause the abnormal release of neurotransmitters leading to cerebral dysfunction. The cellular signaling hypothesis speculates that intraneuronal signal transduction is affected, causing a change in the neurotransmitter production and release leading to altered sensation.
