The lateral meniscus receives its blood supply from the lateral and middle geniculate arteries that branch off the popliteal artery, although the tissue itself is relatively avascular. Only approximately the peripheral 10% to 25% of the lateral meniscus is well vascularized, and the rest of the tissue receives nourishment from the synovial fluid via diffusion or mechanical pumping during the motion of the joint.
