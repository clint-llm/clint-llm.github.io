GSDs are a diverse set of rare inborn errors of carbohydrate metabolism that can have variable phenotypic presentation even within the same GSD type. Obtaining a family pedigree is useful in establishing the mode of inheritance. Most GSDs show an autosomal recessive inheritance, but a few (GSD type IX) show an x-linked inheritance.

Patients with a defect in hepatic glycogen metabolism usually present with fasting hypoglycemia and ketosis. Their symptoms improve with glucose administration. Patients with a defect in skeletal muscle glycogen metabolism present with fatigue and exercise intolerance after short periods of moderate-intense exercise.

In rare instances, GSD type III, V, and VII can present with weakness rather than muscle crampsÂ and, over time, develop fixed weakness.

Anthropometric measurements should be obtained and graphed in all patients with GSDs to assess the overall growth pattern. Short stature or poor linear growth, especially in a child with hypoglycemia, should warrant workup for glycogen storage disorders.
