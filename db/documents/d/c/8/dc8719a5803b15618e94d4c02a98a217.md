While most of these cases occur sporadically, several causative factors have been identified.

**Germline Mutations**

**Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) Von Recklinghausen Disease**

- Autosomal dominant (AD) condition caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which codes for a protein called neurofibromin

- A tumor suppressor of the ras oncogene signaling pathway

- Mutations in the NF1 gene result in multiple cutaneous neurofibromas

**Li-Fraumeni Syndrome**

- Rare AD disorder caused by mutations in the TP53 gene (17p13.1), which codes for p53 (tumor suppressor gene)

- p53 functions to clear damaged cellular DNA

- This manifests in a wide array of phenotypes and clinical presentations; some patients will develop rhabdomyosarcoma by the age of 4

**Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)**

- AD disorder with a mutation in the APC gene (5q21-q22)

- Tumor suppressor gene, inhibiting localization of B-catenin to the nucleus

- Mutant protein fails to inhibit this localization which results in unchecked cell cycling and cellular proliferation

- Clinically this manifests in innumerable colonic polyps with extracolonic manifestations such as epidermoid cysts, osteomas, and desmoid tumors

- Desmoid tumors typically arise approximately five years post-prophylactic colectomy and represent a major source of morbidity and mortality; often arising in previous surgical sites

**Radiation**

- Significantly contributes to a patient's long-term risk for developing STS

- The effects are dose-dependent, and they typically occur at the periphery of the radiation field

- Shorter disease-specific survival as compared to the spontaneous counterparts

- Children who develop STS post-radiation do so at a median of 11.8 years later and in a dose-dependent fashion

**Carcinogens**

- Thorotrast (thorium-based IV contrast 1930 to 1955): Patients diagnosed approximately 20 to 30 years post-exposure associated with hepatic angiosarcoma

- Polyvinyl chloride, a common form of plastic: Prolonged exposure

- Arsenic

**Chronic Lymphedema**

- A chronic lymphatic blockage is thought to stimulate the proliferation of lymphatics and vessels or lead to local immunodeficiency causing the development of malignancy.

- Most commonly seen in the post-radical mastectomy population, especially those who received radiotherapy

- Patients with parasitic roundworm infections such as filariasis can also develop these malignancies

- High risk of developing angiosarcoma

- Also known as Stewart-Treves syndrome
