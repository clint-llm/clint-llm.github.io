Bronchopleural fistula (BPF) is a sinus tract between the main stem, lobar, or segmental bronchus and the pleural space. Treatment for BPF ranges from medical management to bronchoscopic procedures for critically ill patients and surgical intervention for those deemed at the highest risk. This activity describes the epidemiology, pathophysiology, causes, evaluation, and management of bronchopleural fistula. It explains the role of an interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of patients with bronchopleural fistula.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the risk factors for bronchopleural fistulas.
- Outline the diagnostic techniques of patients with bronchopleural fistulas.
- Explain the conservative and invasive treatment options for the management of patients with bronchopleural fistulas.
- Review the interplay among the interprofessional team in diagnosing, treating, and rehabilitation of patients with bronchopleural fistula.
