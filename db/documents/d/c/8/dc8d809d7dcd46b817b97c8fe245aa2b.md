History and physical exam are essential to the diagnosis of impetigo.  Bacterial cultures can be used for confirmation of diagnosis and should be obtained if methicillin-resistant staph aureus (MRSA) is suspected or if an impetigo outbreak is present.  A skin biopsy may be considered if the case is refractory.

The anti-streptolysin O (ASO) response is weak from impetigo alone. Therefore, serologic testing for streptococcal antibodies is not indicated for the diagnosis of impetigo. However, it may be useful if poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is suspected in a patient with a recent impetigo outbreak.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing should be considered when a previously healthy adult develops bullous impetigo.
