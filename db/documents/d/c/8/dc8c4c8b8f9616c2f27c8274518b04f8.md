Children who are noted to be suffering from intrauterine growth restriction should be followed by a perinatologist to investigate reasons for this finding to include TORCH pathogens.  Neonatology should be consulted as they may be needed to assist with delivery and care after the birth of the child.  A pediatric infectious disease physician should be consulted to assist with testing and potential treatment of pathogens. Due to the findings that are common with TORCH infections, consultation with ophthalmology, audiology, radiology, cardiology, gastroenterology, and hematology/oncology may be warranted.
