**Oral Administration**

The oral preparation should not be kept in the mouth for prolonged periods as it tends to cause mucosal irritation and stomatitis.

Various pancrelipase products are not interchangeable; clinicians should not switch between products without verifying dosing.

For exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, the typical dosing is 500 to 2,500 lipase units with each meal or snack. Different formulations are not dose-transferable, so the prescriber should consult the drug information for each formulation when starting or switching agents.

**Tablets**

- Administered with a meal or immediately before it with sufficient fluids.

- The tablet is not to be crushed or chewed.

- It should be taken whole along with a proton pump inhibitor (if not enteric-coated).

**Enteric-Coated Capsules**

- The drug is administered with a meal or immediately before it with sufficient fluids.

- The enteric coating is not to be destroyed; it should be consumed whole.

- If the patient cannot swallow, the enteric-coated micro-spherules can be removed from the capsule and mixed with a small amount of acidic food and administered.

**Other Routes of Administration**

- Gastrostomy tube: Factors to be considered include the size of the tube, size of the micro-spherules, feeding schedules, and other concurrent medications to be administered.

- Jejunostomy or duodenostomy tube: The enteric coating is destroyed by crushing and then administered after mixing with sodium bicarbonate.
