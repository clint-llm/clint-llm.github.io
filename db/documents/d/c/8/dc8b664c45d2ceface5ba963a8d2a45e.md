The life expectancy of patients with isolated BEB appears not to be affected by the disease. However, it poses a tremendous impact on the quality of life. In a series of 238 patients with the diagnosis of BEB or Meige syndrome reported by Castelbuono and Miller, it was found that 27(11.3%) patients experienced spontaneous remission and good quality of life. However, this is not the case for the majority of patients who experience a constant fear of the disease worsening, reaching a point where they need increasing doses of botulinum toxin to achieve symptom improvement or worsen to a level where the response to the botulinum toxin is inadequate. There is also a sense of insecurity and embarrassment when performing social tasks, which in term results in social withdrawal.
