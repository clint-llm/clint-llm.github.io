The lumbar plexus and its derivatives are essential to consider when performing surgery. Â An anterior abdominal approach surgery can result in iatrogenic injury to superficial branches of either the iliohypogastric nerve, ilioinguinal nerves, or genitofemoral nerve. Injury to these during surgery can result in paresthesias. Of these, the genitofemoral nerve is most difficult to identify intraoperatively.

It is crucial to note the use of nerve blocks to the ilioinguinal nerve, Iliohypogastric nerve, and genitofemoral nerve are considerations in the management of treatment-resistant groin pain, as well as surgery to this area.

In joint surgery of either the hip or the knee can result in proprioceptive impairment.
