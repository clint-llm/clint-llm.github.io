Volar splint length depends on the application. For a Colles or other wrist fracture, the splint extends from the second through fifth metacarpal heads (distal palmar crease) to 4 cm to 5 cm distal to the antecubital fossa. For a metacarpal fracture including a Boxerâ€™s fracture, the splint should extend beyond the metacarpophalangeal joint and for a phalanx fracture to beyond the tip of the digits. Plaster takes longer to set and is more pliable than fiberglass.

The hardening of the splint material occurs through an exothermic reaction. The amount of heat released is proportional to the number of layers of cast material and the temperature of the water utilized. Limit the layers of plaster to no more than 12 (usually 8 to 10 layers suffice). Using cool, fresh water allows time to mold the splint and reduces the risk of burn. Apply adequate stockinette and cotton undercast padding to prevent heat penetration. Care is taken to avoid skin contact with plaster or fiberglass. Avoid resting the still wet cast on a pillow or mattress as this will interfere with the dissipation of heat. Extra padding over bony prominences, such as ulnar styloid, will help prevent pressure sores. The elastic wrap is used to hold the splint in place. It should be applied so that swelling is allowed, but the movement is limited. Neurovascular status should be assessed before and after application. A sling is then applied for elevation and protection.
