The facial muscles develop from the first and second branchial, or pharyngeal, arches, beginning to form in the fourth week of development.

The mimetic muscles derive from the second branchial arch, which contains Reichert's cartilage, a structure that ultimately forms the styloid process of the temporal bone, the stylohyoid ligament, and the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone.
