# Continuing Education Activity

Surfer’s ear or external auditory exostoses (EAE) is a slowly progressive disease caused by benign bone growth resulting from chronic cold water exposure. It is most classically associated with surfing but can be seen in any individual who is repeatedly exposed to cold water. This can include many populations, a few of which include surfers, swimmers, divers, kayakers, and sailors. Surfer's ear is usually asymptomatic but can cause symptoms such as hearing loss, recurrent infections, otorrhea, a sensation of aural fullness, and cerumen impaction. Treatment usually involves medical management but may include surgery if symptoms become severe. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of surfer's ear and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of surfer's ear.
- Explain how surfer's ear presents.
- Review the management options for surfer's ear.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by surfer's ear.

# Introduction

Surfer’s ear, or exostoses of the external auditory canal, is a slowly progressive disease from benign bone growth as a result of chronic cold water exposure. It is a condition most commonly associated with surfing but can be seen in anyone repeatedly exposed to cold water, such as swimmers, divers, kayakers, and participants of other maritime activities.

# Etiology

Exostoses develop from prolonged irritation of the external auditory canal, typically with repeated cold seawater exposure.

# Epidemiology

Surfer’s ear dates back to prehistoric man. It has been utilized anthropologically to identify cultures with regular aquatic exposure.

# Pathophysiology

Frequent cold water exposure over the course of years slowly induces bone growth.

Studies demonstrate that exposure to water colder than 19° C  (66° F) leads to the more frequent development of exostoses.

# History and Physical

External auditory exostosis is usually an asymptomatic disease.

On physical exam, the practitioner should be able to visualize multi-nodular masses at the tympanic ring with an otoscope. In general, the size of the masses is proportional to the degree of symptoms. The masses are firm, multiple, and often seen in the external auditory canal bilaterally. If the exostoses are large enough, they may obscure the sight of the tympanic membrane. It is not uncommon for cerumen to become impacted on the tympanic membrane as a result of entrapment behind or within the exostoses. If this is the case, carefully perform an ear lavage to better visualize the ear structures. Once removable debris or obstructions are resolved, consider assessing for hearing loss. If hearing loss is present, performing a Rhine and Weber test will demonstrate a conductive hearing loss as opposed to a sensorineural hearing loss.

# Evaluation

Patients will typically present with a secondary complaint, such as ear pain, hearing loss, or a sensation of fullness. These symptoms can be a result of otitis externa, cerumen impaction, tympanic membrane rupture, or a foreign body. All of these diagnoses have the potential to be a downstream effect of external auditory exostoses. The history and physical exam are typically all that is needed to diagnose external auditory exostoses. The most important component of the physical exam is otoscopy. External auditory exostoses have a firm, bony, and nodular appearance at the tympanic ring within the external auditory meatus. They are usually multiple and bilateral. While their position within the ear canal can vary, the first lesions most commonly are medial and anterosuperior.

The degree of ear canal obstruction caused by the exostoses is usually proportional to the severity of symptoms.

# Treatment / Management

Early detection and prevention of progression of surfer’s ear are paramount once exostoses have been detected. Prevention involves patient education for the use of silicone earplugs and/or neoprene hoods to reduce auditory canal cold water exposure. EAE is a progressive disease; however, the risk of progression can be mitigated with consistent preventive measures. Treatment consists of medical management involving regular cleaning of the external auditory canal to remove any entrapped debris. This can help prevent the propagation of complications such as recurrent otitis externa, tympanic membrane rupture, and conductive hearing loss.

Once the exostoses are formed, they are irreversible unless surgical intervention is performed. If there is greater than 80% occlusion and symptoms are severe and persistent despite medical management, a canalplasty by an otolaryngologist may be considered.

# Differential Diagnosis

If masses are noted in the external auditory canal on the otoscopic exam, there are several differential diagnoses to consider. These include EAE, osteomas, cholesteatoma, keratosis obturans, aural polyps, and tumors.

On exam alone, it can be challenging to distinguish EAE from osteomas. The patient history helps to make this clinical distinction. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for EAE if the patient has a history of repeated cold water emersion. External auditory exostoses are generally bilateral and multinodular. Osteomas are most commonly pedunculated, singular, unilateral, and positioned laterally in the ear canal.

A cholesteatoma is a cystic mass of keratinized squamous epithelium located in the middle ear.

Aural polyps are benign fleshy growths in the external auditory meatus or inner ear.

# Prognosis

External auditory exostoses are benign and usually asymptomatic.

# Complications

The severity of complications from external auditory exostoses is proportional to the size of the exostoses. The size of the exostoses is proportional to the duration and frequency of exposure to cold water.

Conductive hearing loss is a common complication of EAE. The degree of hearing loss is relative to the degree of ear canal occlusion, which is predominantly determined by the size of exostoses. The associated hearing loss is generally due to cerumen impaction on the tympanic membrane caused by blockage from the exostoses.

The ear canal occlusion that can occur due to large exostoses may also propagate an inflammatory process leading to acute external otitis.Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.S. aureus. It is particularly important to cover for P. aeruginosa in patients with diabetes.

In severe cases when otitis externa is recurrent or left untreated, patients can be at risk for developing mastoiditis. Patients are particularly prone to this if they develop a perforation in their tympanic membrane. Seawater can then enter the middle ear and stimulate a more serious infection. Mastoiditis requires prompt treatment with IV antibiotics that cover S. aureus, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and enteric gram-negative rods. Unasyn is an ideal antimicrobial agent.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

External auditory exostoses are preventable.

Consistent use of physical ear protection during cold water exposure prevents cold water from entering the ear canal and can mitigate the development and progression of exostoses.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

An interprofessional team approach will enhance patient outcomes. A primary care clinician or other healthcare professional usually diagnoses the disorder. Audiologists play an important role in evaluating associated hearing loss. When the disease is progressed, with severe blockage and symptoms, the surgical expertise of an otorhinolaryngological surgeon is beneficial.

With more people taking to water-based activities each year, the development of surfer's ear is on the rise. Part of this is due to improved wetsuit technology allowing water enthusiasts to endure colder water temperatures. Also, surfing is rapidly growing in popularity and will likely continue to do so after making its Olympic debut at the Tokyo 2021 Summer Olympics. As more people are spending more time in cold water, they are at increased risk for external auditory exostoses. As healthcare professionals, we must increase awareness of the disease among at-risk populations and educate them on effective preventative measures.
