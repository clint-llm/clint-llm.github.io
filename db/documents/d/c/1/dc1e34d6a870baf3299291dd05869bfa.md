Treatment and management of DGS require intensive interprofessional care:

- Fortunately, many patients with DGS have minor immunodeficiency, with preservation of T cell function despite decreased T cell production. Frequent follow-up with an immunologist experienced in treating primary immunodeficiencies is advisable. Immunodeficiency in neonates with complete DGS (cDGS) requires management with isolation, intravenous IgG, antibiotic prophylaxis, and either thymic or hematopoietic cell transplant (HSCT).

- Immunization, boosters, intravenous immunoglobulin, and antibiotic prophylaxis regimens should revolve around the individual patient's laboratory values. Antibody titer to administered vaccines should be re-evaluated every six to twelve months to determine the necessity of re-vaccination.

- Cardiac anomalies, if not diagnosed during the fetal ultrasound, may present shortly after birth as life-threatening cyanotic heart disease. Pediatric cardiothoracic surgery evaluation may be urgently required. Blood products, if necessary, should be irradiated, CMV negative, and leukocyte reduced to prevent transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease. These measures also aim to reduce lung injury, particularly in surgical cases requiring cardiopulmonary bypass.

- Cleft palate cases require evaluation by an otolaryngologist, plastic surgeon, or oral & maxillofacial surgeon with experience in surgical correction of palatal defects. Repair of a cleft palate can improve feeding ability, speech, and reduce the incidence of sinopulmonary infections.

- Hypocalcemia is manageable with calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Recombinant human PTH is an option in DGS patients refractory to standard therapy.

- Autoimmune diseases are common in DGS patients, including immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Graves disease, and Hashimoto thyroiditis. DGS patients should be evaluated carefully for autoimmune symptoms regularly.

- Audiologic evaluation is necessary for DGS patients experiencing difficulty with hearing. Children too young to express difficulty with hearing need assessment, particularly with a delay in cognitive and behavioral development.

- Early intervention services are beneficial for children with impaired cognitive and behavioral development.

- Speech therapy is necessary for difficulty with language secondary to craniofacial anomalies and/or cognitive impairment.

- Psychiatric care for DGS patients with depressive and psychotic symptoms is necessary, as diseases like schizophrenia are associated with DGS.

- Genetic counseling is a reasonable consideration for parents of a child with DGS who desire more children, as well as for patients with DGS who may want to become parents. If a parent has the same mutation as an affected child, there is a 50% chance a new baby will also have DGS.

Advanced approaches for the management of children with complete DiGeorge anomaly

In the cDGS featuring no thymus function and bone marrow stem cells can not develop into T cells, children usually die by age 2 years due to severe infections. In this setting, the proposal is to T cell–replete HSCT. Nevertheless, because of the absence of thymus, this strategy can only obtain engraftment of post thymic T cells.
