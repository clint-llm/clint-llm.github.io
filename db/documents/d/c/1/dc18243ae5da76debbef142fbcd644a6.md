Lymphadenopathy, while pertinent, may be nonspecific. There are several potential causes of lymphadenopathy, ranging from infectious, autoimmune, malignant, and lymphoproliferative.

There is a wide range of infectious etiologies, including bacterial, fungal, viral, mycobacterial, spirochetal, and protozoal organisms. Autoimmune disorders that may contribute include but are not limited to sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Malignant diseases like lymphoma, leukemia, metastatic cancer, and head and neck cancers are also common causes of lymphadenopathy. Lymphoproliferative disorders such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis can also manifest with the enlargement of lymph nodes.

Lymphadenopathy can be localized or diffuse. About 75% of most lymphadenopathies are localized, and about 50% of those occur in the head and neck regions. Generalized lymphadenopathy, which involves two or more non-contiguous regions, is reported to occur in 25% of lymphadenopathies.

Elucidating the etiology of lymphadenopathy can be challenging. A thorough history and physical exam are one of the most important steps in determining the underlying cause of lymphadenopathy.

Etiologies can be determined based on lymph node groups. Submental and submandibular lymphadenopathy commonly is infectious in origin, often presenting with viral prodromes. Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy can arise from localized bacterial and viral infections, as well as lymphoma.
