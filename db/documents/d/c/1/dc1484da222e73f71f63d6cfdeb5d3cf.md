Diseases of the lymphatic system in the abdomen rarely occur. When they do, they can be a product of either primary or secondary causes. Primary causes are essentially due to a disruption in the development of the lymphatic system itself. These causes encompass congenital or developmental conditions. Secondary causes can be due to a result of other diseases.

One primary cause of disease in the abdominal lymphatic system is lymphangiomas. Lymphangiomas are benign, thin-walled cystic masses. They mostly occur in the mediastinal and axillary regions, but 5% occur in the mesentery, retroperitoneum, and abdominal viscera. The pathogenesis of lymphangiomas is hypothesized as a failure of newly developing tissue of lymphatic origin to connect to the main lymphatic system causing increased growth of lymphatic sinusoids. The mesentery is the most common site of occurrence.

Another primary cause is generalized systemic lymphangiomatosis. This disease happens in children and is an abnormality of the developing lymphatic system and increased growth affecting all body systems.

One example of a secondary cause of disease in the abdominal lymphatic system is lymphangiectasia due to parasitic infections. Components of the parasite block the lymphatic drainage, creating fluid build-up and an inability of the lymphatic vessels to contract.
