Caroli disease is a rare inherited disorder involving segmental dilatation of large, intrahepatic bile ducts which appear as cysts on imaging and histopathologic exam. The gene involved is the same gene responsible for autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD); hence, these conditions commonly co-occur. Caroli disease is usually diagnosed during adolescence, and patients typically present with recurrent episodes of cholangitis. This activity describes the pathophysiology of Caroli disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical history and physical exam findings of a patient with Caroli disease.
- Summarize the treatment options for Caroli disease.
- Detail the evaluation of a patient with Caroli disease.
- Review the importance of enhancing care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by Caroli disease.
