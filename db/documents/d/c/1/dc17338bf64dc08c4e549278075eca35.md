In addition to pilots, crew, and passengers of aircraft, athletes, travelers (lowlanders) to ski resorts, mountaineering expeditions, and people going on pilgrimage to monasteries, abbeys, shrines, or temples are at high risk for developing acute mountain sickness or high altitude illness. If untreated, it can lead to its severe manifestations: high–altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE).  High altitude oxygenation can help such people or those accompanying them acclimatize to high altitudes, hence preventing or ameliorating the symptoms of high altitude illness and/or the progression to severe illnesses. An altitude generator can help acclimatize to high altitudes in a bedroom by producing varying oxygen levels depending on the altitude level one plans to ascend. For example, it can generate 20.9% oxygen at sea level to 9.5% oxygen at 20000 feet (6000 meters) above sea level.
