# Continuing Education Activity

The Valsalva maneuver is forced expiration against a closed glottis. It mimics many normal and, in some cases, routine activities, such as straining during defecation, blowing up a balloon, or playing the saxophone. Performing the Valsalva maneuver causes an increase in intrathoracic pressure, leading to a reduction in preload to the heart. Cardiovascular changes occur during and after this maneuver due to baroreflex and other compensatory reflex mechanisms that are initiated by decreased preload. This activity outlines the indications and contraindications for performing the Valsalva maneuver and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in using this test to evaluate for autonomic dysfunction.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the Valsalva maneuver.
- Review how to perform the Valsalva maneuver.
- Explain the clinical significance of the Valsalva maneuver.
- Summarize the clinical impact that autonomic dysfunction can have on patients and how the interprofessional team can best evaluate and treat patients with autonomic dysfunctions to improve patient outcomes.

# Introduction

Antonio Maria Valsalva, an Italian physician, first described the Valsalva maneuver (VM) in his work De Aure Humana Tractatus in 1704.

Valsalva maneuver is the performance of forced expiration against a closed glottis. Many activities of our daily lives, such as straining during defecation or playing the saxophone entail the performance of the Valsalva maneuver. The key event occurring during the maneuver is increasing intrathoracic pressure leading to the reduction of preload to the heart. The reflex cardiovascular changes during and after the maneuver are because of reduced preload engaging baroreflex and other compensatory reflex mechanisms.

# Anatomy and Physiology

Based on the characteristic hemodynamic changes, the Valsalva maneuver divides into four phases.

Phase I, which corresponds to the onset of strain, is associated with a transient rise in blood pressure because of the emptying of some blood from the large veins and pulmonary circulation.

Phase II follows this when positive intrathoracic pressure leads to a reduced venous return to the heart. Because of reduced venous return and thus reduced preload, stroke volume falls; this leads to a fall in blood pressure activating the baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch. The vagal withdrawal followed by increased sympathetic discharge ensues, leading to marked tachycardia, increased cardiac output, and vasoconstriction, which leads to the recovery of blood pressure to normal values in healthy individuals.

Phase III is the transient phase involving the release of strain which leads to a sudden dip in blood pressure. The release of positive pressure leads to expansion of the pulmonary vascular bed and reduces the left ventricular cross-sectional area resulting in a transient fall in blood pressure.

Phase IV is the overshoot of the blood pressure above the baseline, which is because of the resumption of normal venous return to the heart stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system during Phase II. The overshoot of blood pressure leads to stimulation of baroreflex, leading to bradycardia and the return of blood pressure to the baseline.

# Indications

Valsalva maneuver is used for assessment of autonomic function status, as a marker for heart failure, for termination of arrhythmias, murmur differentiation, and various other indications.

# Contraindications

Valsalva maneuver is relatively safe and can be performed in all patients. Side effects reported are rare. However, since there is a rise in intraocular and intra-abdominal pressure, therefore the test must be avoided in patients with retinopathy and intraocular lens implantation. Valsalva retinopathy may result in susceptible patients.

# Equipment

A modification of this maneuver can be performed in the cardiovascular laboratory or at the bedside using a disposable syringe/mouthpiece connected to a manometer. A small leak is created in the syringe/mouthpiece to ensure sustained effort throughout the period of forced exhalation.

# Technique or Treatment

The patient can perform the maneuver in the sitting, supine, or recumbent position. Some reports advocate a recumbent position,

**Modified VM**

In order to increase the relaxation phase venous return and vagal stimulation, a modification to the standard VM has been described in the REVERT trial, which includes supine positioning with leg elevation immediately after the Valsalva strain. This is used for the emergency treatment of supraventricular tachycardias.

**Reverse VM**

The patient in a sitting position is asked to inhale against resistance for ten seconds while keeping the nose pinched and having the mouth closed tightly. This leads to increased vagal tone and decreased sympathetic activity, which in turn leads to bradycardia and arterial hypotension (the Bezold–Jarich reflex), causing supraventricular tachycardia to resolve in the next 15 seconds if effective.

# Clinical Significance

**Autonomic function assessment:**Valsalva maneuver is an integral part of the Ewing battery of tests used for the evaluation of cardiac autonomic neuropathy.

**Assessment of heart failure:**VM is useful for the assessment of heart failure. Patients with heart failure show an abnormal blood pressure overshoot in response to the Valsalva maneuver due to impaired ventricular function.

**Termination of Arrhythmias:**VM is also useful for the termination of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) with variable success. Increased vagal activity, leading to increased refractoriness of atrioventricular (AV) nodal tissue interrupting re-entry, has been proposed as the mechanism for the termination of PSVT.

**Diagnosis of murmurs:**VM may be used to differentiate between different murmurs. Since the maneuver reduces preload and thus end-diastolic volume, it can help accentuate some murmurs while diminishing others. The murmur of aortic stenosis (AS) is reduced in intensity on the administration of VM because reduced end-diastolic volume (EDV) diminishes the blood available for ejection through the stenosed aortic orifice.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Valsalva maneuver (VM) is a simple, non-invasive test that can be easily performed using a mouthpiece and a manometer. While the maneuver is relatively safe, it is prudent to rule out any pre-existing disease of the retina before performing the maneuver. Therefore, one should consult an ophthalmologist and seek a thorough examination of the fundus in patients with suspected retinopathy. Similarly, the opinion of a cardiologist may assist in patients with pre-existing ischemic or valvular heart disease before the performance of VM.

It can assist the neurologist to identify patients suffering from autonomic neuropathy. Dysautonomia usually manifests as an absence of blood pressure overshoot and reflex bradycardia after the maneuver.
