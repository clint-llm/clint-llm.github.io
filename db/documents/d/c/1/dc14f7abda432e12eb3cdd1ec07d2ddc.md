The FDA currently has two approved indications for 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. These conditions include benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and androgenic alopecia (male pattern hair loss). While not approved by the FDA, clinicians have used 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors in the management of hirsutism.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a condition typically seen in middle-aged and older men with increasing frequency seen with increasing age. BPH correlates with lower urinary tract symptoms that can cause significant distress, including nocturia, urinary urgency, increased frequency of urination, decreased stream caliber, straining while voiding, and a sensation of incomplete bladder emptying. The symptoms mentioned above can significantly affect the quality of life of patients suffering from BPH and can cause noteworthy changes in sleeping patterns. Several theories for the etiology of BPH exist; however, a widely accepted view is that the potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), binds intracellular androgen receptors in the prostate leading to an increase in transcription of proteins that are responsible for increased cellular proliferation. As the gland enlarges, it can compress the prostatic urethra, producing classic symptoms as described above. Finasteride, as well as dutasteride, have both been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of BPH. Researchers have found that finasteride has reduced prostatic DHT by up to 90% and serum DHT by up to 70%. It is worth noting that these reductions in DHT were independent of dosage. Similarly, the research found that dutasteride leads to reductions of DHT by up to 99% for prostate and serum DHT. Furthermore, finasteride has elicited impressive reductions in prostatic volume, which are largely responsible for the troubling urinary symptoms that arise due to an enlarged prostate gland.

Hair loss affects millions of men and women worldwide annually.  This condition has significant morbidity associated with it as a result of a change in physical appearance affecting the well-being of the patient. Androgenic alopecia or male pattern hair loss makes up a large number of these cases wherein hair loss begins over the crown of the scalp and progresses anteriorly while largely sparing the hair on the temporal and occipital portions of the head. The main culprit for this effect is the androgenic steroid dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which promotes hair miniaturization via its actions on androgen-sensitive receptors. Interestingly, the follicular response to androgens is different depending on the location of the body. In areas such as the face, androgens exert their growth effects on facial hair resulting in anabolic effects. In other areas of the body, such as the crown (or vertex) of the scalp, the opposite effect occurs, resulting in a decrease in hair growth. Although male pattern baldness is a natural phenomenon occurring with age, hair loss can lead to emotional distress, especially in younger populations. The two most common first-line treatments for male pattern hair loss include topical minoxidil and oral finasteride, with finasteride being more powerful as it targets the source of hair loss. Numerous studies have tested the efficacy of oral finasteride as an agent to combat androgenic alopecia.  These studies have revealed significant improvements in androgenic alopecia. One study found that while those receiving no treatment for androgenic alopecia demonstrated a loss of approximately 26% hair count over five years, patients receiving finasteride had a 10% increase in hair count in just one year. Another such study provided further evidence of finasteride’s efficacy in managing androgenic alopecia, with all patients demonstrating increased hair count at 12 months.
