When diagnosing acute gastroenteritis there are several differential etiological agents to consider:

- 
Norovirus

- 
Rotavirus

- 
Shigella

- 
Hepatitis A

- 
Listeria

- 
Clostridium

- 
S. aureus

- 
V. cholerae

- 
Giardia

- 
E. coli

- 
Campylobacter

- Ciliary dysentery

- Typhoid fever

- 
Vibriosis

- 
Yersiniosis

- 
C. difficile

Proctitis can also be another differential diagnosis that can be caused by Gonococcus, Herpes simplex, Chlamydia, and Syphilis for example.

Other syndromes to consider are necrotizing enterocolitis, chronic inflammatory processes like parasites, Crohn disease, ischemic colitis, and allergic enteritis.

There are also noninfectious causes that can lead to GI symptoms including arsenic, cadmium, copper, mercury, pesticides, and zinc.
