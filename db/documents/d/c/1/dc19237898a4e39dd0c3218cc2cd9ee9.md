The third cranial nerve is also known as oculomotor nerve and has 2 major components:

- Outer parasympathetic fibers that supply the ciliary muscles and the sphincter pupillae

- Inner somatic fibers thatÂ supply the levator palpebrae superioris in the eyelid (which retracts the upper eyelid) and the 4 extraocular muscles (superior, middle, inferior recti, and inferior oblique).

LR6(SO4)3 is a simple mnemonic representing the innervation of the extraocular muscles. It stands for:

- LR6: Lateral rectus muscle which is supplied by the sixth cranial nerve

- SO4: Superior oblique muscle which is supplied by the fourth cranial nerve

- 3: The third cranial nerve supplies other extraocular muscles
