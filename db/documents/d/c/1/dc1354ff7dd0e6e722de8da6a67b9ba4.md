Nintedanib is pregnancy category D, and females of reproductive age should be counseled to use highly effective contraceptionÂ (for example, reversible implantable contraceptive device) before starting the medication and during therapy. Contraception should be continued for at least three months after the last dose of nintedanib. A Pregnancy test should be performed before and at regular intervals during treatment.
