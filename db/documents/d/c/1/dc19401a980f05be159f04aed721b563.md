In addition to the common risks of surgery to include pain, bleeding, swelling, infection, scarring, damage to surrounding structures, and the need for further surgery, complications of microtia repair include pneumothorax from costal cartilage harvest, infection of the cartilage (often with Pseudomonas aeruginosa), cartilage framework extrusion, changes in framework size, lobule necrosis, and migration of the construct from its original location.

Extrusion of the construct typically happens over the superior helical rim and is treated with temporoparietal fascia or occipitoparietal fascia flap coverage. This is the complication that requires the most frequent return to the operating room for repair because the superior helix tends to have the most tenuous blood supply on the reconstructed auricle.

Both costal cartilage constructs and porous polyethylene implants can migrate after placement, usually anteroinferiorly, although determining the correct location for initial placement can also be very challenging. Many cases of microtia are accompanied by hemifacial microsomia, which makes use of the normal side of the face as a template less helpful. While generally durable in the long-term, porous polyethylene has the potential to extrude or be infected with comparatively minor trauma compared to autologous cartilage constructs.

Lastly, most patients will have a low hairline on the microtic side; this can result in hair-bearing scalp covering the top of the reconstructed ear, which may later require removal with a laser.
