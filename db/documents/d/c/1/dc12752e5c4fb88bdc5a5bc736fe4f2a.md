The pathophysiology underlying BRASH syndrome is not well described however involves the synergistic effect of AV nodal blockade and hyperkalemia resulting in severe bradycardia. The resulting reduction in cardiac output, in turn, leads to poor renal perfusion, therefore, worsening the acute kidney injury as well as the degree of hyperkalemia. It is well documented that severe hyperkalemia alone can cause bradycardia. However, due to this synergistic effect, profound bradycardia can occur even in the setting of mild hyperkalemia. Renally cleared AV nodal blockers, such as metoprolol and amlodipine, impose a greater risk as the renal tubules' concentrations inversely increase as the GFR decreases. If undiagnosed, this can progress to multi-system organ failure requiring transvenous pacing and hemodialysis. This vicious cycle is often initiated by an innocuous event such as recent illness or medication changes. One of the most common causes is hypovolemia resulting from dehydration and a subsequent pre-renal acute kidney injury. This is often precipitated by a gastrointestinal illness such as gastroenteritis or a decreased oral intake.
