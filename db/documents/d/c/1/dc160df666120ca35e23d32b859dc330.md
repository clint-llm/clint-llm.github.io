A multidisciplinary approach is especially important in the management of these patients. Due to the rarity of this condition and its complexities, there is no consensus for management or treatment. During the neonatal period, strict fluid management is needed to prevent life-threatening dehydration. Supplemental feeding via gastrostomy tubes may be useful in preventing dehydration and malnutrition but does not appear to improve linear growth. Growth hormone administration seems ineffective in increasing growth rate or adult height. Furthermore, it may increase the risk of tumor development. Appropriate antibiotics are used to treat infections. IV immune globulin replacement may be used in patients with significant immunodeficiency. Close follow-up with endocrinology is needed to treat diabetes mellitus. Dermatologic recommendations include frequent skin screenings and avoidance of sun exposure.

According to one study, hematologic malignancy screening should be avoided in children due to the lack of prognostic benefit with early diagnosis. However, adults benefit from surgical resection of carcinomas at an early stage and thus, annual breast, cervix, and colon cancer screenings are recommended. Due to the high risk of chromosomal breakage, the radiation exposure must be minimized. Magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound should be used in place of computed tomography and radiographs for cancer screening and diagnosis. Because of the risk of increased toxicity, chemotherapeutic agents may need dose-adjusted. 5-fluorouracil, in particular, has been shown to induce higher levels of DNA fragmentation. Radiotherapy must be avoided. Proton beam therapy has been shown to be a safer alternative than radiotherapy.
