High-risk surgical patients must be monitored closely overnight by a nursing member of the interprofessional team. High BMI, large volume liposuction of that over 5000 mL, a procedure in length greater than six hours, combined procedures, high-risk comorbidities such as coronary artery disease, or any inter-operative aberrant vital signs are all criteria for admission to an observation unit for overnight monitoring by a skilled nursing member with continuous care.

As is standard procedure before discharge, the healthcare team must certify that the patient is stable for discharge and has a well-entrusted environment and caretaker at home as well. Furthermore, for the management of complications and outcomes, it has been well documented in the literature that the details of the surgical procedure and any unforeseen intraoperative surgical events be well documented.
