The larynx is a cartilaginous skeleton with intricate neuromuscular control. The hyoid is the only bone in the larynx and articulates with many of the extrinsic muscles of the larynx. A notable external landmark of the larynx is the anterior prominence of the thyroid cartilage. The hyoid bone is palpable superiorly, and the thyroid gland is palpable inferiorly.

The structure of the larynx divides into three basic parts: the supraglottis, the glottis, and the subglottis.

The cartilages of the supraglottis are the epiglottis, two arytenoids, and two corniculate cartilages. The arytenoid cartilages contain a vocal process medially from which the vocal ligament extends anteriorly to the thyroid cartilage. The vestibular folds (false cords) are folds of mucosa positioned superolateral to the vocal ligaments. The lateral surface of the arytenoid contains the muscular process to which several intrinsic laryngeal muscles attach

The anatomy of the glottis is understood to be divided into the phonatory (anterior glottis) and respiratory (posterior glottis) portions functionally.

The inferior-most portion of the larynx is the subglottis. It extends from 1 cm below the vocal ligaments to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage.

The primary functions of the larynx are in respiration, airway protection during deglutition, and phonation. In respiration, vocal folds are optimally in abduction, increasing the total area of the glottis to facilitate work of breathing.
