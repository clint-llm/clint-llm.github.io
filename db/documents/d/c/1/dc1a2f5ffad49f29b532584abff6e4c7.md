Peripheral pulses are monitored in various clinical settings for several conditions, including where "limb checks" are needed. For example, if there is concern about the vascular supply to a specific extremity, pulses will be checked with some frequency. This is done for conditions including compartment syndrome, critical limb ischemia, and severe fractures. Peripheral pulses are also monitored and quantified routinely as one of the most basic and important vital signs.
