Type I and II hypersensitivity reactions are antibody-mediated similar to type III hypersensitivity. Their clinical features can overlap.

Type I or immediate hypersensitivity is mediated by preformed IgE antibodies that coat mast cells. The IgE antibodies are crosslinked by the free allergen (antigen), leading to mast cell degranulation and the release of histamine and inflammatory mediators. Examples of type I hypersensitivity mediated conditions are:

- Anaphylaxis

- Bronchial asthma

- Allergic rhinitis

- Food allergies

Type II hypersensitivity is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies that coat (opsonize) the circulating cells (platelets, erythrocytes) with or without complement. With opsonization, the cells become the target for phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils or complement-mediated lysis. In other cases, the anti-receptor antibodies interfere with the normal function of the receptor (e.g., anti-acetylcholine receptor). Examples of type II hypersensitivity mediated conditions are:

- Autoimmune hemolytic anemia

- Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura

- Acute rheumatic fever

- Good pasture syndrome

- Myasthenia gravis

- Graves disease

- Pernicious anemia

- ANCA vasculitis
