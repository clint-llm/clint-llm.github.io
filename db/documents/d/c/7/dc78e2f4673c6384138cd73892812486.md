Chorea classically is described in Huntington disease, but there are other disorders that can lead to chorea. Spinocerebellar ataxia subtypes, Wilson disease, Sydenham chorea, and structural disease of the basal ganglia can also be associated with chorea. Overall, the root of the pathology is in the basal ganglia, often exemplified by neuro-imaging demonstrating atrophy of the caudate nucleus. Huntington disease is a hereditary cause of chorea and is one of the tri-nucleotide repeat disorders. Huntington disease is caused by a CAG repeat on chromosome 4 in the Huntington, or HTT gene.
