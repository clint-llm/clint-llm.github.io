Typically children, between 2 and 12 years of age with a peak between 3 and 5 years, present with infrequent seizures (focal and/or generalized) and stagnation or regression of the development. Within 2 and 3 years of the onset, further regression in development occurs in association with more frequent generalized seizures, such as atonic or atypical absence seizures. The majority of the children have a normal development before the disease onset, but developmental delay and cognitive impairment may be present from the beginning depending on the underlying etiologies. Rarely, neurocognitive regression may appear as the earliest feature without any evidence of clinical seizures. Behavioral abnormalities, particularly hyperactivity, are commonly present with ESES.
