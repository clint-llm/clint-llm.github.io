Response to therapy varies by the underlying causal disease or agent. Drug-associated erythroderma tends to resolve quickly with discontinuation of the offending agent and prompt treatment. Erythroderma associated with primary skin disease tends to have a slower course and may also resolve more slowly. Malignancy-associated erythroderma may be more progressive and its course dictated by the prognosis of the underlying malignancy and response to therapy, while idiopathic erythrodermic cases may be unpredictable with periods of relapse and remission.
