The nail biopsy is an essential procedure utilized by dermatologists to establish the diagnosis of a variety of skin and nail pathologies. The nail biopsy encompasses several biopsy techniques that include but are not limited to the nail plate, nail bed, nail fold, and nail matrix.

The favored underlying diagnosis often determines the site of the biopsy and the techniques employed. The nail matrix is very delicate and carries its own biopsy risks and side effects.Â Even so, the majority of nail biopsies carry minimal to no risk of permanent nail dystrophy.
