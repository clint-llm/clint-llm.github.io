As reported in a meta-analysis by Hashemi et al., the estimated prevalence of esotropia was reported as 0.77%.

Further, the prevalence of strabismus and its types varies among different races. In the Baltimore Pediatric Eye Disease Study, the prevalence of manifest deviations was 3.3% among whites and 2.1% among children of African American descent.

The esotropias and exotropias were almost equal in both groups. A retrospective cohort-based study done among patients diagnosed with Esotropia in Minnesota reported that 36% had fully accommodative esotropia, another 17% had non-accommodative esotropia, 10% had partially accommodative esotropia. In contrast, 8% were congenital, 6.5% were paralytic, and the rest had an undetermined underlying cause of esotropia.
