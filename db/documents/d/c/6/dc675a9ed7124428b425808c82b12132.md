An arterial blood gas is a laboratory test used for the measurement of arterial pH, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), bicarbonate (HCO3), base excess, total CO2, and O2 saturation.

A venous blood gas is a laboratory test identical to an arterial blood gas measurement, except the blood is drawn from a venous site. This results in a slightly more acidic “normal” pH range.

Urine chloride is a direct measurement of chloride being excreted into urine. This test is useful to help determine the etiology of metabolic alkalosis.
