The spread of infectious diseases requires a susceptible population and opportunities for transmission. Individual and herd immunity to mpox, previously achieved through widespread vaccinia vaccination, has declined since the 1980s, increasing human susceptibility to outbreaks.

Due to the range of mpox disease severity, an infected patient may present to the emergency department, urgent care, or primary care setting. The ability of an interprofessional team of clinicians, nurses, virologists, veterinarians, and public health experts to promptly identify mpox infection in humans and animals, implement protective measures, and initiate public health reporting creates a bulwark against a devastating outbreak. Specialty infectious disease pharmacist consult may prove helpful in resolving the case, and in addition to infectious disease expertise, can perform medication reconciliation and counsel patients on their medications. The interprofessional paradigm will help drive better patient outcomes. [Level 5]
