Cocaine is absorbed from mucous membranes if applied topically or snorted, through the alveoli if smoked, and the gastrointestinal mucosa if swallowed. Cocaine is degraded by plasma esterases, with a half-life of approximately one hour.

Cocaine hasÂ only received FDA approval for adult nasal mucosal surgery anesthesia; it has no approved pediatric indications.

When used medically, cocaine requires no renal dose adjusting, including for dialysis patients with no supplement necessary. For patients with hepatic dysfunction, caution is advised with close monitoring.
