Pneumococcal and influenza vaccines prevent upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in children. Apart from this, the avoidance of tobacco smoke can decrease the risk of URTI. Tobacco smoke is a respiratory stimulant that increases the risk of pneumonia in children.Â Infants with otitis media should be breastfed whenever possible, as breast milk contains immunoglobulins that protect infants from foreign pathogens in key phases of early extra-uterine life.
