The literature has only reported a few physiological variations of the obturator muscles. One study by Pine et al. examined variations in the relationship between the piriformis and obturator internus to better inform piriformis preservation during posterior hip arthroplasty. The tendon crossing angles, location of insertion onto the greater trochanter and the fusion between tendons prior to insertion were analyzed. It was found that in 10% of cases, the obturator internus and piriformis tendons combined before insertion on the femur.

Somewhat related to anatomical variations, it has also been noted that the architectural design of the obturator internus is particularly affected by aging. The literature demonstrates that age-related changes in the structure of the obturator internus led to a decrease in force-generating capability and an increase in muscle fibrosis.
