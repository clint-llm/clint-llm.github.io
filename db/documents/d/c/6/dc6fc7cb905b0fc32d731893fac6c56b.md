Treatment of testicular cancer requires cooperative evaluation by urologists, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists. Expert radiologic evaluation during surveillance is mandatory to detect recurrent disease. Careful pathologic evaluation is needed to describe different components of seminomatous and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors or GCNIS within specimens.Â  Multidisciplinary discussions and planning result in the optimization of treatment, which results in an excellent prognosis for testicular cancer patients within all risk categories.
