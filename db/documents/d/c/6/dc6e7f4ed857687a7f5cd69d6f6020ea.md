A salicylate level should be checked on all patients with a concern for salicylate toxicity. Serial levels are recommended as absorption is widely variable and will impact treatment. Acetaminophen levels should also be checked as confusion about what substance was ingested may occur. Electrolytes, including calcium and magnesium, ABG, LFTs, CBC, lactate, and coagulation studies should be obtained. An ECG to evaluate for dysrhythmias should be obtained. Consider a CT head if the patient has altered mental status. Serial ABGs and salicylate levels should be obtained until levels clearlyÂ begin to downtrend and pH stabilizes.

Lab results may be normal or reveal slight electrolyte abnormalities at mild salicylate levels. PA pure respiratory alkalosis may be noted due to tachypnea. At moderate levels, metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis will be present. Leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia may be noted. Hypokalemia and hypercalcemia as well as an increased BUN, creatinine, and lactate levels can occur. Worsening of the metabolic acidosis with an anion gap occurs at severe toxicity.
