Clinical diagnosis of micropenis often occurs after a detailed history and physical examination. After making the diagnosis, further testing to identify associated abnormalities and possible etiologies are necessary.

Detailed maternal history is the first step in evaluation for micropenis. Consanguinity and family history of ambiguous genitalia make inherited conditions more likely on the differential. Inquiry about maternal medication use is important, as the use of anti-androgen medications (flutamide, testolactone, enzalutamide, and spironolactone) can interfere with the in-utero virilization.

Physical examination assessment is the most crucial part of micropenis evaluation. Underverlization associated with low blood pressure and tachycardia can indicate adrenal gland insufficiency related to rare forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Penile length accurate measurement is critical during the physical examination. The penis shaft should be maximally stretched. The distance is measured from the pubic symphysis (after pressing the suprapubic fat) to the tip of the glans (with the foreskin retracted as much as possible) dorsally. The average of multiple measurements can enhance accuracy.

Specific penile length less than two and a half standard deviations of the mean for the corresponding age confirm the diagnosis.

- Preterm infants born at 30 weeks of gestation; 1.5

- Preterm infants born at 34 weeks of gestation; 2

- Term infants; 2.5

- One-year-old; 2.6

- Five years old; 3.5

- Ten years old; 3.8

- Adults; 9.3

Careful and thorough palpation of the gonads is another step in micropenis evaluation to narrow the differential diagnosis. The appearance and the maturity of the scrotal sac, the presence and the location of the urethral meatus, the curvature of the penile shaft, and any dysmorphic features require careful evaluation.
