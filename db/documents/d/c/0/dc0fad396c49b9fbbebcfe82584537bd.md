**Indications for Treatment**

Most angiomyolipoma cases are asymptomatic and usually do not require treatment, but therapeutic interventions are required in the minority of cases.

In the past, the main indications for intervention were the presence of the symptoms, suspicion of malignancy, the presence of the tumor in women of childbearing age, and a size larger than 4 cm.

Recently, the historical 4 cm size threshold has been questioned. Some recent studies do not support the 4 cm size criterion because only 30% of renal angiomyolipomas larger than 4 cm were symptomatic.

Other studies revealed that using the 4 cm criterion as a predictor of hemorrhage has lower specificity than the tumoral aneurysm size of 5 mm.

This evidence suggests that the vascularity of the angiomyolipoma and the size of any related aneurysms are ultimately more significant than the tumor size alone.

Angiomyolipomas can be especially troubling during a pregnancy given the high levels of estrogen receptors in these lesions, which causes them to enlarge, and the relatively high rate of reported hemorrhage.

The European Association of Urology and the Canadian Best Practice Report recommend that the treatment of angiomyolipomas be considered and discussed with women of reproductive age who have been found to have these lesions.

If an angiomyolipoma is found in a pregnant lady, it should be managed similarly to other renal tumors, and the treatment should be highly individualized.

Currently, the European Association of Urology and the Canadian Urological Association recommend that intervention is required in well-selected cases and should consider the following criteria:

- Symptoms from the tumor(s) such as persistent pain

- Large lesions (>6 cm, formerly >4 cm)

- Multiple lesions

- Lesions that are enlarging >2.5 mm per year (>5 mm yearly is considered high risk)

- Intralesional aneurysms >5 mm

- Poor access to emergency care or follow-up

- Poor patient compliance

- Presence of a tumor in women of childbearing age

- High-risk occupations such as commercial airline pilots

- Female patients who must continue hormonal therapy

Possible interventions include medical treatment with mTOR inhibitors, thermal ablation (radiofrequency ablation and cryotherapy), selective renal artery embolization, and surgical excision (total nephrectomy, partial nephron-sparing surgery).

**Medical Treatment:**Hereditary renal angiomyolipomas (those associated with tuberous sclerosis and/or pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis) are caused by a mutation in theTSC1 or TSC2 genes resulting in unchecked activation of the mTOR pathway. This results in cell overgrowth and the formation of angiomyolipomas.

Medications that inhibit the mTOR pathway can interrupt tumor progression and promote the reversion of the existing lesions.

Sirolimus was the first mTOR inhibitor used to treat hereditary angiomyolipomas.

Everolimus (also an mTOR inhibitor) was approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating hereditary angiomyolipomas in the setting of tuberous sclerosis complex.

The use of everolimus in sporadic angiomyolipomas is more problematic. A 2020 phase II multi-institutional prospective trial reported good efficacy in patients who were given 4 to 6 cycles of monthly everolimus therapy based on response and tolerability. Over 50% of the patients demonstrated a reduction in tumor size of 25% or more, but almost 50% developed side effects or toxicities that required modification or discontinuation of therapy.

It is important to recognize that mTOR inhibitors are not risk-free and have many reported side effects.

**Thermal Ablation**

Thermal ablative therapy (radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, etc.) has been recommended by the American Urological Association Guidelines for small renal masses (<3 cm).

Specific selection depends on patient characteristics, tumor size, and specific location, as well as local experience and expertise. Thermal ablative therapy has the advantage of being able to perform simultaneous percutaneous renal biopsies and being effective regardless of the underlying nature of the tumor. This gives them a significant advantage over selective angiographic embolization, where the diagnosis has to be clear and definitive before treatment, although embolization remains the preferred minimally invasive procedure for angiomyolipomas. The most commonly used thermal ablative modalities include cryotherapy and radiofrequency ablation.

- **Cryotherapy**has been used very successfully in small numbers of angiomyolipoma patients, but there is insufficiently reported data to recommend its routine use.
- Cryotherapy has some unique advantages, which include minimal damage to surrounding renal tissue, a well-defined area of ablation, the ability to obtain a tissue biopsy during the same procedure, percutaneous accessibility, minimally invasive technology, and the delivery of definitive treatment to the mass regardless if it is eventually determined to be a benign or malignant lesion.
- In institutions that have experience with this modality, cryotherapy may be a very reasonable option, especially where arterial embolization has failed or is not technically feasible, as well as in situations where the absolute minimal loss of renal function is desired or there is some remaining doubt about the diagnosis. This would also include patients with pre-existing renal failure or extensive bilateral disease as an alternative to surgical resection.
- If renal cryoablation of the tumor is being considered, it would be best to include it within a clinical trial if possible. No data is yet available on the possible combination of angiographic embolization together with renal cryotherapy, but it might theoretically provide superior results for larger tumors.

- **Radiofrequency ablation**of angiomyolipomas has demonstrated minimal complications with good efficacy. This minimally invasive technique is most suitable for small-sized tumors which are asymptomatic but could also target large masses.
- Radiofrequency ablation targets the vascular and solid elements of the tumor mass without damaging normal renal tissue. The efficacy of radiofrequency ablation for renal angiomyolipomas has been assessed for small angiomyolipomas in relatively small series.
- In one study, 15 small renal angiomyolipomas were treated successfully with complete disappearance of tumoral enhancement on CT scan and a low complication rate (13.3%) at a mean follow-up of 21 months.
- Another study reported a reduction in tumor size from 4.5 cm to 2.9 cm after radiofrequency ablation of a sporadic angiomyolipoma in a patient with a solitary kidney without any complications or tumor recurrence at the 12-month follow-up.
- Four large angiomyolipomas were treated by radiofrequency ablation in another study, and no complications or hemorrhagic events were reported. This study also showed, during a follow-up of 48 months, a significant decrease in the mean soft-tissue-to-total tumor ratio, but the total tumor volume did not significantly change.
- CT scan guidance is required for tumors that cannot be easily and safely targeted by ultrasonography. Superselective renal artery embolization combined with radiofrequency ablation has produced excellent success rates in a small number of studies.

**Selective Renal Artery Embolization:**In the past, the main treatment for angiomyolipoma was surgical excision because tumor malignancy could not be excluded.

Selective renal artery embolization is the preferred procedural option reserving surgery and possibly thermal ablative therapies for patients with vascular malformations, uncontrollable symptoms, embolization failures, or diagnostic uncertainty.

When the surgical option is indicated, preoperative embolization of the tumor may be considered to reduce the complications and the difficulty of the operation.

Most of these side effects are related to a post-embolization syndrome characterized by flank pain, fever, vomiting, nausea, and leucocytosis during the first three days after the procedure.

These side effects are generally managed conservatively with standard supportive care. Prescribing antipyretics, antiemetics, and analgesia prophylactically could play a major role in minimizing and controlling these symptoms.

**Surgical Excision:**Total or****partial nephrectomy is the only treatment option that totally eradicates the entire renal mass.

Parenchymal preservation is especially important in patients with hereditary angiomyolipomas because of the higher recurrence rate, faster growth rate, and multifocal disease pattern.

Nephrectomy is usually indicated when the suspicion of malignancy is high and the renal mass is particularly large or when other treatment modalities cannot be performed.

Surgical excision has the advantage of a higher cure rate and the need for fewer follow-up procedures with reduced surveillance compared with arterial embolization.

**Active Surveillance and Follow-up**

Generally, active surveillance is used to monitor the ongoing progression of known tumors and the development of new ones when the diagnostic evaluations are completed and the indications for treatment are not present.

There are currently no definitive guidelines for sporadic angiomyolipomas regarding the frequency of imaging studies or which imaging modality should be used for that reason.

An annual repeat of imaging may be appropriate for small and solitary lesions.

For hereditary angiomyolipomas, the International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus highly recommends using the MRI yearly to monitor the condition because of its higher sensitivity in detecting adipose tissue.

Ultrasound is usually sufficient for monitoring with a CT scan or MRI if significant changes are found. With long-term follow-up, it is reasonable to avoid routine CT scanning to minimize radiation exposure.

**Treatment Summary**

- Most angiomyolipomas do not need any treatment.

- The need for treatment is based on current symptoms, size (>6 cm), growth >2.5 mm/yr, intratumoral aneurysms >5 mm, high-risk situations, and potential lack of access to healthcare.

- The least invasive treatment modality should be used whenever possible, which minimizes complications and loss of renal function.

- Everolimus has shown efficacy in controlling tumor growth and promoting shrinkage in hereditary angiomyolipomas. Its use in the more common sporadic angiomyolipomas is uncertain, but early studies suggest it can be effective.

- Thermal therapies such as radiofrequency ablation and cryotherapy allow percutaneous biopsies to be performed simultaneously and will be effective for both benign and malignant lesions. They should certainly be considered for smaller tumors (<3 cm) depending on local experience, expertise, and availability.

- Selective angiographic embolization is the treatment of choice for active bleeding and prophylaxis of high-risk angiomyolipomas. However, there is a high retreatment rate of 30%, and it requires a definitive diagnosis before treatment.

- Surgery is the most definitive, curative therapy reserved for situations that cannot be better managed with less invasive modalities. Nephron-sparing techniques are recommended.
