Colic affects around 20% of infants worldwide, although some studies suggest the prevalence may be significantly higher. A recent population-based survey in the United States suggested a prevalence rate of nearly 6%. These ranges in prevalence may reflect the previous lack of uniformity in defining colic. However, the recognition of colic also depends on the parental perception of crying intensity and duration. Parental wellbeing, as well as cultural differences in what is considered acceptable crying, may also affect these data. Regardless of the variability in prevalence, there is no association with gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, feeding preference or birth order.
