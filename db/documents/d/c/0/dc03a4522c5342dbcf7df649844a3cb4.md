Thrombosis can give rise to complications if improperly managed an initial presentation. One significant, well-studied complication is a post-thrombotic syndrome, which is a complication of deep venous thrombosis. Reports are that about 20 to 50% of deep vein thrombosis patients will develop this condition within 1 to 2 years after presentation.

Pulmonary hypertension is also another complication seen as a result of chronic thromboembolism in the pulmonary vasculature. Estimates are that 0.1 to 9% of patients with a history of pulmonary embolism develop the pulmonary vascular disease.

Arterial thrombosis can result in many complications, particularly concerning cardiac and cerebrovascular disease resulting in significant morbidity and disability and the risk of recurrent events in the absence of lifestyle modifications and medical management.

Another major complication associated with thrombosis is spontaneous hemorrhage (both intracranial and extracranial) that can result due to therapy with full-dose anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents.  Intracranial hemorrhage, when it occurs, is more devastating than extracranial. There are reports that the mortality of intracranial hemorrhage could be as high as 50% in patients using vitamin K antagonists (i.e., warfarin).
