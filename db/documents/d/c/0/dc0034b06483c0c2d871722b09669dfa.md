ICBN does not provide motor innervation for any muscles as it is a pure sensory nerve.

In its path, the nerve passes through several muscles, with the possibility of innervation: intercostal muscles,serratus anterior muscle. The nerve can rarely cross the pectoral muscles but without innervation, and even more rarely, a collateral branch could innervate the pectoralis major and minor muscles.

According to recent research, these nerves may also have motor branches, in particular for the pectoral muscles.
