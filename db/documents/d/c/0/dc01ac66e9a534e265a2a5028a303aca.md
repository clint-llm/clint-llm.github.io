Several molecules interact with the placenta. For example, leptin ensures the health of the placenta, thanks to its actions as a homeostatic agent, proliferation, and protein synthesis, as an anti-apoptotic molecule. In turn, leptin is under the control of other substances, such as insulin, many growth factors, human chorionic gonadotropin, steroids, and hypoxia.
