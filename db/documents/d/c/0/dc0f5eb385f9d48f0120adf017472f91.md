The hepatoduodenal ligament is a double-layered tubular structure composed of peritoneum that encloses the portal triad. The opening behind the free edge of the hepatoduodenal ligament is the omental foramen (foramen of Winslow), the only opening of the lesser sac, and the sole connection between the lesser sac and the greater peritoneal cavity.
