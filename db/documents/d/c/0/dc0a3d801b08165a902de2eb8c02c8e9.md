Histologic features of paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) include epidermal acantholysis and clefting, necrotic keratinocytes, vacuolization of the basal layer, and lymphocyte exocytosis.

Paraneoplastic pemphigus may mimic erythema multiforme both clinically and histologically, particularly if lesions are characterized by predominant interface dermatitis with necrotic keratinocytes. Therefore direct immunofluorescence and indirect immunofluorescence are imperative for correct diagnosis. Similarly, the characteristic suprabasal acantholysis and blister formation seen in paraneoplastic pemphigus are essentially identical to that observed in pemphigus vulgaris, although other vulgaris features are typically absent.

Histological findings of interface dermatitis, vacuolar changes, and dyskeratotic keratinocytes should raise suspicion for PNP, as these features are not present in classic pemphigus.
