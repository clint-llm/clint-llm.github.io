Surgical management of traumatic diaphragm injuries varies based on patient presentation, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, and the need for immediate surgical intervention. Early management of the trauma patient consists of a concise and rapid assessment to identify and address life-threatening injuries. Those patients presenting in hemorrhagic shock or with systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg are considered unstable and should receive immediate resuscitation as per Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines. Adjunctive procedures such as intubation or chest tube placement should be performed as indicated during the primary and secondary surveys. In an unstable patient, the chest x-ray is typically still performed but at the discretion of the trauma surgeon. As previously mentioned, signs of diaphragmatic injury may or may not exist on initial chest x-ray, but moreover, are often either missed or overlooked due to the severity of associated injuries or lack of supporting symptomology.

Amid instability, regardless of mechanism, patients should proceed immediately to the operating room, where an exploratory surgery is indicated to combat life-threatening injuries.

In the hemodynamically stable patient, surgical intervention is more obscure. The mechanism of injury plays a major role in the decision to perform surgery. According to McDonald et al.

Penetrating injuries are more commonly reported in the literature and usually present with minimal to no clinical signs, strengthening the argument to assess these wounds with laparoscopy as a standard approach. According to the Western Trauma Association, the controversy as to whether high-resolution MDCT is sufficient to detect diaphragm injuries has not been resolved. They support the findings in the literature, which suggest a 40% incidence of missed injury in the left thoracoabdominal region with penetrating thoracoabdominal wounds. They recommend diagnostic laparoscopy in these patients as the standard modality to further assess for TDI. This is further supported as a practice management guideline by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma.

The approach, be it open, laparoscopic, or thoracoscopic, demands a thorough examination of the diaphragm. In laparotomy, this necessitates takedown of the falciform ligament and potentially the associated liver attachments to palpate and visualize the posterior right side of the diaphragm. Regardless of the approach, once a TDI has been identified, the principles of repair remain the same. If herniated viscera exist, they must be reduced and carefully inspected to rule out hollow organ perforation or clinically significant ischemia.

Delayed diagnoses in missed TDIs follow the same concepts as the immediate repair, with a few exceptions. First, these patients have a progressive clinical course owing to pain, intermittent obstruction, strangulation, and in some cases, perforation. Addressing the potential contamination that accompanies these hernias is the same: debridement, irrigation, contamination control, and wide drainage. Second, the diaphragm tends to regress laterally over time. A missed injury is subject to an inability to reapproximate the tissue, primarily when repaired at a later date. These require non-absorbable prosthetic mesh placement to bridge the defect. In a delayed fashion, Petrone et al. recommend approaching these defects via thoracotomy to avoid inadvertent injury from potential associated intra-abdominal adhesions.
