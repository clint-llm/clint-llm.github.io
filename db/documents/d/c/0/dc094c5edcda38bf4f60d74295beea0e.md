There are two approaches to the treatment of Sandifer syndrome associated with GER, non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic. Sandifer syndrome resolves with GERD treatment. If the infant is gaining weight appropriately and developing well, nonpharmacologic interventions should be tried before the pharmacologic treatment.

The formula or expressed breast milk can be thickened with one teaspoon of rice cereal per ounce of formula to a maximum of 1 tablespoon per ounce. Parents should be counseled to avoid overfeeding and can decrease the volume of each feed. The importance of pacing in between feeds and keeping the infant in an upright position after every feed is a point of emphasis as an essential method to prevent GER. Some patients may require a change to a more elemental formula since one-third of the patients with GERD symptoms may have allergic esophagitis secondary to cow’s milk protein allergy (CPMA) as an underlying condition.

If all these lifestyle changes fail to improve GERD and, in turn, SS, pharmacologic treatment with anti-reflux medications should start. Proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers are first-line therapy. In most cases, the paroxysmal events will resolve or dramatically decrease in frequency over time; furthermore, the anemic status will improve soon after the control of GERD.
