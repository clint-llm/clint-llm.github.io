In the majority of hypertrichosis cases, men and women are equally affected, with a few exceptions. Prepubertal hypertrichosis is common in healthy, Mediterranean, or South Asian infants and children. Hypertrichosis of the auricle and hypertrichosis of the nasal tip,  types of hereditary hypertrichosis, primarily affect males.
