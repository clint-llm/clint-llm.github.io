It is crucial to make a correct and definite diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder that can be amenable to neuromodulation. Improper diagnosis can expose patients to incorrect treatment modalities. Differential diagnoses for psychiatric disorders include the following disorders, which can present with some psychiatric traits but can be corrected after treating the primary disease.

- Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder

- Autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis and lupus)

- Chronic fatigue syndrome

- Hypercortisolism (Cushing disease, Cushing syndrome)

- Diabetes

- Fibromyalgia

- Hypothyroidism

- Lyme disease

- Sleep disorders
