**PS**

Seizures are characterized as autonomic seizures and are the hallmark of this syndrome. While nausea and vomiting are the most common presentations, other presentations include pallor, mydriasis, thermoregulatory changes, cardiorespiratory changes, incontinence, hypersalivation, etc. Generalized status epilepticus is extremely uncommon.

This clinical condition is relatively difficult to diagnose and requires strong clinical suspicion and expertise. Due to the atypical presentations, diagnosis is often delayed, and the seizures are often misdiagnosed as non-epileptic seizures, migraines, vertiginous attacks, sleep disorders, etc.

**ICOE-G**

Seizures are characterized by visual symptoms and are the hallmark of this syndrome. The symptoms may include visual hallucinations, ictal blindness, orbital pain, headache, nausea, or vomiting. When symptoms spread beyond the occipital lobe, patients may exhibit focal sensory or motor symptoms. Seizures may be very frequent in some children and can be seen daily without treatment.

This clinical condition is often misdiagnosed as a migraine due to a similar presentation of visual symptoms and headaches.
