Lurasidone belongs to the benzisothiazole class. Although the mechanism of action of lurasidone is not fully understood, it is believed to affect both dopamine and serotonin receptors.

It is the blockage of D2 and 5-HT2A receptors that confers the property of atypical antipsychotic to lurasidone. Antagonism at the 5-HT7 receptor and partial agonism at the 5-HT1A contributes to the antidepressant properties of lurasidone.

Lurasidone has low activity on muscarinic M1, histamine H1, alpha-1, and 2A adrenergic receptors.
