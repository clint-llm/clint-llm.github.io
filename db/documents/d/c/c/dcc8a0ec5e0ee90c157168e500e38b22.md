Management of a patient with acute ischemic stroke requires a multidisciplinary effort, with multiple teams working at different levels and in coordination with each other. This requires efficient communication between teams. Code stroke should be initiated so that all teams are ready to deliver their responsibilities. For example, when the patient arrives in ED, physicians (ED physician, neurologist, anesthesiologist) should quickly assess the patient, stabilize them and send for a CT scan.

Meanwhile, nursing staff and technicians should be ready for the scan. If it is determined that the patient has an acute ischemic stroke and has no contraindications and is within the time frame of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator treatment, it should be administered. If not, then he should be taken to OR, avoiding any delay for mechanical thrombectomy.

The anesthesiologist should decide if he would require general anesthesia or conscious sedation depending on the clinical situation. Intraoperatively, care should be provided according to standard management protocols (AHA/ASA guidelines, SNACC recommendations), maintaining hemodynamic and metabolic parameters, providing adequate oxygenation and ventilation, all with an intent to salvage penumbra and limit neurological disability.
