To prevent a subsequent need for strabismus surgery, the extent of EOM injury during ocular and orbital emergencies is important to minimize, if not avoid. Patients with acquired strabismus from trauma suffer from diplopia and gaze disturbance, resulting in difficulties performing daily tasks. ApparentÂ ocular misalignment negatively impacts one's ability to secure a job.

Pre-operative counseling to include the possible need for future strabismus surgeries (apart from secondary surgeries related to complications from the globe or fracture repair) is vital. These patients often require long-term follow-up to address these complications.
