Multiple myeloma is simply a part of the spectrum of plasma cell proliferative disorders. This concept is restated on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, where the disease is divided into MGUS, smoldering myeloma (asymptomatic), or multiple myeloma (symptomatic), as well as reiterated elsewhere.

When concern for multiple myeloma arises, there are several approaches to screening and diagnosis.

The NCCN guidelines recommend the following diagnostic studies:

- Complete blood count (CBC) with differential, platelet count

- BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, albumin, calcium levels

- Serum LDH and beta-2 microglobulin

- Serum immunoglobulins, serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), serum immunofixation electrophoresis (SIFE)

- 24-hour proteinuria, urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), urine immunofixation electrophoresis (UIFE)

- Serum-free light chain (FLC) assay

- Whole Body low dose CT or PET CT

- Unilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, including immunohistochemistry and/or flow cytometry, and cytogenetics

- Plasma cell FISH [del 13, del 17p13, t(4;14), t(11;14), t(14;16), 1q21 amplification, 1p abnormality]

Historically, we have diagnosed MM if clonal bone marrow plasma cells were greater than or equal than 10% on bone marrow biopsy (or if a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma was present) in addition to at least one of the following CRAB criteria:

- Serum calcium level greater than 0.25 mmol/L (greater than 1 mg/dL) higher than the upper limit of normal or greater than 2.75 mmol/L (greater than 11 mg/dL)

- Renal insufficiency (creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL [greater than 177 micromol/L] or creatinine clearance less than 40 mL per minute)

- Anemia (hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL or hemoglobin greater than 2 g/dL below the lower limit of normal)

- One or more osteolytic bone lesions on skeletal radiography, CT, or PET-CT often described as punched-out, round, radiolucent lesions

While this set of criteria identified the majority of cases requiring treatment, many were missed. In November 2014, the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) identified other factors associated with an 80% higher risk of developing myeloma-related organ damage within two years.

- Bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) equal to 60%

- Involved/uninvolved serum free light chain ratio greater or equal to 100

- Abnormal MRI with more than one focal lesion, with each lesion greater than 5 mm that were often missed on previous skeletal surveys

Now, the presence of any CRAB criteria or any of these three additional criteria justifies diagnosis and therapy. It is certainly more sensitive and identifies more of the cases needing treatment. This new set of diagnostic criteria is often referred to as SLiM CRAB.
