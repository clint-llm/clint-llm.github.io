Mycobacteria can be difficult to detect by laboratory testing. The initial workup for most infections begins with a CBC, which can show a normal to elevated white blood cell count. Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can also be normal or elevated. Samples from fluid cultures obtained from soft tissue lesions or excised lymph nodes should undergo acid-fast or fluorochrome staining. Organisms are visualized in around 30% to 60% of cases. Culture of fluid and tissue samples should be obtained and yields an organism in approximately 65% of cases. 90% of patients diagnosed with a disseminated infection will have positive blood cultures. Unlike the growth of common bacteria on culture, rapidly growing mycobacteria will take approximately 1 week or more to grow, and slow-growing mycobacteria will take several weeks to months to show growth.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is frequently used on samples to obtain faster results and is more sensitive in diagnosis, yielding an organism around 91% of the time. Tuberculin skin testing can also be used as a nonspecific method to confirm suspected atypical mycobacterial infection. It will result in a greater than 10 mm area of induration between 30% to 60% of the time. Diagnosis of pulmonary infection is currently based on clinical suspicion of an active infection given active pulmonary symptoms, findings on chest X-ray or CT, and growth on 2 or more sputum cultures (also accepted is tissue biopsy or lavage cultures).
