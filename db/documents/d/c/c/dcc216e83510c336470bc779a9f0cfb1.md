Preventing, detecting, and managing significant occupational VCM exposure and its complications requires a multifaceted and integrated approach between occupational health (OH) and safety professionals, OH nurses, industrial hygienists, physicians, governmental agencies such as OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and private industry. In the US, the 1974 BF Goodrich plant HAS cases prompted further research and swift regulatory action leading to rapid compliance with a new, much more stringent occupational exposure limit. No further HAS cases have developed in workers exclusively exposed after the implementation of this standard.

Workers presenting with the symptoms or signs of hepatic dysfunction, or chronic systemic illness, should receive specialty evaluation by an occupational medicine physician or medical toxicologist for occupational exposure evaluation, as well as a hepatologist for the potential treatment of vinyl chloride-induced hepatic damage and HAS.

The stringent regulations have led to no new cases of HAS in the USA since 1975.

Given the rarity of VCM toxicity in the USA, toxicology professionals in the physician, nursing, and pharmacist disciplines need to be aware of the presentation should they come across a case, or if they encounter a patient from another country where the regulatory environment is not up to speed with the First World. Communication among these interprofessional toxicologists (physician, pharmacy, and nursing) is key, as would be the need to contact the appropriate regulatory authorities to prohibit further exposures and remove other workers from a potentially dangerous environment. Usually, cases such as this begin with contacting a poison control center that is staffed by an interprofessional team and then coordinating reporting with appropriate government agencies. Only through a collaborative interprofessional team approach can these rare cases be addressed and prevent recurrent events. [Level V]
