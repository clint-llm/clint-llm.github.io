A genetic connection to the development of Gardner syndrome has been shown within band 5q21, which is associated with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, located on chromosome 5, a tumor suppressor gene responsible for producing the APC protein that regulates cell growth via appropriate timing in the cell cycle. Gardner syndrome patients suffer from an aberration of this gene which leads to uncontrolled cell growth. In addition to such genetic mutations, a loss of DNA methylation, a mutation of the RAS gene on chromosome 12, a deletion of the colon cancer gene (DCC) on chromosome 18, as well as, a mutation in TP53 gene located on chromosome 17 have also been linked as a possible cause of Gardner syndrome.
