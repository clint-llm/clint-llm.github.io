Endothelial dysfunction is caused by other herpes viruses, including HSV, VZV, mumps, Epstein Barr virus (EBV). HSV endotheliitis may present with linear or diffuse small to medium-sized pigmented KPs, VZV-related endotheliitis has diffuse medium to large-sized mutton-fat KPs, and EBV may have diffuse corneal edema and multiple fine KPs.

Inflammatory glaucomatous conditions including hypertensive anterior uveitis, Fuch Uveitis syndrome, Posner-Schlossman syndrome, previously presumed to be idiopathic,Â have been strongly linked to viral etiologies, including CMV infection.

Corneal graft rejection in corneal transplantation patients: Differentiating CMV endotheliitis from corneal graft rejection remains challenging, especially with negative PCR analysis. Treatment for graft rejection may also reactivate latent CMV, exacerbate CMV endotheliitis, and worsen graft failure. Raised IOP, KPs, graft rejection not responding to steroid or unexplained sudden endothelial cell loss is more suggestive of CMV endotheliitis instead of allograft rejections.
