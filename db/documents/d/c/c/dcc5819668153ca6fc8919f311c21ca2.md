The femoral artery is one of the main arteries of the lower limb. The common access site to perform a cardiac catheterization would be the common femoral artery. The common femoral artery is an extension of the external iliac artery (a terminal branch of the abdominal aorta). The inguinal ligament demarcates the start of the common femoral artery. Below the inguinal ligament and within the femoral triangle, the femoral artery breaks into the superficial and deep femoral artery. As the superficial femoral artery makes its way within the adductor hiatus, it becomes the popliteal artery. The deep femoral artery immediately branches into the medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries.

Within the femoral triangle, the positioning of the femoral artery around other vessels is crucial. From lateral to medial, these structures are the femoral nerve, femoral artery, femoral vein, femoral canal, and the deep inguinal nodes. The femoral sheath encompasses the femoral artery and the femoral vein. This spacial relationship becomes important in complications that could occur during the insertion of a femoral artery closure device.
