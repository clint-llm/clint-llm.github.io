Cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) is infiltrative cardiomyopathy that results from granulomatous inflammation affecting the heart. It is a rare condition with a poor prognosis. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it would help to diagnose and treat patients diagnosed with the same promptly. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of CS and highlights the need for an inter-professional team to evaluate and manage patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the clinical manifestations of cardiac sarcoidosis.
- Describe the diagnostic criteria, typical histopathological and imaging findings for cardiac sarcoidosis.
- Summarize the management strategies for cardiac sarcoidosis.
- Explain the need for an interprofessional teamâ€™s approach for managing patients with cardiac sarcoidosis.
