An interprofessional approach to blow-out fracture is recommended.

Management is relevant from a number of surgical specialties, such as otolaryngological (ENT) surgery, plastic surgery, facial plastic surgery, ocular plastic surgery, and oral maxillofacial surgery.

- Ophthalmologist: All patients suspected of orbital fractures must see an ophthalmologist on presentation to the emergency department and before surgery

- Otolaryngologist and/or facial plastic surgeon and/or maxillofacial surgeon depending on the institutional practice.

- Nursing care is critical both during and after surgery. The patient should be pain-free and should be told to avoid blowing the nose. Nurses should monitor the patients in the ICU or the surgical floor, depending on the extent of the injury. At all times, the nurse should closely monitor the vitals, pupillary function, visual acuity, Glasgow coma score (GCS) score, and assess the patient for mental status changes. Any change in visual or mental status should be immediately reported to the surgeon.

Close communication with all the staff is vital to improve patient outcomes. The outcomes of most blow-out fractures are reasonable, but some patients may have altered eye function and cosmetic changes of the face.
