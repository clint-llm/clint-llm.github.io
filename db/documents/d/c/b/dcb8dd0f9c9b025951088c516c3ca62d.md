**Cystic Fibrosis**

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder affecting multiple organs. CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein cause it.

**Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder**

Recent studies hypothesize that secretin can be used to treat autism and pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, researchers gave a single dose of IV porcine secretin to participants. The study resulted in improved language and behavior in children with these disorders and chronic diarrhea. Children with chronic, active diarrhea showed a reduction in abnormal behaviors when treated with secretin.
