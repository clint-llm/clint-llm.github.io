If the tests of peripheral sensations such as light touch, pain, temperature, and vibration are normal, the cortical sensory function can be assessed.

In the assessment for stereognosis, an object such as a coin, pencil, scissor, cup, glass, comb, or sponge is placed in the hands of the patient for 30 seconds. The patient is asked to identify by naming or description. The score is given as 2 for normalcy, 1 for impairment (identification of some features of the object), and 0 for absence. The Nottingham method of stereognosis assessment is found to be a reliable tool between raters, in patients that have had a stroke.

The sensory deficits in cortical sensory syndrome are loss of position sense, inability to localize noxious stimulus, astereognosis, agraphesthesia, and loss of two-point discrimination. This is seen contralaterally in either parietal lobe disease along with hemiparesis, hemianopia, hemineglect, and loss of optokinetic nystagmus. Additional features in the involvement of the dominant parietal lobe will be aphasia, ideomotor apraxia, and Gerstmann syndrome consisting of agraphia without alexia, left-right confusion, digit agnosia, and acalculia.
