If there is clinical suspicion of a child having cystic fibrosis from newborn genetic screening, or if clinically suspected by a healthcare provider, a sweat test should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. The sweat test is considered to be the gold standard for diagnosing CF and used in conjunction with clinical findings and family history to make the diagnosis. Cystic fibrosis is a  lifelong condition with many healthcare ramifications. Given the evolving therapies for patients with cystic fibrosis, early diagnosis is vital to ensure prompt therapeutic intervention and clinical monitoring. Patients with cystic fibrosis are living longer lives than ever before, with the median age of survival being greater than 40 years in developed countries. Children with diagnosis later in life likely to have better outcome given the likelihood of residual CFTR function and a less severe phenotype.
