- Dysbarism includes medical conditions resulting from changes in ambient pressure; they include barotrauma, nitrogen narcosis, high-pressure neurological syndrome, and decompression illness.

- Dysbarism occurs most commonly in the setting of scuba diving.

- Middle ear barotrauma is the most common complaint of divers.

- Most barotraumas only require supportive care.

- Avoid diving with nasal or sinus congestion or other URI symptoms to avoid “squeeze” injuries

- HPNS symptoms can be diminished or prevented by switching to a gas mixture including hydrogen or nitrogen

- Nitrogen narcosis rapidly improves with ascent

- In diving, “squeeze” barotraumas occur during descent; AGE and DCS occur on or after ascent.

- AGE symptoms appear immediately upon resurfacing; DCS symptoms are usually delayed by hours.

- The presentation of symptoms for DCI often is vague and delayed. Therefore, it is important to have a low threshold for treatment.

- In emergencies, start the patient on high-flow 100% oxygen immediately and contact the closest HBO center.
