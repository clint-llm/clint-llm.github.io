Eczema herpeticum is a potentially life-threatening disease with mortality risk due to complications of systemic viremia, bacteremia, and fungal infection leading to multi-organ failure.

A 2011 study of 1331 hospitalized pediatric EH patients in the United States found no deaths and concluded that the mortality rate of hospitalized patients is low.Â The median length of hospital stay was three days, with 9.2% of patients requiring hospitalization longer than one week, and 3.8% required ICU admission.
