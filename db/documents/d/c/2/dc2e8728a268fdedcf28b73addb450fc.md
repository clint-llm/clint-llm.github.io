The most prevalent toxicities appear below, as reported by several case studies and medication trials.

- Cardiomyopathy/cardiotoxicity: The incidence of myocardial damage from doxorubicin ranges from 1% to 20%, with dosages above 300 mg/m2. LVEF is important to monitor before, during, and after doxorubicin treatment.

- Secondary malignancies: Although used to treat various malignancies and tumors, doxorubicin and other anthracyclines are known for causing secondary malignancies such as acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

- Tissue necrosis: doxorubicin extravasation can cause severe tissue death and necrosis requiring excision and grafting of the skin. It is important to monitor during intravenous injection or infusion of the agent.

- Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic failure is a strong contraindication to the use of doxorubicin. Trending total bilirubin concentrations and monitoring liver enzyme concentrations is essential.

- Myelosuppression: As with other anthracyclines, doxorubicin is known for causing severe myelosuppression requiring routine monitoring of white blood counts, hemoglobin, and platelets as myelosuppression predisposes to infections, sepsis, hospitalizations, or even death.

**Toxicity Prevention**

- Several pharmacological agents have been used and studied to prevent and/or decrease cardiotoxicity in patients receiving anthracyclines, including dexrazoxane, beta-blockers, angiotensin antagonists, statins coenzyme Q-10, and N-acetylcysteine. Most notable studies have taken place testing beta-blockers and dexrazoxane.

- In one randomized study of 25 patients, carvedilol was not better than a placebo at preventing systolic and diastolic heart failure in patients taking anthracyclines.

- Dexrazoxane is a prodrug and potent reversible inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase II, which may decrease topoisomerase II binding by doxorubicin and thus decrease the cytotoxicity of healthy cells. Dexrazoxane is an iron chelator (structurally similar to EDTA) that is thought to decrease free radicals generated by doxorubicin.

- A retrospective study found that dexrazoxane did not significantly affect the mean LVEF after anthracycline administration (56% with dexrazoxane vs. 53% without), but while the authors concluded that it decreased the rate of cardiac events, defined as a reduction of LVEF more than 10%, it is difficult to reconcile that conclusion of this retrospective analysis with the fact that the mean LVEF between the two groups was not different.

- In a meta-analysis reviewing 16 trials, including 1918 patients: dexrazoxane reduced cardiotoxicity after anthracycline treatment by 33%. It specifically decreased heart failure by 58% compared to other agents, including beta-blockers, statins, coenzyme Q-10, and N-acetylcysteine. However, the study determined dexrazoxane did not affect the response rate of malignancies or the risk of death.

- Further studies are in process and have begun to attract attention to minimize the cardiotoxicity risk of doxorubicin.
