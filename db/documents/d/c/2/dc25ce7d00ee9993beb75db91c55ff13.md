# Continuing Education Activity

Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute, self-limited medium vessel vasculitis that has a predilection for the coronary arteries. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of Kawasaki disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of Kawasaki disease. 
- Outline the evaluation of Kawasaki disease using the CREAM and FEBRILE mnemonics. 
- Review the treatment considerations for patients with Kawasaki disease.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to enhance delivery of care for patients affected by Kawasaki disease.

# Introduction

Kawasaki disease (KD), also known by the name mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, is an acute, self-limited medium vessel vasculitis that has a predilection for the coronary arteries.

# Etiology

The etiology of Kawasaki disease (KD) is still not known and may be related to a wind-borne or water-borne pathogen.  However, in recent years there have been studies that have shown certain genetic markers (such as HLA-B51 and HLA-Bw22j2 serotypes, chemokine receptor gene-cluster CCR2-CCR5 haplotypes and FCGR3A polymorphism of the IgG receptor IIIa) show a predisposition to the disease.  In fact, siblings are 10-20 times more likely to develop the disease when compared to the general population.

# Epidemiology

This disease is most common in children younger than five years of age, but it can present at any age, even in adults.

# Pathophysiology

An agent, most likely infectious, enters via the respiratory tract and starts a response that activates lymphocytes, cytokines, and proteinases, specifically tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), Interleukin 1, 4 and 6 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP3 and MMP9)

# Histopathology

A biopsy is rarely performed and is not necessary to make a diagnosis.  Findings early in the disease show destruction of the media of vessels by neutrophils.

# History and Physical

These children will present with multiple days of fever and generalized malaise. On physical exam, one will often find one or more of the diagnostic criteria listed below. It is important to get a full history because meeting any of the diagnostic criteria at any point during the illness count toward the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease, even if not present at the time of evaluation.  There are three principal stages of the disease process: acute, subacute, and convalescent.

A variety of less common manifestations include abdominal pain, vomiting or diarrhea in 20%; hepatitis; parotitis; intussusception; joint pain in between 15-50%, especially the larger weight-bearing joints

In 2014, the American Heart Association (AHA) published the criteria needed to establish a diagnosis.must have fevers for five or more days, with at least four of the following criteria (either all at once or over a series of days):

- Bilateral painless bulbar conjunctival injection without exudate

- Erythematous mouth and pharynx, strawberry tongue or red, cracked lips

- Polymorphous exanthem (morbilliform, maculopapular, or scarlatiniform)

- Swelling of hands and feet with erythema of the palms and soles

- Cervical lymphadenopathy (over 1.5 cm in diameter)

Patients will typically have a patchy generalized macular erythematous rash over the trunk and extremities that appears within 5 days of the fever, and mocks a viral exanthem or drug eruption, but will lack pruritus.

# Evaluation

The diagnosis of Kawasaki disease is clinical.  You can use the mnemonic "Warm CREAM" or "FEBRILE" to help remember the criteria (see Table).  The fever is the most consistent presentation, is minimally responsive to antipyretics, and typically remains higher than 38.5 degrees Celsius.

**Table: Warm CREAM and FEBRILE Mnemonics for KD Criteria**

Warm = Fever for > 5 days

- C = Conjunctivitis without exudate

- R = Rash

- E = Edema or erythema of hands or feet, followed by desquamation and nail changes

- A = Adenopathy, often unilateral, cervical node > 1.5 cm

- M = Mucosal erythema, fissures or crusting of lips or strawberry tongue

- F = Fever for > 5 days

- E = Enanthem of mucosal membranes

- B = Bulbar conjunctivitis

- R = Rash, erythematous, polymorphous

- I = Internal organ involvement: coronary, abdominal, pneumonitis, hepatitis, orchitis

- E = Extremity changes, initial edema, and erythema, desquamation, nail changes

Incomplete Kawasaki disease should be a consideration in children with fevers of five or more days and two or three of the major criteria.  It is more common in younger infants and older children.

- Hemoglobin low for age

- White blood count (WBC) > 15,000/mm

- Platelet count > 450,000/mm

- Serum albumin < 3.0 g/dl

- Elevated alanine aminotransferase

- Urine WBC > 10/high-power field

There are no other required laboratory or diagnostic imaging studies necessary after a clinical diagnosis of KD, except an echocardiogram.  However, some studies may be useful in the case of incomplete disease in an attempt to help narrow the diagnosis when not meeting all of the clinical criteria.  Suggested studies include complete blood count (CBC), metabolic panel, ESR, CRP, and urinalysis.  Mild-moderate normocytic anemia is characteristic of the acute disease phase, while thrombocytosis is present in the subacute phase.

If obtained, blood cultures, stool cultures, antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titers would be negative in KD cases.

An echocardiogram should be performed during the acute phase of the disease to rule out coronary artery aneurysm (CAA).  The proximal left anterior descending and right coronary arteries are most commonly affected.

Cardiac stress testing for reversible ischemia has been recommended as Level A for children with KD and known CAAs.

# Treatment / Management

Treatment aims with Kawasaki disease point to minimize the risk of coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) formation, which peaks two to four weeks after illness onset, by decreasing the inflammation of the coronary arteries.

If the patient is still febrile 36 to 48 hours after the first IVIG dose, then the dose should be repeated once.

Corticosteroids have been proposed as part of the initial therapy (in addition to IVIG and ASA) due to findings of decreased risk of developing cardiac abnormalities. However, research results have been inconsistent  The RAISE trial published in 2012 reintroduced the idea of using extended doses of prednisolone (2mg/kg/day for 4 to 5 weeks) in patients with KD who were at high risk for being resistant to IVIG therapy.

Some have proposed statins for KD due to their immunomodulating properties; however, there is not enough research at this time to suggest their use; the theory is that their ability to target endothelial dysfunction would make them of use during the acute phase to help prevent and/or modify vessel changes.

Patients who develop severe perfusion deficits from an aneurysm may require coronary artery bypass graft surgery and should be a consideration in children who have reversible ischemia or patients that have recurrent MIs.

Long-term management starts after the acute illness has passed, typically 5-6 weeks after the initial onset of the fever; this is typically when coronary artery involvement has reached its peak in severity.  The frequency of follow-up, medication, and repeat images are on a patient by patient basis and their disease severity.

# Differential Diagnosis

Various infections can mimic Kawasaki Disease including:

- Preseptal cellulitis

- Peritonsillar abscess

- Retropharyngeal Abscess

- Cervical lymphadenitis

- Group A streptococcal infection

- Adenovirus, Enterovirus, Parvovirus B19

- Measles

- Mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus)

- Scarlet Fever

- Rheumatic fever

- Toxic Shock Syndrome

- Meningitis

- Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever

- Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS)

- Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)

- Lyme disease

- Leptospirosis

Both KD and adenovirus present with conjunctival injection, however, the important differentiation is that adenovirus causes conjunctival exudates and KD does not.

Kawasaki disease' presentation also overlaps with other immunologic reactions such as multiple drug hypersensitivity reactions, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, infantile polyarteritis nodosa, and systemic lupus erythematosus. These can be differentiated from KD by the absence of classic clinical criteria and by chronicity and the number of joints affected.

# Pertinent Studies and Ongoing Trials

There are several clinical trials regarding the treatment of Kawasaki disease including the use of infliximab, etanercept, and anakinra. Infliximab has been found to decrease inflammatory markers (TNF) and downregulate macrophages in patients with IVIG resistant KD, and patients had a quicker resolution of fever but similar cardiac outcomes.

# Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the severity of cardiac disease.  Additionally, the prognosis is better for children diagnosed between age 6 months to 9 years than those younger or older, perhaps because they are diagnosed earlier after presenting with classic findings.

# Complications

The disease can lead to aneurysm formation, heart failure, MI, myocarditis, valvulitis, pericarditis with pericardial effusion, and rupture of the coronary arteries leading to hemopericardium and sudden death.

- Fever >8 days (most important risk factor)

- Recurrence of fever after a period of being afebrile for 48 hours

- Male (3 times more likely to develop giant aneurysms)

- Cardiomegaly

- <1 year old of age

- Asian or Pacific Islander descent

- Hispanic ethnicity

- Lower IgG levels

- Increased pro-BNP levels

- Increased TNF-alpha levels

- Thrombocytopenia at initial presentation

- Incomplete Kawasaki Disease Diagnosis

Aneurysms are defined as vessel diameter >3mm in children younger than 5 years old and >4mm in children older than 5 years.

In those who aneurysms resolve, there will be significant thickening of the vessel leading to an increased risk of premature coronary atherosclerotic disease.

# Pearls and Other Issues

If KD is on your differential, order the echocardiogram; missing a diagnosis or diagnosing the disease late can be catastrophic.

If considering incomplete KD, order ESR, CRP, CBC, serum albumin and alanine aminotransferase and urinalysis.

Missed diagnosis is often due to vague initial presentation, typically with fever and enlarged unilateral lymph nodes.  The following rash and mucosal changes may be mistakenly blamed on a reaction to the antibiotics for presumed bacterial infection.

Children with Kawasaki disease should get an echocardiogram at the time of diagnosis, two weeks after symptom onset, and again at eight weeks after the diagnosis.  AHA recommends repeating an echocardiogram 10 to 14 days after the initial one and 4 to 6 weeks after all laboratory data have normalized.

The goal of treatment is the prevention of cardiac complications.  Therefore, all patients diagnosed with Kawasaki disease should receive IVIG and aspirin.

Many children get lost to long-term follow-up as an adult leading to severe cardiac complications.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Kawasaki disease is a rare disorder, but because of its serious effects on the coronaries, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team. Once a child is suspected of having Kawasaki disease, the patient should be referred promptly to a cardiologist.

A cardiologist should be consulted to determine the initial and schedule of following echocardiogram studies, anticoagulation management, to determine if coronary artery angiography is necessary and for long-term follow-up and monitoring.  Other specialists to consider, include an infectious disease specialist, rheumatologist, or dermatologist. Following treatment, the short-term prognosis is good, but the long-term prognosis remains unknown primarily because many children are lost to followup.
