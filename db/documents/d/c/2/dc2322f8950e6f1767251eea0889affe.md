An interprofessional team is useful in the management of PR. It can include primary care providers, cardiologists, cardiology nurses, and pharmacists. PR may worsen with time, and hence patients (with moderate to severe disease) should be monitored at least with annual visits. Assessing the exercise capacity during each visit will help the clinician estimate the need and timing for surgical repair. Primary care providers often are the first to diagnose the condition and refer to the cardiologist. Cardiology nurses monitor and educate patients and their families. The nurses arrange to follow up and report changes in status to the team. Pharmacists review medication choices, dosage, and potential interactions. They stress compliance and educate patients about possible side effects. These interprofessional collaborative efforts will lead to improved outcomes in patients with pulmonic regurgitation. [Level 5]
