Traditional medical education has focused on the development of knowledge through didactic lectures. This concept has been seen to be extremely inadequate in developing the skills of medical practitioners, especially in times of emergencies and disasters. Traditional methods are now complemented with simulation-based training to develop the communication and co-ordination between multi-disciplinary teams. Additionally, simulation-based training increases the skills as well as knowledge retention of participants. This approach ensures better decision making by the medical teams in times of extreme duress, leading to better performances by the medical personnel, ultimately translating into better patient outcomes.
