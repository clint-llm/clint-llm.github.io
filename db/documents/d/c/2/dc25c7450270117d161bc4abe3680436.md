Fahr disease is most commonly found to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete and age-related penetrance, but it may also be transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait or occur sporadically. Some studies have reported the phenomenon of anticipation in this disease.

There are four genes which have been implicated as the molecular basis of Fahr disease i.e., loss of function mutation in the gene SLC20A2 encoding type 3 sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 2 (PiT2) on chromosome 8p (40%), a mutation in gene XPR1 that encodes for a retroviral receptor with phosphate export function on chromosome 1q (2%), a mutation in the gene which encodes the receptor for members of the platelet-derived growth factor family- gene PDGFRB on chromosome 5q (2%), and gene PDGFB on chromosome 22q (11%). 46% of cases have some unknown gene mutations. Other loci that have been linked to Fahr disease include IBGC1 locus at chromosome 14q, a locus at chromosome 2q, and another one at chromosome 8.

Since, some genes have been implicated in Fahr disease, the term idiopathic basal ganglia calcification, used previously, should be avoided.
