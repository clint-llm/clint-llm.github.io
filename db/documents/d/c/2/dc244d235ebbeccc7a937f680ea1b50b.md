The role of a radiology technologist is exceptionally important in helping the operator during the procedure. Patient comfort is critical in properly performing the procedure as significant patient movement can affect satisfactory targeting through the rotator cuff interval. Movement can also affect needle trajectory with an injury of the subscapularis, supraspinatus, or biceps tendon. The technologist plays an important role in assisting in fluoroscopic image acquisition. Documentation of immediate pain relief is important for the referring provider, as this can help manage treatment.
