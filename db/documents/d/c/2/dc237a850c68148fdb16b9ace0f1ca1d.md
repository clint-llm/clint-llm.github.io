Viscerosomatic reflexes produce somatic findings (such as referred pain or segmentally-related tissue texture changes) that can help direct a physician to a specific focus of visceral dysfunction. They may also assist the examining physician in narrowing the differential diagnosis when the clinical picture is unclear. When coupled with a thorough history and physical, medication reconciliation, and consideration of environmental factors (viz. common masqueraders such as tight clothing or a sunburn), somatic dysfunction can expose occult visceral dysfunction. For example, a middle-aged male with a history of primary hyperparathyroidism may present with hypertonicity in the paraspinal musculature from T10 to T11, a tender Chapman’s point one inch superiorly and one inch to the left of the umbilicus, and a complaint of waxing and waning lower back pain that radiates into his groin. The chief complaint alone is suggestive of nephrolithiasis; the presence of segmentally-related tissue texture changes, and a Chapman’s point further supports an illness script that illustrates renal pathology.

An important clinical consequence of central sensitization is hyperalgesia. Abnormal and/or steady visceral and somatic sensory input sensitize the interneurons of the dorsal horn and lower their excitation threshold as they contemporaneously lower the threshold of the receptive fields of related somatic structures. Due to the hyperexcitability of the convergent nerves within the spinal cord and the local sensory receptors, less irritation to the somatic structure is required to potentiate an action potential through the sensory pathways, ultimately resulting in increased sensitivity to pain. Another postulate is that the increased contraction of the segmentally-related musculature due to exaggerated motor output results in some peripheral sensitization at the nociceptors within the muscles themselves.

Osteopathic physicians employ manipulative therapy to attenuate sympathetic nervous system activity - and therefore visceral dysfunction - via networks of somatovisceral reflexes. Paraspinal inhibition, rib raising, and soft tissue manipulation to areas of hypertonicity can directly influence the underlying sympathetic nerves and associated visceral structures.
