The determination of clinical phenotype is by location and the degree of occlusion. SCI has a wide spectrum of severity; symptoms can range from minor weakness to paraparesis. Symptoms can be abrupt in onset and progress rapidly over minutes to hours.

ASA involvement can manifest abruptly as symmetric motor dysfunction, bilateral spinothalamic sensory deficit below the level of the lesion, autonomic sphincter dysfunction including sphincter flaccidity, atonic bladder, and paralytic ileus, flaccid weakness associated with areflexia, and sudden back pain,

Brown-Sequard syndrome

Symptoms include unilateral flaccid weakness ipsilateral to and below the lesion, along with a contralateral absence of spinothalamic sensation with sparing of the posterior column sensory modalities (sulcocommissural artery occlusion).
