There is a significant overlap between the risk factors accounting for cardiovascular events and cerebrovascular events. The INTERHEART study looked at nearly 30,000 patients divided into control and interventional groups to identify these risk factors. Stroke prevention follows a similar principle of controlling these risk factors. Risk factors important in stroke prevention can be divided into non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors. In most cases, the patient has a combination of modifiable risk factors, i.e., hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol. This activity reviews stroke prevention and discusses the role of the interprofessional team in educating patients to lower their risks by modifying behaviors that may reduce the incidence of a stroke.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the non-modifiable risk factors for stroke.
- Review the modifiable risk factors for stroke.
- Outline the educational topics that should be addressed in educating patients regarding stroke risks.
- Summarize the role of the interprofessional team in educating patients to lower their risks by modifying behaviors that may reduce the incidence of a stroke.
