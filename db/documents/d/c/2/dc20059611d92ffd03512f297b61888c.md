Piezogenic papules do not appear to have a hereditary transmission in the vast majority of cases. No direct link has been found to a specific connective tissue defect or condition. It should be noted that the literature has noted an anecdotal association in groups of patients with both Ehlers–Danlos syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome, presumably due to weakness in collagen, although no specific mechanism has been proven.

Several risk factors have been identified, although, once again, no direct cause has been established. At-risk individuals include patients who are obese, those who have pes planus, and people who have occupations that require long periods of standing. It is frequently found in athletes such as figure skaters or those participating in long-distance running or high-impact sports.
