Normal distribution of technetium 99m sestamibi (the most commonly used radiopharmaceutical for scintimammography) is in the salivary glands, thyroid, myocardium, liver, and gallbladder.

Any uptake of radiopharmaceutical greater than the average breast parenchyma is suspicious for malignancy. If the breast demonstrates mild, homogenous uptake of the radiopharmaceutical, it is considered a normal study. Patchy, widespread uptake likely is not indicative of malignancy. Evaluation of the axilla is important for interpreting potential metastasis to axillary lymph nodes in the presence of an ipsilateral focal area of increased uptake suggesting primary malignancy. Axillary folds will demonstrate increased uptake as an artifact and should be considered normal but can be a pitfall, and lateral imaging should be used to identify its superficial location and linear appearance.
