Seroma is the abnormal accumulation of serous fluid in a dead space containing plasma and lymphatic fluid. It is a common postoperative complication, particularly in breast cancer and plastic surgery. They are a potential source of pain and anxiety for patients in the postoperative period and can lead to further complications such as infection or wound dehiscence. Current research trends focus on postoperative prevention; however, repeated aspiration remains the mainstay of postoperative seroma management once this fluid collection develops. This activity reviews the postoperative evaluation and management of seromas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of seroma formation.
- Review the treatment considerations for patients with a post-operative seroma.
- Outline the technique of seroma aspiration.
- Describe the role of the interprofessional team in the post-operative management of seroma in improving patient care and outcomes.
