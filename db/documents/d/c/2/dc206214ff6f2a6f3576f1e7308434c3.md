The liver, gallbladder, and biliary system arise from a ventral proliferation of endoderm that grows into mesoderm from the caudal part of the foregut. This outgrowth happens in the fourth week of embryonic growth and is called the hepatic diverticulum or liver bud. The endoderm of the liver bud differentiates into hepatocytes while mesoderm becomes a connective tissue and blood vessels. It is important to remember the liver has a hematopoietic role throughout the fetal period.
