For adults, although central nervous system oxygen toxicity may lead to incidental injury, studies show that with the removal of the inciting agent no long term neurological damage occurs

For infants, those who have survived following an incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia will ultimately recover near-normal lung function, since lungs continue to grow during the first 5–7 years.  Nevertheless, they are likely to be more vulnerable to respiratory infections for the rest of their lives, and the harshness of later infections is often greater than that in their peers

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants frequently reverses without intervention and eyesight may be normal in later years. When the disease has advanced to the stages requiring surgery, the results are generally good for the treatment of stage 3 ROP, but are much worse for the later stages. Although surgery is usually successful in restoring the anatomy of the eye, damage to the nervous system by the progression of the disease leads to comparatively poorer results in restoring vision. The presence of other complicating diseases also reduces the likelihood of a favourable outcome
