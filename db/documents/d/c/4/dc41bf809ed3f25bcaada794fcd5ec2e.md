In a case of optic atrophy, a number of investigations can be tailored according to the suspected etiology of the condition.

- Visual field tests should be done whenever possible to help in diagnosis as well as follow-up of the patientâ€™s condition. The 30-2 program is most useful in the investigation of optic atrophy. Visual field changes can include enlargement of the blind spot and paracentral scotoma, altitudinal defects (as seen in AION and optic neuritis), and bitemporal defects (seen in compressive lesions, similar to optic chiasma tumors).

- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with contrast is useful in the diagnosis and should be done in all patients with optic atrophy, if possible. Imaging techniques may demonstrate space-occupying lesions, sinusitis, hyperpneumatized sinuses, fibrous dysplasia, and fractures.

- On MRI images, multiple sclerosis plaques are typically seen located in the infratentorial region, in the deep white matter, periventricular, juxtacortical, or mixed white matter-grey matter lesions. The lesions appear iso- or hypointense on T1 images (T1 black holes), while, on T2 images, they are hyperintense. FLAIR sequence also shows hyperintense lesions. Other sequences, such as T1-weighted post-contrast (gadolinium), MR spectroscopy, and Double-inversion recovery (DIR), can also be used.

- In suspected fractures, a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan is preferable.

- Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be done to demonstrate the thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer.

- Ultrasonography (B-scan) is recommended for orbital tumors. B-scan in papilledema may demonstrate nerve sheath dilatation.

- Blood glucose level: Useful for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus as well as before initiating steroid therapy as the baseline.

- Blood pressure, cardiovascular examination: To look for vascular causes.

- Carotid Doppler ultrasound study: Carotid occlusion may need to be ruled out in selected cases.

- Vitamin B-12 levels: Nutritional causes of optic atrophy need to be ruled out when suggestive. However, a nutritional etiology may be obvious from history and systemic examination.

- Laboratory tests may be required when indicated. These investigations include Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL)/Treponema pallidum hemagglutination (TPHA) tests, Antinuclear antibody levels, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme assay, Homocysteine levels, Antiphospholipid antibodies, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus (TORCH panel).

- Electroretinography (ERG) results may show abnormalities such as:

- Subnormal: Potential less than 0.08 microvolts, seen in toxic neuropathy.
- Negative: When a large a-wave is seen, it may be due to giant cell arteritis, central retinal artery occlusion, or central retinal vein occlusion.
- Extinguished: The response seen in complete optic atrophy.

- Visually evoked response (VER)/ Visually evoked potential (VEP): In optic neuritis, VER/VEP has increased latency period and decreased amplitude when compared to the normal eye. Compressive optic lesions tend to reduce the amplitude of VER/VEP while producing a minimal shift in the latency.

- Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA): It can be performed in cases of retino-choroiditis, diabetic retinopathy to look for areas of capillary drop-out, neovascularization, and other defects. In optic disc drusen, FFA shows fundus autofluorescence.
