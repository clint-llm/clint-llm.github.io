The most common eyelid skin cancer is basal cell carcinoma (BCC), which occurs more commonly on the lower eyelid. Eyelid cancer can be treated with carcinoma excision with frozen section control of the tissue margins, or alongside a Mohs surgeon to excise the lesion. Becuase of resection, lower eyelid reconstruction is a common problem faced in ophthalmic plastic surgery. Other types of cancers and trauma may also lead to lower eyelid defects. There are various techniques available for lower eyelid reconstruction, and these depend on the of the size of the defect as well as patient-specific factors.
