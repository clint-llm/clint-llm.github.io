A pure bacterial culture remains essential for the study of its virulence, its antibiotic susceptibility, and its genome sequence in order to facilitate the understanding and treatment of caused diseases. Bacterial cultures are still widely used laboratory techniques that many physicians rely on to make their final diagnoses. Many health care professionals are involved in this process, and proper communication and coordination will enhance patient-centered care, improve outcomes, patient safety, and enhance team performance. Bacterial culture from a patient's specimen is a commonly ordered test that many physicians use to aid their medical decision-making process. Nurses are frequently involved in obtaining and transporting samples from the patient to the laboratory. Clinical microbiologists must be trained with a thorough understanding of the principles to run the tests, interpret the results, and report the findings. Sterile sampling techniques and proper handling of the specimen during handling and transport of samples are required to avoid contamination. Any healthcare professionals handling these patient samples must be adequately trained in order to avoid contamination of the samples or accidental exposure and spread of potential pathogens.
