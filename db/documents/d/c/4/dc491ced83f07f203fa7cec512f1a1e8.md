For a patient with a suspected V. parahaemolyticus infection, the diagnostic method of choice is obtaining a stool culture. It is best to choose a selective medium for culture. V. parahaemolyticus grows particularly well on Thiosulfate Citrate Bile-salts Sucrose (TCBS). The bacteria can also demonstrate hemolysis as well as urease positivity. The provider should contact the laboratory and discuss suspicion for V. parahaemolyticus as this can help the lab utilize specialized techniques that can enhance the chance for successful growth. If there is suspicion of septicemia or wound infection, blood and wound cultures can also be obtained.
