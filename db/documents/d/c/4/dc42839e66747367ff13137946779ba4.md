A thorough understanding of the lower eyelid anatomy and the effect of the aging process on the periorbital regions helps surgeons preoperatively assess the laxity of the lower eyelid and plan the appropriate surgical technique to decrease the chances of lower eyelid malposition. This evaluation may need an interaction between different specialties, especially in complex cases such as facial palsy, dry eye syndrome, or thyroid eye disease. This can be done through interprofessional communication between a facial plastic surgeon, an ophthalmologist, and an endocrinologist if needed. This holistic and integrated approach optimizes the preoperative assessment of these cases. [Level5]
