Motor nerve fibers, like those found in the brachial plexus, arise from cells within the basal plate of the developing spinal cord and emerge to the ventral nerve root. The sensory nerve fibers found in the dorsal nerve root originate from neural crest cells. The dorsal nerve root will grow toward the ventral nerve root and will eventually join to form a spinal nerve. Spinal nerves will divide into dorsal primary rami and ventral primary rami. As the limb bud develops, nerves will elongate and grow into the limb in dermatomal and myotomal distributions.
