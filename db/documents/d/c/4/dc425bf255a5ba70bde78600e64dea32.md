A boutonniere deformity results when the triangular ligament and the central slip of the extensor tendon of a digit are disrupted. This disruption of the ligament and tendon will cause the lateral bands to displace volarly. This results in forced flexion of the finger, and subsequent limitation of the DIP joint to extend. Over time, the oblique retinacular ligament gradually contracts. This ligament contracture will gradually worsen the hyperextension deformity of the joint.
