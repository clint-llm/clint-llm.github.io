Potassium-sparing diuretics overdose is relatively rare, and there are no reports of deaths. With mild to moderate toxicity, there can be the development of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mild dehydration, and hyperkalemia. If there is severe toxicity, there can be the development of severe dehydration coupled with hyperkalemia, which may lead to dysrhythmias, tachycardia, hypotension, hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, and possibly changes in mental status. Acute renal failure may also develop due to the deposition of triamterene in the renal tubules.
