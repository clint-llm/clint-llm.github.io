The first protective principle stemming from the 1978 Belmont Report is the principle of Respect for Persons, also known as human dignity.

To ensure participants have the autonomous right to self-determination, researchers must ensure that potential participants understand that they have the right to decide whether or not to participate in research studies voluntarily and that declining to participate in any research will not affect in any way their access to current or subsequent care. Also, self-determined participants must have the ability to ask the researcher questions and the ability to comprehend questions asked by the researcher. Researchers must also inform participants that they may stop participating in the study at any time without fear of penalty.

Researchers must also ensure that they do not coerce potential participants into agreeing to participate in studies. Coercion refers to threats of penalty, whether implied or explicit, if participants decline to participate or otherwise opt-out of a study. Additionally, giving potential participants extreme rewards for agreeing to participate can also be a form of coercion, because the rewards may provide an enticing-enough incentive that the participant feels they need participate, while if such a reward were not offered they would otherwise have declined. While researchers often use various rewards and incentives in studies, they must review carefully this possibility of coercion. Some incentives may pressure potential participants into joining a study, thereby stripping participants of complete self-determination.

An additional aspect of respecting potential participants’ self-determination is to ensure that researchers have fully disclosed information about the study and explained the voluntary nature of participation (including the right to refuse without repercussion) and possible benefits and risks related to study participation. Without complete information, a potential participant cannot make a truly informed decision. This aspect of the Belmont Report can be troublesome for some researchers based on their study designs and research questions. Noted biases related to reactivity may occur when study participants know the exact guiding research questions and purposes. Some researchers may try to avoid reactivity biases by using covert data collection methods or masking of key study information. Masking frequently occurs in pharmaceutical trials with placebos because knowledge of placebo receipt can affect study outcomes. However, masking and concealed data collection methods may not fully respect participants’ rights to autonomy and the associated informed consent process. Any researcher considering concealed data collection or masking of some research information from participants must present their plans to an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for oversight, as well as explain the potential masking to prospective patients in the consent process (i.e. - explaining to potential participants in a medication trial that they will be randomly assigned either the medication or a placebo). The IRB will make a final determination if studies warrant concealed data collection or masking methods in light of the research design and methods and study-specific protections.

The second Belmont Report principle is the principle of beneficence. Beneficence refers to acting in such a way to benefit others while promoting their welfare and safety.

Before seeking IRB approval and conducting a study, researchers must analyze potential risks and benefits to research participants. Examples of possible participant risks include physical harm, loss of privacy, unforeseen side effects, emotional distress or embarrassment, monetary costs, physical discomfort, and loss of time. Possible benefits include access to a potentially valuable intervention, increased understanding of a medical condition, and satisfaction of helping others with similar issues.

The final principle contained in the Belmont Report is the principle of justice, which pertains to participants’ right to fair treatment and right to privacy. The selection of the types of participants desired for a research study should be guided by research questions and requirements so as not to exclude any group, and to be as representative of the overall target population as possible. Researchers and IRBs must scrutinize the selection of research participants to determine whether researchers are systematically selecting some groups (e.g., participants receiving public financial assistance, specific ethnic and racial minorities, or those who are institutionalized) because of their vulnerability or ease of access. The right to fair treatment also relates to researchers treating those who decline to participate in a study fairly without any prejudice.

The right to privacy also falls under the Belmont Report’s principle of justice. Researchers must keep any shared information in their strictest confidence. Upholding the right to privacy often involves procedures for anonymity or confidentiality. For participants’ data to be completely anonymous, the researcher cannot have the ability to connect the participant to their data. If researchers can make participant-data connections, even if they use codes or pseudonyms in place of personal identifiers, the study is no longer anonymous. Instead, researchers are providing participant confidentiality. Various methods can help researchers assure confidentiality, including locking any participant identifying data and substituting code numbers instead of names, with a correlation key available only to a safety or oversight functionary in case of emergency, but not readily available to researchers themselves.
