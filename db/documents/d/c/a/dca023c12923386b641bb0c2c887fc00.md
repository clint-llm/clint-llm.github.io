Anisometropia is a condition of asymmetric refraction between the two eyes. This condition is defined by a difference of 1 or more diopter in spherical equivalent. Its diagnosis and treatment in the first years of life are essential to optimize children's visual development and binocular function. The diagnosis and management of this condition are multidisciplinary and require periodic examinations to limit amblyopia. Anisometropia must be promptly diagnosed and treated to avoid any permanent reduction in vision associated with this condition. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of anisometropia and reports the importance of the interprofessional and familiar role in evaluating and treating the young individuals affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anisometropia diagnostic criteria.
- Identify possible causes of anisometropia and their related etiopathogenetic mechanisms in developing this condition.
- Summarize possible treatment options from the gold standard to more recent surgical procedures.
- Review the importance of timing and compliance in treating anisometropia to prevent or limit permanent functional limitations.
