As with any other bone tumor, plain radiography is the initial exam of choice. The appearance of an osteoid osteoma on plain film is classically a small, round, radiolucent nidus with surrounding sclerosis.  The nidus itself may contain areas of calcification.  Three-phase skeletal scintigraphy is an option if conventional radiographs are inconclusive.
