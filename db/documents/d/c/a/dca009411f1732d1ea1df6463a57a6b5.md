Complications of cerebral edema range from mild cognitive impairment to death.  Untreated, severe cerebral edema is fatal due to brain and brainstem compression and herniation.  The presence of significant cerebral edema can cause diffuse brain injury, precipitate seizures in some cases, or create large areas of ischemic brain tissue.  Cerebral edema, particularly when widespread, can increase ICP, and this is the most life-threatening sequelae of this condition due to the potential for herniation and brainstem injury.  Permanent brain injury can occur in more severe cases.  Many of the complications are related to the underlying cause(s) of the edema.
