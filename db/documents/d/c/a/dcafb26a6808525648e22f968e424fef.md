Anyone who closes wounds should understand sutures. Unfortunately, no suture is ideal for every wound, and in most cases, several types of sutures are required to close the wound adequately. Today there are natural, synthetic, absorbable, non-absorbable, multifilament, and monofilament sutures available. Synthetic sutures are preferred around the face as they cause a limited reaction, and inflammation is minimized. Absorbable sutures are used in areas where there is no need for extensive support, and the wound heals faster, and these are also used in internal layers. Non-absorbable sutures are used when one wants continued mechanical support. Monofilaments are less susceptible to infection but can be traumatized by surgical instruments. The multifilaments can sustain infections, but they are prone to tangles.

Proper suture technique should incorporate three major principles, including proper distribution of tension to the deeper layers, atraumatic handling of tissues, and eversion of wound margins.
