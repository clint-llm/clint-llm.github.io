At supratherapeutic levels (15 mcg per mL), concern for respiratory depression or euphoric effects has not been demonstrated.

At supratherapeutic doses of 1.0 mcg per kg, 2.0 mcg per kg, and 5.0 mcg per kg, mild to moderate hypernatremia has been reported. Any induced electrolyte imbalance observed during treatment should be managed per the standard of care, in conjunction with the termination of medication administration and identification of any additional etiologies for the electrolyte disturbance.

The adverse effects mentioned previously, including hypoesthesia, paresthesia, and somnolence, are self-limited at supratherapeutic doses.

There is no documented antidote for difelikefalin.

Considering the reassuring safety profile, the lack of activity in the central nervous system, and the more common adverse side effects of difelikefalin subsiding without intervention, the clinical utility of naloxone in suspected supratherapeutic or toxic levels of difelikefalin is unlikely relevant.

Phase III double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials have been conducted over the course of up to eight and twelve weeks. Potential long-term effects of difelikefalin remain unclear.
