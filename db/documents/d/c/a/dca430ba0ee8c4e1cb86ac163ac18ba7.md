interprofessional management of the patient with IE is essential to ensure positive outcomes. Physicians are important clinicians in assessing these patients and helping establish the diagnosis of TVIE. Nurses involved in the patient's care can identify changes in clinical status or clinical deterioration. Pharmacists have an important role in assisting with antimicrobial management. Some aspects of this care include appropriate empiric regimens, narrowing antimicrobial coverage, and ensuring an adequate therapeutic range of medications and their dosages. Case managers and social workers also play an essential role in finding rehab facilities to help prevent future IVDU, as well as to help arrange for outpatient facilities to obtain longer term IV antibiotics if necessary. Treating TVIE requires a team approach to ensure successful outcomes. The outcomes for patients with TVIE depends on patient age, comorbidity, hemodynamic status, theÂ presence of sepsis and time of treatment.
