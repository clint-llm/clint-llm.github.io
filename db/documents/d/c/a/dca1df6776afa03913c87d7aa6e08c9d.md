The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) revised the definition of pain in 2020 as "An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage."

Chronic pain is a widespread health problem, with approximately 100 million people in the United States suffering from chronic pain in 2008.

The goal of treatment for chronic pain is the reduction of pain intensity and the improvement of function and quality of life. Apart from efficacy, the adverse effects, side-effect profile, economic factors, and patient preference should also be considered during the selection of a treatment modality. Multimodal management has been recommended for chronic pain, including medications, exercises, lifestyle modification, physical therapy, pain psychology, behavioral modalities, interventional pain modalities, and alternative medicine.
