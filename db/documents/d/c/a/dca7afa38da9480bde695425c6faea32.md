American physician Austin Flint first described his namesake murmur in 1862. In his own poetic words: "The murmur is oftener rough than soft. The roughness is often peculiar. It is a blubbering sound, resembling that produced by throwing the lips or the tongue into vibration with the breath of respiration." The murmur is best described in modern terms as a low-pitched mid to late diastolic rumble heard best at the apex of the heart and is associated with severe aortic regurgitation. This activity examines when this condition merits consideration in the differential diagnosis and how to evaluate it properly. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of the Austin Flint murmur.
- Review the workup of a patient with an Austin Flint murmur.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for a patient with Austin Flint murmur.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of aortic regurgitation and improve outcomes.
