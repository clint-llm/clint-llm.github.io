Mullerian inhibiting factor (MIF), also called the anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), plays a significant role in sexual differentiation. It is produced by the Sertoli cells in male fetuses and signals the regression of the Mullerian ducts, fallopian tubes, and uterus. Androgens, which are secretedÂ by Leydig cells, induce differentiation of Wolffian ducts into male internal and external genitalia.
