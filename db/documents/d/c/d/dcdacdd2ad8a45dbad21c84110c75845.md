Glucagon is a single-chain polypeptide made up of 29 amino acids that are derived from a larger precursor peptide, which is cleaved upon secretion. The main site of glucagon production is pancreatic alpha-islet cells, which secrete glucagon in response to hypoglycemia, amino acids, gastric inhibitory peptide, and ghrelin. Glucagon acts in the liver to increase glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis by stimulating the cAMP pathway resulting in an elevation of plasma glucose. The secretion of glucagon is inhibited by hyperglycemia, insulin, somatostatin, and GLP-1

Excessive secretion of glucagon from the tumor leads to the glucagonoma syndrome. Classic glucagonoma syndrome consists of weight loss, necrolytic migratory erythema (NME), diabetes, and mucosal abnormalities including stomatitis, cheilitis, and glossitis
