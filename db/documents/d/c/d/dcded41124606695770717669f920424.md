Interference with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin K can lead to derangements in clotting factors. Patients may require supplementation of fat-soluble vitamins, especially if they are on long-term cholestyramine therapy.

Cholestyramine can interfere with the absorption of many medications such as digitalis glycosides, propranolol, thiazides, warfarin, tetracycline, thyroxine, iron salts, statins (pravastatin and fluvastatin), ezetimibe, phenobarbital, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, loperamide, and tricyclic antidepressants. Due to drug interactions, it is advised to administer other medications 1 hour before or 4 hours after taking cholestyramine.
