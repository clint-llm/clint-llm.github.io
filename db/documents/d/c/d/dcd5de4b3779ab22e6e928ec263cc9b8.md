The cause of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) remains largely idiopathic, but there seems to be a correlation between the prevalence of AS in a given population and the prevalence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 in that same population. Among people who are HLA-B27 positive, the prevalence of AS is approximately 5% to 6%. In the United States, the prevalence of HLA-B27 varies among ethnic groups. According to a 2009 survey, prevalence rates of HLA-B27 were 7.5% among non-Hispanic Whites, 4.6% among Mexican-Americans, and 1.1% among non-Hispanic Blacks.
