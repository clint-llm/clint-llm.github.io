**Quadrangular Space Syndrome**

This is a rare condition characterized by compression of the axillary nerve and posterior humeral circumflex artery as they travel through the quadrangular space.

**Upper-Crossed Syndrome**

This syndrome is characterized by an imbalance of muscle strength, tightness, and movement patterns in the upper quarter of the body. Numerous anterior and posterior thorax muscles are implicated. Patients present with a forward head posture, thoracic spine hunching, elevated and protracted shoulders, and decreased spine mobility in the thoracic vertebrae.

These postural abnormalities are associated with pain and inflammation in the back and neck. This is often caused by continual position in poor postures, such as those who spend a prolonged time using a computer, reading, or watching television. Additionally, over time, upper-crossed syndrome can lead to cervicothoracic and glenohumeral joint dysfunction.
