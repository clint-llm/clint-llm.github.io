Previous randomized controlled trials have found no serious adverse effects and good overall tolerance of the drug.

One major area of concern regarding safety is with pyrrolizidine alkaloids which are commonly found in the butterbur plant.

Severe hepatotoxicity may beÂ associated with butterbur use, but the evidence is unclear. From the World Health Organization's Vigibase, one study reported 40 cases of hepatotoxicity, including two liver transplants associated with the use of Petasites formulations.
