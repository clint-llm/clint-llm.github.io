Sinus squeeze, also known as barosinusitis or aerosinusitis, is irritation of the mucosal lining in the sinuses as a result of the failure to equalize intrasinus pressures with ambient environment pressure. Sinus squeeze is associated with rapid ascent or descent while scuba diving, rapid altitude changes during flights, and hyperbaric treatments. Symptoms include pain, epistaxis, lacrimation, and rhinorrhea. Pain is the most common symptom, and the frontal sinuses are most commonly affected. Referred tooth pain can occur when the maxillary sinuses are involved. This activity describes the pathophysiology, prevention, and management of sinus squeeze and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of sinus squeeze.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with sinus squeeze.
- Review the treatment and management options available for sinus squeeze.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the prevention and management of sinus squeeze and improve outcomes.
