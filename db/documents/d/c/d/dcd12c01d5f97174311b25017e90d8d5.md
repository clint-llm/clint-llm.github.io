Arterial pressure monitoring is a form of invasive blood pressure monitoring and is done through the cannulation of a peripheral artery. This form of monitoring is commonly utilized in the management of critically ill and perioperative patients. This activity reviews the indications and contraindications to the placement of an arterial catheter and describes arterial pressure monitoring principles. This also highlights interprofessional team members' role in the management of patients who are being monitored with arterial pressure monitoring.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for arterial pressure monitoring.
- Summarize how information from each cardiac contraction becomes an arterial reading on the monitor.
- Describe the proper placement of the transducer in relation to the patient's anatomical landmarks.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to obtain accurate measurements of arterial pressure and timely treatment of significant changes in pressure.
