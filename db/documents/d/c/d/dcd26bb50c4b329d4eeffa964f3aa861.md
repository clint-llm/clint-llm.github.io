Klippel Trenaunay syndrome is a clinical diagnosis with the presence of 2 of the three classic features. Imaging is recommended to evaluate the underlying venous/lymphatic malformations and soft tissue/bone hypertrophy, mapping the extent of disease and complications. A color doppler ultrasound can be an initial step to assess varicosities, venous malformation, or the presence of thrombus formation. However, MRI and MRV can be more useful in assessing the extent of all the underlying malformations.
