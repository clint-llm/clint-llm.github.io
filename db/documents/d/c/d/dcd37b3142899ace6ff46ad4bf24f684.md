As mentioned earlier, Morvan syndrome is a clinical diagnosis. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed to diagnose Morvan syndrome when a patient presents with a combination of above mentioned diverse clinical features. Most of the investigations that are usually performed in such patients, such as CSF analysis, brain MRI, EEG, PET scan, are typically unyielding. EMG studies can confirm myokymia. However, the detection of VGKC-complex antibodies is quite diagnostic. Although these antibodies are directed against CASPR2, LGI1, or more commonly both, CASPR2 antibody's predominance is found in association with thymoma cases.
