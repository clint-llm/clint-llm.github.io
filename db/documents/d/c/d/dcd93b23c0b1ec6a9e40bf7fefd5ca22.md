If a patient presents with myopathy, the following conditions must be excluded to make an absolute diagnosis.

- Electrolyte imbalance-induced myopathy that can commonly occur due to the loss of potassium, phosphate, or magnesium from the body. Hypokalemia/Hypophosphatemia can cause muscle cramps and aches leading to a myopathic situation similar to PM.

- Another important category that must be kept in the differential is endocrinological disorders, e.g., hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome, etc. These hormonal disorders can make proximal musculature weak, making the clinical presentation similar to PM.

- Other autoimmune disorders should be ruled out to diagnose polymyositis. The most common differential is dermatomyositis that is easily differentiated by the dermatologic presentation and endomysial presentation on biopsy. Other disorders to keep in mind for making the diagnosis of PM are myasthenia gravis, mixed connective tissue disorder, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, iatrogenic myopathies, and myositis-induced myopathies (focal/giant cell myositis).

- A history of chronic steroid use should be taken to exclude steroid-induced myopathy or Cushing syndrome.

- Patients with a previous diagnosis of fibromyalgia or polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) can complain about muscle pain and weakness. These patients must be carefully evaluated to exclude these causes. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can cause myopathy, so it should be excluded as well.

- Drugs can be an important cause of myopathies, so all the drugs having a tendency for myopathy should be kept in mind, such as statins, alcohol derivates, e.g., ethanol,Â antimetabolites (vincristine), azathioprine, chloroquine/primaquine, and anti-fungal agents.
