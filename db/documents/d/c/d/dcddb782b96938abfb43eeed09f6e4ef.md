Renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), which originate within the renal cortex, are responsible for 80% to 85% of all primary renal neoplasms. Transitional cell carcinomas, which originate in the renal pelvis, comprise approximately 8%. Other parenchymal epithelial tumors, such as oncocytomas, collecting duct tumors, angiomyolipomas, and renal sarcomas, occur infrequently. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, presentation and diagnosis of renal cell cancers and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of renal cell cancer.
- Explain the workup of a patient with renal cancer.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for renal cell cancer
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with renal cell cancer.
