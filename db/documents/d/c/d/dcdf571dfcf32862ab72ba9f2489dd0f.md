Epidermoid cysts are the most common cutaneous cysts and typically occur in the third and fourth decades of life. It is rare to find these cysts before puberty. They are predominantly found in males versus females (ratio 2:1). In the neonatal period, small epidermal cysts, referred to as milia, are common. Approximately 1% of epidermoid cysts have been noted to have a malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC).
