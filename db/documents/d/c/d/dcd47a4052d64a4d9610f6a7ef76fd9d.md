Evaluation of the trauma patient should include all of the usual exams and studies used in a major multi-trauma patient. The eFAST may find pneumo/hemothorax but does not usually help define a flail chest. The chest x-ray may be the first study that helps specifically with the flail chest. The chest x-ray is not very sensitive and may miss rib fractures identified by CT; hence the diagnosis of flail chest may be missed if one just relies on the chest x-ray. A rib series is better but may still miss one-fourth of the rib fractures.

Complete trauma labs should be ordered including a blood gas. Labs have a limited direct role in the diagnosis of flail chest but may aid in monitoring the patient for signs of impending respiratory failure.
