Stercoral colitis is a rare inflammatory form of colitis that occurs when impacted fecal material leads to distention of the colon and eventually fecaloma formation. Fecalomas can lead to focal pressure necrosis and perforation, while colonic distention and increased intraluminal pressure can lead to compromise of the vascular supply and ischemic colitis.

Multiple areas of ulceration can present in the colon. The most common locations of ulceration are in the sigmoid colon and the rectum.
