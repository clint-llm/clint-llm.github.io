Treatment of xeroderma should focus on restoring physiologic lipids in the epidermis, enhancing skin moisturization, optimizing skin barrier function, and promoting epidermal differentiation.

- Infrequent bathing and using lukewarm water: Individuals should avoid aggressive skin washing and hot water, which are harsh and strip the skin of protective oils.

- Use of mild cleansers: synthetic detergent cleansers are preferred due to their acidic pH, which closely resembles the skin's natural pH. Syndet cleansers are less irritating than traditional soaps, and their low pH has been shown to downregulate pruritus.

- Routine use of skin moisturizers: Oil-based creams are thicker in consistency than water-based lotions and are more effective in providing moisturization. Ointments are greasier in texture and particularly useful for preventing transepidermal water loss.

- Utilizing room humidifiers, especially during the winter months

- Staying hydrated with adequate fluid intake

Products containing the following active ingredients may improve skin texture and hydration:

- Humectants promote water transfer from the dermis to the epidermis. Examples include glycerin, urea, ammonium lactate, hyaluronic acid, and gelatin.

- Occlusives create a hydrophobic layer over the skin, preventing water loss. Examples include lanolin, paraffin, petrolatum, cholesterol, and stearyl alcohol.

- Emollients can fill gaps and fissures in the skin. Examples include petrolatum, dimethicone, and propylene glycol.

Clinicians may also prescribe topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors if xeroderma is accompanied by pruritus or dermatitis.
