Epidemiologic assessment of insulin resistance is typically measured in relation to the prevalence of metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance syndrome. Criteria proposed by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III national survey data suggest insulin resistance syndrome is very common, affecting about 24% of United States (US) adults older than 20 years. While there has been a rapid rise in pediatric obesity and type 2 diabetes, no consensus has been reached on diagnostic criteria for insulin resistance in the pediatric population at this time. The type-A syndrome is predominantly found in younger adults while the type-B syndrome is found in older adults. From a demographic standpoint, insulin resistance affects all races with limited data on comparisons between different racial groups.
