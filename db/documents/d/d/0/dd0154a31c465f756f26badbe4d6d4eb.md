Hepatic angiosarcoma accounts for 0.1%-2% of all primary hepatic malignancies, but it is still considered to be the third most common primary hepatic malignancy. It usually occurs in older men with a peak incidence in the sixth or seventh decade of life. Males are more frequently affected than females with a ratio of 3-4:1. However, in childhood, there is a higher incidence amongst girls compared to boys.
