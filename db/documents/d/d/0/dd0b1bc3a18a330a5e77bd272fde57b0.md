The femoral artery is a large blood vessel that provides oxygenated blood to lower extremity structures and in part to the lower anterior abdominal wall. The common femoral artery arises as a continuation of the external iliac artery after it passes under the inguinal ligament. The femoral artery, vein, and nerve all exist in the anterior region of the thigh known as the femoral triangle, just inferior to the inguinal ligament. Within the femoral triangle, the anatomical relationship from medial to lateral is femoral vein, common femoral artery, and femoral nerve. The artery and vein are both contained within the femoral sheath while the nerve is not.

Besides providing oxygen-rich blood to the lower extremity tissues, the common femoral artery is clinically significant because it is a common site of peripheral arterial disease complications such as claudication and critical limb ischemia. Additionally, the common femoral artery serves as a preferred site for percutaneous catheterization for a wide variety of endovascular procedures. A thorough understanding of the anatomy and potential variations of the femoral artery is crucial for surgeons and interventionalists in order to avoid complications.
