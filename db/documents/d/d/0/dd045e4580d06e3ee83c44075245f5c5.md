A thorough history and physical exam are critical to the identification of patients with anticholinergic poisoning. Patients may present with a history of intentional ingestion of common anticholinergic agents such as antihistamines or jimson weed; however, the history is often less straightforward.

The clinician must be familiar with the anticholinergic toxidrome as a reliable history is not always obtainable. The mnemonic “red as a beet, dry as a bone, blind as a bat, mad as a hatter, hot as a hare, full as a flask” is helpful to remember the classic signs and symptoms of anticholinergic poisoning. Respectively, these include flushing, anhydrosis, dry mucous membranes, mydriasis, altered mental status, fever, and urinary retention. Decreased bowel sounds are also a common physical exam finding. Central nervous system effects may include delirium, hallucinations, agitation, restlessness, confusion, staccato speech, and picking at clothing and bedding. Seizures and jerking movements are possible.
