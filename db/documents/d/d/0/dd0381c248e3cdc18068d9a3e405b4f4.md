The lesions of DPN initially present in adolescent patients as minute, round, skin-colored to dark brown macules, resembling freckles, gradually becoming papular and increasing in size and number with age. There may be a family history of similar lesions. The lesions often become hyperpigmented, filiform to sessile, smooth-surfaced papules, ranging from 1- to 5-mm in diameter and 1- to 3-mm in elevation. They most commonly appear in a symmetric distribution on the malar cheeks, temples, and forehead. They may also occur on the neck, upper chest, and back with less frequency. Approximately one-fourth of patients with facial lesions will also have lesions on the body. The papules are asymptomatic, without scaling, crusting, or ulceration.Â Lesions do not spontaneously resolve.
