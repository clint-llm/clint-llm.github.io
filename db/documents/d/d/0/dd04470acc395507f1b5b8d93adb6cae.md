The morbidity of WS is largely due to the presence of arteriopathy and congenital heart disease.

In terms of inheritance, there is a 50% chance of parents with WS passing the microdeletion to their children.

Patients with WS can live semi-independently to independently and are often able to work. As each individual with WS has different needs, it is recommended to complete an individualized life transition plan, preferably before the age of 13 or 14.
