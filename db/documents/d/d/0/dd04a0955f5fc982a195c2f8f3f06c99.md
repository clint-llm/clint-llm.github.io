The care of the patient with Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS) requires all members of the healthcare team. Nurses are integral in recognizing and preventing complications, including decubitus ulcers, dysautonomia, and infection prevention. Pharmacists should be well-versed in the adverse effects that may occur with the administration of treatments for GBS, such as IVIG. Respiratory therapists can assist with preventing atelectasis and aspiration pneumonia. Physical and occupational therapists are crucial as the patient begins to regain function and strength. Following recovery, patients often may find it helpful to enlist in support groups available through the GBS foundation.
