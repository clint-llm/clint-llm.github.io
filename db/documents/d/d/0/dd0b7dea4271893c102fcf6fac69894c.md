The diagnosis of orbital cellulitis should always begin with a physical exam looking for clinical findings of orbital cellulitis but also for its serious complications. It is important that an ophthalmologistÂ evaluate a patient with suspected orbital cellulitis for extraocular movements, visual acuity, and to assess for proptosis. In addition, an otolaryngologist should be consulted for evaluation of patients with extensive rhinosinusitis

**Laboratory Studies**

Although low yield, it is recommended to obtain blood cultures for common bacterial pathogens and, depending on the circumstances, fungi and mycobacteria from patients with suspected orbital cellulitis prior to the administration of antibiotics.

**Imaging Studies**

Two main imaging tools are available such as a CT and MRI to aid in the diagnosis of orbital cellulitis. MRI has been found to be superior to CT scan because it can help in following soft tissue disease progression

- Proptosis

- Limitation of eye movements

- Pain with eye movements

- Double vision

- Vision loss

- Edema extending beyond the eyelid margin

- ANC greater than 10,000 cell/microL

- Signs or symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) involvement

- Inability to examine the patient fully (patients less than 1 year of age)

- Patients who do not begin to show improvement within 24 to 48 hours of initiating

**Findings on Imaging
**

Common CT findings in orbital cellulitis are inflammation of extraocular muscles, fat stranding, and anterior displacement of the globe, although this may be subtle. Evidence of rhinosinusitis, with the most intense, is commonly seen in ethmoid sinuses. Complications of orbital cellulitis, for example, subperiosteal abscesses and orbital abscesses appear as low-density collections on CT scan.
