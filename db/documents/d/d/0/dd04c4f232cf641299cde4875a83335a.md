Patients must also not have contraindications to using SNM. They must not have any urinary obstruction or current pelvic infection. Patients with severe or rapidly progressive neurologic disease are also relatively contraindicated from having SNM therapy.

Contraindications of SNM include shortwave diathermy, microwave diathermy or therapeutic ultrasound, mechanical obstruction, and inability to operate the patient programmer.

While age and comorbidities are not contraindications, there is some evidence to suggest that patients over 55 years old with three or more chronic comorbid conditions exhibit diminished success rates for improving their voiding symptoms with sacral neuromodulation.
