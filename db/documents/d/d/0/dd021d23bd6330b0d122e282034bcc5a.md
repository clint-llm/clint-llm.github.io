Although corns and calluses are chronic, recurrent issues, most of them gradually spontaneously remit when repeated friction or pressure causes them to be eliminated. Nevertheless, if corns do not resolve or if they start to cause severe pain, the patient should enlist the assistance of a podiatrist.

In a small 2021 study involving 39 patients, surgical versus conservative treatment were compared, and noted 100% "very good or excellent" satisfaction in the surgical group, in contrast to 28.6% of patients who underwent conservative treatment.
