The most common adverse effects, seen in more than 5 percent of patients taking bisacodyl, are diarrhea, abdominal pain (mainly in the upper abdomen), and headache.

Myenteric plexus or smooth muscle damage due to stimulant laxatives is rare, and it is unclear if this is due to constipation or laxative use.

Rectal administration of bisacodyl may cause rectal mucosa irritation and a sensation of burning and mild proctitis. Bisacodyl has some interactions with other drugs such as digoxin, antacids, and H2-receptor antagonist. Wang et al. conclude that bisacodyl interferes with digoxin absorption, with a resultantÂ reduction of the serum digoxin concentration.
