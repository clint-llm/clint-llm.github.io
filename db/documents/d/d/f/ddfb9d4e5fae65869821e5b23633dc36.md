Autonomic dysreflexia is a condition that emerges after a spinal cord injury, usually when the damage has occurred above the T6 level. The higher the level of the spinal cord injury, the greater the risk, with up to 90% of patients with cervical spinal or high-thoracic spinal cord injury being susceptible. Dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system leads to an uncoordinated sympathetic response that may result in a potentially life-threatening hypertensive episode when there is a noxious stimulus below the level of the spinal cord injury. In about 85% of cases, this stimulus is from a urological source such as a UTI, a distended bladder, or a clogged Foley catheter. There is a significantly increased risk of stroke by 300% to 400%. Autonomic dysreflexia can occur in susceptible individuals up to 40 times per day. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment of autonomic dysreflexia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of autonomic dysreflexia.
- Review the manifestations of autonomic dysreflexia.
- Summarize the management options for autonomic dysreflexia.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by autonomic dysreflexia.
