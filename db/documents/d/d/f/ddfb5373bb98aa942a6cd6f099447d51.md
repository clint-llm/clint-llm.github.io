A patient who delivers a macrosomic infant should be screened very carefully for previously undiagnosed diabetes. If such screening is negative, they should be monitored carefully in their following pregnancies.Â The goal of scheduled cesarean birth for suspected macrosomia is to reduce fetal morbidity or maternal morbidity, or both. Although fetal and maternal morbidity increase with birth weights more than 4,000 g, most births of macrosomic newborns are uncomplicated.
