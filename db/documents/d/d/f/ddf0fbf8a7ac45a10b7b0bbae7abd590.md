The patient positioning depends on the modality.Â For example, PA or posteroanterior film is obtained with the patient facing the cassette and x-rays beam projecting from the posterior aspect of the patient to the anterior aspect. In an anteroposterior (AP) view, the cassette is along the posterior aspect of the patient. Portable radiographs are obtained in the ICU setting when the patient cannot be erect. CT chest is performed with the patient supine. The arms are usually above the level of the head. MRI and PET scans are also obtained with the patient in the supine position. Ultrasound is also obtained with the patient usually supine. However, this being a dynamic procedure, the patient can move during the procedure.
