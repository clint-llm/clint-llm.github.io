Encopresis can be divided into constipation-associated encopresis or overflow encopresis, and non-retentive encopresis. More than 80% of the children with encopresis have retentive fecal incontinence. Other organic non-functional causes for encopresis include repaired anorectal malformation, postsurgical Hirschsprung disease, spinal dysraphism, spinal cord trauma, spinal cord tumor, cerebral palsy, and myopathies affecting the pelvic floor and external anal sphincter.
