Ultrasound has expanded from its diagnostic origins to become a robust, adaptable therapeutic technology for physicians in a variety of specialties. Low-intensity ultrasound has become a mainstay therapy for many acute and chronic musculoskeletal conditions in the outpatient or inpatient setting due to its ease of use and limited complication rate. Meanwhile, HIFU has emerged as a non-invasive therapy used for the ablation of many types of tissues. Though many applications are still experimental, it is likely to be widely accepted as a safe, alternative therapy for various tumors and aberrant tissues.
