Knowledge is key. In the setting of an underdiagnosed and easily missed clinical entity, educating providers and patients is paramount. Any patient with a history of exertional extremity pain which resolves with rest should trigger consideration of CECS and seek medical attention. Additionally, any patient with atraumatic extremity pain with findings of the pain out of proportion, pain on a passive stretch, and tender compartments merits consideration of AECS and should seek care.
