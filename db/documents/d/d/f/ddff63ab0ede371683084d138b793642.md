Patient counseling will depend on the severity of the injury and symptomatology. Severe cases may require surgery, and the patient or parents must be informed of all the potential sequelae and complications accompanying such a procedure. Less severe cases can be managed with physical therapy, and patients need to be compliant to maximize the effects of such treatment.

Following surgery, patients need to limit their activities and especially sports involvement. Contact and or ballistic sports may not be options for many patients with atlantoaxial instability, even after surgical correction. These determinations need to be made case-by-case based on specific etiology and the management intervention.
