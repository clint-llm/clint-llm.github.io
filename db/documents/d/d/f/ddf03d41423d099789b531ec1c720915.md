May-Thurner syndrome is caused by compression of the left iliofemoral vein by the right common iliac artery, just after it originates from the abdominal aorta and before the iliofemoral junction. The chronic pressure from the overriding artery compresses the vein against the bony structures, usually the lower lumbar vertebrae, leading to the formation of 'venous spurs.' Although MTS primarily results in the thrombosis of the left iliofemoral veins, rarely 'right' sided MTS has also been reported.
