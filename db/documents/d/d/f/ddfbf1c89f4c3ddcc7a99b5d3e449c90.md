Complications include partial or total flap loss, infection, seroma, hematoma, fat necrosis, and donor site complications. Published series have shown a complete or partial flap loss rate of 0.6% to 1.3%. More commonly, poorly perfused flap segments result in fat necrosis. The development of a hematoma can threaten microvascular anastomosis. Meticulous hemostasis is requisite for free tissue transfer. Several series have considered the morbidity associated with the TRAM donor site. The literature has described hernias, abdominal wall laxity, and wound complications.
