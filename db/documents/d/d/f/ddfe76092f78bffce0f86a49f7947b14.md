Further inpatient care of a patient with tricuspid regurgitationÂ involves:

- Anticoagulation may be needed in cases of atrial fibrillation or if the patient has sustained a valve replacement.

- Management of arrhythmias, if present

- Treatment of any infections

- Heart failure

In patients whose valve has been removed, repeat echocardiography is indicated at 6-month intervals. In patients whose valve has been replaced, annual echocardiography is recommended.
