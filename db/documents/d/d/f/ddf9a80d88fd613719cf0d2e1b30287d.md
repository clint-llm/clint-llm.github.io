Postpartum fever is defined as an oral temperature ≥38.0°C (≥100.4°F) on any two of the first 10 days postpartum, excluding the first 24 hours.

Unfortunately, there is no documented cut-off point for what temperature is too high just to be caused by breast engorgement. The presence of myalgias and breast erythema suggest mastitis rather than engorgement as the diagnosis.

Causes of hyperthermia include serotonin syndrome, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, an overdose of sympathomimetic or anticholinergic agents, withdrawal from ethanol or benzodiazepines, aspirin toxicity, and thyroid storm.

The hallmark physical examination finding for serotonin syndrome is hyperreflexia and clonus, while for neuroleptic malignant syndrome, lead-pipe rigidity is characteristic.

The overdose of sympathomimetic agents presents with tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, and agitation. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines or ethanol can present with tremors, tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia and progress to seizures.
