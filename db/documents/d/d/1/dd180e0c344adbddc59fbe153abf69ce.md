Clear cell carcinomas of the lower genital tract have a greater tendency to recur late and develop metastases in distant sites more frequently than squamous cell carcinomas.

Metastasis is uncommon in clear cell carcinoma of the cervix, but local recurrence may occur.

The most common extra-pelvic sites of recurrence are the lungs, liver, and skeletal system.

Most recurrences of clear cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix get diagnosed within three years after primary tumor treatment.

High-risk factors for recurrence include positive parametrial extension, positive pelvic lymph nodes, and positive vaginal margins. In patients with these high-risk factors, chemoradiation is the postoperative adjuvant treatment of choice.
