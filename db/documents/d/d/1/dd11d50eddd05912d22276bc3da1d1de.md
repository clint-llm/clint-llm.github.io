Electric potential is found in nearly every medical device. Each has a specific voltage limit, which prevents the device from failing. Electric potential is also found in the human brain. Human neurons have a voltage of 70 mV on average. Capacitance is also found in nearly every medical device but is the mainstay of defibrillators. Capacitors are temporary batteries that can discharge quicker than regular batteries, which is imperative when a patient undergoes cardiac arrest.
