Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) refers to the obstruction of the blood flowing out of the left ventricle. It can occur at the valvular, subvalvular, or supravalvular level. In general, there is an obstruction to forward flow, which increases afterload and, if untreated, can result in hypertrophy, dilatation, and eventual failure of the left ventricle. Patients presenting with signs and symptoms of LVOTO may see a pediatrician or general physician first and then be referred to an adult or pediatric cardiologist. While traditionally defined in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, LVOTO is known to have several causes. This activity describes the evaluation of patients with LVOTO and highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical signs and symptoms of patients with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO).
- Outline the diagnostic modalities for the evaluation of LVOTO and the diagnostic findings on clinical imaging.
- Discuss the management plan for patients with LVOTO. 
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected with LVOTO.
