Foreign invaders are continuously attacking the human body. Their attempts to hijack the body's machinery is quickly shut down by the immune system. The immune system is a multilayered system that prevents the entry of pathogens into our body and allows us to live every day without constantly being sick. There are many mechanisms in which our immune system fights pathogens. One is opsonization. Opsonization is the process of recognizing and targeting invading particles for phagocytosis.
