The ultimate goal of simulation is to improve patient care. Debriefing is a critical component of healthcare simulation, regardless of whether the primary learning objective is knowledge transfer or the development of teamwork and/or communication skills. The use of VAD may contribute to a high-quality debriefing, but it is not a necessary component.

Participants may derive benefit from reviewing their performance on videotape and discussing it during debriefing. VAD provides the opportunity to evaluate team processes and offers support to improve teamwork.
