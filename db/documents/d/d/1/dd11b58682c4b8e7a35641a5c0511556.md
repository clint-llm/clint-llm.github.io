One to three days of rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and fever usually precedes croup. Typical symptoms of croup include a barky or a seal-like cough, hoarse voice, and high pitched inspiratory stridor that parents may incorrectly describe as “wheezing.”

Several scoring systems can evaluate the severity of respiratory distress. The Westley score assesses the following:

- Cyanosis

- Level of consciousness

- Inspiratory stridor

- Retractions

- Air entry
