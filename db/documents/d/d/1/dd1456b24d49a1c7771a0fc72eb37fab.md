Alveolar macrophages play an important role in scavenging microbes such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, inhaled environmental particles like coal, silica, asbestos, tissue debris, and cancer cells. Alveolar macrophages get activated by the interaction of toll-like receptors (TLR) present on the AM surface with the pathogen-associated molecular receptors (PAMP) present on the microbial cell. The interplay between TLRs and PAMPs transmits chemical signals that trigger the process of pathogen engulfment and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines that enhance local immune response Mycobacterium Tuberculosis can resist phagocytosis
