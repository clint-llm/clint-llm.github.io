B. burgdorferi is the only species of spirochete responsible for the most common vector-borne disease in North America. In the United States, B.
burgdorferi infection occurs in northeastern and midwestern regions. In Europe, B. burgdorferi is one of five species (Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia garinii, Borrelia spielmanii, and Borrelia bavariensis) that cause Lyme disease. Recently, the number of reported cases of Lyme disease in the United States has increased from 25,000 to 30,000 per year. There is a bimodal age distribution with highest age incidences in children 5 to 9 years old and in adults 45 to 59 years old. Also, slightly more men than women are infected.B. burgdorferi was observed in the midgut tissues by Dr. Willy Burgdorfer and coworkers in endemic areas.
