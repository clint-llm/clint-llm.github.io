Topical hydroquinone, tretinoin, adapalene, and corticosteroids have been used with limited success. Case reports have shown success after treatment with Er:YAG laser followed by topical corticosteroids and fusidic acid. The Er:YAG laser is theorized to improve hyperpigmented areas by removing the abnormal proliferated epitheliumÂ and allowing formation of new epidermal tissue from unaffected follicular epithelium.
