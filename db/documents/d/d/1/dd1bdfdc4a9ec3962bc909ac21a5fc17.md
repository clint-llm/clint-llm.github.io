Polytherapy has become the mainstay of treatment and is endorsed and recommended by ACC as well as ESC/ ESH.

There have been two main approaches:

- Either instituting two or more drugs (usually an ACEi or an ARB along with thiazide diuretic and calcium channel blocker) simultaneously, or

- Stepwise titration approach with single therapy being up-titrated to maximum dosage before instituting a second drug.

Both have been successful in improving patient outcomes provided there is adequate compliance and treatment adherence.

All the societies recommend at least an 8 to 12-week duration of anti-hypertensive medication before assessing BP control and reviewing patient for complications.

There is a consensus that home BP measurements or ABPM should be checked at or before initiation of therapy and then three months after starting therapy for monitoring and documentation of adequate BP control.
