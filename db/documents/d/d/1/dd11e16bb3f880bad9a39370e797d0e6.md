It is essential to evaluate the mood and mental status of adolescent recipients of MAOIs, as with any other antidepressant; these medications may increase the risk for suicide in those aged 18 to 24 years.

Baseline and periodic monitoring of renal and hepatic functions and blood pressure measurements should be taken for those on MAOIs. Blood glucose also requires monitoring, as noradrenergic effects of MAOIs lead to a decrease in insulin production and an increase in glucagon secretion.

For those on MAO-B inhibitors such as selegiline, periodic evaluation for parkinsonism is advisable.
