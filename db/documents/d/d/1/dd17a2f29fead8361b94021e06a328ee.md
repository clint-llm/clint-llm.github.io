Health agencies must caution the public on the dangers of eating raw and undercooked seafood. This especially applies to raw oysters. Health advisory notices would ideally be placed in restaurants. The public should also be made aware of the danger of wounds acquired in marine environments. Surfers, divers, swimmers, and fishers should be educated, through the media and their clubs and associations, on the risk Vibrio represents when they sustain an injury in suspect waters. In addition, those enjoying these activities in climates known to enhance V. vulnificus virulence- warn, sub-tropical, or monsoon-prone areas- should be extra wary. Medical personnel in these areas much have heightened knowledge and awareness of the presenting signs and symptoms, course, and complications of V. vulnificus.
