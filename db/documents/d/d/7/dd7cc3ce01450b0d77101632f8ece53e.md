Serum ferritin and transferrin saturation require measurement before initiation of epoetin alfa. If the serum ferritin level is less than 100 ng/mL and/or serum transferrin saturation level is less than 20%, then supplemental iron should be started before the initiation of epoetin alfa treatment.

- If Hb does not increase by greater than 1 gram per deciliter after four weeks of the treatment, increase the dose by 25%. In any consecutive two weeks, hemoglobin increases greater than1 grams per deciliter, then cut down the dose by 25%. If there is inadequate or no response over three months of an escalation period, the clinician should stop treatment.

- Serious cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and mortality increase when the Hb level increases more than 11 grams per deciliter. Signs and symptoms of these side effects also require monitoring. To decrease the risk of thromboembolism, encourage the patient to quit smoking and alcohol drinking, regular exercising, and diet modification.

- Complete blood count, serum iron profile with ferritin should be monitored while the patient is receiving treatment.

- Consult with the cardiologist to monitor cardiac complications.

- Consult with a nephrologist for further management with dialysis.

- Consult with the oncologist for coordinating myelosuppressive therapy if the patient is on chemotherapy.

- Consult with the neurologist for a patient with a history of seizure.
