Most of the patients affected with McArdle disease lead a normal life, and it does not affect life expectancy. Rhabdomyolysis is to be avoided as it can lead to acute renal failure which may potentially become life-threatening. Patients exploit the second wind phenomenon and adjust to the disease itself. Only a minority of patients have known to experience progressive worsening of symptoms with advancing age and wasting, especially over the shoulder girdle and back muscles.

More recent studies report heterogeneity in the clinical severity, such as 8% of patients are asymptomatic in daily life and 21% show limitations in the activities of daily living and fixed muscle weakness.

It has also been reported in various studies that the disease does not adversely alter the course of pregnancy or childbirth.
