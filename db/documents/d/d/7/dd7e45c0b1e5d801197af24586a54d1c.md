The postpartum period is the period after delivery of conceptus when maternal physiological and anatomical changes return to the nonpregnant state. The postpartum period, also known as puerperium, starts following the expulsion of the placenta until complete physiological recovery of various organ systems. The postpartum period divides into three arbitrary phases, i.e., acute phase  - the first 24 hours after delivery of the placenta, early – up to 7 days, and late – up to 6 weeks to 6 months. Each phase has its unique clinical considerations and challenges.
