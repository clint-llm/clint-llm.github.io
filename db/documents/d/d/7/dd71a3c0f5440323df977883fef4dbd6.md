Chlordiazepoxide has anti-anxiety, sedative, appetite-stimulating, and weak analgesic actions. It binds to benzodiazepine receptors at the GABA-A ligand-gated chloride channel complex and enhances GABA's inhibitory effects. Also, it increases chloride conductance through GABA-regulated channels. Moreover, its therapeutic benefits in anxiety disorder come from the inhibition of neuronal activity in amygdala-centered fear circuits. Additionally, it blocks EEG arousal from stimulation of the brain stem reticular formation. It is common to see some immediate relief of anxiety symptoms with first dosing, but several weeks with daily dosing are needed to see the maximal therapeutic benefit. It is metabolized by the liver microsomal pathway, first by hepatic oxidation, then by glucuronidation. The elimination half-life of this medication is 24 to 48 hours, and its excretion is via the urine.
