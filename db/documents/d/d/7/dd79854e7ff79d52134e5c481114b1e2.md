The clinical course of hair loss in lichen planopilaris may be insidious or fulminant, and the pattern is highly variable. Commonly, there are several scattered foci of partial hair loss with associated perifollicular erythema and scaling. A pattern of hair loss suggestive of central centrifugal alopecia or Brocq’s alopecia can also occur. The scalp lesions may be single or multiple, focal or diffuse, and occur anywhere on the scalp. Hair follicles around the margins of the bare areas show perifollicular erythema and perifollicular scale, in contrast to discoid lupus erythematosus, where follicular plugging is in the center of the active bare patch. A pull test may yield anagen hair in cicatricial alopecia, which is a useful sign of active disease that requires treatment. Symptoms of itching, burning, pain, and tenderness are often severe. Cutaneous, nail, and mucous membrane lichen planus may occur before, during, or after the onset of scalp involvement. The most characteristic trichoscopic feature of active lichen planopilaris is perifollicular scaling. Trichoscopy of inactive end-stage lichen planopilaris reveals small, irregularly shaped, whitish areas lacking follicular openings, called “fibrotic white dots,” and white areas of conducted fibrosis.
