In patients with ossicular discontinuity following trauma, primary investigations are usually performed to rule out a more significant head injury. A CT head will normally be performed, and if a temporal bone fracture is present, it is important to note whether it is otic capsule-sparing or otic capsule-violating, as this is the most reliable predictor of underlying injuries to the middle and inner ear.

Once the patient is medically fit, an audiogram should be obtained as soon as possible to allow for a baseline measurement of hearing loss. Any conductive hearing loss could be related to either ossicular disruption or hemotympanum, and it is challengingÂ to differentiate between them at this point. Therefore, a repeat audiogram should then be performed at least 6 weeks following the injury by which time any hemotympanum should have resolved. Any conductive loss at this time, in the presence of an intact tympanic membrane, should be assumed to be due to ossicular chain dislocation. Tympanometry may show increased compliance, suggesting discontinuity of the ossicular chain.

A standard trauma-sequence head CT is usually inadequate for appropriate imaging of the ossicles, therefore a CT temporal bone scan should be requested. However, not all ossicular chain dislocations are evident on CT scans, and it may be that diagnosis is only possible following surgical exploration of the middle ear.
