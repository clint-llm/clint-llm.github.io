Smaller Z-plasties may be performed as in-office procedures, requiring only a surgeon and an assistant, with or without an additional nurse present. Larger or more complicated operations, such as serial Z-plasties for scar release or Furlow palatoplasty, are better performed under general anesthesia in an operating room and thus require an anesthesia provider and full surgical staff.
