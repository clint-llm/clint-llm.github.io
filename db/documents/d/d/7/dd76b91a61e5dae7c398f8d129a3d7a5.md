Although CT is the initial modality for diagnosing pancreatic abnormalities, MRI is beneficial for characterizing cystic lesions and characterizing and even identifying some solid tumors, particularly smaller ones.

Pancreatitis evaluation in the acute setting is nearly always with CT; however, MRI is comparable to CT and can be useful in some complicated cases or patients who cannot receive iodinated contrast. Fat-suppressed T2-weighted sequences demonstrate greater differentiation between pancreatic and peripancreatic tissues while making any peripancreatic inflammation much more conspicuous.

MRCP is increasingly in use to diagnose chronic pancreatitis due to its ability to visualize pancreatic duct obstruction and dilation; however,  the typical calcifications in chronic pancreatitis are not visualized as effectively as on CT.

MR can help differentiate pancreatic lipomatosis from fibrotic changes in cystic fibrosis patients.  Fibrotic replacement of the pancreas will appear as hypointense areas on T1- and T2-weighted imaging, while fatty changes will reveal the opposite: hyperintensity on both T1- and T2-weighted sequences.

Pancreatic adenocarcinomas appear hypointense on T1-weighted images vis-a-vis the normally bright appearance of the healthy pancreas. There is less utility of T2-weighted images as the signal is similar to the normal pancreas. Diffusion-weighted images can show restricted diffusion of adenocarcinomas, but restricted diffusion is not specific to carcinomas as it can also present in pancreatitis.

Pancreatic NETs appear on MRI as hypointense on T1- and hyperintense on T2-weighted images with hyperenhancement after gadolinium administration on arterial or pancreatic phase timing due to their hypervascular nature. Large islet cell tumors may have areas of cystic or necrotic nonenhancement.

Lastly, in cases of biliary ductal dilation, MRCP can help differentiate an obstructing gallstone (no enhancement and dark on T2) or intraluminal mass (enhancing mass without dark T2-weighted signal).
