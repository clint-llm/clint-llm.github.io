The formulations of PPIs are often specifically designed to prevent premature activation by gastric acid. The delivery methods include:

- Enteric-coated tablets

- Gelatin capsules

- Coated granules as a suspension

- In combination with bicarbonate to temporarily neutralize luminal gastric acid

For immediate acid suppression, there are intravenous formulations for lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole.

As proton pumps recycle periodically in the stomach, it may take a few days for PPIs to achieve a full effect - and of note, their duration of action is slower than some other medications that affect acid production, such as histamine-receptor blockers. These medications are best administered before food intake as proton pumps become activated during meals, and administration of PPIs prior to food intake will enhance the drug's efficacy. For this reason, most practitioners recommend that the patient take the PPI first thing in the morning when taken once daily. If twice-daily dosing is employed, then a second dose is usually added approximately 30 minutes before dinner. For some select patients with nighttime predominance of symptoms, the timing of once-daily administration may change to 30 minutes pre-dinner.
