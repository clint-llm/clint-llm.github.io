Any patient presenting to the clinic with pain, redness, and photophobia should be meticulously evaluated by an Ophthalmologist with suspicion of iritis. In the case of keratouveitis, the patient should be referred to a cornea specialist for higher opinion and management to rule out infective and autoimmune keratitis. Non-resolving iritis, endophthalmitis, or cases with diagnostic dilemmas must be evaluated by a retina and uvea specialist for expert opinion and further management. The patient with underlying systemic pathology leading to iritis and uveitis should be referred timely to an internist to pinpoint the etiology and targeted systemic treatment. Iritis with trabeculitis, angle-closure, or open-angle glaucoma should be managed with a glaucoma specialist. Patients with complicated cataracts requiring surgical intervention should be ideally operated on by a cataract and IOL surgeon for an excellent visual outcome.
