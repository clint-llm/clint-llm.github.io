The management of chronic sinusitis is best done with an interprofessional team of healthcare workers that includes primary care, infectious disease experts, otolaryngologists, and radiologists, and specialty trained nurses. Otolaryngology nurses should educate the patient on controlling the trigger factors like avoiding tobacco, which can exacerbate the symptoms of chronic sinusitis. The pharmacist should educate the patient on antiallergy therapies that can help control the symptoms. The patients should also be told to manage gastroesophageal reflux disease because it is a known trigger for chronic sinusitis. Finally, the patients should be educated on the possible complications of chronic sinusitis and when to seek medical assistance.

**Outcomes**

Chronic sinusitis may be a benign disorder, but it has significant morbidity. If not treated, the quality of life is poor. The condition is known to exacerbate asthma and can even lead to meningitis and brain abscess formation- which increases morbidity and mortality. Patients with chronic sinusitis who are treated usually have satisfactory outcomes. Symptom relief can be obtained after functional endoscopic sinus surgery in about 75% of patients who fail to respond to medical management. In rare cases, chronic sinusitis can result in orbital and intracranial infections, leading to visual and neurological deficits.
