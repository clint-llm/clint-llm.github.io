As new viral variants emerge, the neutralizing effects of monoclonal antibodies can diminish. As mentioned, the FDA revoked its authorizations for previously authorized monoclonal antibodies as they did not maintain efficacy against the Omicron variant. With the dominance of this variant in the United States and the lack of readily available testing to identify the infecting variant, the FDA recommends against using any monoclonal antibody for treating acute COVID-19 illness.

It is important to note that the bulk of the data supporting the use of monoclonal antibodies for treating COVID-19 illness is either preliminary, unpublished, or has not been peer-reviewed. Nonetheless, monoclonal antibodies appear promising in treating infectious diseases, including COVID-19, and potentially may reduce hospitalizations and mortality.

**Summary**

- Monoclonal antibody therapy was previously indicated for use in nonhospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate disease who have risk factors for progression to severe disease.

- As of January 2023, due to the dominant circulating variants and subvariants, none of the previously authorized monoclonal antibodies are recommended for treating acute COVID-19 illness.

- Monoclonal antibodies to treat COVID-19 target the viral spike protein, preventing viral entry.

- Monoclonal antibody therapy has been shown to reduce deaths and hospitalizations in nonhospitalized patients with risk factors for severe disease progression.
