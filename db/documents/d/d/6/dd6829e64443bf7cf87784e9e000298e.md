**Laboratory Studies**

A complete blood count will demonstrate anemia and leukopenia in almost 75% of patients. Hypergammaglobulinemia is also present in 75% of patients with MCTD. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate presents as elevated in nearly all patients.

**Imaging Studies**

Chest X-ray: Chest X-ray helps in evaluation for pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, and cardiomegaly. Dilatation of the pulmonary artery can present in patients with pulmonary hypertension.

X-ray joints: X-ray of affected joints might reveal small, asymmetrical periarticular erosions. Soft tissue swelling, deformities, and destructive arthritis resembling psoriatic arthritis can present. Rarely periarticular osteopenia and aseptic necrosis may be found.

Echocardiogram: Echocardiogram shows Pericardial effusion, mitral valve prolapse, left ventricular hypertrophy, and changes secondary to pulmonary hypertension.

EKG: Abnormal EKGÂ findings include hemiblock, bundle branch block, atrioventricular block, changes secondary to pericarditis, and pericardial effusion.

Pulmonary function testing: Reduction in diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume, and six-minute walk tests occur in ILD.

Computed tomogram: High-resolution computed tomogram is very sensitive in diagnosing ILD. Common findings include ground-glass opacities, linear opacities, subpleural micronodules, septal thickening, traction bronchiectasis, usually with peripheral and lower lobe predominance. Honeycombing, airspace consolidation, emphysema, and centrilobular nodules are less common findings.

Angiogram: Medium-sized arterial occlusions can occur in patients with Raynaud phenomenon.

Right heart catheterization: Definitive diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in MCTD requires right heart catheterization demonstrating mean pulmonary arterial pressure at rest greater than 20 mmHg.
