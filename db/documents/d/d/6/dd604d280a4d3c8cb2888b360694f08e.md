Tympanic membrane rupture is generally easy to identify based on history and physical exam alone. However, there is other pathology that needs to be considered when assessing for TM perforation. Differential diagnosis includes AOM, otitis externa, traumatic otorrhea (CSF otorrhea), brain or inner ear neoplasm, posterior stroke, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, ear FB, auricular hematoma, bullous myringitis, labyrinthitis, cholesteatoma, and perilymphatic fistula, to name a few. A thorough history and physical exam can help narrow down the diagnosis.
