Meissner corpuscles, also known as Wagner-Meissner corpuscles or tactile corpuscles, are a subset of mechanoreceptors first described by Professor Georg Meissner and Professor Rudolf Wagner in 1852. Located in the dermal papillae of glabrous skin, these specialized encapsulated nerve endings relay fine touch and low-frequency vibration sensations to the central nervous system (CNS). Meissner corpuscles play an essential role in somatosensory acuity, especially in the digital extremities and palmar skin, meriting clinical significance for peripheral and diabetic neuropathy as well as age-related degeneration of dermatological tactile sensation.
