Before placement of a coronary sinus catheter to deliver retrograde cardioplegia it is important to review any imaging modalities available to ensure that there are no anatomical variants present. Specifically, a persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) can cause a significant problem with retrograde cardioplegia delivery.  In PLSVC the left brachiocephalic vein does not develop and therefore the left arm/head/neck venous drainage returns through the PLSVC and into the coronary sinus.  In patients with this anatomic variant, retrograde cardioplegia is not possible because the cardioplegia solution would not be traveling through just the coronary vessels and essentially given systemically.
