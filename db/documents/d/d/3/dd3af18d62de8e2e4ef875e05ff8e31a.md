The complication rate of traumatic mediastinal injuries is difficult to determine as the majority of these injuries occur concurrently with other injuries. Complications that occur in these patients can include bronchial or esophageal stricture. In addition, patients with tracheal or esophageal injury can develop tracheoesophageal fistulas. Patients with mediastinal trauma can develop empyema or ventilator-associated pneumonia. In addition, thoracic duct injury and chylothorax can also occur.
