Because LP may be a reaction to different exogenous agents such as viruses, drugs, or contact allergens, care should be taken to identify and treat any underlying causes before diagnosing idiopathic LP.

Various diseases that may appear similar to LP include LE, erythema dyschromicum perstans, psoriasis, secondary syphilis, pityriasis rosea, lichen nitidus, graft versus host disease, and keratosis lichenoides chronica. Hypertrophic LP can look very similar to lichen simplex chronicus. Vulvar LP can be difficult to distinguish from lichen sclerosis.

Differentiating between LP and LE can be a challenge when lesions are only present on the scalp or in the mouth, so biopsy with DIF is especially useful in those cases. The simultaneous presence of both diseases has been described in many reports, possibly related to the use of antimalarials in the treatment of LE.
