The liver breaks down glycogen to maintain adequate blood glucose levels, whereas, muscles break down glycogen to maintain energy for contraction.

Glycogen debranching enzyme is one of the few known proteins possessing two independent catalytic activities that occur at separate sites on a single polypeptide chain. The two activities are transferase and amylo-1,6-glucosidase. Both the debranching enzyme and phosphorylase enzyme are necessary for the complete degradation of glycogen.

Adrenal hormones, such as catecholamines and glucocorticoids, regulate hepatic glycogenolysis. Adenosine stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis through the secretion of corticosterone from the adrenal glands.

By responding to norepinephrine, via a cAMP-dependent mechanism, glycogenolysis contributes to stability maintenance during hypoglycemia. Glycogenolysis generates energy in the form of ATP, NADH, and lactate production.

Glycogenolysis is stimulated by glucagon, which is mediated by an intracellular increase of cAMP and Ca+2, which is mediated either by the adenylate cyclase or phospholipase C pathway. Glucagon activates adenylate cyclase via GR2 receptors. Adenylate cyclase converts ATP to cAMP, which activates PKA, which activates glycogenolysis enzymes via ATP-dependent phosphorylation.
