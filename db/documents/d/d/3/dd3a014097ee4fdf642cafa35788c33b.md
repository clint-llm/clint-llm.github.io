Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the result of the sudden loss of cerebral blood flow. Usually, there is cerebral artery thrombotic or embolic occlusion that corresponds with a loss of neurologic function. In general, ischemia leads to hypoxia and a decrease in cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which results in a lack of energy to maintain an ionic concentration gradient across the cellular membrane. Inhibition of the ion pump leads to cellular depolarization and influx of sodium and calcium ions and H2O into cells, leading to cytotoxic edema. The exact pathophysiology of ischemic stroke depends on the etiologic process. The differing etiologic subtypes that can lead to stroke include lacunar, cardioembolic, atherosclerotic, dissections, vasculitis, specific genetic disorders, idiopathic, etc.

The histopathological consequences of ischemic stroke can lead to deficits in cognitive and motor functionâ€”severe focal ischemia results in structural changes in both gray and white brain matter. Furthermore, changes develop in inflammatory, neuronal, vascular endothelial, and astrocytic cells. In white matter regions, axonal damage occurs with oligodendrocyte injury and subsequent demyelination. If the ischemic attack is less severe, there may be a selective neuronal injury to weak neuronal populations without damage to neighboring cells.
