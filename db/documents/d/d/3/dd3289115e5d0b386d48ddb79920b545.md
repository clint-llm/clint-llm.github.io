All basilar skull fractures warrant admission for observation and potential surgical treatment. The level of consciousness and additional intracranial injury play a large factor in the treatment of cribriform plate fracture. Conservative treatment tends to be chosen for those who initially present with a GCS >8. Most traumatic CSF leaks resolve spontaneously within the first seven days, and a lumbar drain may be employed to decrease intracranial pressure and facilitate spontaneous resolution

An endoscopic repair has been shown to be highly effective, with a resolution rate of greater than 95%, and requires no additional treatment. If fractures are in the extreme anterior cribriform, sufficient access may not be possible endoscopically, and an open surgical approach may be required. If an open approach is used, minimizing retraction of the frontal lobes is important to optimize the olfactory function and decrease the chance of postoperative frontal lobe syndrome
