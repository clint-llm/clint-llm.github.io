Neuromuscular blocking agents are commonly used to paralyze patients requiring intubation whether in an emergency as a life-saving intervention or as a scheduled surgery and procedure. The indications for intubation during an emergency can be divided into 3 categories: failure to maintain or protect the airway, failure to adequately ventilate or oxygenate, and anticipation of a decline in clinical status.

Pharmacologic paralysis is a vital aspect of rapid sequence intubation (RSI), improves visualization of the glottic anatomy, and prevents vomiting during intubation attempts. Importantly, the conjunctive use of induction agents is vital to RSI to reduce the sympathetic reflexes, improve intubating conditions, and avoid the unwarranted effect of paralyzing a conscious patient.

The most well-known depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent is succinylcholine. It is the only such drug used clinically and is considered by many the drug of choice for emergency department RSI, although this is controversial. It provides the fastest of optimal conditions during intubation of critically ill patients.
