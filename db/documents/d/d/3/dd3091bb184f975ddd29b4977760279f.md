The differential diagnosis hinges largely on the patient's history. Tarantulas are large, conspicuous spiders and are generally easily identifiable by adolescent and adult populations. However, one must also consider bites, stings, and exposures from other arthropods, including black widow spider bites, ant bites, and scorpion stings. Tissue necrosis secondary to envenomation can resemble cutaneous or deep space infections causing cellulitis, abscess, or necrotizing fasciitis. Local reactions due to urticating hairs can resemble contact dermatitis, urticaria, or systemic reactions such as anaphylaxis from other environmental sources. Ocular involvement can resemble keratitis or conjunctivitis acutely and can progress to resemble a granulomatous ocular disease of other etiology.Â Sometimes exposure to urticating hairs of other organisms, such as the spiny hairs of caterpillars, can cause similar reactions, including ophthalmia nodosa.
