Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the top infectious disease killer of HIV/AIDS patients worldwide. In 2014, 400,000 TB-related deaths occurred among people with HIV.

M. tuberculosis was the third most common infectious opportunistic infection of the eye after cytomegalovirus retinitis and ocular toxoplasmosis in this population.

Ophthalmologists play a special role in educating fellow providers and healthcare professionals about the possibility of ocular TB and its visual implications if gone undiagnosed. The retinal examination should be part of the basic initial workup for all patients with CD4 count less than 100 cells per ÂµL. In HIV patients coinfected with TB, there is concern that immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), worsens TB uveitis. Accordingly, in those patients, it is advisable to commence anti-TB treatment first and delay the start of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for 2-8 weeks, depending on the CD4 count.

Providers should refer TB and HIV coinfected individuals to infectious disease specialists to help manage medical treatment. Nurses and pharmacists also play a vital role in the administration of TST to HIV-infected patients. Local health officials should be contacted if an HIV patient, or any patient, tests positive for TB infection. The majority of states mandate the reporting of confirmed TB to the proper authorities within 24 hours.
