Evaluation in SHPT consists of monitoring the lab values of PTH, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D levels, and renal function.

Since it can present as bone mineral disorder and affect the musculoskeletal system, Kidney Disease for Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2017 recommends systematically performing bone mineral density in dialysis patients with bone mineralization disorders to assess the risk of pathological fracture.

There are certain striking radiological features in renal osteodystrophy. Osteosclerosis is increased bone density, especially in the axial skeleton, but bone is structurally weak and prone to stress fractures.

The brown tumor in SHPT is a lytic bone lesion caused by increased osteoclastic activity and proliferation of fibroblasts.

Osteitis fibrosa cystica is revealed on standard radiographs by subperiosteal resorption, especially at the distal phalanges, clavicles, distal ulna, and skull.

Periarticular, vascular, and more rarely, visceral metastatic calcifications can also be found.
