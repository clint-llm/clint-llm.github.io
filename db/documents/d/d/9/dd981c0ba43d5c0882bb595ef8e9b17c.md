Pediatric dosing based on age has the potential for suboptimal therapeutic levels due to the broad range of potential weight, especially with increasing childhood obesity. Young's Rule cannot be used for newborns, and consideration must be given to growth variability at the given age.

It should be noted that Young's Rule can be a guide for dosing but is not accurate for pediatric dose prediction. The activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes depends on age, leading to high inter- and intra-individual variability in the pediatric population.
