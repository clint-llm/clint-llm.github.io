Lactational mastitis is most commonly caused by bacteria that colonize the skin, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most common. Methicillin-resistant S. aureusÂ (MRSA) has become an increasingly common cause of mastitis, and risk factors for MRSA should be considered. Other causative organisms include Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides species, and Coagulase-negative staphylococci. Risk factors for lactational mastitis include prior history of mastitis, nipple cracks and fissures, inadequate milk drainage, maternal stress, lack of sleep, tight-fitting bras, and use of antifungal nipple creams.

The cause of periductal mastitis is not clear. However, many suggest that smoking may be associated with the development of the condition through direct damage to the ducts and subsequent inflammation. Bacteria are isolated in cultures in 62%-85% of patients with periductal mastitis, and the most common causative organisms include Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus, Bacteroides, and Proteus species.

The etiology of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) remains unclear. Autoimmune disease, trauma, lactation, oral contraceptive pill use, and hyperprolactinemia have all been implicated as possible causes.Corynebacterium, especially in patients with the histological findings of cystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis (CNGM).
