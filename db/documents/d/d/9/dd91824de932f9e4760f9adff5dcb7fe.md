Patients with Lesch Nyhan syndrome have a shorter life span, rarely surviving into their 30s. Renal failure is a major complication, but early diagnosis and prompt treatment with allopurinol have made this a rare cause of death. Reasons for death are respiratory failure and infections like pneumonia. Case reports have documented sudden unexpected death in some patients.
