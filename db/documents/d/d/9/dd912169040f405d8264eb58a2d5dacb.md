Epidermoid tumors originate from the inclusion of ectodermal elements within the neural groove. Inclusion of epithelium may occur while the neural tube is folding, but some authors proposed that it may occur earlier during the gastrulation period.

Rarely, an epidermoid can be formed if epithelial cells are introduced into the brain during a surgical procedure or after a traumatic brain injury. These rare cases are the only ones not having a congenital origin.
