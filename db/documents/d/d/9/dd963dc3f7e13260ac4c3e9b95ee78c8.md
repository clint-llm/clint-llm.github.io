Pes planus is a relatively common foot deformity that refers to the loss of the medial longitudinal arch of the foot, resulting in this region of the foot coming closer to the ground or making contact with the contacting the ground. The medial longitudinal arch of the foot is a tough, elastic connection of ligaments, tendons, and fascia between the forefoot and the hindfoot. It serves as an adaptive support base for the entire body, functions to dissipate the forces of weight-bearing and acts to store energy during the gait cycle. Dysfunction of the arch complex is usually asymptomatic but can alter the biomechanics of the lower limbs and lumbar spine causing an increased risk of pain and injury. This activity describes the presentation, evaluation, and management of pes planus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the causes of pes planus.
- Outline the presentation of a patient with pes planus.
- Review the treatment options for pes planus.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of pes planus and optimize patient outcomes.
