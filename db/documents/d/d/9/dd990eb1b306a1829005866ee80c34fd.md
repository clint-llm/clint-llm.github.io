Patient education becomes paramount regarding the etiology of their disease, especially for those with malignancy-related hypercalcemia. An interdisciplinary team involving oncology, nephrology, and endocrinology is often required to ensure adequate and well-coordinated care. Patients should be made aware of the mortality associated with severe hypercalcemia. Also, all available treatment options, including hemodialysis or parathyroidectomy, should be discussed, especially in cases of persistent/ resistant hypercalcemia.
