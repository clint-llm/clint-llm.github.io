The primary target of TSH is the thyroid gland. Specifically, TSH modulates the release of T3 and T4 from thyroid follicular cells. Around 80% of the thyroid hormone is released as T4. T4 is de-iodinated to T3, which is a more potent thyroid hormone. Even though only about 20% of T3 originates from the thyroid gland, 80% comes from peripheral conversion via a deiodinase. More than 99% of thyroid hormones bind to thyroid-binding globulin, prealbumin, and albumin, and only 1% circulates freely in the blood. Once T3 binds to its receptor in the nucleus, it activates DNA transcription, followed by mRNA translation, and new protein synthesis. These new proteins influence many organ systems, promoting growth as well as bone and central nervous system (CNS) maturation. T3 and T4 act on almost all cells in the body to increase the basal metabolic rate. Specifically, they increase the synthesis of Na?/K?-ATPase, leading to an increase in oxygen consumption and heat production. They also act on B1 receptors in the heart to increase heart rate and contractility through increasing the number of beta-1 receptors on the myocardium such that the myocardium is more sensitive to stimulation by the sympathetic nervous system. Thyroid hormones also activate metabolism, with an increase in glucose absorption, glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and protein synthesis and degradation (net catabolic).
