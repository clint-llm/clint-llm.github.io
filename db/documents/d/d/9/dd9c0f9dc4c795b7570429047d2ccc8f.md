The most common cause of piebaldism is a mutation in the KIT proto-oncogene. During embryogenesis, the KIT ligand produced within a dermatomyotome binds to the KIT receptor (a tyrosine kinase receptor) on melanoblasts and melanocytes, allowing for survival and migration along a given dermatomyotome. Mutations in KIT within the 4q12 locus lead to abnormal melanocyte migration and the absence of melanocytes in the ventral midline of the epidermis. This absence leads to the characteristic central leukoderma and poliosis seen in piebaldism.
