The UM process has several readily identifiable stakeholder groups that each have an interest in understanding the UM process. First, patients and their families are likely to have minimal contact with the UM process, all the while the decisions made may have a significant impact on the types and locations of care and service provided. It would be important for patients and families to stay informed of what UM processes are in play as they access their health care benefits. Second, health care professionals and institutions in which they work are engaged with the UM process, likely daily. Health care professionals and institutions need to understand the process and to co-operate effectively. With an eye towards quality improvement and enhanced patient experience, it would be ideal for those professionals and institutions to make full use of the data that emerges from the UM process to improve care and safety were ever possible.

Participating in the UM process around the identification and implementation of national standards of care is one obvious possibility, and with UM's focus on both overutilization and underutilization of health care services, quality improvement projects are likely to emerge. Third, those professionals and organizations that conduct UM have a responsibility to oversee the UM process in an ethical manner that respects the legitimate rights and obligations for all of the stakeholders involved. Finally, those who pay for health care benefits and health care services, namely employers and purchasers also have a responsibility to make sure that any UM processes done on their behalf are useful and contributing to the delivery of efficient and effective health care services to those for home health care is purchased.

One ongoing concern relates to how UM programs might create unintended consequences emanating from the financial incentives and disincentives on health care professionals' decisions around care and service delivery. The literature evaluating the impact that UM determinations might have on professionals and institutions' behaviors and care process is mixed in terms of measuring a positive, negative, or neutral effect.
