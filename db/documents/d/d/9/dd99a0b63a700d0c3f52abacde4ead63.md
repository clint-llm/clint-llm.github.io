The liver receives a dual blood supply with 75% to 80% of the blood volume coming from the portal vein and 20% to 25% coming from the hepatic artery. The portal vein is formed from the superior mesenteric and splenic veins posterior to the neck of the pancreas. It is joined by the proper hepatic artery, a branch of the celiac trunk, and the common bile duct to form the portal triad which is enclosed in the hepatoduodenal ligament. Within the portal triad and associated branches, the bile is leaving the liver in the bile ducts while the portal vein and hepatic artery are delivering blood to the liver; this creates countercurrent flow which allows for the optimized exchange of electrolytes, bile acids, and other compounds.

Venous drainage of the liver occurs primarily via the left, right, and middle hepatic veins. The left hepatic vein accounts for 20.7% of the venous drainage and primarily drains the left lobe of the liver. The middle hepatic vein accounts for 32.7% of hepatic drainage and drains the middle portions of the left and right lobes of the liver. The right hepatic vein accounts for 39.6% of drainage and drains the lateral portion of the right lobe of the liver. The caudate lobe of the liver drains into the middle hepatic vein in most cases, though some cases drain directly into the retrohepatic portion of the inferior vena cava.
