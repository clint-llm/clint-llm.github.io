The pituitary gland is located within the sella turcica, a bony depression in the sphenoid bone. The pituitary gland is divided into anterior and posterior segments. The anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) is comprised of glandular tissue, while the posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis) is comprised of neural tissue. The pituitary gland is connected to the hypothalamus through the pituitary stalk. The pituitary stalk has a portal circulation for the anterior pituitary and neuronal connection for the posterior pituitary. The anterior pituitary gland is regulated by hormones secreted by the hypothalamus, while the posterior pituitary hormones are produced by the hypothalamus itself and are subsequently stored in the posterior pituitary for release.

Pituitary tumors arising from the anterior pituitary gland account for approximately 15% of intracranial neoplasms and are usually benign tumors.

Here we present an overview of pituitary cancer, including its epidemiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, available predictive markers, current, and emerging treatment options, as well as prognosis.
