Complications of lower extremity nerve blocks are few.

- Hypercoagulable state - lower extremity nerve blocks may blind practitioners to the early signs and symptoms of a deep venous thrombosis in patients at high risk for venous thromboembolism.

- Thrombocytopenia or anticoagulation may predispose to bleeding at the injection site and subsequent complications.

- Preexisting skin infections at the injection site frequently result in seeding the lower extremity or nerve, predisposing to deep infection.

- Patients with a demonstrated drug allergy to the anesthetic agent of choice should not undergo a lower extremity block due to the risk of anaphylaxis or other allergic response.
