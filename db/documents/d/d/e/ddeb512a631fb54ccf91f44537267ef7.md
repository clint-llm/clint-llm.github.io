Venous sinus thromboses are venous blood clots of the major veins of the brain. They can be provoked or unprovoked, and the signs and symptoms thereof will depend on the location and extent of the clot. Common locations for sinus thrombosis include the dural sinuses, the cavernous sinus, and deep sinuses of the cortex. This activity describes the evaluation and management of venous sinus thrombosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of venous sinus thrombosis.
- Summarize the three most common venous sinus thrombosis syndromes and their presentations of dural sinus thrombosis.
- Identify when it is important to pursue further testing for an underlying hypercoagulable state in dural sinus thrombosis.
- Review the importance of communication among the interprofessional team that will help improve the outcomes of patients suffering from venous sinus thrombosis.
