Portal hypertension is the hemodynamic dysfunction commonly associated with liver cirrhosis and a clinical manifestation of noncirrhotic hepatic and extrahepatic disorders.

The pathophysiology of portal hypertension in cirrhotic patients is explained by various factors that include decreased tone of the hepatic vasculature from endothelial dysfunction due to disequilibrium between vasoconstrictors and vasodilators and increased hepatic resistance to portal blood flow from cellular damage, fibrosis, and regenerative nodular formation.

The ensuing portal hypertension also results in spontaneous portosystemic collateral shunts between the splenic vein and the left renal vein, commonly referred to as gastro-renal shunts. These collateral shunts mediated by angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGFR-2 are commonly seen in approximately 85% of patients with gastric varices.

The increased pressure and portal blood flow in the portosystemic circulation due to the above factors lead to gastric varices causing elevated intra-variceal pressure and wall tension, increasing the risk of variceal rupture leading to a life-threatening GI bleed.

Alternatively, gastric varices can also occur in the absence of cirrhosis and normal HVPG due to segmental portal hypertension from any obstruction in the splenic vein, such as thrombosis and stenosis sequela of pancreatic pathology (pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocysts, or neoplasms).
