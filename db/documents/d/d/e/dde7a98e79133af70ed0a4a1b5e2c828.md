Cyclic breast pain, which is related to hormonal changes, is predominantly associated with the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and improves with the onset of menses. The periodic discomfort is because of the increase in estrogen level that stimulates the ductal elements of the breast, while simultaneously, there is a decrease in progesterone stimulation of stroma. A concurrent increase in prolactin, causing increased ductal secretion, also contributes towards pain and swelling during this phase. Association of cyclic mastalgia with the use of hormonal therapy such as oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, with its resolution during pregnancy/lactation and menopause also justifies its hormonal etiology.

Non-Cyclic breast pain is not hormone-related and may be inflammatory, vascular, muscular, or neoplastic in origin. It has an unusual pattern with intermittent or constant pain, a variable location, and most likely unilateral. A few of the common causes include breast cyst, fat necrosis due to trauma, mastitisÂ or breast abscess, duct ectasia [because of duct dilation with periductal inflammation], and costochondritis or chest pain due to angina.

Some other causes like the consumption of high-fat content diet, smoking, drinking caffeinated beverages, and use of certain medications (antidepressants, antibiotics, antihistamine) have also been linked with mastalgia, but their exact pathophysiology is unknown.
