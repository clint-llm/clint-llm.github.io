Patients with stress ulceration usually have a poor prognosis secondary to the underlying critical illness. Moreover, GI bleeds in these patients secondary to stress-related mucosal disease are independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality.  These patients are often too unstable for advanced endoscopic or surgical procedures to suppress GI bleed, leading to worse outcomes. Hence, aggressive prophylactic measures for the appropriate patient population at risk of developing stress ulceration remain the cornerstone in the management of stress-induced gastropathy.
