Treatment for congenital syphilis when the disease is confirmed or likely to be present is:

- Infants up to 4 weeks of age: Aqueous crystalline penicillin G, 50,000 units/kg per dose intravenously every 12 hours in the first seven days of life. After 7 days of life, 50,000 units/kg per dose intravenously (IV) every 8 hours for 10 to 14 days. Alternatively, procaine penicillin G, 50,000 units/kg/day intramuscularly for 10 to 14 days.

- Infants older than 4 weeks and older children: Aqueous penicillin G, 50,000 units/kg per dose every 6 hours intravenously for 10 to 14 days.

The management of an asymptomatic infant potentially exposed to syphilis but unlikely to have the disease is controversial. These are infants of mothers who received adequate treatment more than 4 weeks before delivery. However, most experts and the CDC recommends benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg per dose intramuscularly (IM) in a single dose in these asymptomatic children.
