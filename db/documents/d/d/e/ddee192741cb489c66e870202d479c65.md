Cholecalciferol, also known as vitamin D3, is a secosteroid produced by the skin and can also be present in certain foods such as dairy products, eggs, and fish. Its primary function is to maintain normal calcium and phosphate levels in the serum. During winter and in areas with minimal sun exposure, dietary supplementation is necessary for optimal musculoskeletal health.

The labeled indication for cholecalciferol is dietary supplementation. The off-label indications for cholecalciferol include hypothyroidism, prevention of osteoporosis, and Vitamin D insufficiency/ deficiency in both healthy patients or those with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Aside from its known role in bone mineral metabolism, various studies have found a link between cholecalciferol supplementation and favorable prognoses of different diseases such as hypertension, type 1 and 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polycystic ovarian syndrome (POS), multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and various dermatologic diseases.
