Mycobacterium avium complex consists of multiple nontuberculosis mycobacterial species (NTM), which cannot be distinguished in the microbiology laboratory and requires genetic testing.A newcomer to the Mycobacterium avium complex is the Mycobacterium paraintracellulare, identified in pulmonary infections in Southeast Asia in 2016. M. avium complex is the most common cause of nontuberculosis mycobacterial species infections in humans, and respiratory system is the most common site of infection. This activity reviews the presentation and pathophysiology of mycobacterium avium intracellulare and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Mycobacterium avium intracellulare.
- Review the presentation of a patient with Mycobacterium avium intracellulare.
- Summarize the treatment of Mycobacterium avium intracellulare.
- Outline modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by Mycobacterium avium intracellulare.
