The mechanism of action of omalizumab is different for allergic asthma vs. chronic urticaria.

The direct action involves selectively binding to the C-epsilon-3 locus, the domain at which IgE binds to Fc-epsilon-RI,Â decreasing levels of the immunoglobulin, and preventing interactions with its high-affinity receptor, as stated earlier, primarily on eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells interrupting the allergic cascade. Also, due to the total reduction of free IgE, there is a reduction in the expression of the IgE high-affinity receptor on inflammatory cells and a reduction in peripheral eosinophilia.

With regards to chronic urticaria, the mechanism is not as well understood; unlike in asthma, where a 95% reduction in serum IgE levels is required to modify allergen response, in chronic urticaria, it is not a classic allergen-driven response, and a fixed dose of omalizumab has approval for use.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Omalizumab administration is via subcutaneous injection. Absorption into the systemic circulation is rather slow, with peak serum concentrations achieved after an average of 7 to 8 days. Omalizumab demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics in the approved dosage regimens. IgG clearance process, as well as specific binding and complex formation with IgE, are involved in omalizumab clearance. The mean half-life is 26 days.
