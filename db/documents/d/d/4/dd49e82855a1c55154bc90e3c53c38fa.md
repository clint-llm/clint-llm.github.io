Microtia reconstruction is one of the most complex procedures in plastic surgery. It requires much experience in order to avoid the many potential complications of autologous cartilage reconstruction. Understanding the timing of the surgeries as well as collaboration between plastic and otologic surgeons is extremely important in order to produce consistently excellent results. Many of the principles discussed here are also applicable to auricular reconstruction for defects of other etiologies, particularly oncologic resection and avulsive trauma.
