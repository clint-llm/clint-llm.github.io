The best way to decrease morbidity and mortality from aspergillosis is to place hospitalized patients at risk of invasive aspergillosis in private rooms with HEPA filtration, lowering fungi concentration.

In select patients, prophylactic antifungal therapy decreases the risk of fungal infections. Antifungal prophylaxis with voriconazole or posaconazole is recommended for patients with several risk factors. These include prolonged periods of neutropenia from chemotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, severe or prolonged graft-versus-host disease, lung transplant within the first 3-4 months post-transplantation, and some other solid organ transplant recipients.Aspergillus airway colonization within the first six months of transplant or that have received increased immunosuppression for rejection within the last three months, it is recommended that they preemptively receive a course of antifungal therapy.
