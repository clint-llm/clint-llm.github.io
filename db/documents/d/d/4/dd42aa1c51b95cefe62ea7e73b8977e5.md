The veins in the upper extremity drain the deoxygenated blood. The drainage of blood allows for oxygenated blood to flow into the upper extremity. The veins do not perfuse the upper extremity with blood.

The lymphatics of the upper extremity follows closely with the veins. The lymphatics drainage start at the hand and drains toward the heart. The superficial lymphatic vessels on the radial side follow closely with the cephalic vein. The superficial lymphatic vessels on the radial side of the hand will drain into the infraclavicular lymph node. The lymphatics of the medial side of the hand follow the basilic vein and drain into the supratrochlear lymph nodes. The supratrochlear lymph nodes are above the medial epicondyle of the humerus.Â The supratrochlear lymph nodes will eventually drain into the axillary lymph nodes.

The deep lymphatic vessels follow closely with the deep veins. The deep lymphatic drainage is directed towards the axillary lymph nodes. The lymph drainage of the upper extremity will eventually return to the central circulation via the right lymphatic duct or the thoracic duct. The right lymphatic duct drains the right upper extremity, while the thoracic duct drains the left.
