Sick sinus syndrome or sinus node dysfunction is primarily a disease of the elderly population. It results from the degeneration of the SA node affecting its ability to generate or transmit impulses to the atrial tissue. Sinus node dysfunction has several characteristic rhythm disturbances manifesting in symptoms of organ hypo-perfusion. The main treatment of sick sinus syndrome is permanent pacemaker; it is usually done after secondary causes are ruled out. The risk of sudden cardiac death with sinus node dysfunction is low.
