PHH is not well-described in the literature, but like any other DH, they can be congenital or acquired. The two most common Congenital defects are Bochdalek hernia, a posterolateral defect (due to failure of pleuroperitoneal folds and persistent pneumoenteric recess), and Morgagni hernia, an anteromedial defect  (due to failure of septum transversum), both mostly occur on the left side. The acquired defects are secondary to trauma, post esophageal surgery, or due to progressive weakness within the muscles.

Based on established embryological evidence in the literature regarding diaphragmatic hernias, it can only be concluded that congenital PHH is a posteromedial defect (due to failure in the development of dorsal mesentery) within the diaphragm.
