The persistence of this condition is an important communication event in a hematopathologist's diagnostic days.  Patients who develop this condition may be at risk for subsequent progression to AML.  Therefore, communication between the pathologist and hematologist/primary care physician is essential. Once a case of RARs is a consideration as a differential diagnosis, communication that a careful evaluation of the peripheral smear with iron staining performed is in order, as well as ancillary mutational analysis for SF3B. Treatment will often be determined by the clinician shortly after the review of the peripheral blood smear.
