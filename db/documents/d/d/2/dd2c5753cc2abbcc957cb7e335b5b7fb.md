- Non-invasive testing can be performed at 10 weeks of gestation. This tests for cell-free DNA in the plasma of pregnant women and helps identify certain anomalies or diseases.

- Amniocentesis, which is usually performed between 14 and 20 weeks, is the sampling of the amniotic fluid to screen for fetal anomalies. This is a diagnostic test.

- First-trimester testing looks for the risk of trisomy 21, trisomy 18, trisomy 13, and other neural tube defects.

- Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a hormone that is elevated in amniotic fluid in anomalies of the CNS and ventral abdominal wall. It is decreased when the fetus has trisomy 21, trisomy 18, or other chromosomal defects.

- Anatomy sonogram can be performed throughout pregnancy, but particularly between weeks 16 to 22 to estimate the fetal weight and gestational age using measurements from:

- Head circumference

- Biparietal diameter

- Femur length (from epiphysis to epiphysis)

- Abdominal circumference

Although beyond the scope of this article, there is also a Quad-screen test that can be performed in the second trimester. The components of this screening test include AFP, hCG, Estriol, and Inhibin-A.
