The autonomic nervous system exerts influence over the organ systems of the body to upregulate and downregulate various functions. The two aspects of the ANS operate as opposing functions that act to achieve homeostasis. This next section will discuss this in terms of its divisions, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.

The sympathetic nervous system, also known as the “fight or flight” system, increases energy expenditure and inhibits digestion. The following changes take place on activation of the sympathetic nervous system:

- Heart rate and cardiac muscle contractility increase

- The ciliary muscle relaxes, and the pupil becomes dilated for the betterment of far vision.

- Bronchodilation of the lungs

- Decreased GI motility

- Decreased urine output

- Relaxation of the detrusor muscle of the bladder and contraction of urethral sphincters

- Increased secretions from sweat glands

- Increased blood flow to muscles because of relaxation of arterioles

- Dilation of coronary arteries

- Constriction of large arteries and large veins

- Increased metabolism

- Increased glucose production and mobilization by the liver

- Increased lipolysis within fat tissue, ejaculation

- Suppression of the immune system

These changes function to increase movement and strength. Stressful situations that threaten survival, exercise, or the moments just before wakening are just a few examples of increases in sympathetic nervous system activity.

The parasympathetic nervous system, also known as “rest and digest,” can be thought of as functioning in opposition to the sympathetic nervous system. Its functions include:

- A decrease in heart rate and contractility of cardiac muscle

- Constriction of the ciliary muscle and the pupil for near vision

- Increased secretion by lacrimal glands and salivary glands

- Increased gut motility, bronchoconstriction of the lungs

- Contraction of the detrusor muscle with the relaxation of urethral sphincters

- Glycogen synthesis by the liver

- Swelling of the clitoris and erection of the penis

- Activation of the immune system

The parasympathetic nervous system does not appear to exert much control over vascular tone as the sympathetic nervous system does.
