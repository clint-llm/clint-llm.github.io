Gastrocnemius tears can result in significant functional impairment for athletes, if not diagnosed and treated appropriately. Interprofessional communication and patient education are essential. The condition can be recognized and treated by multiple clinicians to include primary care physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, orthopedics surgeons, and physical therapists. It is important to rule out emergent conditions such as acute compartment syndrome or deep vein thrombosis and to distinguish the injury from a calcaneal tendon rupture. With adequate interprofessional communication and patient education, gastrocnemius tears can be diagnosed and treated in a timely fashion to improve patient recovery.
