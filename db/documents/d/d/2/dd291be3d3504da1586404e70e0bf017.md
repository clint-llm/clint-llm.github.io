The overall prognosis of a giant cell tumor of bone is good, though local recurrence can vary widely. This determination is primarily from the extent of the resection (wide local excision with the lowest rate but higher morbidity) and whether there was the use of an adjuvant in addition to the surgery. A GCTB located near the spinal cord carries a poorer prognosis and has a high rate of local recurrence.
