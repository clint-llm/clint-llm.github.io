The 'five rights' first have important clinical significance by their integration into the methodologies used for instructing nursing students about the applications of the 'rights' framework in clinical practice. Traditionally, nurses learn to administer medications in a laboratory setting before working with patients in clinical settings.

The nursing instructor's role of providing students with clinical scenarios that force nursing trainees to make decisions in unclear clinical situations, function as a competent member of an interprofessional team, and practice with advanced types of medication administrations has been stated as a pivotal role in teaching future nurses about the rights of medication administration.

In practice, the innovation of modern technologies has contributed to helping nurses clinically apply the five rights in everyday practice. An example of modern technology is barcode medication administration (BCMA), which allows nurses to verify the five rights of medication administration by electronically scanning a patient's wristband to confirm the information and crossmatch with a patient's electronic medical chart.

Computerized provider order entry (CPOE) with clinical decision support (CDS) also aid healthcare providers with prescribing.

Estimates are that in 2014 approximately 5.5 million medication-related alerts were inappropriately overridden, resulting in approximately 196,600 adverse drug events nationally, costing between $871 million and $1763 million.
