Currently, there are no guidelines in place for monitoring CGRP receptors-acting drugs. However, the general monitoring of responsiveness to monoclonal antibodies (erenumab, eptinezumab, galcanezumab, and fremanezumab) against the CGRP receptor is by periodic assessment of changes in mean Monthly Migraine Days (MMD) or monthly Migraine Physical Function Impact Diary (MPFID) activity scores. Changes in these values usually occur 3 to 4 months after starting the drug.

In the case of gepants, the drug's effect can be monitored by the reduction in pain 2 hours post-dose and freedom from the patients' most bothersome symptom (which may include photophobia, nausea, phonophobia).

Several co-morbidities may also arise in patients over time, and timely modification or discontinuation of these drugs should follow accordingly.
