The prognosis for patients with spinal cord injury is very poor. Unfortunately, there is no definite treatment leading to recovery for SCI. Less than 1% of patients with SCI recover complete function before the time of hospital discharge. The level of disability suffered directly correlates to the level of injury, with higher-level injuries resulting in more significant disability and higher complication rates. Patients will SCI suffer significantly increased mortality in the first year following injury, and those that survive still have decreased life expectancy. Only 12% go on to hold employment, and less than one half will get married.
