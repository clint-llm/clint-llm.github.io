A considerable amount of appropriately calibrated and maintained equipment is required during the hearing aid fitting process. They are:

- Computer with installed hearing aid fitting and verification software

- Hearing aid programming cables or wireless link device

- Hearing aid(s) selected for features such as power, size, color, connectivity to additional devices, FM compatibility, tamper-proofing

- Couplings such as earmould or slim tubes for behind-the-ear devices

- If real-ear measurements are used: a test box and/or hearing aid verification equipment, real-ear measurement tubing, real-ear-to-coupler-difference tube

Additionally, the following may be helpful to the clinician:

- Demo hearing aid to visually orientate the family

- Written instructions and information

- Hearing aid maintenance pack, which often includes: tubing puffer, battery checker or charger (for rechargeable hearing aids), moisture-removing tablets, cleaning tools, antiseptic wipes, stetoclip, hearing aid case

- Retention devices such as toupee tape, hearing aid clothing clips, loop retainers

- Speech testing materials

- FM 'shoes'/'socks'/'boots' and ear-level receivers

- Medical tape to help hold the real-ear-measurement tube in place
