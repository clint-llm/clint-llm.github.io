Dysdiadochokinesia and cerebellar ataxia are challenging to treat, and the underlying etiology requires attention. Physical, speech, and occupational therapy, including strength training, balance exercises, treadmill, cycling, and Romberg exercises, can help improve functional outcomes in patients with cerebellar lesions. Home safety evaluation and durable medical equipment may be necessary to prevent falls.
