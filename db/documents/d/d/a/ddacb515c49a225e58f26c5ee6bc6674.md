The majority of patients with uncomplicated acute mastoiditis have a resolution of symptoms with conservative measures, including antibiotics, steroids, and myringotomy, without the need for mastoidectomy. However, research in conservative versus invasive treatment for acute mastoiditis is lacking. Additionally, it is critical to monitor patients who are receiving treatment for acute mastoiditis, particularly in the first 48 hours. In cases where the patient's clinical status does not change or deteriorates from admission, mastoidectomy is then indicated.
