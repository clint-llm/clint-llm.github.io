Rufinamide, in general, does not require any routine ancillary monitoring except for the clinical evaluation, such as seizure frequency and duration. As with other AEDs, patients can experience behavioral changes and/or suicidal ideation, dermatological reactions, e.g., rash.

There are no well-established therapeutic levels of rufinamide. In one of the clinical trials, the plasma concentration for rufinamide ranged from 4.95 to 48.15 ug/ml during the maintenance period.

In general, the drug-drug interactions with rufinamide are very limited.

Rufinamide itself is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 iso-enzyme. Still, it has few drug-drug interactions with other AEDs, which metabolize through the same enzyme system as carbamazepine oxcarbazepine, zonisamide, tiagabine, topiramate, etc. The P450 enzyme inducers (like phenytoin and phenobarbital) can decrease rufinamide levels by 25 to 45%. Rufinamide can render oral contraceptive pills (OCP) less effective by increasing their clearance, especially ethinyl estradiol, norethindrone, and triazolam.
