Central precocious puberty

The decision to treat depends on the age of the child and the progression of puberty. If the child has rapidly progressing symptoms or if bone age is significantly advanced, consider treatment. The main goals of treatment are to preserve the adult height and to alleviate the associated psychosocial stress. GnRH agonists are the standard of care.

GnRH agonist therapy is generally considered safe, with no reported significant adverse events. The most common adverse events include local skin reactions (intramuscular pain, sterile abscesses) and post-menopausal symptoms (hot flushes).

While on treatment, periodic monitoring of pubertal progression, growth velocity, and skeletal maturation are necessary.

Peripheral Precocious puberty

Treatment is directed towards eliminating the source of sex steroids. Surgery is indicated in gonadal and adrenal tumors.  If exogenous sources of sex steroids are identified, they should be eliminated. Classic congenital CAH is treated with glucocorticoids. In McCune-Albright syndrome, some benefit occurs with blocking the estrogen synthesis using aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole) and selective estrogen selective receptor modulator (tamoxifen).  The optimal treatment for familial male-limited precocious puberty is not well established, but the preferred treatment is a combination of an androgen antagonist (spironolactone) and an aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, testolactone).
