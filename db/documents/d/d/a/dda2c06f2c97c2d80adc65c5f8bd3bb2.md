Since onchocerciasis presents with both dermatological and ophthalmological manifestations, differentiating each of them in isolation is sometimes very challenging. Skin features like pruritus may be due to allergic reactions from several sources.

- Subcutaneous nodules may be due to other subcutaneous cystic or non-cystic lesions. A list of some subcutaneous nodules includes the following (this is by no means exhaustive)

- Inflammatory or reactive

- Granulomatous: rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
- Panniculitis: erythema nodosum, nodular panniculitis
- Systemic vasculitis: polyarteritis nodosum,Â granulomatosis with polyangiitis


- Metabolic and storage disorders: gout, calcinosis
- Others: osteoarthritis, foreign bodies

- Infectious

- Bacterial: treponemes, subacute bacterial endocarditis
- Fungal: sporotrichosis, coccidioidomycosis
- Mycobacterial: tuberculosis, leprosy
- Viral: hepatitis B, hepatitis C
- Parasitic: amebiasis, Chagas disease

- Tumors

- Benign: lipoma, neuroma, nevus, ganglion cyst, bony exostosis, schwannoma
- Malignant: sarcoma, leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma, basal cell carcinoma

- Ocular lesions seen in onchocerciasis are not unique to the disease. Uveitis, cataract, glaucoma, and other posterior segment changes may all be due to causes other than onchocerciasis. Other helminthic infestations are important differential diagnoses of onchocerciasis and include hookworm infestations, schistosomiasis, sparganosis, and cestodes.
