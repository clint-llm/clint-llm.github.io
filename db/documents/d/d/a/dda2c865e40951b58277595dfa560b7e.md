The development of sucking by itself is a primitive reflex that appears early in infants. Sucking behavior in children is associated with self-comfort and security feeling. Caregivers commonly introduce pacifiers to help the infants calm down when agitated. A study done in Italy by Ferrante et al. reported that thumb sucking behavior in their study was initiated to stimulate the nasopalatal receptors and receive muscular balance to release psychological and physical tension.
