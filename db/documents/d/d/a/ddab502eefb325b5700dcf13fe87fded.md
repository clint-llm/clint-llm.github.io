The management of HD is challenging and complex. While once the domain of the neurologist, today, it is realized that treatment may also require the expertise of a psychologist, psychiatrist, physiatrist, internist, family practitioner, and social worker. Periodic evaluations should be made to address the severity of chorea, gait problems, rigidity, behavioral changes, and cognitive decline. To improve outcomes, the European Huntington disease network provided evidence-based recommendations in the treatment of HD (See: treatment and management).

The roles of the nurse, social worker, and pharmacist are critical. The nurses will assist the team by monitoring the patient for pain, atelectasis, and deep vein thrombosis. The social worker will provide the patient and the caregiver all the necessary help and equipment to improve the quality of life. The pharmacist will be involved in the multiple medication therapies needed for these patients to improve the symptoms. The need for meticulous planning and discussion with other professionals involved in the management of the patient is highly recommended to lower the morbidity and improve outcomes.
