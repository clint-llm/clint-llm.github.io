Complications of untreated depression are similar to those complications of other untreated mental illnesses. It is commonly accepted that untreated depression broadly impacts healthcare resulting in increased healthcare costs as well as decreased medication adherence and treatment compliance in those with medical problems. In multiple studies, depression has been shown to lead to additive functional impairment and increase symptom burden in those with chronic medical illnesses. Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that depression increases mortality.
