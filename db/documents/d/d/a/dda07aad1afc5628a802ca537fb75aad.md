Untreated esophageal stricture related complications:

- Food impaction

- Food particle aspiration

- Asthma from aspiration

- Severe chest pain

- Esophageal perforation from long-standing inflammation

- Fistula formation

Iatrogenic complication from stricture dilation and stent placement:

- Esophageal perforation

- Bleeding

- Hemorrhage

- Anesthesia-related complications (such as respiratory failure, sedation)

- Aspiration pneumonia

- Bacteremia - 22% of cases develop transient bacteremia from esophageal dilation

- It is usually associated with malignant stricture dilation and multiple dilations
- Periprocedural antibiotics are usually recommended to avoid this

- Re-stricture formation

- New stricture formation

- Traumatic stent removal

- Epithelization of the uncovered stent

- Displacement of stent proximally which could potentially cause choking sensation and difficulty in breathing
