The mouth is the most common location for involvement with cicatricial pemphigoid. It may be the only site affected. All areas of the oral cavity may be involved including the buccal mucosa, gingiva, tongue, vermillion lips, and palate.

Cicatricial pemphigoid of the ocular mucosa is often progressive. Scar formation can result in blindness. Inflammation may be slowly progressive. The patient may experience non-specific symptoms of eye irritation, such as burning or excessive tearing.

Nasopharyngeal involvement is less common. It may present as crusted nasal lesions, epistasis, or chronic sinusitis.

Esophageal involvement may present as pain, dysphagia, odynophagia, and stenosis.

Cicatricial pemphigoid of the genital and anal mucosa is rare. Erosions and ulcerations can lead to considerable discomfort of the genital skin. Scarring can lead to narrowing of the urethra and vaginal opening. Stenosis of these structures may require surgical intervention to restore function.

Cutaneous lesions of cicatricial pemphigoid occur in two clinical presentations. The first subtype presents as a more generalized eruption of tense bullae without scarring. The second subtype presents as blisters on an erythematous base occurring in localized areas, resulting in atrophic scarring. This most commonly affects the head and neck area. Activity in the scalp often leads to alopecia.
