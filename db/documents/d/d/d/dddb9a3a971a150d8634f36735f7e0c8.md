S. schenckii is evident as budding yeasts which may be round to oval in both human and animal tissues. The transition from mold to yeast form is seen by culturing mycelia at 37 degrees. This transition in S. cases is regulated by calcium which induces RNA and protein synthesis on the yeast cell. Microscopically, the yeast form is cigar-shaped and exhibits narrow-based budding.
