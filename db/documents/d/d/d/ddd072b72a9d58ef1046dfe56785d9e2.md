Patients may either be symptomatic or asymptomatic and can vary depending on the involvement of the arterial segment. Most common symptoms are similar to atherosclerotic disease including transient ischemic attack, stroke, and hypertension. Nonspecific symptoms include dizziness, headaches, tinnitus, chest pain and shortness of breath. On physical exam, Horner syndrome (generally limited to ptosis and miosis) can be noted, most likely due from pressure on the sympathetic fibers from the carotid artery. Reports of bruits in the carotids, epigastrium, and flanks also exist. Cranial nerve abnormalities and other neurologic deficits, as well as carotid bruit,  have also been described.
