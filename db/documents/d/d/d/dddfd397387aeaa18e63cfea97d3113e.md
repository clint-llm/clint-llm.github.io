Histologically, atrophy of the spleen is evident by degeneration of white pulp (i.e., decreased periarteriolar lymphatic sheaths, or PALS, decreased follicles, germinal centers, and marginal zones). Decreased amounts of hematopoietic components characterize red pulp atrophy.

Cytologically, the presence of Howell-Jolly bodies and pitted red blood cells visible upon review of a peripheral blood smear may be suggestive of asplenia or reduced function of the spleen. Other non-specific cytologic findings include absolute monocytosis, lymphocytosis,Â and/or thrombocytosis.
