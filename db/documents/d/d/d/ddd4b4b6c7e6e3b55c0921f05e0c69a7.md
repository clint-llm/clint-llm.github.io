The histology of miliaria is different based on the type, as each is classified by the depth of obstruction of the eccrine duct. Miliaria crystallina displays subcorneal or intracorneal vesicles from the intraepidermal portion of the duct and may contain neutrophils. Miliaria rubra exhibits epidermal spongiosis with parakeratosis and vesicles in the epidermis communicating with the eccrine duct. It can have associated inflammatory lymphocytic infiltrate surrounding the duct and superficial vasculature. Miliaria profunda involves the intradermal spongiosis of the eccrine duct, and is comparable to miliaria rubra. Miliaria profunda differs from rubra by the further rupture of eccrine ducts and more significant lymphocytic inflammation. It is periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive, diastase-resistant by microscopy.
