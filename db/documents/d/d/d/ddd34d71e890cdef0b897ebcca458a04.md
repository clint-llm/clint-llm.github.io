The etiology of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations is not clear, but they can be congenital or acquired. However, most cases are associated with the condition of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Rendu-Osler-Weber disease, which is an autosomal dominant disorder.

The most abundant transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B) binding protein, endoglin, has been currently identified by a gene mapping to locus 9q3 and is referred to as the gene for HHT-1. In the same manner, mutations for activin receptor-like kinase1 gene have been mapped to locus 12q, which is presently referred to as the gene responsible for HHT-2.
