Food intolerance has been observed to affect 15%Â to 20% of the population.

In an Australian study, one in 10,000 infants less than 2 years of age were found to have food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES). FPIES is found to occur predominantly in infants and is associated with common food triggers (proteins in cow milk, soy, rice, oats, and egg), but the epidemiological data are still lacking.

Celiac disease has been considered a major public health concern and is reported worldwide. It is most prevalent in Western Europe and the United States but is underdiagnosed in most affected people. A meta-analysis done in 2018 has noted a 1.4% prevalence of celiac disease based on serological tests, and 0.7% based on biopsy.

Although no sex predilection is known, FPIES and eosinophilic gastroenteritis have a slight male predominance, whereas women are slightly more likely to be affected by celiac disease.
