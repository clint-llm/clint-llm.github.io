Famotidine decreases the production of stomach acid, and its pharmacologic activity is used in the treatment of acid-related gastrointestinal conditions. Famotidine is available both by prescription and over-the-counter (OTC). It is FDA approved and available through prescription for the treatment of duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in adults and children, with a further indication for treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions in adults. Famotidine is also FDA approved for over-the-counter treatment and prevention of heartburn due to gastroesophageal reflux in adults and pediatrics. It also has off-label uses. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of famotidine, so providers can direct patient therapy as needed to achieve positive outcomes.
