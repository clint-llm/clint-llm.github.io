Suspected child abuse should be considered in the evaluation of all injuries of children. A thorough history of the present illness is vital to make a correct diagnosis. Essential aspects of collecting the history involve gathering information about the child's behavior before, during, and after the injury. The parent or caretaker should be able to provide the history without interruptions and not be influenced by the provider's questions or interpretations. Pediatric abuse should be considered in each of the following:

- A non-ambulatory infant with any injury

- Injury in a nonverbal child

- Injury inconsistent with the child's physical abilities

- A statement of harm from the verbal child

- Mechanism of injury not plausible; multiple injuries, particularly at varying ages

- Bruises on the torso, ear, or neck in a child younger than 4 years

- Burns to genitalia

- Stocking or glove distributions or patterns

- Caregiver is unconcerned about the injury

- An unexplained delay in seeking care or inconsistencies or discrepancies in the histories provided

The differential diagnosis depends on age, injury type, and signs and symptoms. The differential diagnosis of injury usually differentiates between accidental and inflicted trauma. An astute healthcare provider must carefully consider organic disease processes or accidental injury versus deliberately inflicted trauma.
