Most patients with EDKA recover well with prompt recognition and treatment. Delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment, especially hydration without dextrose/insulin infusion, can lead to persistent acidosis, vomiting, and prolonged hospitalization. Prognosis is worse for small children and pregnant women. Rarely, severe cases of respiratory failure, hypovolemic shock, coma, and death. Death is rare in most EDKA cases; however, pregnant women are at greater mortality risk than the general population.
