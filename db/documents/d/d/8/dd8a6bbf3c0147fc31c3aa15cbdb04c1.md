Along with patient education, physicians must understand the drastic implications of microalbuminuria. Strongly advising their patients to be compliant with the recommendations has been shown to prevent future complications, decrease morbidity and mortality, and improve quality of life. Early detection of microalbuminuria has been studied greatly and has been observed to help in halting the progression of the underlying disease. An interprofessional team is crucial in the early screening and management of microalbuminuria. Primary care providers working closely with the patients in the community can ensure early detection of microalbuminuria. With early detection, dietary modification, and treatment ensue earlier, leading to better patient outcomes.
