Complications of HRM are rare. Placing the HRM nasogastric sensory catheter may cause discomfort in the nose or throat. During placement of the catheter, patients may experience a gagging sensation that may lead to emesis. Caution should be exercised when placing the catheter in patients who have recently had esophageal surgery or in patients with esophageal varices. Finally, there have been rare instances of esophageal perforation in patients with severe achalasia during HRM.
