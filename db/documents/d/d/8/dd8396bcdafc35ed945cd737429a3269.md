Phenobarbital is one of the sedative-hypnotic agents which belongs to the barbiturates class of drugs. Phenobarbital offers a wide array of clinical uses that commonly include anti-seizure management.

Phenobarbital can also be used to relieve insomnia and apprehensiveness, although addiction is a point of concern when using phenobarbital for insomnia. This drug is also useful for benzodiazepine and alcohol withdrawal treatment due to its anti-seizure properties and sedative effect. The syndrome resulting from alcohol withdrawal has a better clinical outcome when treated with benzodiazepines, according to significant evidence-based studies.
