Mucorales are thermotolerant fungi found in soil and decaying matter and rarely cause disease because of low virulence.  Rhizopus is considered the most frequent fungal infection in immunocompromised populations, though various Aspergillus species are also commonly encountered. Mucormycosis has increased its frequency because of the increased prevalence of immunosuppression states in the general population owing to improved lifespan in cancer and transplant patients, as well as expanding indications for immunosuppressive medications for various autoimmune diseases.

The primary route of infection is via air spore inhalation, which deposits in the paranasal sinuses and the lung. Other routes less frequently encountered result from ingestion or direct skin inoculation.

Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, malignancies (lymphomas and leukemias), renal failure, organ transplant, burns, immunosuppressive therapy, cirrhosis, and AIDS. Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis and patients on dialysis who receive treatment with iron chelator deferoxamine are also more susceptible to mucormycosis.

The most commonly encountered clinical form is rhinocerebral mucormycosis, and the resultant mortality, even with pharmacological and/or surgical treatment is high unless the immune system status can be restored.
