**Boxed Warning:**Data in animal studies has demonstrated the potential of developing medullary thyroid carcinoma. It is unknown whether this would also occur in humans at this time. Given the theoretical risk, tirzepatide should be avoided in those with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Patients with a history of MEN 2 (multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type-2) should also avoid tirzepatide.

Patients with other thyroid cancer-related risk factors should be advised of the theoretical risks. Furthermore, patients who experience a hypersensitivity reaction should avoid using tirzepatide any further. Other relative contraindications also exist, such as gallbladder disease or diabetic retinopathy.

Tirzepatide is only approved for those with type 2 diabetes mellitus and should not be used in those with type 1 diabetes mellitus. It is also not directly approved for other forms of diabetes, such as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults.

Patients who are currently using other GLP-1 agents, such as semaglutide or liraglutide, should not be prescribed tirzepatide. Patients on insulin therapy can be initiated on tirzepatide therapy and cautiously have their insulin dose decreased to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia.
