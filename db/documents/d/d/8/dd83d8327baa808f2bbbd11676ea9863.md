Preparing for a catheterization involves the following steps:

- Review indications and contraindications for the procedure. A careful history can help to assess the need for urological referral.

- Give clear instructions to the patient about the procedure. Allow appropriate time to respond to the queries of the patient.

- A proper light source should be present.

- Maintain patient's privacy during the procedure.

- The patient should lie down on a firm flat surface with the head resting on a pillow.

- Appropriate positioning of the patient. Supine position for men and frog-leg position for women is recommended.

- Place a disposable pad beneath the patient's buttocks.

- Perform hand hygiene.

- Wear sterile gloves.

- Appropriately drape the patient.

- Prepare the glans penis and the urethral meatus using a sterile technique. In women use the non-dominant hand to expose the urethral meatus by separating the labia and prepare the meatus with an antiseptic solution.
