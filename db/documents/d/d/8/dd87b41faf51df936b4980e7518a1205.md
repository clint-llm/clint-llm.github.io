Derived from the ventral foregut endoderm, the biliary tract begins to form during the fourth week of embryonic development. Between weeks four and eight, the extrahepatic bile ducts develop via the lengthening of the caudal portion of the hepatic diverticulum. Around the 8th week of gestation, the cranial portion of the ventral foregut endoderm gives rise to the intrahepatic bile ducts, while the caudal portion gives rise to the development of the extrahepatic biliary tree.
