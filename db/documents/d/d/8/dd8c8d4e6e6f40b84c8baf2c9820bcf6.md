It is very important to identify and differentiate Paget disease of the breast from other mimics like inflammatory dermatosis, pre-malignant skin conditions, and breast neoplasms. A list of differential diagnosis should be kept in mind to carry out proper investigations and treatment. Following is the list of the differential diagnosis for MPD of the breast;

- Various skin inflammatory conditions like atopic dermatitis, factitious dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis & other forms of eczema

- Various skin cancers like malignant melanoma, Squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma, etc

- Pre-malignant skin conditions like Bowen's disease

- Erosive adenomatosis of the nipple which is a benign neoplasm of the major nipple ducts

- Nipple duct adenoma, which presents as a palpable nipple nodule with cutaneous erosion and sometimes a discharge in middle-aged women

- Benign Toker cell (clear cell of the nipple epidermis) hyperplasia

- Drug eruptions.

Eczematous dermatitis of the nipplesÂ is usually bilateral; it is without any induration and responds rapidly to topical glucocorticoids. Nevertheless, be suspicious of Paget disease if "eczema" persists for more than three weeks with the treatment.
