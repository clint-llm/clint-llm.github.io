Penetrating trauma occurs when a foreign object pierces the skin and enters the body creating a wound. In blunt or non-penetrating trauma the skin is not necessarily broken. In penetrating trauma, the object remains in the tissue or passes through the tissues and exits the body. An injury in which an object enters the body and passes through is called a perforating injury. Perforating trauma is associated with an entrance wound and an exit wound.

Penetrating trauma suggests the object does not pass through. Penetrating trauma can be caused by violence and may result from:

- Fragments of a broken bone

- Gunshots

- Knife wounds

Penetrating trauma often causes damage to internal organs resulting in shock and infection. The severity depends on the body organs involved, the characteristics of the object, and the amount of energy transmitted. Assessment includes x-rays, CT scans, and MRI. Treatment involves surgery to repair damaged structures and remove foreign objects.

Puncture and penetration are similar.

- A puncture does not have an exit wound. It is generally due to something sharp or pointed

- This type of trauma is seen in a stabbing or when stepping on a nail.
