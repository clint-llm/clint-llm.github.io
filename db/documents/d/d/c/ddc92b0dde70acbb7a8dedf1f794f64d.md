Aniseikonia occurs when there is a difference in perceived image size or shape. It is usually caused by anisometropia, called optical aniseikonia, or by changes in the macula, such as edema or distortion, called retinal aniseikonia. Aniseikonia at a young age can result in amblyopia. Aniseikonia at a later age can cause asthenopia, headache, diplopia, dizziness, nervousness, imbalance, nausea, spectacle intolerance, ocular suppression, and distorted space perception. Aniseikonia is best measured with an eikonometer, but these are usually unavailable. It can also be calculated in the clinic by dissociating the two images of the eyes and estimating the difference in shape and size. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients with aniseikonia.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the difference between aniseikonia and anisometropia.
- Review the various causes of aniseikonia.
- Summarize tests used to evaluate for aniseikonia.
- Explain the treatments used in managing aniseikonia.
