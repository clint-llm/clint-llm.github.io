Performing electrodiagnostic studies in spinal stenosis patients have few absolute contraindications. Needle EMG is contraindicated in those with severe bleeding disorders. Needles should also never be inserted into areas of active soft tissue infection. NCS is contraindicated in patients with implanted cardiac defibrillators or if connected to external defibrillators. Patients require screening for pacemakers, and electrical stimulation should not be performed directly on or near the device itself.
