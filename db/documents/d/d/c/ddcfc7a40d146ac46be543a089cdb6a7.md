Even though there are several treatments for Achilles tendon rupture, there is no consensus on which to undertake. There is a wide variation in the management of Achilles tendon injury between orthopedic surgeons and sports physicians. Further, there is no uniformity in postoperative rehabilitation. Experts recommend that an interprofessional approach may help achieve better outcomes.

The team should include a trauma surgeon, an orthopedic surgeon, a rehabilitation specialist, and a sports physician. The pharmacist must ensure the patient is not on any medications that can affect healing. The nurse should educate the patient on the importance of stretching before any exercise and participating in a regular exercise program after repair.

**Outcomes**

Conservative treatment is usually preferred for non-athletes, but the risk of re-rupture is high. While surgery offers a lower risk of re-rupture, it is also associated with post-surgical complications that may delay recovery. Overall, the outcomes for Achilles tendon rupture are good to excellent after treatment.
