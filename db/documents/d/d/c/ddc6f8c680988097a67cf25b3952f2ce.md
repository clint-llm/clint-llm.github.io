Respiratory acidosis typically occurs due to failure of ventilation and accumulation of carbon dioxide. The primary disturbance is an elevated arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) and a decreased ratio of arterial bicarbonate to arterial pCO2, which results in a decrease in the pH of the blood. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of respiratory acidosis and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of respiratory acidosis.
- Review the history and physical exam findings typically seen in patients with respiratory acidosis.
- Explain the management strategies for respiratory acidosis. 
- Summarize modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by respiratory acidosis.
