Hysterosalpingogram is an imaging procedure performed to assess the causes of infertility in females. Hysterosalpingogram utilizes radiopaque dye injected into the uterus and is visualized with an x-ray. Infertility in females is a complex workup assessed from a hormonal, structural, and partner-based approach. Disorders of the fallopian tube can account can for up to 60% of the reasons for infertility. This imaging procedure is commonly the second step in the diagnostic approach for female patients presenting with infertility. Pelvic ultrasound is generally the first.
