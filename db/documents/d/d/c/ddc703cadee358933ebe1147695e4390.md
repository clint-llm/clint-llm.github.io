The quadriceps tendon is derived from the muscular junction of the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and vastus intermedius muscles at the anterior superior pole of the patella. The quadriceps tendon, in combination with the patellar tendon and the patella bone, makes up the extensor mechanism of the lower leg. A rupture of this central tendon drastically hinders knee extension and directly affects functionality. The degree that a quadriceps tendon rupture limits lower leg extension is based on the severity of tendon damage. Minor tendon tears may have minimal impact on extensor function, while complete tendon tears may totally impede lower leg extension. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of quadriceps tendon rupture and reviews the role of the inter-professional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe risk factors and at-risk populations associated with quadriceps tendon rupture. 
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with a quadriceps tendon rupture, including differentiating it from a patellar tendon rupture.
- Review the treatment and management options for patients with quadriceps tendon ruptures.
- Summarize inter-professional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication for evaluating, treating, and rehabilitating quadriceps tendon tears.
