Several muscles of the pelvic diaphragm support the uterus, the urogenital diaphragm, and the round, broad, lateral, and cardinal ligaments. The pelvic diaphragm includes the following muscles: piriformis, coccygeus, iliococcygeus, pubococcygeus, and puborectalis. The pubococcygeus, puborectalis, and iliococcygeus muscles together are known as the levator ani muscles. Vaginal delivery is a major cause of levator ani defects, genital organ prolapse, and urinary incontinence.

The major ligaments that support the uterus include the round ligament, transverse cervical ligament (cardinal ligament), uterosacral ligament, and broad ligament. The cardinal ligament reaches from the cervix to the sidewall of the pelvis and appears at the base of the broad ligament. The uterosacral ligament plays a major role in keeping the uterus in the anteverted position. It extends from the cervix to the sacrum and supports the uterus posteriorly. The pubocervical ligament provides anterior support to the uterus, helping to prevent cystocele. The broad ligament is a double folding of the peritoneum, divided into four regions composed of the mesosalpinx, mesovarium, mesometrium, and the suspensory ligament of the ovary. It overlies the ovaries, uterus and fallopian tubes, and secures the uterus laterally to the sidewall of the pelvis.

When the supportive structures of the pelvis fail, the result is pelvic organ prolapse. It is a common difficulty for women and is usually treated with conservative management, mechanical support using pessaries, or surgical repair. Laparoscopic promontofixation is a surgical option that has excellent long-term results.
