Bisphosphonates are the cornerstone in the management of metabolic and cancer-related bone disease. The use of bisphosphonates in patients with multiple myeloma and metastatic bone disease has led to a reduced incidence of pathological fractures.

Bisphosphonates first appeared on the industrial scene in the 19th century when their unique structural properties were used to ‘soften water’ to prevent scaling and corrosion of pipes.

Despite their benefits, bisphosphonates have both short-term and long-term side effects. A good understanding of these is essential when prescribing this class of drugs.
