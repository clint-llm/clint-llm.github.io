**Submentoplasty**

A skin incision is marked in a transverse submental crease, centered and roughly 3 cm in length. A #15 blade is then used to make a single stab incision in the center of the planned incision as well as two more, 1 to 2 mm inferior to the attachment of each ear lobule. A 2 to 3 mm liposuction cannula on a 10 cc syringe is then inserted through the stab incisions, the submental one first, and subsequently the lateral ones. Care should be taken to face the opening of the cannula away from the dermis so as not to cause postoperative texture irregularities or disrupt the blood supply to the skin.

Dry passes are made with the cannula under the skin to create tunnels prior to applying suction. The assistant should retract the skin away from the surgeon to create appropriate counter tension. The cannula's tip should be just visibly tenting the skin in order to ensure the liposuction remains sufficiently superficial to avoid damaging blood vessels or other important structures. The area of cannula dissection should remain superior to the hyoid and inferior to the border of the mandible, in order to avoid injury to the marginal mandibular nerve and larynx. Maintaining this plane will also facilitate later flap elevation.

The submental incision is then made, allowing dissection to enter the subcutaneous plane. The skin flap is retracted with a double prong skin hook toward the surgeon while the assistant provides counter tension. Facelift scissors, such as Gorney-Freeman or Goldman-Fox scissors, are used to dissect in a subcutaneous plane from the submentum past the level of the hyoid. As the dissection proceeds inferiorly, a facelift retractor can be exchanged for the skin hook. Once the platysma borders are identified, additional lipectomy may be performed in between the muscle bellies, if necessary.

A plane is developed along the undersurface of the platysma and carried 1 to 2 cm laterally. Fat on the deep surface may need to be removed; however, excessive fat removal in this area can lead to a cobra neck deformity. The fat that has been removed should be kept in saline in the event it needs to be replaced. If the cervicomental angle is extremely obtuse, the surgeon can dissect the platysma's medial border at the level of the hyoid and divide it transversely. The medial platysmal borders are then approximated with 3 or 4 buried, interrupted sutures between the hyoid and the mentum.

**Neck Lift**

Attention is now turned to the facial incisions. An abbreviated Blair incision is marked starting anterior to the lobule and proceeding onto the posterior surface of the auricle, and then posteriorly and inferiorly into the hairline. The incision is made with a #15 blade through the dermis and into a subcutaneous plane. Countertension should be applied on the neck, and the flap developed using facelift scissors. Castañares scissors are particularly helpful to divide the tough soft tissue attachments over the mastoid. Elevation then continues anteriorly to join the submental dissection. The flap is subdermal/supraplatysmal; therefore, the great auricular nerve and external jugular vein should not be at risk if the correct plane is maintained.

The surgeon places two non-absorbable sutures as buried half mattresses between the lateral border of the platysma and the mastoid periosteum. The vector of pull will be roughly parallel to the posterior border of the helix. The first suture is placed superiorly and the second more inferiorly. After hemostasis is obtained, the skin flaps are tailored to eliminate redundant skin, and the wounds are closed in layers over a drain, taking care to avoid excessive tension on the suture lines, particularly inferior to the lobules.

Antibiotic ointment and a compressive head and neck dressing are applied.

**Laser Skin Resurfacing**

Settings will vary by device, but it should be remembered that the combined thickness of the epidermis and dermis in the neck is just over 0.25 mm on average, whereas the skin of the cheek is over 1 mm in depth. This, combined with the lower concentration of dermal appendages, means that healing may be slower and less energy should be delivered than when performing facial resurfacing. Fractionated delivery of the laser may be preferable to fully ablative settings, if available, and resurfacing should stop when the papillary dermis is reached, indicated by the presence of pinpoint bleeding and a subtle change in skin color toward a more yellow hue. If performing laser resurfacing under the same anesthetic as a surgical neck lift, using even more conservative settings may be prudent.

**Botulinum Toxin Injection**

The platysmal bands are visualized with the patient in an upright position, and aliquots of 5 units of botulinum toxin are injected with a fine gauge hypodermic needle (30 or greater) in a vertical line along the medial border of the platysma. Typically, 3 to 6 injection sites are required on each side. The injections will take 1 to 2 weeks to reach their maximum effect and will last for 3 to 4 months. Repeat as necessary.

**Other Modalities**

The deoxycholic acid injection may be performed roughly every six weeks, but not usually more often than every 4, given the edema that typically follows injections. Cryoablation is also typically performed at roughly one-month intervals until the desired effect is reached; radiofrequency ablation is ideally performed as a single treatment only.
