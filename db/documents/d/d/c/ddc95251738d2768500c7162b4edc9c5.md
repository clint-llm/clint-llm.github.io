SBME is a key adjunct in delivering high-quality, consistent, and reproducible surgical education. Concerning technical skills and human factors, SBME has demonstrated an increase in the otolaryngologistâ€™s confidence and ability. It does not replace the core expertise gained by clinical experience. However, it allows otolaryngologists to hone their skills and practice key patient management principles in standardized and evidence-based environments.

Care is necessary when extrapolating increased confidence in managing a scenario to actual improved patient outcomes. SMBE has been shown, however, to lead to better clinical outcomes with various non-otolaryngological clinical skills.
