The etiology of caput succedaneum is birth-related trauma to the fetal head during vaginal birth. It is more often associated with an extended labor course in vertex delivery. The fetal head is subjected to pressure by both the uterine and vaginal walls as it passes through the cervix. Additionally, the condition has been associated with both forceps and vacuum-assisted delivery when the vacuum cup contacts the head.
