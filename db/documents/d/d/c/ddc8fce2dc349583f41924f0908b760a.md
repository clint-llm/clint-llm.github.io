Membrane Attack Complex

As stated in the Fundamentals section, all complement pathways result in the construction of a MAC, which compromises the pathogen cell wall, resulting in its swift malfunction.

Inflammation and Chemotaxis

All forms of C3 convertase yield C3b and C3a. The C3a fragment is an anaphylatoxin that mediates inflammation in two ways: it triggers histamine release from mast cells and increases vascular permeability.

Similarly, all forms of C5 convertase yield both C5b (for the MAC) and C5a. C5a is also an anaphylatoxin, in addition to a neutrophil chemotactic agent.

Opsonization for enhancement of phagocytosis

There are two well-studied mechanisms by which the complement system opsonizes the pathogen for enhanced phagocytosis. We will first discuss the mechanism that all pathways have in common. C3b binds C3bBb forming C5 convertase, but C3b also acts as an opsonin to attract macrophages to the site of inflammation (namely, complement activation) to enhance phagocytosis.

The alternative activation pathway performs the second mechanism of opsonization. This pathway is capable of synthesizing a ‘soluble’ C3 convertase, named iC3Bb. iC3Bb can also attach to the pathogen and, in turn, attract phagocytes, bind them, and ultimately facilitate phagocytosis.
