The field of electrophysiology has greatly developed in the past decades. As a result, the use of EP studies in clinical practice has significantly enhanced. EP studies are still an invasive test with limited utility in certainÂ niche indications, whereas it can provide practice-changing information in some arrhythmias. It is therefore imperative that clinicians understand the importance and role of EP studies in various cardiac pathologies and refer patients for this invasive study judiciously in line with the principles of high-value care.
