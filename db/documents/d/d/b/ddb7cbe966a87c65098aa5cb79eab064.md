The interprofessional healthcare team, e.g., physicians, nurses, pharmacists, etc., needs to work together to ensure the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab therapy. Importantly, the healthcare team needs to monitor for signs of infection, e.g., aspergillosis, candidiasis, pneumocystis, tuberculosis, etc. The pharmacist should verify the dosing and perform a drug interaction check. Nurses can monitor adverse events and make preliminary assessments of treatment effectiveness on subsequent visits.

Both nurses and pharmacists need to have an open communication line with the prescribing physician so they can report or discuss any concerns regarding tocilizumab therapy or the patient drug regimen in general. This type of interprofessional healthcare team communication is necessary to optimize patient outcomes with minimal adverse events. [Level 5]
