Intracranial hypotension (ICH) is defined as a CSF pressure less than 60 mm H2O and generally causes a postural headache in patients with the condition. The etiology of ICH can be spontaneous or iatrogenic, which makes the topic relevant for review and further educating the healthcare team. This activity gives an overview of intracranial hypotension, summarizing the etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment modalities and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition in order to improve prognosis and course of treatment.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of intracranial hypotension.
- Outline the evaluation of a patient with suspected intracranial hypotension.
- Summarize management for patients with intracranial hypotension.
