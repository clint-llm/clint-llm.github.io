**Tube-Related**

**Mechanical Complication**

Tube placement for enteral feeding might cause mechanical complications. Some mechanical complication from tube feeding is listed below.

- Tube malposition

- Tube obstruction

- Accidental dislodgment of tube

- Breakage of the feeding tube

- Leakage of the feeding tube

- Erosion and ulceration near the site of insertion

- Intestinal obstruction

- Bleeding

Tube for enteral feeding can be inserted nasally through the guided percutaneous application or surgical technique.

Nasoenteral insertion is mostly done blindly by the bedside, with about 0.5% to 16% mispositioning in the pleura, trachea, or bronchial trees. This can cause the infusion of enteral feeds in the tracheobronchial tree causing a pulmonary abscess or pneumothorax.

**Infectious Complications**

- Infection at the site of tube insertion

- Aspiration pneumonia

- Ear and nasopharyngeal infection

- Infective gastroenteritis with diarrhea

- Peritonitis

Tube placement in enteral feeding is sometimes associated with the infectious processes listed above. Aspiration pneumonia is reported in 89% of patients on enteral feeding with no clear benefit of gastroenteric feeding over nasogastric. Distal duodenal or jejunal feeding might prevent the regurgitation of enteral feeds.

Complications from the enteral feeding tube also depend on the following:

- The size of the tube

- The tube material

- The diameter of the tube

Spark et al. critically reviewed pulmonary complications from gastroenteric tube placement. In 9931 cases of tube placement, there was 1.9% (187) malposition in the tracheobronchial tree. The 187 misplaced tubes resulted in 35 pneumothoraxes (18.7%) with at least five mortalities.

**Gastrointestinal Complications**

Enteral feeding is associated with several GI complications

- Nausea and vomiting

- Diarrhea

- Constipation

- Cramps and bloating

- Regurgitation and aspiration

**Nausea**

Nausea and vomiting are common after the initiation of enteral feeding, about 20% to 30%. Non-occlusive bowel necrosis and aspiration can also occur. This is associated with high mortality.

**Diarrhea**

This is the most gastrointestinal complication seen in enteral feeding. Diarrhea occurs in about 30% of patients admitted to the medical or surgical wards and about 80% of patients in the ICU.

Diarrhea in enteral feeding is a result of many factors. Using antibiotics and other medications in enteral feeding is a common cause of diarrhea—medications like antacids, oral magnesium or phosphate, antacids, and prokinetic agents. The use of oral and intravenous antibiotics can also favor the growth of Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella. The sorbitol-containing solution can also trigger profuse diarrhea in patients on enteral feeding. Using fiber based on the result of meta-analysis can significantly reduce the incidence of enteral feeding-associated diarrhea, especially in high-risk patients, both post-surgically and critically ill.

**Constipation**

This is a less common complication that is associated with enteral feeding. Constipation is more common in patients on long-term enteral feeds. Some studies suggest that using fiber supplementation might help reduce the percentage of patients reporting constipation in enteral feeding.

**Aspiration Pneumonia**

This is a potentially life-threatening complication from enteral feeding. It occurs because of aspiration of oral secretion and or gastric with enteric secretions. Aspiration is more common when patients are fed via a nasogastric tube in a supine position.

- Gravitational backflow

- Lower esophageal sphincter impairment

- Infrequent contract of the esophagus

- The presence of a tube near the gastric cardia

- Impaired level of consciousness

- Poor gag and cough reflex is seen in neurologically impaired patients with stroke or dementia

To prevent aspiration, place the enteral feeding tube about 40 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. This applies to patients with a higher risk of aspiration.

**Metabolic Complications**

Enteral feeding is associated with metabolic complications. A common complication seen in malnourished patients is refeeding syndrome. This phenomenon was first described in Far East prisoners during the Second World War.

Patients with anorexia nervosa, hyperemesis, alcoholism, and malabsorption syndrome like short bowel syndrome who are started on enteral feeding are prone to refeeding syndrome.

The pathophysiology of the refeeding syndrome is still poorly understood. In a period of starvation, the cellular membrane system downregulates with the loss of intracellular potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and calcium. The total body content of these ions is depleted. Intake of sodium and water by the cell is also increased. The sudden reversal of malnutrition with enteral feeding is due to an uptake of potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and calcium back by the cell with simultaneous movement of water and sodium out of the cells. The undernourished kidney is also impaired and cannot handle the sodium and water load.

Hypophosphataemia is the hallmark of refeeding syndrome. Hypophosphatemia can cause rhabdomyolysis, cardiac failure, arrhythmia, muscular weakness, leukocyte dysfunction, seizure, coma, and sudden death.

The phenomenon is more common in enteral than parenteral feeding.

Awareness of the syndrome is the key to treatment and prevention.

**Patients at Risk for Re-feeding Syndrome**

- Chronic alcoholism

- Anorexia nervosa

- Postoperative patients

- Elderly patients

- Prolonged fasting

- Morbid obesity associated with profound weight loss

- Malabsorption syndrome: Cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and short bowel syndrome

To manage refeeding syndrome, the cardiovascular status of the patient should be monitored closely, preferably in the ICU. Judicious monitoring of electrolytes and micronutrients should also be implemented.

Goal caloric intake should target about 50% to 75% of daily requirements.

Body Weight

- Less than 7 years: 80 to 100kcal/kg body weight per day

- Seven to 10 years: 80 to 100kcal/kg body weight per day

- Eleven to 14 years: 60 kcal/kg body weight per day

- Fifteen to 18 years: 50kcal/kg body weight per day

- Older than 18 years: 25 kcal/kg body weight per day, an average of 1000 kcal per day initially

- Thiamine, riboflavin, folic acid, and pyridoxine should be supplemented, including fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.

**Minerals**

Sodium should be restricted, I mmol/kg of body weight per day or 1.5 g per day, but an adequate amount of phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium should be given.

Magnesium (0.8 to 1.6mmol/L)

For hypomagnesemia, start at 0.5 mmol/kg per day over 24 hours, then 0.25 mmol/kg of body weight per day for five days

Maintenance 0.2 mmol/kg per day intravenous or 0.5 mmol/kg per day oral

Hypophosphatemia

A normal range is 0.85 per 1.40mmol/L

For mild hypophosphatemia (0.6 to 0.85 mmol/L), start at 0.3 to 0.6 mmol/kg of body weight per day

For moderate hypophosphatemia (0.3 to 0.6 mmol/L), start at 0.3 to 0.6 mmol/kg of body weight per day

In severe hypophosphatemia, less than 0.3 mmol/L, give IV sodium or potassium phosphate 0.8 mmol/kg of body weight in half normal saline over 12 to 24 hours.

**Complications Associated with PEG Placement**

**Peristomal Wound Infection**

Wound infection occurs after PEG placement with an incidence of about 3 to 70%. Wound site infection can be caused by the technique of placement, obesity, malnutrition, steroid, or immunosuppressive therapy. Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy has been shown to reduce the incidence of wound infection after placement of PEG. First-generation cephalosporins or penicillin give adequate coverage.

**Clogged Feeding Tube**

The incidence of clogging of feeding tubes can be as high as 25%. Clogging occurs when very thick feeds and medications are delivered through a relatively thin feeding tube. Repeated gastric aspiration is discouraged since the low pH of gastric fluid can promote protein coagulation.

**Peristomal Leakage**

This is also a complication of PEG tube placement for enteral feeding. Several factors can contribute to leakage. Excessive pulling and tugging and increased gastric secretion inhibit wound healing, like malnutrition, diabetes, and immunodeficiency. This can be prevented using antisecretory agents like proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Skin protectants and barrier creams can also be used.

**Bleeding**

The incidence of bleeding is about 2.5% after placement of PEG.

**Colonic Fistulae**

Misplacement of PEG for enteral feeding might lead to the formation of gastrocolic, colocutaneous, and gastro colocutaneous fistulae. A gastrocolic fistula connects the wall of the stomach and the colon. Gastro colocutaneous fistula is an epithelial connection between the wall of the stomach, colon, and skin that can occur because of iatrogenic puncture or direct erosion of the PEG into the colon wall and the skin.

To prevent colonic misplacement, the gastroscope should be transilluminated through the anterior abdominal wall. The endoscopically visible imprint of a finger or needle is considered a “condition sine qua non” before introducing the needle through the stomach.

**Pneumoperitoneum**

This can occur in about 8% to 18% of PEG tube placements.
