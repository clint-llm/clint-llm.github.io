Usually, most squamous cell papillomas are diagnosed upon examination and require no further investigations, especially in immunocompetent individuals where they are self-limiting and don't transform to malignant lesions. However, in those considered to have a higher risk of turning malignant, e.g: anogenital and oropharyngeal tract papillomas, they may undergo excision and a biopsy is sent for histopathological investigations if there is any question as to the diagnosis or if there is a concern for dysplasia.

Although genital warts are usually caused by low-risk HPV subtypes, 5% to 20% of the individuals affected have been found to carry other sexually transmitted diseases. It is always important to suspect high-risk HPV infections that cause precancerous lesions in those individuals with genital warts and early screening should be initiated. Screening for cervical dysplasia/malignancy is typically accomplished through speculum examination and Pap smear.
