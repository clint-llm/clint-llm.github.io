Serum and urine samples are required. The serum collection must be within 24 hours of urine collection.

**Blood specimen**

A blood sample of 1 mL (minimum 0.5 mL) in a labeled tube, preferably stored at refrigerated or frozen temperature.

**Urine specimen**

A 24-hour urine sample is collected from the patient to measure creatinine clearance. Â A plastic collection container is used to collect urine. The collection starts with an empty bladder. At the start, the patient urinates into the toilet and flushes. The date and time get recorded at the start of the collection. For the next 24 hours, the patient will collect urine and store it in a container at room temperature. The total urine collected for 24 hours gets sent to the laboratory for analysis. The patient is required to drink at least 8 cups of liquid on the day of urine collection.
