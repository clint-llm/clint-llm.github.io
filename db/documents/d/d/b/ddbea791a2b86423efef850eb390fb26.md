Proximal biceps rupture patients generally recover with non-operative treatment and experience no long-term deficits in shoulder or elbow strength. However, distal biceps rupture can cause persistent pain and forearm supination weakness. Also, with a complete distal biceps rupture, the tendon can retract significantly, and later repair in chronic cases would be technically challenging. Hence the timely diagnosis of distal biceps rupture is critical, especially in a young active patient.
