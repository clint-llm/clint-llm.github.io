Screening should be performed with the intent to treat if the result is positive.

Those at risk for new infection:

- Close contacts of patients with active TB.

- Casual contacts of patients with active TB (e.g., healthcare, homeless shelters, correctional facilities, refugee shelters, and nursing homes workers).

- Immigrants from TB-endemic regions.

Individuals with conditions or other factors associated with progression to active disease (reactivation):

-  High risk: certain immunocompromising conditions, such as patients with HIV/AIDS, organ transplantation, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapy or other biologics, chronic renal failure in hemodialysis, carcinoma of head and neck, malignancy, or silicosis. Also, recent tuberculosis infection within the past two years and radiographic evidence of prior healed TB,  history of untreated, or inadequately treated tuberculosis.

- Moderate risk: chronic steroid use (greater than 15 mg/d of prednisone equivalent), diabetes mellitus, and young age (less than 5 years old) when infected.

- Increased risk: cigarette smoking, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, body mass index less than 20, or solitary granuloma on chest radiograph.

**Test Selection**

The CDC, IDSA, and the WHO guidelines endorse the use of either IGRA or TST for the screening of tuberculosis. In certain situations, one test is preferred over the other.

The TST is the test of choice for children younger than 5-years-old or when boosting of a waning immune response is needed. The TST may be somewhat preferred for a patient who needs repeat testing annually, such as healthcare workers, because IGRA test results may be less reproducible.

IGRAs are recommended for patients who may not return for the TST reading (history of drug abuse, homeless), those who were previously vaccinated with the BCG, or individuals older than 5 years who are likely to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have low or intermediate risk of disease progression, and in whom it has been decided that testing for latent tuberculosis is warranted.

It is less clear if either TST is preferred over IGRA or vice-versa in individuals 5 years or older with a high risk of progression to disease. In cases in which the risk of progression is low, there is no need to screen; however, if this is necessary by law or credential bodies, IGRA is recommended over TST. It is important to mention that TST can be done in situations when IGRA is not available, too costly, or difficult to perform.

Simultaneous or sequential testing is not recommended, except in cases where the initial test is negative or indeterminate (borderline), but if the clinical suspicion is high, then repeat testing with TST or IGRA (depending on which test was done initially) can be done. The 2017 IDSA guidelines also recommend a second diagnostic test to confirm the diagnosis in cases of a positive test result in low-risk individuals.
