Pylephlebitis starts with thrombophlebitis of the small veins which drain the site of infection. This process extends to larger veins leading to septic thrombophlebitis involving the portal vein. In some cases, this process extends even further with the involvement of the large mesenteric veins. If this occurs, the potential exists to result in bowel ischemia, a fatal complication if not identified early.Â In one review of 19 cases of pylephlebitis, bacteremia was identified in 88% of the cases with the most frequent isolates including Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli.

In another review of 100 cases, a microorganism was identified 92% of the time from blood culture, tissue sample, liver abscess, or portal veinous aspirate. Infections were more frequently polymicrobial with the most commonly implicated organisms including Bacteroides species, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus species.
