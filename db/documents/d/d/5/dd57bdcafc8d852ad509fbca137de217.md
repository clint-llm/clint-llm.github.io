The treatment of renal osteodystrophy revolves around the strict control of phosphate, calcium, vitamin D, and PTH. The components of a management plan in cases of high bone turnover diseases with an elevated PTH are:

Vitamin D: If blood levels of vitamin D are <30 ng/ml, a 20,000 U/day supplementation of vitamin D2 is recommended. This will lead to a suppression of PTH and, in turn, of osteoblasts. Vitamin D analogs should not be used in adynamic bone disease. These analogs could lead to hypercalcemia, depending on their potencies. Calcitriol, being the most potent, holds the highest risk of hypercalcemia along with the added risk of hyperphosphatemia that is seen to some degree with all vitamin D analogs, and hence, recommendations are to withhold these if the serum phosphate is more than 5.5 mg/dL.

Cinacalcet: This is used to lower PTH levels by improving the calcium-sensing receptor sensitivity in the parathyroid glands. When used along with the other components of the treatment regimen of renal osteodystrophy, it has proven to help achieve PTH level targets in patients on dialysis.

Phosphate: To suppress the elevated PTH levels, maintaining a serum phosphate below 5.5 mg/dL is essential. A phosphorous restricted diet is strongly recommended, with a vegetarian meal preferred due to the low bioavailability of phosphorous in vegetarian protein.

Calcium: The level of calcium is kept near the high end of the normal range by modifying the concentration of calcium in the dialysate. This is done to keep the PTH suppressed and to decrease the calcium and phosphorus (Ca X P) product.

Acidosis: Acidosis is seen in many patients and should be managed using sodium bicarbonate.

Parathyroidectomy: Cases with severe hyperparathyroidism along hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, or hyperparathyroidism refractory to medical treatment are indications for a surgical consult. A total parathyroidectomy could lead to over suppression of PTH and eventually to adynamic bone disease. Subtotal parathyroidectomy is preferred over total parathyroidectomy.

Aluminum: If aluminum-induced osteomalacia is suspected, chelation withÂ desferrioxamine can be initiated.

A different approach is taken in patients with low bone turnover diseases:

An attempt to prevent the suppression of PTH is made by decreasing the calcium and vitamin D levels. The use of non-calcium containing binders will maintain phosphate levels without increasing those of calcium and subsequently prevent the suppression of PTH. This has proven to increase the rate of bone formation.
