After age six, Hashimoto is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States and in those areas of the world where iodine intake is adequate. The incidence is estimated to be 0.8 per 1000 per year in men and 3.5 per 1000 per year in women. Twin studies have shown an increased concordance of autoimmune thyroiditis in monozygotic twins as compared with dizygotic twins. Danish studies have demonstrated concordance rates of 55% in monozygotic twins, compared with only 3% in dizygotic twins.
