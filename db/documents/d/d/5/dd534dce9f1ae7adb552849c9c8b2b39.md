Instructors should use approaches that promote life-long learning. Given that healthcare providersÂ are adult learners, educators must apply adult learning theories to engage them. Adult learners are more apt to learn when they participate in the learning process and have an active role in deciding what they will learn. Instructors and learners will both benefit from spending time interacting and discussing topics they each believe are essential to the learning process.
