Common sites of anaerobic infections include oral, abdominal, and pelvic cavities; however, anaerobes can cause infections of other regions such as the head, neck, and skin. Clinically significant anaerobes associated with human infections are as follows:

**Gram-Positive**

**Gram-Positive, Spore-forming Bacilli**

Clostridium: These are spore-forming anaerobes responsible for some of the more serious human infections. They account for close to 10% of all anaerobic infections. Significant members of this family are Clostridium difficile, which causes C. difficile infection. Clostridium perfringens, which causes gas gangrene or soft tissue infections. Clostridium septicum also causes gas gangrene.

**Gram-positive, Non-spore-forming Bacilli**

Actinomyces: These colonize the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and infections result from a break in the mucocutaneous barrier. The 3 most common anatomic sites affected by Actinomyces are cervicofacial, thoracic, and abdominal.

Propionibacterium: This species is part of the normal flora of skin and mucosa. The most significant member of this family is Propionibacterium acne which plays a role in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris.

Bifidobacterium: This is normal flora of intestinal tracts. It is usually non-pathogenic; however, pediatric infections have been documented in the form of chronic otitis media, abdominal abscesses, and peritonitis.

Lactobacillus: These organisms are also normally found in the GI tract and can be recovered from numerous food products. They have low pathogenic potential; however, cases of abdominal abscesses, aspiration pneumonia, and bacteremia, particularly in neonates, have been described.

Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus: These anaerobes are part of the mouth, GI tract, upper respiratory tract, and urogenital tract, as well as the skin. They can be pathogenic and cause numerous infections such as chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis, aspiration pneumonia, pelvic inflammatory disease, including tube-ovarian abscesses.

Other members include Eubacterium, Bifidobacterium, Arcanobacterium, and microaerophilic Streptococcus (Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus intermedius).

**Gram-negative**

Bacteroides: These are the most frequently recovered anaerobic pathogens from clinical specimens. They are part of human colonic and normal female genital flora. These organisms are most commonly the cause of intra-abdominal infections, particularly abscesses. The majority of these abscesses are mixed infections. They can also cause extra-abdominal infections such as aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, among others.

Fusobacterium: One of the species from this group of anaerobes, Fusobacterium necrophorum, is a common cause of peritonsillar abscesses associated with a complication of internal jugular vein thrombosis, known as Lemierre syndrome.

Campylobacter: This is one of the most common causes of acute bacterial gastroenteritis.

Prevotella: These are normal flora of the human oral cavity and intestinal tract. In children, they are frequently associated with head and neck infections such as peritonsillar abscesses, retropharyngeal abscesses as well as perineal or perianal infections such as pilonidal abscesses.

Veillonella: Occasionally associated with abdominal abscesses and aspiration pneumonia in children.
