# Continuing Education Activity

With the increasing application of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) as the standard of care for patients with acute chest pain, health care providers will encounter both coronary artery anomalies and variants more frequently. The majority of coronary artery anomalies and variants do not have clinical significance; however, some can cause myocardial ischemia due to flow-limiting effects of the anomalous artery. It is important to distinguish those clinically important and may require intervention from incidental coronary artery variants that pose little to no risk to the patient. This activity educates the interprofessional team about the incidence, imaging, hemodynamic significance, and treatment of congenital coronary artery anomalies.

**Objectives:**
- Review the incidence of coronary artery anomalies.
- Describe the features of hemodynamically significant coronary artery anomalies.
- Identify which coronary artery anomalies require treatment.
- Summarize the accepted imaging techniques for evaluating coronary artery anomalies.

# Introduction

With the increasing application of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) as the standard of care for patients with acute chest pain, health care providers will encounter both coronary artery anomalies and variants more frequently. The majority of coronary artery anomalies and variants do not have clinical significance; however, some can cause myocardial ischemia due to flow-limiting effects of the anomalous artery.

# Etiology

Coronary artery anomalies occur because of a developmental abnormality of a coronary artery. These include abnormalities of a vessel’s:

- Origin (such as an origin arising from a different aortic valve cusp)

- Course (such as an intramural course within the aorta)

- Termination (such as a coronary-cameral fistula)

- Morphology (such as an aneurysm)

# Epidemiology

The accepted definition of an anomaly is a developmental finding that occurs in less than 1% of the population, as opposed to an anatomic or normal variant, which occurs in greater than 1% of the general population.

The frequency of coronary artery anomalies has been defined as 0.78 to 1.3% of the general population (as determined by invasive coronary angiography) but shows a higher incidence of 0.99% to 5.8% on CCTA studies due to the higher sensitivity of CCTA and its broader inclusion criteria compared to invasive angiography.

# Pathophysiology

Coronary artery anomalies are hemodynamically significant if they either transiently or permanently adversely alter the blood flow to the subtended myocardium.

An anomalous coronary artery may arise from the systemic arterial circulation, but the contralateral or incorrect coronary sinus or cusp. This includes the right coronary artery (RCA) arising from the left coronary sinus, the left coronary artery arising from the right coronary sinus, and the left circumflex artery (LCX) arising from the right coronary sinus. The origin of the right coronary artery from the left sinus is three times more common than the origin of the left coronary artery from the right cusp but is less often clinically significant by a factor of 3:1.

The hemodynamic significance of these particular anomalies depends not only upon the course the anomalous artery takes before it reaches the myocardium but also upon the effect of the abnormal course on the shape of the artery and its ostium.

Not all inter-arterial anomalies are hemodynamically significant. If an inter-arterial anomalous coronary artery travels inferior or caudal to the level of the pulmonary valve, known as a transseptal course, then, similar to pre-pulmonic or retro-aortic anomalies, arterial compromise does not occur, and the anomaly is considered hemodynamically non-significant.

Coronary artery fistulas are rare congenital anomalies. They include abnormal communication between a coronary artery and a venous structure (coronary-venous fistula) or abnormal communication between a coronary artery and a cardiac chamber (coronary-cameral fistula) without the presence of an intervening capillary bed.

Intrinsic coronary artery anomalies include an intramyocardial course, subendocardial course, and coronary artery ectasia or aneurysms. Coronary artery aneurysms are uncommon, usually incidental, and are associated with atherosclerotic disease 50% of the time.

# History and Physical

The majority of coronary artery anomalies will be occult on physical examination. Those that cause transient adverse blood flow will present with signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dyspnea, and rarely sudden cardiac death. High flow anomalies, such as coronary artery fistulas or anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), may also present with an audible continuous murmur.

# Evaluation

CCTA has become the reference standard for the evaluation of coronary artery anomalies and is deemed appropriate for the evaluation of coronary artery anomalies by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

# Treatment / Management

The majority of coronary artery anomalies are benign, incidental findings that require no treatment. For symptomatic anomalies, treatment is dictated by the nature of the specific anomaly.

ALCAPA treatment in infants requires surgical reimplantation of the anomalous artery to restore two coronary circulation.

Treatment of hemodynamically significant interarterial coronary artery anomalies, such as an origin from the contralateral coronary sinus with an intramural course, involves surgical unroofing of the intramural portion of the anomalous artery or coronary artery bypass grafting.

Coronary artery fistulas have a spontaneous closure rate of only 1 to 2%.

Intrinsic anomalies, including an intramyocardial course and a subendocardial course, generally do not require treatment.

# Differential Diagnosis

Coronary artery anomalies can cause signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia in adults but are far less common than atherosclerotic coronary lesions that induce ischemia. Rarely, a transseptal course of an interarterial anomaly can be associated with dysrhythmia. Sudden cardiac death in athletes and young adults can occur secondary to a coronary artery anomaly but is less common a cause than is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy induced fatal ventricular dysrhythmia.

# Prognosis

Since most anomalies are not clinically significant, the prognosis for the vast majority of patients is good. Patients with ischemia inducing anomalies should be referred to centers with experience in treating these conditions.

# Complications

Most coronary artery anomalies and variants are not hemodynamically significant and are incidental findings on CCTA. However, flow-limiting anomalies can cause signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia, including chest pain, shortness of breath, and sudden cardiac death. Coronary artery anomalies such as ALCAPA and coronary artery fistula can present in infancy with failure to thrive, chest pain when crying or eating, as well as sweating, dyspnea, and pallor.

# Pearls and Other Issues

Coronary artery anomalies are rare entities that are usually incidental and benign. The key to identifying a flow-limiting anomaly is the analysis of the vessel shape, in particular, ostial narrowing and vessel cross-section.

Some anomalies, such as intramyocardial course, subendocardial course, as well as pre-pulmonic, retro-aortic, and transseptal anomalies, are almost always benign based on course alone. ALCAPA and coronary artery fistula cause a steal phenomenon, which may induce myocardial ischemia.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Coronary artery anomalies are more frequently encountered with the increasing use of CCTA to evaluate patients with acute chest pain. Outcomes in patients will be improved by understanding the significance of the anomaly by the interprofessional team so that unnecessary treatment does not occur. The healthcare team can include primary care, radiology, cardiology, echocardiographers, and cardiac nurses.
