Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) is a common acquired disorder occurring after skin inflammation or injury. It is chronic and is more common and severe in darker-skinned individuals (Fitzpatrick skin types IIIâ€“VI). While the condition typically improves spontaneously, this process can take months to years, necessitating prolonged treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in educating and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.
- Review the steps in the evaluation of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.
- Outline the management options available for postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and improve outcomes.
