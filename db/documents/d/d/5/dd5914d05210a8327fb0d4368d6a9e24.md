The demographics affected by various anemias range depending on the MCV value and etiologies.

The underlying causes of microcytic anemia have epidemiologic variations.

Iron deficiency anemia is the most common cause of microcytic anemia. It frequently occurs in premenopausal, menstruating women due to menorrhagia and chronic blood loss without proper iron supplementation. However, the most significant concern for men and post-menopausal women over the age of 50 is colorectal cancer until proven otherwise and requires colonoscopy as soon as possible. Anemia of chronic disease ranks as the second most common type of anemia seen worldwide.

Macrocytic anemia is common with a prevalence ranging from 1.7% to 3.6%.

Folate deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiencies can affect a wide range of demographics throughout the world due to their acquisition from an unbalanced diet; however, vitamin B12 deficiency tends to appear in patients with vegan diets due to its origin of animal products. Moreover, vitamin B12 deficiency can also occur in malabsorptive diseases, Diphllobathrium latum infection, pernicious anemia, and gastrectomy. Organic acidemias were found to affect 1 in 784 live births in the UK.

However, due to the many causes of normocytic anemia, its epidemiology varies across the board between all ethnicities, ages, and genders, especially since many are acquired.
