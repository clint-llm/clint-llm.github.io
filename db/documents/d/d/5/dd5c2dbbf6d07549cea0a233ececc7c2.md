The brachioradialis muscle is supplied by the radial recurrent artery. The radial recurrent artery is a branch of the radial artery below the elbow joint that runs distal to proximal to contribute to the collateral circulation elbow joint.

The brachioradialis lymphatic drainage is part of the upper limb lymphatic system, consisting of superficial and deep lymphatic vessels. The superficial lymphatic vessels closely follow the superficial venous vasculature. Part of the superficial lymphatic system follows the basilic vein to drain into the cubital lymph nodes. Lymphatic vessels around the cephalic vein drain to the axillary lymph nodes. The deep lymphatic vessels also drain lymph from the brachioradialis and travel with the deep veins, eventually draining to the axillary lymph nodes.
