Magnesium is an essential element for the life of plants as it is part of chlorophyll. Moreover, it is abundant in animal tissues, where it is fundamental for enzymatic action, transporters, and the synthesis of nucleic acids. It influences other electrolytes such as sodium, calcium, and potassium. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of hypermagnesemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition. The interprofessional team has a crucial role in identifying patients at a higher risk of hypermagnesemia due to a history of renal insufficiency or gastrointestinal problems requiring frequent use of antacids or laxatives.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of hypermagnesemia.
- Review the evaluation of hypermagnesemia.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for hypermagnesemia.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to identify hypermagnesemia and improve outcomes.
