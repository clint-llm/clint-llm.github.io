The parathyroid glands are primarily composed of chief cells and adipocytes, with clusters of oxyphil cells scattered throughout. On H&E stain, under high power magnification, chief cells appear to have poorly demarcated borders, scant light pink cytoplasm, and large, round nuclei. Oxyphil cells are larger and less frequently seen on light microscopy than chief cells. They also have smaller nuclei and more eosinophilic cytoplasm.
