Access to the bloodstream is achieved through either the femoral or radial artery. Real-time X-ray fluoroscopy is used to visualize the location of the catheter and tissues. The catheter is advanced to ascending aorta. Coronary arteries are engaged using different catheters for the right and left coronary artery.  IV contrast is introduced in the coronary artery to delineate the anatomy. Pictures of coronary arteries are taken from different angles to help access the three-dimensional nature of the narrowing.
