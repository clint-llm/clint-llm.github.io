The most significant risk of complication can result from a transvaginal ultrasound approach that can disrupt the integrity of a placenta previa, leading to iatrogenic hemorrhage. Due to the angle of orientation between the placement of the endocavitary probe and the position of the cervix, some studies have argued that this risk is potentially overstated. However, there are no major risks associated with the alternative of using a transabdominal approach to the evaluation of the gestation during the third trimester, so this should be preferred and attempted first.

Other minor risks associated with the use of ultrasound entail the anxiety that it can elicit on the patient and the discomfort associated with the pressure of the probe against the skin or vaginal mucosa.
