**Miscellaneous**

- Infection (55%), urinary tract infection (22%), pelvic pain (14%)

**Warnings and Precautions**

- Gastrointestinal perforations: Gastrointestinal (GI) perforations, some fatal, have been seen in patients treated with bevacizumab. It should be discontinued in patients with GI perforations. Most cases occurred within 50 days of treatment initiation. In particular, GI perforations were observed in ovarian cancer patients.

- Hemorrhage: Serious or fatal hemorrhage, including GI bleeding, central nervous system hemorrhage, vaginal bleeding, hemoptysis, and epistaxis, occur up to five times more frequently in patients receiving bevacizumab. These reports have primarily been in non-small cell lung cancer patients with squamous cell histology and a history of hemoptysis (grade ≥2).

- Surgery and wound healing complications: Incidents of wound healing and surgical complications (including serious and fatal complications) increase in patients treated with bevacizumab. It should not be given for the 28 days before an elective surgical procedure, at least 28 days following surgery, or until complete healing of the surgical wounds. Necrotizing fasciitis has been documented in patients receiving bevacizumab. Discontinue bevacizumab in patients who develop necrotizing fasciitis.

- Arterial thromboembolic events (ATE): The risk of cerebral infarction, transient ischemic attacks, myocardial infarction, and angina is higher in patients receiving bevacizumab. In a postmarketing retrospective cohort study involving 2012 patients, acute coronary syndrome and stroke rates were higher two years after intravitreal bevacizumab.

- Severe hypertension: Hypertension occurs as anti-VEGF therapy causes enhanced expression of the pre-pro ET-1 gene, increasing endothelin-1 and decreasing NO bioavailability. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers are all commonly used to treat bevacizumab-induced hypertension. As NO availability is decreased in patients with VEGF inhibitors-induced hypertension, long-acting oral nitrates have been used for refractory hypertension.

- Renal injury and proteinuria: As discussed above, nephrotic syndrome and proteinuria are potential complications of bevacizumab therapy. Nephrotic syndrome requires cessation of bevacizumab treatment, while proteinuria needs temporary discontinuation and monitoring.

- Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): PRES is a neurological complication characterized by headaches, seizures, visual disturbances, nausea & vomiting associated with hypertension. Discontinuing bevacizumab and blood pressure control is recommended.

- Ovarian failure:   VEGFA is assumed to play an essential role in regulating angiogenesis in the ovary. The incidence of ovarian failure increases in premenopausal women given bevacizumab. Bevacizumab induces ovarian damage; it is likely that this damage is temporary and disappears within the expected drug clearance in most cases. However, frequent and prolonged drug therapy may complicate the toxicity, and fertility may be temporarily or permanently compromised following bevacizumab administration.

- Congestive heart failure: Bevacizumab treatment significantly increases cancer patients' risk of developing CHF. In a meta-analysis, increased risks of developing CHF were observed in patients with breast cancer, renal cell cancer, and glioblastoma. Asymptomatic LVEF dysfunction during bevacizumab therapy should be treated with ACE inhibitors. Discontinuation of bevacizumab is recommended in CHF.
