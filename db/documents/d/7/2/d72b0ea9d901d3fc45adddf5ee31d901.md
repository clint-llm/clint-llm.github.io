Emergency medicine or primary care providers who understand fundamental suturing techniques and tissue handling can repair simple facial lacerations. However, if there are underlying injuries to the globe, parotid duct, facial nerve, lacrimal drainage system, eyelid margin, a significant loss of tissue, or violation of multiple tissue planes requiring complex repair, the appropriate surgical specialist must be consulted for evaluation and management of the injury.
