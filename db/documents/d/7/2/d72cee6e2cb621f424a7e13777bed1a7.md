Complications divide into short-term and long-term.

Short term complications (2 to 3%) are usually immediate and relate to the procedure; they are

- Access complications like bleeding, thrombosis of subclavian/ axillary vein, and inadvertent puncture of lung tissue causing pneumothorax or hemothorax

- Pocket complications like pain, pocket hematoma, and even Twiddler syndrome which is the twisting and misplacement of the device, usually due to pressure exerted by expanding hematoma, that causes device malfunction usually by disrupting the lead and generator connections

- Device-related infection (1 to 2%), including endocarditis, have also been reported

- Serious complications (less than 1%) like pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and death can also occur during DFT

Long term complications (up to 4%) include

- Device-related pain

- Anxiety

- Lead fracture

- Inappropriate shock delivery

- Phantom shock (which means that the patient perceives as receiving shock therapy, but device interrogation does not reveal any such shock or event)

- Device erosion through the skin

- Device Infection - more so in cases of replacement or generator change, than new device implantation

- Immunologic rejection - rare
