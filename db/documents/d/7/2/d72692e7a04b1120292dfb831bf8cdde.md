The indications for a laparotomy have significantly reduced in recent times since the advent of minimal access surgery. It is however important to note that access is key to any surgical procedure. In many situations, keyhole surgeries may be extremely difficult or even impossible as the risk of injuries to vital structures may outweigh the benefits of minimal access procedures. In these situations, whether emergency or elective, the more traditional laparotomy remains the mainstay. Broadly, these situations include multiple dense adhesions from previous surgeries or inflammatory conditions, grossly distended intestines in intestinal obstruction or massive ascites in patients with end-stage liver or cardiac disease. Emergency conditions, such as those for acute intraperitoneal bleeding, uncontrollable gastrointestinal bleeding, blunt or penetrating abdominal injuries, generalised intraperitoneal sepsis due to perforated gastrointestinal tract are still the most common indications for laparotomy
