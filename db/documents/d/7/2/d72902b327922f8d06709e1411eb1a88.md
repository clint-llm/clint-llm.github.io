In the majority of cases, the pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors arise sporadically. However, in some cases, they arise as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 along with the tumors of the parathyroid and anterior pituitary. The disease is due to the inactivation of the Menin gene located on chromosome 11q13. Menin gene is a tumor suppressor gene. When pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors appear as a part of the MEN type 1, multiple pancreatic tumors can appear. They can also appear as a part of von Hippel Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, and tuberous sclerosis.
