There is no clear-cut pathology of ASD however different populations have been suggested for different subtypes of ASD. For example, CDD occurs in children who have achieved normal developmental milestones, and this regression sometimes occurs very rapidly. This condition often develops abruptly and is most commonly seen in the fourth year of life, but there can be variation. Some consider it to be childhood dementia, indicating that the deposition of amyloid in the brain can be the possible cause of the disease, but this needs to be proven.[
