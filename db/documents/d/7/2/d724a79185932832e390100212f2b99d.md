The concept of a regional anesthesia technique that provides neural blockade of the entirety of the lumbar plexus, a lumbar plexus block (LPB), dates back nearly 50 years. The first description of such a block by Winnie et al. in 1973 was an “inguinal perivascular technique” alternatively referred to as a “3 in 1 technique”.

Since the initial description of the posterior lumbar plexus block, a number of variations of the technique have been described. Most of these differ from the original technique of Chayen et al. in only minor detail and are related to the distance of the needle insertion point from midline or the lumbar level at which the block is performed.
