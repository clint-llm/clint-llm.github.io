The gold standard in the laboratory diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia is the caffeine halothane contracture test (CHCT), although genetic testing is rapidly advancing and may one day replace the muscle biopsy. The CHCT involves exposing a sample of live muscle fibers to halothane and caffeine to determine the muscle response to halogenated anesthetics. Genetic testing for mutations of the RYR1 or other associated genetic variants associated with malignant hyperthermia is becoming increasingly more valuable as the testing improves. Testing can be expensive and is only available in certain centers. Therefore, when presented with a patient for urgent or emergent surgery who has a history suggestive of a close relative who has had a malignant hyperthermia episode, anesthesiologists will usually provide a "non-triggering anesthetic," which is typically a variety of combinations of intravenous anesthetic agents. The differential diagnosis for malignant hyperthermia can include many other, unrelated disorders such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, pheochromocytoma, sepsis, thyroid storm, serotonin syndrome, or iatrogenic overheating.
