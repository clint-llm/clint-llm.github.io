Hypergammaglobulinemia (polyclonal gammopathy) is a complex disease process and requires communication between primary clinicians, internists, hematologists, pathologists, and other healthcare providers for early evaluation and management of the patient. From a diagnostic point of view, a pathologist will provide an interpretation of serum protein electrophoresis.

A hematologist may give an expert opinion regarding the possible association with monoclonal gammopathy or any other hematological disorder. A primary clinician and an internist will help manage and follow up on the underlying condition causing hypergammaglobulinemia (polyclonal gammopathy). The psychological and financial implications of chronic disease should also be considered.
