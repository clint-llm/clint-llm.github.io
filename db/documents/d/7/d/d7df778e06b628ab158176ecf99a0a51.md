Subconjunctival hemorrhage results from bleeding of the conjunctival or episcleral blood vessels and subsequently leaks into the subconjunctival space. Blood vessels can wear and tear over time. The elastic and connective tissues become fragile with age and underlying comorbidities which can result in the ease of spread of the hemorrhage in the elderly. Traumatic SCH is more localized to the site of impact compared to spontaneous. There is a predilection for SCH to develop on the temporal aspect of the eye since the bulbar conjunctiva of the temporal aspect is larger than the nasal aspect. Other reasons include increased incidence of conjunctivochalasis, protection of the nose on the nasal aspect, and more difficulty detecting projectiles on the temporal aspect. The inferior aspect was noted to have an increased incidence of SCH compared to superior likely to blood gravitating downwards after insult.
