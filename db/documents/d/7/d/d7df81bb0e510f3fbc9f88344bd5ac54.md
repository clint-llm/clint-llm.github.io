An anal fissure is a superficial tear in the skin distal to the dentate line. Anal fissures are common in those with a history of constipation or hard stools, low fiber diet, trauma, and previous anal surgery. Anal fissures can be acute (lasting less than six weeks) or chronic (more than six weeks). The majority of anal fissures occur at either the posterior or anterior midline. Other locations warrant further workup to rule out secondary causes. This activity describes the etiology, clinical features, and types, along with treatment strategies including conservative and surgical procedures and postoperative management, while outlining the lifestyle modifications for preventing recurrences of anal fissures. This activity highlights the critical role of the interprofessional care team in caring for patients with anal fissures and improving long-term outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of anal fissures. 
- Outline the clinical presentation of patients with anal fissures.
- Explain the various treatment options along with postoperative and long-term management of patients with anal fissures.
- Identify the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance long-term outcomes and quality of life for patients with anal fissures.
