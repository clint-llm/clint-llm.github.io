Susceptibility testing for antimicrobials is necessary for patients who raise suspicion of infection with specific pathogens based on disease manifestation and clinical correlation.  Antibacterial agents are then used to detect sensitivity or resistance from bacteria.  Although the purpose of this review is primarily towards the susceptibility testing for bacterial pathogens, it is important to note that antifungal susceptibility tests also exist for addressing fungal infection (e.g., Candida, Aspergillus spp.).  Furthermore, antiviral susceptibility tests are also available (e.g., influenza) via molecular technologies including sequencing analysis such as Sanger and pyrosequencing methods.
