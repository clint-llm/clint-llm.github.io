The diaphragm, an intrathoracic organ, separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities and is covered by pleura and peritoneum, as it is both extrapleural and extraperitoneal. The subphrenic space is divided by the falciform ligament.

- The subphrenic space is divided into five regions: The intraperitoneal space above the liver, limited medially by the falciform ligament, is a common location for pyogenic and amebic abscess; appendicitis or pelvic infections can localize here, ascending through the paracolic gutter.

- The intraperitoneal space below the liver (Rutherford Morison’s kidney pouch) communicates with the right gutter and is home to infections from the stomach and duodenal perforations and empyema of the gallbladder.

- Above the liver, the intraperitoneal perisplenic space may become infected from stomach perforation, cancer, splenectomy, or colon resection.

- The lesser peritoneal sac behind the pancreas and the left kidney is limited below by the transverse colon. Infection in this area is usually caused by perforation on the posterior wall of the stomach.

- Above the liver space, the “bare area” is bounded above and behind by the diaphragm. It is affected by extraperitoneal infections like retrocecal or retroperitoneal appendicitis, kidney abscesses, or from the retroperitoneal portion of the duodenum.
