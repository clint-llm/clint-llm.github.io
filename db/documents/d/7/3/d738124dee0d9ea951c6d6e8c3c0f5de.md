Complications and long-term effects of idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) vary depending on the severity and frequency of recurrence. Iron deficiency anemia and pulmonary fibrosis are the two most common complications of IPH. In the acute phase, IPH complications vary from simple complications such as shortness of breath to death due to choking of airways because of massive bleed and shock. Chronic complications may occurÂ from progressive pulmonary insufficiency/severe respiratory distress and right heart failure. Death may occur as a result of massive bleeding.
