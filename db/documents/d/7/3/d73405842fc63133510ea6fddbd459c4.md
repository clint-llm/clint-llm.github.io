NAC reconstruction can typically be performed under IV sedation or using local anesthetic as autologous breast reconstruction skin flaps are often insensate. Likewise, breast envelopes following prosthetic reconstruction have varying degrees of sensation. A standard plastic surgery minor operations set (unless taking cartilage as composite grafts) will work appropriately. Sutures used to sew on grafts, or local flaps can be dissolvable or non-dissolvable and small caliber (3-0, 4-0, 5-0 suture).
