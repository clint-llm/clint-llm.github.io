Isolated calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) injuries are rare. CFL injuries are often described in the lateral ankle compartment, specifically associated with the anterior talofibular ligaments (ATFL); however, the CFL injuries have unique characteristics which can impact long term function, such as mobility and strength. This activity describes the evaluation and management of calcaneofibular ligament injury and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of calcaneofibular ligament injuries.
- Explain the typical presentation of calcaneofibular ligament injury.
- Outline the management options available for calcaneofibular ligament injury.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance calcaneofibular ligament injury care and improve outcomes.
