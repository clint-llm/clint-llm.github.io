The prognosis in corneal grafts depends on several factors such as meticulous preoperative case selection, preoperative timing, storage and transport of donor graft, intraoperative surgical technique, meticulous postoperative examination, early detection, classification of rejection, and prompt, timely intervention with corticosteroids. The visual prognosis is governed by graft host junction opposition, centration, Â clarity, and graft survival postoperatively. Approximately 75% of endothelial rejections can be reversed with an excellent visual outcome. Fine and Stain, in their analysis, documented that about 50% of vascularized grafts and 66% of grafts without vascularization resulting in rejection can be reversed.

The prognosis diminishes as the number of repeat grafts increases. The prognosis is also poor in young patients due to the high incidence of graft rejection as they have a robust immune system. The prognosis in regrafts depends on the extent of vascularization in the failed graft. The graft prognosis was described by Sano et al. by grading the vascularization in graft and scoring the corneal graft rejection. Apart from this, the prognosis is also governed by patient education, compliance to medications, time of presentation after a rejection episode, the financial status of the patient, timely and regular follow-up. Various factors have been implicated, including HLA and ABO donor matching, but no conclusive guideline exists.
