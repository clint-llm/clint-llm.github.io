The published incidence of Frey syndrome after parotidectomy varies from 4% to 96%.

The incidence of Frey syndrome approaches 80% in parotidectomy patients based on Minor’s starch-iodine test but ranges from 30% to 60% based on subjective patient reports, indicating that there is likely a population of asymptomatic Frey syndrome patients or patients with non-bothersome symptoms.

There do not appear to be age or gender predilections for the development of Frey syndrome.
