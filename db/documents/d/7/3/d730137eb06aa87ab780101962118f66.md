Osteoid osteoma was first described by Jaffe in 1935 and accounts for 10% of all benign bone tumors.

Osteoid osteomas that occur in long bones are predominantly intracortical.  The majority of osteoid osteomas that present in the foot exhibit minimal periosteal reaction and are of the cancellous and subperiosteal subtypes. The size of the nidus is used to differentiate an osteoid osteoma from an osteoblastoma. Osteoblastomas are typically greater than 2 cm.
