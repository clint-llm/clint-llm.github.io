Cardiac output (CO) can be further broken down as the product of stroke volume (SV), which is the blood volume ejected by one heartbeat, and heart rate (HR), which is the number of heartbeats per minute. Specifically, this is a measure of left ventricular output and a clinical indicator of left ventricular function. Therefore, conditions that affect heart rate or stroke volume then directly affect cardiac output. Heart rate is influenced by multiple factors, including neuronal and hormonal input (e.g., norepinephrine, epinephrine, acetylcholine, thyroid hormones), ion concentrations (e.g., Ca2+, K+), body temperature, chemoreception (i.e., blood oxygen levels, blood CO2 levels, and pH), and drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, muscarinic antagonists, digitalis), among others. Stroke volume is affected by three variables: contractility, afterload, and preload (remember the mnemonic SV CAP for Stroke Volume affected by Contractility, Afterload, and Preload).

At the cellular level, changes in autonomic nerve activity or myocardial stretch affect cardiac output, albeit by slightly different mechanisms. To increase the heart rate, the autonomic nervous system increases sympathetic innervation and decreases vagal tone to the sinoatrial node. Sympathetic fibers also directly influence the adrenal medulla, which then releases the catecholamines epinephrine (mostly) and norepinephrine. These neuronal and hormonal catecholamines influence B1-adrenergic receptors of the heart, leading to an increase in both contractility and heart rate.

Discrete increases in the stretch of the myocardium, or increases in pre-load, also increase cardiac output by augmenting the myofibril - Ca2+ binding relationship. The term pre-load comes from the temporal relationship of being "pre" contraction of the myocardium. That is the load placed on the heart while in diastole, or its filling cycle. Specifically, it is believed that stretching the muscle fibers increases troponin’s affinity for Ca2+ and decreases the space between thick and thin filaments of the cardiac muscle – ultimately leading to an increase in the number of cross-bridges that can form. This increases stroke volume and, hence, cardiac output. The exact underlying mechanism is still a topic of debate.

Another variable that can have a profound effect on cardiac output is the afterload, which is aptly named due to its temporal relationship with the heartbeat. Afterload then can be described as the load against which the heart must pump, or put another way, the pressure in the aorta that the heart must overcome to eject its left ventricular volume or preload. Clinical scenarios were afterload is increased include hypertension and aortic valve stenosis. An increase in afterload results in decreased stroke volume (in contrast, an increase in contractility or preload results in increased stroke volume).
