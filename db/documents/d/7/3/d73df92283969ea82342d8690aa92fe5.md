Testosterone production by testicular Leydig cells depends on stimulation from the anterior pituitary gland which secretes pulses of luteinizing hormone (LH) into the circulation. When LH binds to its receptors on Leydig cells, it causes cAMP levels to rise. Increased levels of cAMP drives the expression of two proteins: StAR (the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein) and CYP11A1 (the cholesterol sidechain clevage enzyme). StAR promotes the transfer of cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner mitochondrial membrane while CYP11A1 promotes the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, the precursor of all steroid hormones. Pregnenolone can undergo 17 alpha-hydroxylation to 17 OH pregnenolone which is converted to DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone
