Anaerobes are part of the indigenous or native flora, particularly the oral cavity, human bowel, and female genital tract. The colonization with anaerobes varies with age, organ site, and environmental factors. For example, infants exclusively breastfed have gut flora with predominantly Bifidobacterium, with few Bacteroides and Enterococcus species. On the other hand, infants who are fed cow's milk have gut flora similar to that of an adult's, which contain gram-negative anaerobes and facultative bacilli.

Anaerobes are part of indigenous flora, which resists colonization and invasion from non-indigenous flora. However, infections from anaerobes do occur and usually result from a breakdown of the mucocutaneous barrier or immunosuppression. Anaerobic organ infections include, but are not restricted to, brain abscesses, dental infections, aspiration pneumonia, lung abscesses, bite infections (animal/human), abdominal abscesses, and necrotizing infections of soft tissue.
