Epidermoid cysts are derived from the follicular infundibulum. Generally, these cysts are the result of plugging of the follicular orifice. The cyst communicates with the surface of the skin through a keratin-filled orifice. Disruption of the follicle is important in the pathogenesis as those with acne vulgaris may have multiple epidermoid cysts originating from comedones. Additionally, they can also occur from traumatic and penetrate injuring leading to the implantation of the epithelium. Epidermoid cysts are lined with stratified squamous epithelium that leads to an accumulation of keratin within the subepidermal layer or dermis. Generally, the cysts are asymptomatic until they rupture. When the cysts rupture, an inflammatory reaction occurs from the displacement of soft and yellow keratin into the dermis and surrounding tissue. Recently ultraviolet (UV) light and infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) have been implicated as causing epidermoid cysts.
