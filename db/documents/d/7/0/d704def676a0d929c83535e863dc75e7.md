While it is known thatÂ gastrointestinal stromal tumors arise from the same lineage as the interstitial cells of Cajal, it is not yet clear if they arise from these cells themselves, or their precursors.

GISTs without KIT or PDGFRA are collectively known as wild-type. This group comprises a heterogeneous mix of mutations, including NF1, BRAF, HRAS, and can be seen in tumor syndromes such as neurofibromatosis type 1, Carney triad (GIST, paraganglioma, and pulmonary chondroma) and Carney-Stratakis syndrome (GIST and paraganglioma).
