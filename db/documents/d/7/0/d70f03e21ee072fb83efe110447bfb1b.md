Intravenous catheterization is an individual skill that can significantly enhance the healthcare teamâ€™s ability to care for a patient. Therefore the team must utilize appropriate communication before, during, and after the attempt to optimize outcomes. Closed-loop communication between members of the interprofessional team is important in indicating the need, deciding when to perform scalp vein catheterization, and in the fluids and/or medications being ordered and infused.

Although it is a convenient alternative to extremity IV access, the location, potential lack of experience because it is a rarer site of catheterization, and the look of a patient with a scalp vein may cause distress to the patient, parent (if applicable), and healthcare team, such that indications, contraindications, and decisions on choosing a scalp vein for access must be agreed upon to enhance patient outcomes and satisfaction. Sharing best practices and the creation of clinical practice guidelines are essential to maximizing patient safety and the success of this procedure.
