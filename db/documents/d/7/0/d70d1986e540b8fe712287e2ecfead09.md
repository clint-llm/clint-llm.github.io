Moderate to severe hearing loss dramatically affects the quality of life for patients and their families and may impair their ability to work in their chosen careers. Hearing aids cost between $1500 and $3000 per pair (US dollars, 2017), requiring replacement every 3 to 5 years, and they don't always give the patient fully functional hearing. A course of 10 hyperbaric oxygen treatments at an outpatient facility ranges between $2000 and $5000. For people with an early presentation of sudden sensorineural hearing loss, the application of hyperbaric oxygen therapy significantly improves the prognosis with a number needed to treat of 5.3. For patients with moderate hearing loss hyperbaric oxygen improved hearing an average of 19.3 decibels and for those with severe hearing loss improved an average of 37.7 decibels. This improvement would bring the average patient from needing to wear hearing aids and learn lip reading to a normal to slight impairment range.
