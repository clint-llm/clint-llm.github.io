Clinicians should be aware of the potential adverse effects of antipsychotics on bone mineral density, especially in children and elderly patients who are physically and emotionally more prone to the medication's side effects due to their body size, different metabolism rate, and evolving physiology.

Providers need to utilize a more sensitive diagnostic tool like QUS, PQCT, MRI Bone density to screen and assess the BMD in children and adults.

The antipsychotic dose should be adjusted if clinically safe and suitable. Prolactin levels should be checked at baseline and then regularly annually and should be normalized promptly. A switch to antipsychotics without prolactin-elevating qualities may be a useful alternative and or add-on antiresorptive medications.
