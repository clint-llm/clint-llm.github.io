Approximately one billion people worldwide are infected with Ascaris lumbricoides, and more than 60,000 people die from the disease annually. It affects mostly tropical and subtropical countries around the world, and it is frequently documented in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, China, and East Asia. Unfortunately, it is a neglected tropical disease that causes an estimated loss of 1.2 to 1.5 disability-adjusted years.
