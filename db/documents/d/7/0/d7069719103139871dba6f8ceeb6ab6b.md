Central lines are inserted by many healthcare professionals, but the monitoring of these lines is done by the nurses. Today, in order to avoid line infections, most hospitals have a central line team that regularly monitors the duration and need of these lines. Anyone who inserts a central line must be familiar with the anatomy and how to deal with complications. While in the past it was believed that lines within the thorax were cleaner and less likely to develop infection complications, more recent data would suggest that with appropriate line management by these teams and with appropriate prep and sterile technique utilization at the time of line placement, there is no statistically significant difference in the development of infectious complications based solely upon location of line insertion within the body.
