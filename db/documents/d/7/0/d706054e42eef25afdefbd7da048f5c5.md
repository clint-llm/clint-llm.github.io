Epidermodysplasia verruciformis is a very rare condition with no definitive treatment. Large randomized controlled trials do not exist to recommend specific treatment strategies. This genodermatosis is best handled an an interprofessional team effort including dermatology, general surgery, radiation oncology, and medical geneticists. In conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma, there are reported cases where radiation therapy may have induced more invasive transformation of lesions, and in these cases, current recommendations should be discussed between treating physicians and consultants. Identifying patients with this disease early on in the course of development and treating suspicious lesions is important to avoid more serious malignancies. Reducing sun exposure may help decrease the development of more malignant skin lesions and should. Encouraging patient follow-up and compliance with treatment and prevention strategies should be stressed as lesions may develop and progress to malignancy or even metastatic disease if left untreated.
