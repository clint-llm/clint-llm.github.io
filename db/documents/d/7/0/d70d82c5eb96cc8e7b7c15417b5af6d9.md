Abdominal pain is an extremely common complaint in the emergency department, with a large differential ranging from very benign etiologies to life-threatening emergencies. Keeping a large differential can help guide diagnosis and treatment options. Although relatively rare, serious complications can arise in someone with Meckel's diverticulum and the definitive treatment is a surgical intervention for removal and repair. Meckel's diverticulum is often an incidental finding, and if found during surgery, removal is typically up to the discretion of the surgeon. Surgeons have determined certain guidelines to drive their decision to remove an asymptomatic diverticulum to prevent future complications.

These parameters are listed above but include younger age, diverticulum lengths greater than 2 centimeters, presence of gastric mucosa, and male gender. However, there is no significant evidence to determine whether or not this approach changes morbidity or mortality. If painless rectal bleeding is the presenting symptom, a technetium-99 scan may be appropriate for diagnosis. However, for patients that present with abdominal pain and physical exam concerning for perforation, intestinal obstruction, or intra-abdominal abscess,  a CT scan is more appropriate for diagnosis. After diagnosis, prompt surgical consultation and operative management are necessary.
