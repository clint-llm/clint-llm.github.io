Tocolysis is effective because it focuses on both delaying and weakening uterine contractions. The pharmacology targets the activity of the myometrium. The myometrium is the smooth muscle in the uterus.

From a physiologic perspective, the myometrium is responsible for the contractional effort of childbirth. Like all smooth muscle, this process is calcium-mediated. The start of a contraction does not require any nerve input nor hormonal stimulus. It begins with a spontaneous depolarization of the cell surface, which opens voltage-gated calcium channels.

Though the average gestation age for women to go into the labor is 40 weeks, some conditions will result in labor starting earlier. ItÂ´s believed that this switch to a contractional uterus is caused by an equilibrium change of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.
