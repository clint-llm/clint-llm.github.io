Palytoxin (PTX) is a large naturally occurring toxin initially isolated from zoanthids (i.e., soft corals) in the genusÂ Palythoa and has since been found in various marine life including microalgae.

Inhalation, ingestion, or cutaneous contact can lead to lethal systemic effects, but a small number of cases in recent years have described ophthalmic effects that range from superficial punctate epitheliopathy to bilateral corneal melt with subsequent perforation.
