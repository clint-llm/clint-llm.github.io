Patients typically present with wrist pain, decreased grip strength, and progressive loss of wrist range of motion.Â Wrist pain may be radial or ulnar and is more common when weight-bearing on an extended wrist. A decrease in wrist extension is common due to the dorsal displacement of the ulnar head. However, this does not commonly restrict forearm rotation.

Patients may present primarily with cosmetic complaints rather than with functional limitations.

The entire radius variant is a more severe form of Madelung deformity and is more common in Leri-Weill dyschondrosis. Patients with the entire radius subtype typically have pronounced radial bowing and more severe deformity. The reverse Madelung deformity results in dorsal subluxation of the carpus on the exam.
