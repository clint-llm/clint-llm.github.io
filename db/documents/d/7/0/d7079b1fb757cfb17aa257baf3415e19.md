It is important to maintain a constant dose titration to maintain steady thiopurine exposure while minimizing toxicity. There have been observations that in patients with nonfunctional variant alleles of TPMT or with reduced TPMT enzyme activity, there is a resulting accumulation of 6TGN in hematopoietic tissues causing toxicity.
