Normal erythrocytes have a biconcave shape and possess relatively high plasticity. A lipid bilayer forms their membrane with proteins that adhere to the cytoskeleton and confer a normal biconcave shape providing optimal surface/volume relationship and adequate malleability, maintaining structural integrity and proper ion permeability.

Hereditary spherocytosis results from a deficiency in one or more proteins involved in maintaining adequate adherence between the cytoskeleton and bilipid membrane. As the cellular surface is unable to be adequately supported by the cytoskeleton, the cell adopts an abnormal sphere shape that decreases surface to volume relationship. As the abnormal red blood cell membrane holds a higher tension, their structure is increasingly fragile and unable to buffer for several intravascular imbalances, such as a decrease in osmolarity.

Spherocytes also have an abnormal ionic permeability that increases the influx of sodium to the intracellular space, which increases ATP requirements as the activity of the Na/K pump increases to compensate for the rise in intracellular sodium.
