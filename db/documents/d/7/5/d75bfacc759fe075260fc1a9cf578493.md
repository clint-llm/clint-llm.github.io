Pulmonary hypertension is a complex clinical syndrome with high morbidity and mortality. It requires a multifaceted treatment approach, including patient education, pharmacologic management, and invasive diagnostic/therapeutic procedures to optimize clinical outcomes.

Specialty-trained nurses are essential to the interprofessional team caring for patients with PH. They educate the patient on the importance of fall preventive measures, compliance with oxygen therapy, lifestyle modifications to maintain adequate nutrition and function, as well as medical compliance to help improve morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Specialized nurses for in-home care are especially important given the poor mobility of these patients. They can help evaluate the patient in the community setting and ensure the delivery of adequate outpatient treatment.

The clinical pharmacists assist the medical providers by reviewing patient medication lists and decreasing potential adverse drug-drug interactions for these patients. Primary care medical providers and pulmonologists must coordinate care to minimize any adverse outcomes of medical therapy and prevent the progression of this disease. A collaborative interprofessional team can significantly improve the quality of life for patients with PH and decrease mortality. [Level 5]
