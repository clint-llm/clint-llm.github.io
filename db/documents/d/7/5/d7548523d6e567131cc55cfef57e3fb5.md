In conclusion, neurothekeomas are rare, superficial tumors most often arising in the head and neck, shoulder, or upper extremities of younger females. The tumors tend to be small, less than 2 cm, and histologically are composed of a mix of spindled and epithelioid cells set against a variably myxoid background stroma. The neoplastic cells are generally immunoreactive with CD10, CD68, MITF-1, and NKI-C3 and negative for NSE, S100 protein, or GFAP. The recommended treatment for neurothekeoma is complete surgical excision; recurrence rates are low even for tumors demonstrating atypical features. Head and neck surgeons and pathologists need to be aware of the presentation and clinical course of this uncommon lesion, as well as its similarity to other benign and malignant tumors clinically and histologically, to adequately manage patients and provide appropriate treatment options and follow-up care.
