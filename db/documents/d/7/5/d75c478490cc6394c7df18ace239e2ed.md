Hydrops fetalis, also known as fetal hydrops, is not a disease but rather a symptom of an underlying health problem that affects the fetus. If left untreated, the excess fluid can stress the fetal heart and other vital organs, putting the fetal life at risk. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of women carrying a fetus with hydrops fetalis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of pregnant women with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of hydrops fetalis.
- Outline the important features for the diagnosis of hydrops fetalis.
- Describe the importance of ultrasound surveillance in decreasing the incidence of hydrops fetalis. 
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to improve healthcare outcomes for hydrops fetalis.
