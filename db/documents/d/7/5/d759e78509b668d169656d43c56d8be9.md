The history of the appearance of primary syphilitic lesions, secondary syphilis, sexual history, onset (may be acute, subacute, and chronic),Â and the presence of neurologic, ophthalmic, or otological symptoms lead to clinical suspicion of tabes dorsalis. Serologic and CSF testing can confirm the diagnosis of late neurosyphilis.

On physical examination, neurologic manifestations of tabes dorsalis include loss of or decreased deep tendon reflexes in the lower extremities, pupil irregularities with bilateral miotic pupils that respond to near reflex but not to light (Argyll Robertson pupil), and in up to 60% of patients loss of proprioceptive (touch, vibration) sense with sensory ataxia, loss of pain and position sensation.
