With presenting symptomology being so wide and varied, the differential diagnosis could also be very broad. However, with the more classic symptoms of chest pain, dyspnea, fever, malaise, and tachycardia, there are certainly a few very important differentials. As often most of these patients have been recently hospitalized and undergone some sort of procedure, they are at risk for several other potentially serious problems. This list would include the following:

- Pulmonary embolus

- Sepsis

- Pneumonia

- Congestive heart failure

- Influenza

- Recurrent cardiac injury (such as acute MI/in-stent re-stenosis or valve failure)

- Acute anemia with or without GI bleed

- Endocarditis

- Uremia

Secondary to this broad and potentially life-threatening subset of other disease processes, the evaluation for Dressler syndrome will often include evaluation for these other processes.
