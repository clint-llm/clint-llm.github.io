Tension pneumothorax must be treated immediately to avoid further associated morbidity and mortality. Delay in diagnosis and management is associated with a poor prognosis. Tension pneumothorax arises from many causes and rapidly progresses to respiratory insufficiency, cardiovascular collapse, and ultimately death if not recognized and treated. In uncomplicated pneumothoraces, recurrence can happen within six months to three years. Recurrences are more common in smokers, COPD, and patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Ventilator-related tension pneumothorax has been found to have dire outcomes and result in death more frequently.
