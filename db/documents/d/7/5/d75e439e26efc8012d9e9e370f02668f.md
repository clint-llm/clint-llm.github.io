Complications can arise directly due to the release of hormones from the tumors or due to the mass effect of the tumor. Recurrent pancreatitis, intestinal obstruction, and gastrointestinal bleeding can occur due to direct invasion by the tumor. Even varices can occur due to obstruction of the splenic vein by the tumor.

Carcinoid syndrome is associated with a certain complication known as a carcinoid crisis. The symptoms usually involve stupor, confusion, flushing, hyperthermia, cardiac arrhythmias, diarrhea, bronchospasm, and drastic fluctuations in blood pressure (usually hypotension accompanied by shock but sometimes hypertension can also occur).
