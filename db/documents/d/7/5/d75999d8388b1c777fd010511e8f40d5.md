Meningitis and pneumonia caused by H. influenzae are indistinguishable from other bacterial causes of meningitis and pneumonia. An appropriate workup includesÂ obtaining a sputum specimen and doing a gram-stain followed by a culture. Bronchitis (inflammation of airways) may have similar symptoms as bacterial pneumonia, but the presence of fever and productive cough in H. influenzae pneumonia differentiates between the two. H.influenzae epiglottitis can be differentiated from parainfluenza virus infection (croup) based on the presence of the 'steeple sign' on posteroanterior neck x-ray in the latter. The age group most affected by the parainfluenza virus range from 6 months to 3 years, and classic features are barking seal-like cough and inspiratory stridor.
