In contrast to encouraging global trends, maternal mortality in the United States has been increasing in the past four decades, rising 140% between 1987 and 2013, and the United States has one of the highest pregnancy-related mortality rates of high-income countries.

Studying rates of postpartum infections and their effects is difficult, as most of these infections occur following maternal hospital discharge, and decreasing hospital stay following childbirth further inhibits the detection of postpartum complications, including infection.

The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control show that infections are the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in Hispanic women in the United States and disproportionately affect ethnic minorities.

The risk of postpartum infections is likewise increased in patients at the extremes of maternal age or with high body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, immune compromise, bacterial vaginosis, group-B streptococcus positive status, and sexually transmitted infections.
