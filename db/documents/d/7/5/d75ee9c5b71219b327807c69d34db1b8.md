Highly trained healthcare personnel with clearly defined roles and shift schedules in a COVID-19 ICU can improve workflow and efficiency.

A pyramid-like approach has been tried and tested during the pandemic with a trained intensivist guiding multiple teams of mid-level physicians/physicians of other specialties, allowing for wider coverage of patients by the intensivist. Figure 13 depicts the pyramid-like approach that allows for maximal ICU physician coverage. The respiratory therapists form an integral part of the team and should be involved in each patient's care on mechanical ventilation. They should also be a part of the rapid response team in the hospital to facilitate the transition from regular nursing floors to ICU in case of emergencies. Dialysis nurses should be readily available as acute kidney injury has been reported in up to 25% of critically ill COVID-19 patients.

Since many COVID-19 ARDS patients require prone positioning early in the course of intubation, a safe and effective method for proning is required. A proning team should consist of a respiratory therapist, nurses and can include additional staff to provide much-needed hands during the meticulous procedure. Care should be taken to use padding and pressure preventive dressing on pressure points such as shoulders, nipples, groin, knees, and feet. Palliative care specialists should also be available to assist with advanced care planning and end-of-life care discussions.
