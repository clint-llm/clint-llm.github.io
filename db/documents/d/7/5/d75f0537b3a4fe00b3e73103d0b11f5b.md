Beyond the more widely used hematoxylin and eosin histochemical staining, several other stains are more advantageous in certain situations that warrant bone biopsies. This includes

- Alkaline phosphatase: useful in understanding relative osteoblast activity

- Von Kossa: best utilized to observe the degree of mineralization in tissue samples and cell cultures

- Toluidine blue O: used to identify mineralized bone and osteoid seams, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts

- Safranin O: stains proteoglycan content in osseous tissue samples

- Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP): enzyme specific stain for the presence of osteoclasts

- Prussian blue: stains for iron content in bone tissue specimens

- Elastin/Van Gieson (EVG): stain used to determine the presence of elastic fibers

- Calcein: labels bone mineralization fronts in vivo

- Oil red O: stain used to visualize the presence of adipose cells in bone specimens
