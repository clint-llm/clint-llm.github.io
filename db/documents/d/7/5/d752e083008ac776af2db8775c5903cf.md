HLA antigen sensitization can become a problem for patients undergoing procedures such as stem cell transplants. HLA antigens have a significant role in transplant-mediated rejection, which falls under the following two categories:

**T-cell-mediated Rejection**

In T-cell-mediated rejection, the T-cell becomes activated because of the interaction between the T-cell receptor and the HLA-peptide combination from the donor.

**Antibody-mediated Rejection**

In antibody-mediated rejection, the T-helper cells are co-stimulated, and there is a concurrent inflammatory response, leading to the recognition of foreign HLA molecules.

Due to the possibility of these two types of rejection, laboratories measure the HLA antibodies in circulation to determine the risk of rejection.

HLA types also had correlations with an increased risk of particular diseases. For example, early-onset myasthenia gravis correlates with HLA-B8 as the unique genetic factor that leads to the onset of the disease.
