The West Nile virus infects humans following a mosquito bite. The Culex species of mosquito is the most common vector. Besides humans, the West Nile virus can infect birds, horses, dogs, and many other mammals. Wild birds may be the optimal hosts for harboring and enabling amplification of the virus. Humans are considered accidental dead-end hosts due to the low and transient viral levels in the bloodstream. Additional and rare means of transmission include infected donor blood, organs, breast milk, or transplacental infection.

About 1% of individuals will develop serious symptoms and the overall morbidity is increased in people over the age of 50. The most common complications are neurological. Unfortunately, the lack of federal funding has meant that active surveillance of this virus is not maintained in many states.
