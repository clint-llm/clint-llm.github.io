The signs and symptoms of thrombosis vary depending on the presumed location and acuity. Patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) often present with isolated extremity swelling, pain, warmth, and erythema at the site of the blockage. The patient typically describes the pain associated with a DVT as “crampy” located in the calf or thigh of the affected lower extremity (though can occur in any extremity). They may exhibit a decreased range of motion of the extremity, inability to ambulate, or radiation of pain (e.g., into the groin for LE DVT extending to femoral vein). Patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) may present with pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, back pain, syncope, or even death if severe (e.g., PE associated with hemodynamic instability or right heart strain).

Most commonly, arterial thrombosis results in cardiac or cerebrovascular compromise. Those with acute thrombosis in the coronary arteries of the heart will often report “crushing” left-sided chest pain or heaviness with radiation to the left arm or jaw (classic presentation; though atypical presentations occur frequently). If thrombosis occurs in one of the cerebral arteries (e.g., ischemic stroke), symptoms may include acute onset of unilateral or bilateral weakness, headache, confusion, vision changes, dysarthria, dysphagia, paresthesias, difficulty ambulating, or frank paralysis of one or more extremities.
