RNA makes proteins using amino acids. There are 20 different types of amino acids that make up a protein’s primary structure. Once a ribosome binds to an mRNA transcript, it starts decoding the mRNA codons and recruits tRNAs with the encoded amino acid. Codons are deciphered using the genetic code. In the genetic code, each codon represents a specific amino acid—for example, CUU codes for leucine and GGU codes for glycine. The genetic code is redundant in the fact that different codons can code for the same amino acid. For example, both UAU and UAC code for tryptophan. Once a ribosome finishes reading the mRNA, the amino acid sequence will fold and form a protein.

Besides the most important function of RNA to make proteins, other critical cellular functions include modifying and restructuring of other RNAs and regulation of gene expressions during growth and development, and changing cellular environments.

Some RNAs also function as catalytic RNA to drive biochemical reactions; hence they are termed as ribozymes. The ribozymes also sometimes pair with auxiliary proteins to carry out their catalytic functions. The biochemical reactions catalyzed by ribozymes include protein synthesis, RNA splicing, and RNA cleavage. Ribozymes fold into a complex tertiary structure to form an active site that allows nucleophilic substitution reactions for phosphoryl transfer. These reactions are facilitated through acid-base catalysis with the involvement of ribonucleosides and metal ions.
