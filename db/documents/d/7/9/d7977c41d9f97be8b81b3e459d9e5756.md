Results are recorded on a graph known as the audiogram, which logarithmically plots sound frequency in cycles per second (Hertz or Hz) from low pitch to high pitch along the X-axis and loudness in decibels of hearing level (dB HL) from soft to loud along a reversed Y-axis.

A standard audiogram graphs pitch in octaves and most inter-octaves from 250 Hz to 8000 Hz; the full testable range includes 125 Hz and ultrahigh frequencies of 9, 10, 11.2, 12.5, 14, 16, and 20 kHz.

Pure-tone sounds are presented through the appropriate transducers to the better-hearing ear, if one exists, starting at 1000 Hz. Initially, the tone is presented at a level estimated to be easily audible to confirm the patient understands the task of perception and response. If no response occurs, the volume is increased in 20 dB increments until the patient does respond or reinstruction is deemed necessary.

Once the initial response is obtained, a threshold search is performed in steps by descending 10 dB in volume for every response to a presentation and ascending 5 dB for every presentation without a response.

The standard testing order is 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz, then repeating 1000 Hz to assess intra-test reliability and account for practice effects before proceeding to 500 and 250 Hz. If a patient demonstrates a high number of false positives (responding without stimuli) or false negatives (not responding to stimuli that should be audible), reinstruction may be warranted. Patients with constant tinnitus may have difficulty distinguishing the pure-tone stimuli from their tinnitus, and modification of the tone stimuli to a warbled tone or a series of two or three pulses may be done to improve response accuracy.

Hearing loss is generally categorized by the degree of difficulty detecting sound in 5 dB increments, from normal hearing sensitivity at ≤25 dB HL to mild (26 to 40 dB HL), moderate (41 to 55 dB HL), moderately severe (61 to 70 dB HL), severe (71 to 90 dB HL), or profound (91+ dB HL) hearing loss.

Once AC and BC thresholds are determined, hearing loss is categorized as sensorineural if the frequencies falling outside normal limits have AC and BC thresholds within 10 dB of each other. The hearing loss is considered conductive if BC is within normal limits, but at least one frequency has a difference between BC and AC of ≥15 dB; the loss is described as "mixed" if there are some sensorineural loss frequencies and some conductive loss frequencies, or if the hearing loss has both conductive and sensorineural aspects in one or more frequencies.

The configuration of a hearing loss refers to the shape of the plotted audiogram, as some configurations are strongly correlated with specific causes of hearing loss, such as sloping high-frequency loss with presbycusis, notching mid-frequency loss with genetic causes, or low-frequency hearing loss rising to normal hearing with cochlear hydrops.

Due to how sound transmits through the skull, a sufficiently loud presentation of AC or BC to one ear may cross to the cochlea of the other ear to elicit a response, which may confuse audiometry results.
