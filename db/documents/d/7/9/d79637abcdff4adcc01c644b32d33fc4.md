Renal calculi are a very common condition encountered by doctors in primary care centers around the world. In an extensive clinical database of almost 50,000 nephrolithiasis patients, less than 1% showed no abnormal or sub-optimal chemistries.  A significant portion had abnormal or sub-optimal urinary citrate levels. Interprofessional teamwork is the key to early diagnosis and active management of kidney stone disease, of which hypocitraturia is an important part since it is the easiest urinary chemical abnormality to treat.

24-hour urine testing and treatment can significantly improve urinary chemistry risk factors and reduce the reoccurrence of nephrolithiasis.

According to the current AUA guidelines, all patients with nephrolithiasis should be offered access to a 24-hour urine test for kidney stone prophylaxis, especially for patients with multiple stones or who have a high surgical risk. All members of the healthcare team should cooperate in communicating this information to their nephrolithiasis patients. Optimal management of kidney stone disease requires a team approach for early diagnosis of acute renal colic, prompt urologic surgical removal of significant stones, ensuring that all kidney stone patients are aware of their option to minimize future stone production by having 24-hour urine testing with the prophylactic treatment of conditions like hypocitraturia by urology, nephrology, primary care and other members of the healthcare team.
