The majority of caustic ingestions occur in pediatrics, with 2.16 million toxic exposures reported in the United States, and half of these occurring in the pediatric population. Most commonly, these ingestions are from household products and accidental in the pediatric population. In the adult population, the vast majority are intentional. "Lye" (alkaline substances such as sodium or potassium hydroxides normally contained in household cleaning products) substances make up the majority of caustic ingestions.
