Microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a tumor that most commonly occurs on the head and neck, especially on the central facial skin of middle-aged and older adults.

- Ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

- Prior radiation therapy.

- Immunosuppression or immunosuppressive medications.

- Genetic predisposition.

MAC has been noted to occur at increased incidence after therapeutic radiation in 19% to 50% of studied patients with Fitzpatrick skin types I and II (in whom ultraviolet skin damage may also be a contributing factor) after an average latent period of 30Â to 40 years.

Although the association between immunosuppression and the risk of other skin cancers, such as squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma, has been well studied--the association between immunosuppression and the risk of the development of MAC is less clear.
