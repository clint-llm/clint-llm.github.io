**Development**

The pancreas develops from the posterior foregut endoderm. At about 4 weeks gestation, this endoderm first gives rise to dorsal and ventral buds, which gradually elongate.

The pancreatic enzymes are drained by 2 pancreatic ducts: the duct of Wirsung (major pancreatic duct) and the duct of Santorini (minor pancreatic duct).Â The ventral duct forms the proximal portion of the major pancreatic duct, which opens into the duodenum via the ampulla of Vater. The dorsal duct forms a part of the major ducts as well as the minor duct or the accessory duct of Santorini. The latter usually empties through the ampulla of Vater but may empty independently in approximately 5% of people.
