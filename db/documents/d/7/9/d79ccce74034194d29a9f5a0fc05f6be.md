Depending on the type of the pancreatic cyst, the risk of malignancy varies. Noninvasive diseases typically have a great prognosis.

Five-year survival:

- Resected noninvasive main duct IPMN nearly 100%, however, five-year survival for malignant lesions is around 60%.

- Resected malignant branch duct IPMN around 70%.

- Noninvasive mucinous cystic neoplasm approximately 96% and invasive disease following resection approximately 75%.

- cystic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor approximately 77%.

- limited data is available for solid pseudopapillary neoplasm due to the rarity of the condition.
