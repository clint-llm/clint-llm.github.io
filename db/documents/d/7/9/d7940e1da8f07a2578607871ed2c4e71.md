The mechanisms of carcinoid tumor development and progression are not clear, but some cases are postulated to develop in the setting of proliferating pulmonary neuroendocrine cells via diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) and tumorlets.

Some studies also showed a relationship of this tumor to smoking but the causation relationship is still not concrete. Air pollutants and certain chemicals have also shown a few risk factors among other studies. Some data shows a high incidence among whites and women as compared to men.
