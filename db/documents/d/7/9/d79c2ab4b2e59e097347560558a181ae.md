The vagal nuclei and their nerves mentioned above mainly from the nucleus ambiguus innervate nearly all striated muscles of the pharynx and larynx. These muscles receive innervation from the vagus nerve and glossopharyngeal nerve with the one exception being the tensor veli palatini muscle (V3). The vagus nerve also innervates the palatoglossus muscle, which helps to raise the posterior segment of the tongue. Distal branches of the vagus nerve— the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve and recurrent laryngeal nerves—innervate the cricothyroid muscle and intrinsic muscles of the larynx, respectively.
