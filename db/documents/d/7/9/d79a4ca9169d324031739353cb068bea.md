Testicular cancer is an uncommon malignancy of males. It is divided into germ-cell tumors and sex cord-stromal tumors. Germ cell tumors are the commonest type, accounting for about 95% of testicular malignancies. Germ cell tumors are further divided into seminomatous and non-seminomatous. The rare sex cord-stromal tumors account for about 5% of testicular cancers. A Leydig tumor is the commonest variant.Â Testicular cancer differs from other cancers in having an excellent prognosis and near-complete curability. Hence efforts must be undertaken for the early diagnosis and management of the same.
