PAD and PCD are a spectrum of disorders associated with acute massive VTE, with the exact incidence being difficult to predict due to the rarity of the disease process. The highest incidence of patients occurs in the fifth and sixth decades of life, but ischemic venous thrombosis has been reported as early as 6 months all the way into the 8th decade of life. It has a slightly higher predominance in males versus females.

The majority of cases involve the lower extremities, with the left limb more often affected than the right due to the anatomical relationship between the right iliac artery overlying the left iliac vein; however, it is not uncommon for both lower extremities to be involved. Given the involvement of the iliofemoral segment, PCD is associated with significant post-thrombotic morbidity and high recurrence rates if not treated adequately.
