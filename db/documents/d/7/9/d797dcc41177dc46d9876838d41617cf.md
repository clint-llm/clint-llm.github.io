The abdomen ultimately serves as a cavity to house vital organs of the digestive, urinary, endocrine, exocrine, circulatory, and parts of the reproductive system.

The anterior wall of the abdomen has nine layers. From outermost to innermost, they are skin, subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, external obliques, internal obliques, transversus abdominis, transversalis fascia, preperitoneal adipose and areolar tissue, and the peritoneum. The peritoneum is one continuous membrane; however, it is classified as either visceral (lining the organs) or parietal (lining the cavity wall). A peritoneal cavity is therefore formed and filled with extracellular fluid used to lubricate the surfaces to reduce friction. The peritoneum is comprised of a layer of simple squamous epithelial cells.

The subcutaneous tissue of the anterior abdominal wall below the umbilicus also separates into two distinct layers: the superficial fatty layer known as Camper's fascia, and the deeper membranous layer known as Scarpa's fascia. This membranous layer is continuous with Colles fascia within the perineal region inferiorly.

The true abdominal cavity consists of the stomach, duodenum (first part), jejunum, ileum, liver, gallbladder, the tail of the pancreas, spleen, and the transverse colon.

The posterior wall of the abdominal cavity is known as the retroperitoneum.**SAD PUCKER**.
