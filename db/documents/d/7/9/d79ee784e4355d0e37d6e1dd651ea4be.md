The breast or mammary gland is found on the thorax underneath the skin and is considered a subcutaneous organ. Boundaries of the breast are as follows: clavicle superiorly, inframammary fold inferiorly, sternum medially, serratus anterior laterally, pectoral muscles posteriorly, and skin anteriorly. The breast spans from the second to the sixth intercostal space.

The subpectoral space boundary follows the pectoralis major muscle anteriorly, rib cage and pectoralis minor posteriorly, serratus anterior laterally, and subcutaneous tissue inferiorly covered with mastectomy flap.

The pre-pectoral space is defined as the space between the pectoralis major muscle fascia and the mastectomy flap.
