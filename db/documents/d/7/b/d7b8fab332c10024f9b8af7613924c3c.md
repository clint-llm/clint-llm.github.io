In discussing the indications for liposuction, one must take into account that liposuction most often is considered an aesthetic procedure and, as such, is completely elective. Therefore, the burden of proof for demonstrating that the patient is a viable candidate for the procedure lies with the surgeon.

- The patient must demonstrate deviations from normal body contour caused by excess adiposity in the region.

- The patient should be within 30% of their normal body mass index (BMI).

- An ideal candidate is non-obese, with minimal skin laxity, and minimal to moderately excess adipose tissue.

- A patient's weight should be stable for six to twelve months prior to surgery.
