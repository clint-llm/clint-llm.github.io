Koilocytosis and its significance vary between organ systems. Koilocytosis reveals HPV infection, which is often transient. The immune system clears most HPV infections within 18 months.

In certain cancers of the head and neck, HPV testing has prognostic significance, but the diagnostic algorithm does not include the identification of koilocytes. Survival is better in patients with HPV-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck compared to squamous cell carcinoma that is not HPV-associated.

Anal cancers are frequently associated with HPV, and anal cytology specimens undergo evaluation in much the same manner as cervical Pap smears. Koilocytes are not a frequent finding, but they are diagnostic of LSIL in this anatomic location as well.

In penile cancer, the absence of koilocytosis may predict lymph node metastasis.

As research continues, the role of koilocytosis in different organ systems may change. Currently, koilocytosis acts as a marker for HPV infection and may help direct further diagnostic decision-making.
