There are no current guidelines in place for monitoring dexrazoxane. However, this drug leads to an acute rise in liver protein production, which may be indicated as increased liver function tests (LFT), i.e., elevated alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase. Constant monitoring of liver enzymes may be required with the administration of dexrazoxane, keeping in mind that a combination of both dexrazoxane and doxorubicin would lead to a greater increase in hepatic protein production than dexrazoxane alone.
