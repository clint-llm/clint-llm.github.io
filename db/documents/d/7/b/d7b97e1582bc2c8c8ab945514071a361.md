The sensory nerve supply of the skin over the glabella is from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve and its branches. The frontal nerve (branch of the ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve) divides into supratrochlear and supraorbital nerves. The supratrochlear nerve exits the orbit between the pulley of the superior oblique muscle and supraorbital foramen, passes under the corrugator muscles to supply the skin of the glabella, medial forehead, upper eyelid, and medial conjunctiva.

The motor nerve supply of the glabellar complex muscles is by the facial nerve. The facial nerve exits the stylomastoid foramen to enter the parotid gland and divides into temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular, and cervical branches. The temporal branch of the facial nerve crosses the zygomatic arch, and lateral orbital rim to reach the frontalis muscle. The innervation of the corrugator muscles is via the temporal and zygomatic branches of the facial nerve. Procerus muscle may receive supply by the temporal, zygomatic, or deep buccal branch of the facial nerve. The zygomatic or the upper buccal division sends a nerve cranially along the side of the nose to innervate the nasalis, followed by the procerus and corrugator.
