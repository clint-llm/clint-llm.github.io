Microscopic colitis is one of the many causes of chronic diarrhea. It is diagnosed based on biopsy results obtained during colonoscopy. Symptom control and remission generally occur with medication management, but some patients will not find relief. Surgery is an option but should be avoided unless symptoms are severe and intolerable. Patients will typically have three3 or more bowel movements daily most of which are watery, and most patients will have at least nine bowel movements daily. The goal of therapy is three or fewer bowel movements daily with no watery bowel movements. Some known provoking factors of this disease include tobacco use, particularly smoking cigarettes, and NSAID use. Patients should be encouraged to stop smoking and to decrease or stop the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen. There is not currently a known association with an increased risk of colon cancer. Expect symptoms to recur, though it is important to note any change in symptoms for further evaluation.
