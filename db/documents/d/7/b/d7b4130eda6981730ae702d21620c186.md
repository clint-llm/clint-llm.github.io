Fat grafting is a technique in which harvested adipose tissue is injected underneath the skin to reconstruct traumatic, oncologic, or congenital defects. The technique may also be used for cosmetic purposes, particularly facial rejuvenation. The term "autologous fat grafting" refers to the same procedure when the fat is harvested from the person who will receive it, which is the most common clinical scenario. Autologous fat is considered by many to be the ideal filler material for facial rejuvenation, as it is 100% biocompatible, produces a soft and natural result, and is theoretically a permanent intervention. This activity reviews the utility of this procedure for facial rejuvenation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing and improving care for patients who undergo autologous fat grafting.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications and contraindications for autologous fat grafting in the face.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique required to perform autologous fat grafting for facial rejuvenation.
- Review the potential complications of autologous fat grafting.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to optimize outcomes from autologous fat grafting.
