Fluid compartments in the human body are divided between the intracellular and extracellular spaces. The extracellular space constitutes about one-third of total body water, further divided into intravascular plasma volume (25%) and the extravascular interstitial space (75%). The fluid balance between these compartments is maintained by hydrostatic pressures and oncotic pressures described by Starling. The other two important factors in fluid balance are vessel wall permeability and the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system collects fluid and filtered proteins from the interstitial space and returns that back to the vasculature. Any disturbance in this delicate homeostasis that results in net filtration out of the vascular space or impaired fluid return by lymphatics leads to fluid accumulation in the interstitial space, called edema. Edema can affect any body part and range from local swelling to full-blown anasarca, depending on the underlying pathology. A classic example of local swelling is an insect bite. An example of anasarca can be seen in nephrotic syndrome.

Other than localized edema, edema does not become clinically apparent until the interstitial volume has increased by 2.5 to 3 liters because the tissues constituting the interstitium can easily accommodate several liters of fluid. Therefore, a patient's weight may increase by nearly 10% before pitting edema is evident.
