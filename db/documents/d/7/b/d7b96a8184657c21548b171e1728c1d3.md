The optimal treatment of Warthin tumor relies on surgical removal, which can be easily realized due to the superficial location of the tumor. Some surgeons prefer the superficial parotidectomy to avoid the rupture of the tumor capsule, whereas others chose local resection with the surrounding tissue.

Since the Warthin tumor is well-defined and because of its superficial location on the surface layer of the parotid gland, some authors prefer to perform superficial parotidectomy. The best treatment option for Warthin tumor located in the deep lobe is deep parotidectomy following superficial parotidectomy and confirmation of the facial nerves. According to some authors, since Warthin tumor is often located in the tail of the parotid gland, partial parotidectomy could be a relevant option. Partial parotidectomy excises not only the bottom branches of the facial nerves but also the tumor, including the neighboring normal tissues.
