**Before Treatment**

- Monitor and evaluate the electrolytes, especially potassium and sodium. Reevaluating electrolytes in patients at risk for electrolyte disturbances during the treatment is recommended.

- Monitor patients for QT-prolongation.  ECG is necessary for patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, or concomitant use of other QT-prolonging drugs.

**During Treatment**

- Patients need to be assessed and monitored for worsening depression, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior during the initial few months of therapy or when the dose increases or decreases. Weekly face-to-face contact with patients during the initial first month of treatment, followed by visits every other week for the next month and ultimately at three-month intervals, is recommended.

- Weight and growth should be monitored regularly by a physician during treatment in children and adolescents.

- According to Beers Criteria monitor sodium level closely when starting or adjusting the dose of citalopram in patients age 65 and above.
