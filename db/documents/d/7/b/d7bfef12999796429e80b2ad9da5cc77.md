In most instances, dysplastic lesions of the cervix are not visible to the naked eye, and it is the pap smear which detects abnormalities requiring further evaluation. Some lesions appear as exophytic or plaque-like growths on the cervix.  HPV can cause anogenital warts and thus prompt further investigation into other abnormalities caused by HPV.
