Orbital hypertelorism is defined as an increased distance between the orbits, with true lateral displacement of the orbits. Hypertelorism is associated with underlying craniosynostosis syndromes, median facial clefting, and some other genetic syndromes. Evaluation of hypertelorism includes precise measurement and a complete dysmorphology exam. Referral to a geneticist is indicated for patients with hypertelorism, and genetic testing is often indicated. Patients may benefit from evaluation by an interprofessional craniofacial team, and surgical reconstruction may be indicated.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of hypertelorism.
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of hypertelorism.
- Summarize the management options available for hypertelorism.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication for patients with hypertelorism to improve outcomes.
