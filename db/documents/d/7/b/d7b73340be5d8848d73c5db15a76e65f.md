Retinitis pigmentosa as a clinical entity was originally described in 1853, but the name was not attached to the disease until 1857.

The disease may involve vision loss alone and, in this event, is referred to as "nonsyndromic" RP. The majority of RP cases, about 70% to 80%, fall into the nonsyndromic category. When RP occurs in conjunction with systemic disease, it is termed "syndromic" RP. The most common form of syndromic RP is Usher syndrome, which involves neurosensory hearing loss in association with vision loss.
