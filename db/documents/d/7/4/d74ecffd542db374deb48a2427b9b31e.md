Artificial nutrition refers to the provision or supplementation of daily metabolic nutrition requirements in patients with contraindications to feeding through the mouth or those with inadequate oral intake. Artificial nutrition is provided through parental or enteral access. Parenteral nutrition is provided through a large vein in the central venous system. Enteral nutrition makes use of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to provide nutrition. Enteral access can be obtained by passing a feeding tube through the nose (nasogastric and nasojejunal), mouth (orogastric) at the bedside. It can also be achieved by surgical implantation of a feeding tube into the gut, such as a feeding gastrostomy (stomach) or a feeding jejunostomy (jejunum). Historically, enteral nutrition has not been as well emphasized as parenteral nutrition because of the belief that many disease states will prevent the gut from normal absorptive function. However, it is now clear that enteral nutrition is well tolerated even in severe disease states in critically ill patients. Moreover, enteral nutrition has been associated with reduced infectious complications, lower costs, and reduced length of hospital stay.

Feeding jejunostomy refers to a surgically inserted tube, preferably in the proximal jejunum, to provide enteral nutrition or administer medications. This is different from a definitive jejunostomy, which is commonly done as part of gastric resection by a Roux-en-Y technique. The first person to successfully place a feeding jejunostomy was Bush in 1858, performed on a patient with inoperable gastric cancer.

This chapter is aimed at presentingÂ indications and contraindications of feeding jejunotomies. Furthermore, it describes the equipment, preparation, and techniques of positioning and potential complications with their management. The role of the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance feeding jejunostomies and improve outcomes is also addressed.
