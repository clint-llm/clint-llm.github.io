Fosinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that aims to decrease systemic blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Fosinopril is most often prescribed for patients suffering from hypertension (<140/90 mmHg for non-complicated patients and <130/80 mmHg for patients with either diabetes or chronic kidney disease).

Fosinopril is also prescribed as an adjunctive treatment of heart failure (HF) along with conventional therapy that includes diuretics with or without digitalis. Once-daily fosinopril treatment has been shown to improve HF signs and symptoms and reduce hospitalizations for worsening HF.

Also, in the Fosinopril Acute Myocardial Infarction Study (FAMIS), early treatment with fosinopril has shown to benefit patients with acute myocardial infarction in addition to a prevention of left ventricular (LV) remodeling.

Fosinopril also works as a preventative therapy for patients with diabetic nephropathy. In a randomized clinical trial of patients with diabetic nephropathy, fosinopril combined treatment with losartan resulted in reduced 24-hour total urine protein excretion, serum creatinine, and BUN.

Off-label use of fosinopril also includes the treatment of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN).
