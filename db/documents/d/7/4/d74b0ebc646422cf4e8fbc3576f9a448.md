The approach to the management of cardiac rhabdomyoma is interprofessional. Inter-personal communication between the general practitioners, cardiologists, and cardiothoracic surgeon plays a pivotal role. There is a growing body of evidence for the use of everolimus in the management of cardiac rhabdomyoma, and pharmacists can guide the proper use of the medication. Every step of the management needs to be communicated to the family, which is also an important part of patient-centered care.Â Patient safety should always be a priority, which again requires a great team effort and performance.
