Vitamin B6 supplementation is a therapeutic option for a variety of medical conditions. Pyridoxine is used in supratherapeutic doses as an antidote to treat seizures from isoniazid toxicity.

Over-the-counter supplements are the most likely culprit for patients taking a pyridoxine level above the safe recommended upper limit. Often patients are unaware that high-dose pyridoxine could be harmful. One illustrative case report describes a patient presenting to a healthcare facility with peripheral neuropathy, and he reported taking vitamin B-complex supplements at fifty times the daily suggested allowance for ten years.

According to the 2017 U.S. poison center data, there were 566 reports of using pyridoxine therapeutically as an antidote.
