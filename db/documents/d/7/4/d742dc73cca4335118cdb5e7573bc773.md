Pecs blocks are most often performed in the preoperative period but can be placed postoperatively as well. Pecs blocks are placed by anesthesiologists, anesthesiology residents, or nurse anesthetists. A peri-operative nurse should be present throughout the procedure to assist with the procedure timeout, patient positioning, and monitoring. A proper timeout includes verifying the procedure performed, side of procedure, allergies, and any potential contraindications to performing the procedure. During the procedure, sterility is an absolute necessity. Resuscitation equipment and medication must be readily accessible in case of emergency. If using sedation, then a dedicated nurse should monitor the patient for the duration of the procedure.

Post-operatively, nursing should continue to monitor the patients and should be made aware of potential complications post-procedure, including bleeding, local anesthetic toxicity, and pneumothorax. This appraoch exemplifies the interprofessional team paradigm that is most likely to deliver positive patient results. [Level V]
