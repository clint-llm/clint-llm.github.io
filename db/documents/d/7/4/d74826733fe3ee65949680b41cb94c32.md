This article contains a synopsis of the anatomy, embryology, and classification of posterior urethral valves with a brief discussion of the theories and research that lead to the current understanding of posterior urethral valves. This is followed by descriptions of the presentations, investigations, and management of this condition. Finally, there is a comment on the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with posterior urethral valves and the importance of patient-centered care, particularly at the transitional stage between pediatric and adult services.
