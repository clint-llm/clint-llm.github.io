The solid organ recipients should be counseled and taught to remain vigilant of this potential problem. The National Kidney Foundation conducted a survey about whether transplant recipients remembered receiving information about the risk of cancer and other complications. The results were not promising as only one-third of these patients recalled receiving information from a health care professional about cancer risks before the procedure. One fourth (23%) of all the patients learned about the risk of post-transplant cancer only after their surgery. Filling this void a priority and detailed conversation before transplant and on follow-up visits need to take place. The patients should receive counseling regarding the risk factors that can be controlled or manipulated (e.g., immunosuppressive drugs, untreated viral infections), there is a window of opportunity to prevent post-transplant cancers. Thus, lies the importance of constant patient education.
