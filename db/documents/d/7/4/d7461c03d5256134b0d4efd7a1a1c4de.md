Any child presenting with leukocoria should be evaluated for vision, pupillary reflexes, slit-lamp examination of both anterior segment and fundus, indirect ophthalmoscopy, FFA, OCT of the retina, and B scan ultrasonography. Neuroimaging, blood workup, genetic testing, and fine-needle aspiration cytology are other ancillary tests done to confirm the diagnosis.

- **Pupillary reflex:**In a dark room, looking through the direct ophthalmoscope set at ‘0’ from a distance of 18 inches away from the eye, when light is projected onto the eyes, a normal red reflex should emanate from both eyes and should be symmetrical in color and contrast. A markedly diminished reflex, a white reflex, dark spots in the reflex, or an asymmetry (Bruckner reflex) are all considered abnormal. When in doubt, dilate the pupil with dilating drops to examine the reflex in detail. For infants under nine months of age, a combination of cyclopentolate 0.2% with phenylephrine 1% eye drops are used 45 minutes prior to the examination.

- **Bruckner reflex:**When viewed through a direct ophthalmoscope, when strabismus is present, the fixating eye has a darker reflex than the deviating eye. This test would help differentiate leukocoria from altered reflexes produced in small-angle deviations and amblyopia (anisometropia).

- **Ultrasonography:**This is recommended in all patients presenting with leukocoria. It is highly specific for detecting intraocular calcifications (90%) in retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is seen as a solid retinal mass with high reflectivity due to calcification. Coats disease is seen as a retinal detachment, and the point echoes in the subretinal fluid with no retinal mass lesion. Toxocariasis shows an elevated granuloma with no calcification. Astrocytic hamartomas present as glistening yellow calcification in contrast to the dull, chalky white calcification of retinoblastoma. Ultrasonography helps in differentiating an isolated retinal detachment from one associated with a retinal mass lesion. Medulloepithelioma shows a pattern of heterogeneous areas of high internal reflectivity. Clear cysts are visible within the mass.

- **Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA):**Retcam photography with FFA is very useful in evaluating leukocoria in infants. Coats disease shows retinal telangiectasia as a ‘lightbulb’ appearance with late leakage and peripheral non-perfusion areas. Retinoblastoma shows a rapid homogenous hyperfluorescence. Toxocariasis granulomas show reticular hyperfluorescence with retinal traction. ROP and FEVR demonstrate a peripheral avascular zone.

- **Optical coherence tomography (OCT):**It is a noninvasive test to assess fluid, edema, or fibrosis in the posterior pole lesions. Anterior segment OCT (AS-OCT) would help delineate the size and extent of Medulloepithelioma.

- **Computerized tomography (CT):**CT is avoided in children due to high exposure to radiation but can be useful if intraocular calcification is doubtful.

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):**It is a diagnostic modality of choice to detect the intracranial spread of retinoblastoma and other secondary tumors like pinealoblastoma or parasellar neuroblastoma. Retinoblastoma is seen as an isointense to a hyperintense lesion on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2-weighted images.

- **Blood investigations:**These are helpful in toxocariasis, TORCH infections, and endogenous endophthalmitis.

- **Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC):**Vitreous tap helps in endogenous endophthalmitis and chronic endophthalmitis secondary to toxocariasis. It is contraindicated in retinoblastoma as it leads to seeding and metastasis. Anterior chamber tap shows eosinophils in toxocariasis. The ratio of aqueous to plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is more than 1.0 in retinoblastoma. It is usually less than 1.0 in ocular diseases other than RB. Aqueous LDH serves as a histologic tumor marker and correlates with the severity of retinoblastoma (types 4 and 5). Isoenzymes LDH4 and LDH5 are characteristically elevated.

- **Genetic testing:**This helps in the diagnosis and genetic counseling of retinoblastoma, FEVR, astrocytic hamartoma, and Coats disease (NDP gene). Analysis of the retinoblastoma gene is done by direct and indirect methods. The direct method aims to detect the initial mutation that formed the tumor and subsequently find out whether the mutation is in the germline of the patient. Indirect methods are used if the initial mutation cannot be located. DNA can be evaluated from the tumor cells or from leukocytes. The deletion of the RB gene is detected by karyotyping and the Southern blot technique. Point mutations are detected by ribonuclease protection, gel electrophoresis, and direct DNA sequencing.
