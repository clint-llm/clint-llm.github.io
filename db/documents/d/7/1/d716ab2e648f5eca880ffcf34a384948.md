Airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation are key features of asthma. Bronchial smooth muscle constriction and airway inflammation lead to the obstructive process known as bronchospasm. Triggers of bronchospasm include allergens (e.g., medications or latex-based medical equipment), respiratory infection, smoke, cold air, exercise, stress, and physical stimulus/trauma to the airway, among others.
