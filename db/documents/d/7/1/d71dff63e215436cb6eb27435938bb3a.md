Struvite stones occur much more commonly in females. This is explained by the much greater likelihood of UTIs in women and the close association of UTIs and struvite stone formation.

In the United States, about 5%Â to 15% of all renal stones are composed of struvite, while worldwide, this percentage goes up to 30% of all nephrolithiasis cases.

While it was previously thought that asymptomatic struvite stones were relatively harmless, more recent studies have demonstrated that 30% of patients treated conservatively without surgery ultimately died of sepsis or renal failure. Untreated, struvite stones have shown a 15-year overall survival rate of only 41%.

While the majority of struvite stones are unilateral, up to 15% may be bilateral.

Struvite stones also cause prolonged irritation, infection, and chronic inflammation, which can rarely result in squamous cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis or collecting system. These cancers, while rare, have an average 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and are considered quite dangerous.
