The current understanding is that IgA nephropathy occurs due to a multi-hit mechanism.

Susceptibility to IgA nephropathy is dependent on many genetic and environmental factors. The pathogenesis of this disease is a multi-“hit” process.

The levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 could also be influenced by environmental factors. For instance, these antibodies are prone to bacteria-derived proteases.

Experimental studies in mice suggest that exposure to bacteria is needed for excess IgA production, which is enabled by the mediators of B cell differentiation and proliferation. Although the application of this theory to IgA nephropathy in humans must be made cautiously, this idea is further aided by genome-wide association studies and studies of disease progression.

It is hypothesized that cytokine APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand) contributes to IgA nephropathy by propagating B cell class switch to IgA-producing plasma cells through actions on the TACI receptor. APRIL gene polymorphism confers IgA nephropathy susceptibility, and various risk alleles linked to IgA nephropathy are also associated with several diseases of mucosal immunity.

Activation of complement is described as a significant pathogenic contributor to IgA nephropathy, particularly the lectin pathway. Polymeric IgA1 can activate this pathway, and the mannose-binding lectin pathway is detected in glomerular deposits.
