Vertebrobasilar strokes are interruptions of blood flow to the posterior circulation. While these types of strokes are relatively uncommon, they are a disproportionate cause of morbidity and mortality compared to anterior circulation strokes due to discreet symptoms that resemble non-stroke medical conditions. Patients with a sudden interruption of a vertebrobasilar stroke often present with a chief complaint of nausea or vertigo, delaying appropriate neurological evaluation and preventing or hampering time-dependent interventions. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and management of vertebrobasilar strokes and explains the interprofessional healthcare team's role in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of vertebrobasilar strokes.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of vertebrobasilar strokes.
- Review the treatment options available for vertebrobasilar strokes.
- Summarize the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance vertebrobasilar strokes and improve outcomes.
