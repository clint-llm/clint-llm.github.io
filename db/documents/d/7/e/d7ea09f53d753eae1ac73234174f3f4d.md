The innominate artery usually traverses the trachea between the 6-9th cartilage ring. Thus, when a tracheostomy is placed lower than the 3rd tracheal ring, the risk of a Tracheoinnominate fistula increases. Over-inflation of the cuff is also a known risk for the fistula as it can erode into the posterior segment of the innominate artery. Other risk factors include the use of corticosteroids, radiation therapy to the neck area and recurrent episodes of hypotension causing ischemia.

Several factors can contribute to the friability of tissues and promote the development of a fistulous connection between the trachea and the innominate artery. The first event is the formation of an ulcer due to localized ischemia or infection. This ulceration then progresses to the formation of a fistula between the trachea and the innominate artery.
