- If a patient is hemodynamically unstable with a high clinical suspicion of pneumothorax, needle decompression, or tube thoracostomy must be done immediately.

- If the patient is stable, then diagnostic imaging (i.e., CXR) can be done prior to treatment.

- Cardiac tamponade can clinically mimic tension pneumothorax.

- Patients with high peak inspiratory pressure are at greater risk of tension pneumothorax.

- If patients become hemodynamically unstable or have a cardiac arrest, there is a high suspicion of tension pneumothorax.

- If a chest tube is malpositioning or becomes plugged, it can cease to function, and the pneumothorax can recur.

- In stable patients, local anesthesia or adequate analgesia/sedation should be administered.
