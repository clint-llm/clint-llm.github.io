Bleach exposure may occur by numerous mechanisms. Knowing these mechanisms is crucial to treatment decisions.

Additionally, you must be aware of the many uses for bleach and realize that people may combine chemicals to achieve an initially desirable goal (fumigation, foliage control, area cleaning, etc.). These chemical combinations may yield undesirable products of the reaction.

Causes of bleach exposure include:

- Aerosolized by spray (direct or drift): Pulmonary, ocular, dermatologic (lesser)

- Immersion (direct or splash): Ocular, dermatologic, gastrointestinal (GI)

- Ingestion: GI, pulmonary

- Aspiration: Pulmonary
