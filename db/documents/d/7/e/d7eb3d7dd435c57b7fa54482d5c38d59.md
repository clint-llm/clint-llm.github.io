**Dorsal skin complications:**These are the most commonly encountered complications e.g ulceration, maceration, nail deformity

**Mild extensor lag < 10°****and prominent bump on the dorsal aspect of the DIPJ**: may be present following nonoperative or operative treatment

**Swan neck deformities:**this occurs due to weakness of the volar plate and transverse retinacular ligament at PIPJ level,  and dorsal slippage of the lateral bands with subsequent PIPJ hyperextension. The deformity is maintained by the contracture of the triangular ligament.

**Specific operative treatment complications:**Superficial and deep infection, deformity of the nail, secondary displacement of the fracture, joint incongruity, avascular necrosis, or extensor tendon rupture have been reported with operative management
