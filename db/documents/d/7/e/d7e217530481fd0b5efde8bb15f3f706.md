There are several clinical implications involving the superior mesenteric vein that clinicians must be vigilant about due to a possibly drastic progression. The most serious of these is pylephlebitis. Pylephlebitis is the presence of portal mesenteric venous thrombosis, with or without bacteremia, within 30 days of an intra-abdominal inflammatory process. The most common precursors to pylephlebitis are diverticulitis, acute appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, and gastroenteritis.

In contrast, isolated superior mesenteric venous thrombosis (SMVT) is reported to have milder disease progression compared to portomesenteric venous thrombosis, due to the extensive venous collateral circulation preventing bowel infarction.

Traumatic injuries to the superior mesenteric vein are rare, accounting for 0.1% of trauma admissions, but they are associated with a steep mortality rate of 45 to 52.7%. The mechanism of these injuries is often a penetrating abdominal injury but is increasingly caused by high-speed motor vehicle collisions. Studies indicate that hemodynamic stability upon presentation, the severity of the vascular injury, and the degree of comorbid injuries are the most important factors that influence mortality rates.
