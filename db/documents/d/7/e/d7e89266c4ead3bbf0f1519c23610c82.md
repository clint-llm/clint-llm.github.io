An interventricular septal abscess is a life-threatening complication of infective endocarditis. It occurs as a consequence of either native or prosthetic valve infection or disseminated sepsis. With the advent of various noninvasive imaging modalities, early diagnosis of an interventricular septal abscess has led to medical and surgical interventions to improve outcomes. This activity reviews the etiology, evaluation, and treatment of an interventricular septal abscess.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of an interventricular septal abscess.
- Outline the evaluation of an interventricular septal abscess.
- Review the treatment and management options available for interventricular septal abscess.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies, roles, and responsibilities to improve the evaluation and management of an interventricular septal abscess.
