**Visual Acuity**

Visual acuity should be evaluated in each eye separately, if possible, taking care not to manipulate any possible intrinsic globe injury. Pupillary defects should also be noted.

**Intraocular Pressure**

Intraocular pressure assessment by noncontact tonometry or applanation tonometry is essential in cases of blunt trauma, as secondary glaucoma can result in acute vision loss. Traumatic secondary glaucoma can occur due to blockage, damage, or collapse of the trabecular meshwork, and angle-closure and hypotony can be secondary ciliary body detachment.

**Gonioscopy**

Gonioscopy is helpful to rule out a foreign body, blood in Schlemm's canal, blood in angles, pigment dispersion, and angle recession. Gonioscopy should be performed under topical anesthesia with 0.5% proparacaine and when the eye is not inflamed. Gonioscopy can be deferred or delayed in case of pain.

**Fluorescein Staining**

This investigation is essential to locate the epithelial defect, look for abrasions, erosions, and seidel's test.

**Seidel's Test**

The cornea is stained with fluorescein under topical anesthesia, and the tear site is observed for spontaneous aqueous leak under a cobalt blue filter.

**Forced Seidel's Test**

The cornea is stained with fluorescein stain under topical anesthesia, and the tear site is observed for an aqueous leak on pressure on the globe under a cobalt blue filter.

**Imaging**

**X-Ray**

A plain X-ray of the skull and orbit is helpful to locate any intraocular foreign body. A metallic foreign can show positional changes due to up and down movement.

**B Scan Ultrasonography**

This is an essential tool to locate retinal IOFB rule out retinal detachment, globe rupture, vitreous hemorrhage, choroidal detachment, and suprachoroidal hemorrhage. The examining ophthalmologist has to be careful not to exert excess pressure on the globe in case of open globe injuries to prevent extrusion of intraocular contents.

**Computed Tomography**

Computed tomography (C.T.) imaging can rule out additional maxillofacial injuries while confirming the diagnosis. In addition to globe deformity and retrobulbar hematoma, C.T. imaging can evaluate foreign bodies, scleral disruption, and even vitreous hemorrhage. It is superior to X-ray in locating and detecting IOFBs.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging**

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is superior in detecting and locating occult posterior rupture and soft tissue trauma. MRI is not indicated in cases of metallic foreign bodies.

**Electrodiagnostic Tests**

In cases of doubtful visual acuity, electroretinogram (ERG), electrooculography (EOG), visual evoked potential (VEP) are helpful to assess the integrity of the optic nerve and retina.

**Optical Coherence Tomography**

This investigation is useful to look at the morphology and anatomy of the macula and rule out the macular hole, macular edema, scar, and disruption of IS-OS junction.

A thorough evaluation of any concomitant intracranial and facial bony injury should be pursued. A high number of globe ruptures and retrobulbar hematomas are associated with fractures, particularly the orbital floor. Extraocular motility testing may be decreased in the affected eye because of entrapment, intrinsic globe deformity, or retrobulbar hematoma. Laboratory evaluation should be pursued as the clinical situation dictates in the setting of trauma or anticoagulant use.
