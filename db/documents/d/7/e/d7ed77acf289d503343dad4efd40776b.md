The bowel movement during the ontogenetic process occurs by the concomitant intervention of the enteric system development. This combination is made possible by the presence of embryonic nitric oxide (NO). Its deficiency (NO) causes a decrease in intestinal amplitude and contractile frequency and reduced response to cholinergic, including adrenergic and non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) stimuli (ATP, GABA, dopamine, neuropeptide Y, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and other molecules).
