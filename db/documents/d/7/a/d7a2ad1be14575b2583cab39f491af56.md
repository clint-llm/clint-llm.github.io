Hypothermia occurs as a results of the body dissipating more heat than it absorbs/creates leaving the body unable to generate sufficient heat to maintain an adequate temperature to maintain proper function. Many factors play a role in the development of hypothermia.  While the underlying cause of accidental hypothermia is excessive cold stress and inadequate heat generation from the body (thermogenesis) there are other factors that increase one’s risk of developing hypothermia.  Risk factors include extremes of age, mental disability/disease, malnutrition, dehydration, alcohol abuse, excessive exertion, certain medications, co-morbid medical conditions (ie: hypothyroidism, CV disease, Parkinson’s).  Prolonged or intense exposure and co-existing weather conditions can also increase the risk of developing hypothermia.
