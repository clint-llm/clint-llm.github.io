The normal progression of labor requires the inspection of **three**"Ps," representing power, passage, and passenger. The power comes from uterine contractions and maternal expulsive efforts. The passage is the maternal pelvis, and finally, the fetus is the passenger, who may or may not present itself in a favorable position and presentation. Abnormal progress of labor may be related to fetal factors, uterine factors, bony pelvis factors, or a combination of these. The size of the fetus and the capacity of the maternal pelvis are tested as uterine contractions provide propulsion. Asynclitism or extension of the fetal head as well as occiput posterior or transverse position or mentum or brow presentation may also be etiologies ofÂ abnormal progress of labor or labor dystocia.

A Bandl's ring may uncommonly be associated with protracted labor or labor arrest. This involves the formation of a constricting ring of the uterus which forms between the contractile portion and the lower uterus. It is not clear what causes this contraction ring. Prolonged labor may be a cause of the formation of a Bandl's ring, but the ring may also be an effect of labor dystocia.

**Risk Factors Associated with Abnormal Labor**

- Nulliparity

- Short stature

- High fetal station at full cervical dilation

- chorioamnionitis

- Post-term pregnancy

- Bandl's ring

- Gestational diabetes

- Hypertensive disorders

- Epidural analgesia
