Angioma serpiginosum is benign and asymptomatic but can be severely disfiguring and cause significant psychological distress to the patient. Spontaneous involution may occur but is usually never complete. Treatment is indicated only for cosmetic reasons. Cosmetic camouflage is an effective option. No other topical treatment has been found to be effective in angioma serpiginosum. The treatment of choice is considered to be vascular lasers. Various lasers have been found to be effective in treating angioma serpiginosum including Argon laser, tunable pulsed dye laser (PDL), and intense pulsed light (IPL). The PDL has been the most reported laser used in angioma serpiginosum. One to seven sessions is required. Recently, 532 nm potassium titanyl phosphate laser has shown good results. The longer pulse duration of KTP laser is also related to the lower incidence of adverse effects like purpura, which is an advantage over PDL. The advantage of PDL over KTP would be the ability to penetrate deeper; although, significant depth of penetration is not required for most cases of angioma serpiginosum. KTP lasers also have a smaller beam size as compared to the PDL. Also, KTP is absorbed by melanin (other than hemoglobin/oxyhemoglobin) and therefore requires higher fluences, especially with darker skin. This might be associated with higher incidence of adverse effects.
