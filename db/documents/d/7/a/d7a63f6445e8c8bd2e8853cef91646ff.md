There are a variety of pathologies that affect parietal cell gastric acid secretion, as well as intrinsic factor secretion. The most common cause of gastric pathology worldwide is Helicobacter pylori infection.H. pylori have many virulence factors that promote cellular adhesion (BabA/B, sabA, OipA), evasion of the immune response (LPS), and cell damage mediated through disruption of tight junctions (Ure A/B).H. pylori correlate with hypochlorhydria mediated by interruption of interactions between parietal cells, G cells, ECL cells, and D cells.

Autoimmune gastritis is associated with the loss of parietal cells in the body and fundus, and it accounts for 10% of chronic gastritis cases.

Prostaglandins are responsible for protecting the gastric mucosa from injuries caused by hydrochloric acid. NSAIDs cause gastritis by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which gets mediated by inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase.
