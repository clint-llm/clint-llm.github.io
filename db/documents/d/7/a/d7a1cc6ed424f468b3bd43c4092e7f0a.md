The route used to perform the procedure is based on provider preference, but the placental location may influence the decision.

In the transabdominal approach, the ideal site exposing the longest axis of the placenta is identified. The patient is placed in a supine position, and the abdomen is cleaned with a chlorhexidine or iodine solution. Sterile drapes are placed to create a sterile field. A local anesthetic may be used. An 18 or 20 gauge spinal needle is inserted into the placenta under continuous ultrasound guidance. A 20 cc syringe containing collection media is attached to the end of the needle once the stylet is removed. Negative pressure is created, and the needle is moved up and down through the placenta, collecting the tissue. Once the sample is collected, it is evaluated to ensure sufficient chorionic villi were aspirated.

In the transcervical approach, the patient is placed in a lithotomy position, and a sterile speculum is inserted into the vagina. The cervix is cleaned with an iodine solution. A single tooth tenaculum may be applied to the anterior lip of the cervix to facilitate passage of the catheter. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, a transcervical CVS catheter is inserted into the placenta. The catheter contains a malleable guidewire with an echogenic tip, which can be identified on ultrasound. Once in the proper location, the stylet is removed, and a 20 cc syringe containing media is attached to the end of the catheter, and negative pressure is created. The sample is evaluated for adequacy prior to ending the procedure. Transcervical CVS can also be performed using small biopsy forceps.

Tissue samples are sent to the laboratory for culturing and further testing, including conventional karyotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and chromosomal microarray. Rapid assessment results return in 2 to 4 days, and cultured samples result in 1 to 2 weeks. Families should meet with their provider to discuss further management. Additional ultrasounds may be performed, and MSAFP may be collected at 16 weeks to screen for open neural tube defects.
