There are no specific diagnostic tests that are used as the gold standard for spasmodic dysphonia. Typically, it is recognized by its characteristic history, endoscopic and physical exam findings, and auditory-perceptual findings such as voice breaks and breathiness. Additionally, these findings characteristically vanish during emotional vocalizations, such as laughter and crying. On exam, ADSD can be elicited with words that begin with vowels, counting from 80-89, and with classic phrases such as "we eat eggs every day." ABSD is most noticeable following voiceless consonants, classic sentences such as "the puppy bit the tape," and by counting from 60 to 69.

Voice therapy is sometimes trialed prior to botulinum toxin therapy. However, once the disease is recognized, botulinum toxin therapy can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Select patients who have had alternative surgical procedures for SD, such as selective laryngeal adductor denervation and reinnervation (SLAD-R), may also require botulinum toxin to manage recurrent symptoms after the procedure.

Botulinum toxin is indicated in spasmodic dysphonia with and without vocal tremor, isolated vocal tremor, vocal process granuloma, and cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction.
