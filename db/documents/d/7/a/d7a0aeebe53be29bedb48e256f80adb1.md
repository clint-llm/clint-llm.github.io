Serological testing is currently the primary method of diagnosing syphilis. The two types of serological tests are non-treponemal (non-specific) and treponemal (specific). Non-treponemal tests include RPR, VDRL, and toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST). RPR and VDRL are most commonly used. Treponemal tests include TPPA, CLIA, and TP-EIA. Syphilis can also be diagnosed using dark ground microscopy of samples of genital lesions in those with primary and secondary syphilis.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using non-treponemal reagin tests as the first-line for screening for syphilis infection. The two main non-treponemal tests used are RPR and VDRL.
