Diving using an underwater breathing apparatus (UBA) of any type involves inspiration of compressed gas by the diver at pressures above normal surface pressure. Seawater is sufficiently denser than airÂ such that the pressure exerted by one atmosphere (atm) of air is equivalent to the pressure at 33 feet of seawater (fsw), meaning that ambient pressure on a diver will double in the first 33 feet of descent. During any dive, a diver is subject to the limitations imposed by Boyle's Law, which states that pressure and volume are inversely related. As pressure decreases, the volume will increase proportionally, which means that the same diver holding his breath and ascending from 33 fsw would double his lung volume on return to the surface if that were anatomically possible without structural damage to the lungs. Acute exacerbation of reactive airway disease, anatomic anomalies such as bullae or blebs, or holding the breath can entrap air in the lungs of a diver. pulmonary overinflation syndrome and results in one or more overexpansion injuries: pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, or arterial gas embolism.
