Gangrene is tissue damage secondary to infection, ischemia, or both. It is a relatively uncommon condition, and early recognition is essential. Gangrene is associated with a high incidence of mortality, and in patients that survive, it can have a massive impact on the quality of life. This activity reviews the identification, evaluation, and treatment of gangrene, highlighting the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology for the development of gangrene.
- Describe the appropriate assessment for a patient with gangrene.
- Explain the management strategies of gangrene.
- Review the importance of an interprofessional approach to the evaluation and treatment for patients with gangrene.
