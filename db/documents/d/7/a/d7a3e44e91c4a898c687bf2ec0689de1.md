Expeditious, humane, and safe care of patients should always guide us in our practice. Peripheral nerve block of the external ear is a valuable procedure to become familiar with as it can expedite analgesia, which will then accelerate the completion of procedures and decrease patient discomfort, whether suturing a laceration, draining an abscess, or removing a foreign body. By utilizing the peripheral nerve block, patient-centered care is at the forefront as it minimizes pain quickly and more safelyÂ than injecting directly into the external ear.

The peripheral nerve improves safety with fewer needle sticks to health professionals compared to direct local injection and shorter overall procedure duration utilizing fewer staff members compared to moderate sedation or general anesthesia. Using ultrasound improves locating the nerves, avoids vasculature, and decreases the amount of anesthetic required. However, interprofessional teamwork between the clinician and nursing staff during and following the procedure will improve patient outcomes.
