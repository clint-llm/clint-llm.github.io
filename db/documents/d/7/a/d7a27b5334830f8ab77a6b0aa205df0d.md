The patient should be in a supine position with the legs resting comfortably on the examination table. Following, the EMG study of the intrinsic foot muscles will complete the test.

Nerve conductions show the reduced amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) of the tibial nerve stimulated at the ankle and recorded from the abductor hallucis and abductor digiti minimi. Sensory conduction studies and mixed conduction techniques are performed, usually with averaging techniques. Due to the wide range of normal values, comparing the results with the other foot (only if it is unaffected) is useful.

Following needle EMG analysis of muscles innervated by medial and lateral plantar nerves must be performed. These muscles are the intrinsic foot muscles and include abductor digiti minimi, abductor hallucis brevis, flexor hallucis brevis, and flexor digitorum brevis. Some neurogenic findings may appear in these muscles in normal subjects, so it is best to compare the findings with the unaffected foot. Additionally, to complete the study, EMG examination of proximal muscles in the calf innervated by the tibial nerve (proximally to the tarsal tunnel) and the peroneal nerve, such as the gastrocnemius and the tibialis anterior muscles respectively, must be normal.
