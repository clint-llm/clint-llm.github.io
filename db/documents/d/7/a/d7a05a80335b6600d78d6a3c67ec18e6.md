The basic laparoscopic equipment required for this operation includes insufflation with CO2, drapes, monitors, laparoscopic instruments, electrocautery, and trocars.

Contrary to conventional laparoscopic procedures, with bariatric patients, the procedure requires longer trocars as well as longer laparoscopic instruments to accommodate for the thicker abdominal wall.

There are many different techniques to perform a gastric bypass; however, many of the steps and equipment required are uniform:

- A total of 5 trocars are typical, ranging from 5 to 12 mm in size

- A liver retractor

- 10 mm, 30-degree angled laparoscope

- Endoscopic linear stapler; some methods require circular stapler

- Endoscope

- Ultrasonic energy device
