The exact pathophysiologic mechanism for development for an incisional hernia is not clearly known

Non-midline incisional hernias are less common. Pathophysiologically, improper healing in more than one layer of the abdominal wall is required before hernia can fully develop. Less obvious or not well-defined hernias may develop from a weakness in one layer of the three abdominal muscles. Recognizing and treating this entity might be challenging. In addition, a ventral hernia can  predispose the patient to the classical complications of incarceration, obstruction or strangulation.
