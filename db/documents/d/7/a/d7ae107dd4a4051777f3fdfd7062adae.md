Atherosclerosis can lead to a build-up of plaque in the carotid artery, causing narrowing and carotid artery disease, which increases the risk for cerebrovascular disease or stroke. Carotid endarterectomy is a surgery performed to remove plaque buildup in the common carotid and internal carotid arteries and improve blood flow. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and technique involved in performing a carotid endarterectomy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the pre-operative and post-operative care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the indications for carotid endarterectomy.
- Describe the technique involved in performing a carotid endarterectomy.
- Review the complications associated with carotid endarterectomy.
- Explain how careful planning and discussion amongst interprofessional team members involved in the management of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomies will improve outcomes.
