There is little meaningful data to compare operative to non-operative treatment of isolated ulnar shaft fractures due to the differences in fracture severity and configuration between operative and non-operative management.

It does seem apparent, however, that for minimally displaced fractures with limited soft tissue damage, early mobilization results in a quicker time to union than prolonged immobilization or functional bracing. Excellent or good functional outcomes appear highest for the functional brace and early mobilization groups, with below elbow bracing being slightly superior to above elbow bracing.

In considering operative interventions, compression plating yields the best patient outcomes. Intramedullary nailing may be an acceptable alternative with the understanding that these patients were reported to have a poorer functional outcome in some studies.
