Pathophysiology includes infections, autoimmune process (Dressler syndrome, postpericardiotomy syndrome), uremia, connective tissue disorder. Â Most cases are idiopathic thought to be caused by a triggering of the inflammatory process resulting in inflammation of the pericardium which causes pericarditis.

Cardiac tamponade results from the rapid filling of fluid within the pericardium, leading to compression of the chambers of the heart, further resulting in decreased venous return, ventricular filling and decreased cardiac output. Pericarditis, autoimmune diseases or neoplasms often result in slow-growing effusions, that over time become large before leading to cardiac tamponade type of picture.
