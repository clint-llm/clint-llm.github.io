Polypharmacy refers to using five or more medications based on a review of current data. Aging places individuals at risk of multi-morbidity (coexistence of 2 or more chronic health conditions) due to associated physiological and pathological changes and increases the chances of being prescribed multiple medications. The cutoff point of 5 drugs is associated with the risk of adverse outcomes such as falls, frailty, disability, and mortality in older adults; hence optimization of medication regimen is one of the critical elements in comprehensive geriatric care. This activity reviews the key elements of polypharmacy therapy in the clinical setting. It discusses how members of an interprofessional team can more effectively manage the care of patients taking multiple medications.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the definition of polypharmacy.
- Describe the reasons for recognizing and managing polypharmacy in the elderly.
- Describe the strategies that can help minimize polypharmacy.
- Outline how an interprofessional approach helps prevent polypharmacy.
