Bronchogenic cysts are foregut-derived cystic malformations of the respiratory tract. They are usually located within the mediastinum at an early stage of gestation or in the lung at a later stage. The treatment of all bronchogenic cysts has its basis as complete surgical excision, and their definitive diagnosis is established primarily by histopathological examination of the surgical specimen. This activity explains the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management in patients with bronchogenic cysts. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating and decreasing long term morbidity in patients with bronchogenic cysts.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology and epidemiology of bronchogenic cysts.
- Outline the evaluation in a patient with a bronchogenic cyst.
- Explain the management strategies in a patient with a bronchogenic cyst including its complications.
- Explain the importance of a cohesive, interprofessional team approach to caring for patients with a bronchogenic cyst.
