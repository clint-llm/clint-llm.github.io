Busulfan is an alkylating chemotherapeutic agent. Alkylating agents are a broad category of antineoplastic agents, but all have a similar mechanism of action. Alkylating agents work specifically by substituting alkyl groups for hydrogen atoms on the cancer cell DNA molecule; this results in cross-linkage within the DNA chain, inhibiting the transcription of DNA into RNA. The inhibition of DNA into RNA causes inhibition of protein synthesis and further results in cytotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic effects.

Busulfan works by having a hydrolysis reaction occur with the two easily displaced methanesulfonate groups located on opposite ends of a butane chain within the drug's chemical structure. This reaction creates positively charged carbonium ions that are highly reactive, which disrupts and damages the cancer cell's DNA. The reaction that occurs is a nucleophilic substitution reaction with the guanine molecules, which creates DNA intrastrand cross-links.

Another inhibitory effect that busulfan exerts on DNA is binding to the cysteine molecules of histone proteins, which leads to DNA-protein binding. Busulfan also disrupts the cellular redox equilibrium by interacting with the sulfhydryl groups of glutathione, resulting in increased oxidative stress in cancer cells.
