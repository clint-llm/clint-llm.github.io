Absolute contraindication to an epidural corticosteroid injection includes active infections. Furthermore, uncontrolled coagulopathy or bleeding disorders (including taking many oral anticoagulants) are contraindications to the procedure as well. Other absolute contraindications include worsening and progressing neurological deterioration. For example, progressive weakness or neurosurgical emergencies such as a grade four spondylolisthesis are contraindications for the procedure. Relative contraindications include uncontrolled medical conditions such as hypertensionÂ or diabetes and pregnancy (given the inability to use fluoroscopy during pregnancy).
