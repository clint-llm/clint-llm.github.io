The word "pneumonia" originates from the ancient Greek word "pneumon," which means "lung," so the word "pneumonia" becomes "lung disease." Medically it is an inflammation of lung parenchyma that is more often, but not always, caused by infections. The many causes of pneumonia include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia and highlights the interprofessional team's role in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of bacterial pneumonia.
- Recall the X-ray findings in a patient with bacterial pneumonia.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for bacterial pneumonia.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of patients affected by bacterial pneumonia and improve outcomes.
