Examples of cases in which scalp laceration occurs range from injuries caused by fall, hammer blows, or bottles to severe blast-related trauma in warzones. Knowing the etiology and mechanism of the injury is vital in evaluating patients with scalp laceration to anticipate and look for associated injuries and their possible complications.
