The morphology of the occlusal surface of the molars is extraordinarily variable. Occlusal fissures are deep invaginations of enamel that can be extremely diverse in shape and have been described as broad or narrow funnels, constricted hourglasses, and multiple invaginations with inverted Y shaped divisions and irregularly shaped.

- V type: they are wide at the top and gradually narrowing towards the bottom. They are shallow and wide and tend to be self-cleaning, somewhat caries resistant, and non-invasive technique is recommended.

- U-type: They are also shallow and wide, tend to be self-cleaning and somewhat caries-resistant, and non-invasive technique is recommended.

- I-type: They are extremely narrow slits. They are deep, narrow, and quite constricted, resembling a bottleneck, caries susceptible, and may require invasive technique.

- IK- type: They are seen as a narrow slit associated with a larger shape at the bottom, may require invasive technique, very susceptible to caries.

However, because of morphological variations, it is not always possible to categorize a tooth as having one particular type of fissure
