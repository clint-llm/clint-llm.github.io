Lymphoscintigraphy is used as an adjunct to neoplasm staging workup and pre-operative planning in breast cancer diagnoses. Lymphoscintigraphy paired with axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy has replaced staging axillary lymph node dissection in early disease and is now considered the standard of care. If sentinel lymph node procedures demonstrate axillary metastasis, axillary lymph node dissection will then be performed.

There are several indications for lymphoscintigraphy, including diagnosis and workup of metastatic diseases as well as diagnosis of lymphatic flow disorders such as lymphatic dysplasia or chylous leaks such as chylous ascites or chylothorax. Lymphoscintigraphy can be used for initial diagnosis as well as outcome monitoring after an intervention.
