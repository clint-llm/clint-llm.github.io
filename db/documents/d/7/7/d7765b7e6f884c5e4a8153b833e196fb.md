The AUA

The depth of the target and route of the needle should be pre-planned before the date of the procedure in order to avoid discovery just prior to the moment of needle insertion that the intended target is not accessible using the intended image guidance technique.  Extra-long needles may need to be specially ordered if the patient is obese.

Patients with difficult to reach targets are served best by coordinating the biopsy such that both US and CT can be used as necessary to afford the advantages of both modalities (i.e., the speed of ultrasound, tissue contrast and resolution of CT).  CT guided biopsies of upper pole lesions protected by ribs may be made feasible only via CT gantry angling and/or trigonometric analysis to estimate the necessary angle of insertion.  The angle at which to direct the needle concerning the level of the table can be calculated by first dividing the depth of the lesion by the distance of the lesion from the skin entry point and then by calculating the inverse tangent of that number.
