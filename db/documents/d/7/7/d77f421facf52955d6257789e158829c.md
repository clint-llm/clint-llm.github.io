The outcome depends on the duration of symptoms, underlying pathology, comorbidities, and patient age. The longer the duration of symptoms, the poorer the outcome. The risk of long-term or permanent erectile dysfunction is high, especially in cases of prolonged priapism, despite optimal treatment. In addition, patients who experience one episode of priapism are at risk for recurrent attacks. A common cause of poor outcomes is infection. Younger men with sickle cell disease should be taught about priapism as early; rapid treatment helps minimize permanent damage and erectile dysfunction.
