Like most muscles of the orbital cavity, the levator palpebrae superioris receives innervation from the third cranial nerve, the oculomotor nerve. The nerve originates from a single caudal subnucleus within the oculomotor nucleus in the midbrain. The nerve exits the brainstem between the superior and posterior cerebellar arteries. Next, it traverses the cavernous sinus laterally before exiting the cranium through the superior orbital fissure, where it divides into the superior and inferior branches. The superior branch crosses over the optic nerve and supplies direct innervation to the levator palpebrae superioris and the superior rectus muscles.
