Small bowel resection can be done during an open or laparoscopic procedure depending on the timing and indication for the surgery. For elective resections, bowel preparation with a low residue diet for several days before the surgery is generally undertaken. Mechanical bowel prep may be added but is not standard. Conditions requiring SBR are often emergent, and therefore pre-op planning is limited to supportive care for the critically ill patient. Collectively, the following preparation strategies are recommended to minimize the post-procedural complications with small bowel resection: 1) optimizing the nutritional status, 2) weaning the immunosuppressive agents, 3)abdominopelvic abscess drainage, specifically in chronic conditions, including Crohn disease.
