In the early stages, when the mass is small (less than 3 centimeters), renal cell cancer is typically asymptomatic. Approximately 25% of patients are asymptomatic, and the solid renal mass is an incidental finding during a routine radiological study.

As the mass grows, symptoms may include hematuria, back pain, flank mass, fatigue, weight loss, anemia, fever, and/or high serum calcium level.

The classic clinical triad of flank pain, hematuria, and flank mass is not common, presenting in only 10% of patients. When this classic triad is present, it usually indicates advanced disease.
