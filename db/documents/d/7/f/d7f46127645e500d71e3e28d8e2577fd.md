Due to the potential CBD’s negative effects on the liver, it is important to measure transaminase and bilirubin levels both before and after treatment initiation. If transaminase levels increase before treatment, this may be a sign of liver damage. By measuring transaminase levels during treatment, earlier identification of potential liver damage may be identified, and CBD may be titrated down. Levels should be obtained prior to, 1 month, and 3 months after initiating treatment. After every change in dose and/or addition of a medication known to affect the liver, transaminase and bilirubin levels should be obtained every month in patients who have liver damage or take drugs known to cause liver damage, valproate, clobazam, etc. At the first signs of liver dysfunction, such as right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and/or dark urine, transaminase and total bilirubin levels should be obtained immediately. If transaminase levels are greater than five times the upper limit of normal or greater than three times the upper limit, with bilirubin levels also being greater than two times the upper limit of normal, they should discontinue treatment.
