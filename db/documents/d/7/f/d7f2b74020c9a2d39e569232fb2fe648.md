Desvenlafaxine is an antidepressant that is an FDA-approved drug to treat major depressive disorder in adults. For healthy women who have contraindications to estrogen, desvenlafaxine can be used off-label to treat hot flashes during menopause. Although not FDA approved in adolescents, the TORDIA studies have shown that serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors like venlafaxine have efficacy in treating major depressive disorder in treatment-resistant depression in adolescents. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions of desvenlafaxine, pertinent for interprofessional team members during desvenlafaxine therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of desvenlafaxine.
- Identify the indications for using desvenlafaxine therapy. 
- Outline the potential adverse events when using desvenlafaxine.
- Review the importance of interprofessional communication improving care coordination among the interprofessional team when initiating desvenlafaxine therapy
