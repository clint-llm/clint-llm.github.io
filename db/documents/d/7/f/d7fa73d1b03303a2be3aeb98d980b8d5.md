An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach to cancer pain care can help achieve the best possible outcomes. A patient with cancer is often first seen by a primary care or advanced practice nurse provider who refers the patient to an oncology center for evaluation by an oncologist. The radiologist frequently performs radiological imaging including MRI and CT scan for the staging of terminal cancer. The imaging studies are vital for the interventional pain physician in planning the neuraxial neurolysis. While neuraxial neurolysis is not recommended unless the patient has less than one year of expected life, early involvement of an interventional pain physician in patient care can optimize the planning and achieve best outcomes. Many patients are referred by physicians who erroneously believe thatÂ neurolytic blocks are permanent and without significant risk. There is a need to introduce an all-inclusive pain and palliative care model at all levels of the healthcare system.
