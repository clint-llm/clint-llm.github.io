Physical findings may be normal. About half of the reported patients are asymptomatic, and the other half have platelet counts < 50 K/uL and abnormal bleeding. Characteristic features of MHA include epistaxis, easy bruising, gingival bleeding, menorrhagia and excessive postoperative bleeding. The bleeding symptoms depend on the degree of thrombocytopenia. They vary from generally mild not requiring specific treatment to rare, severe bleeding episodes after surgical procedures that need blood transfusions. Fatal bleeding has not been reported.
