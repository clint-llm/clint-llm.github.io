Patients typically present to their healthcare provider with the chief complaint of knee pain. Therefore, it is essential to obtain a detailed history of their symptoms. Pay careful attention to the history as knee pain can be referred from the lumbar spine or the hip joint. It is equally important to obtain a detailed medical and surgical history to identify any risk factors associated with secondary knee OA.

The history of the present illness should include the following:

- Onset of symptoms

- Specific location of pain

- Duration of pain and symptoms

- Characteristics of the pain

- Alleviating and aggravating factors

- Any radiation of pain

- Specific timing of symptoms

- Severity of symptoms

- The patient's functional activity

**Clinical Symptoms of Knee OA**

**Knee Pain**

- Typically of gradual onset

- Worse with prolonged activity

- Worse with repetitive bending or stairs

- Worse with inactivity

- Worsening over time

- Better with rest

- Better with ice or anti-inflammatory medication

- Knee stiffness

- Knee swelling

- Decreased ambulatory capacity

Physical examination of the knee should begin with a visual inspection. With the patient standing, look for periarticular erythema and swelling, quadriceps muscle atrophy, and varus or valgus deformities. Observe gait for signs of pain or abnormal motion of the knee joint that can indicate ligamentous instability. Next, inspect the surrounding skin for the presence and location of any scars from previous surgical procedures, overlying evidence of trauma, or any soft tissue lesions.

Range of motion (ROM) testing is an essential aspect of the knee exam. Active and passive ROM with regard to flexion and extension should be assessed and documented.

Palpation along the bony and soft tissue structures is an essential part of any knee exam. The palpatory exam can be broken down into the medial, midline, and lateral structures of the knee.

**Areas of Focus for the Medial Aspect of the Lnee**

- Vastus medialis obliquus

- Superomedial pole patella

- Medial facet of the patella

- Origin of the medial collateral ligament (MCL)

- Midsubstance of the MCL

- Broad insertion of the MCL

- Medial joint line

- Medial meniscus

- Pes anserine tendons and bursa

**Areas of Focus for the Midline of the Knee**

- Quadricep tendon

- Suprapatellar pouch

- Superior pole patella

- Patellar mobility

- Prepatellar bursa

- Patellar tendon

- Tibial tubercle

**Areas of Focus for the Lateral Aspect of the Knee**

- Iliotibial band

- Lateral facet patella

- Lateral collateral ligament (LCL)

- Lateral joint line

- Lateral meniscus

- Gerdy’s tubercle

A thorough neurovascular exam should be performed and documented. It is important to assess the strength of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles as these often will become atrophied in the presence of knee pain. A sensory exam of the femoral, peroneal, and tibial nerve should be assessed as there may be concomitant neurogenic symptoms associated. Palpation of a popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulse is important as any abnormalities may raise the concern for vascular problems.

Other knee tests may be performed, depending on the clinical suspicion based on the history.

**Special Knee Tests**

- Patella apprehension – patellar instability

- J-sign – patellar maltracking

- Patella compression/grind – chondromalacia or patellofemoral arthritis

- Medial McMurray – a medial meniscus tear

- Lateral McMurray – lateral meniscus tear

- Thessaly test – a meniscus tear

- Lachman – anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury

- Anterior drawer – ACL injury

- Pivot shift – ACL injury

- Posterior drawer – posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury

- Posterior sag – PCL injury

- Quadriceps active test – PCL injury

- Valgus stress test – MCL injury

- Varus stress test – LCL injury
