Mpox was a zoonotic disease endemic to central and western Africa and most concentrated in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Although first identified in captive monkeys (hence the name), the available data suggests African rodents as the natural reservoir. Infections have occurred in squirrels, rats, mice, monkeys, prairie dogs, and humans.

Sporadic clusters and cases of human mpox have occurred outside of Africa. In 2003, Gambian giant rats imported from Ghana infected co-habitant prairie dogs sold as household pets in the Midwestern United States. This resulted in fifty-three human cases of mpox.

In May 2021, a family returned to the United Kingdom after traveling to Nigeria, and three family members became infected with the mpox virus.

Precise prevalence and incidence are difficult to establish, given suspected shortcomings in disease reporting and confirmation. However, both metrics have increased since the discontinuation of routine smallpox vaccination.

In 2022, there is now an ongoing Mpox outbreak involving multiple countries on different continents, predominantly in theÂ men who have sex with men (MSM) population, with a presentation involving predominantly genital lesions.

Transmission can occur through contact with bodily fluids, skin lesions, or respiratory droplets of infected animals directly or indirectly via contaminated fomites. Although human-to-human transmission has previously been limited, mathematical modeling in the context of decreasing herd immunity to orthopoxviruses reflects an increasing threat of disease spread between humans.
