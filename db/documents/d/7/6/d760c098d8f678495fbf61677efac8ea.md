Hypertonic fluids are administered parenterally via intravenous infusion. Infusion volumes and rates depend on clinical indication.

**Hypertonic Saline**

In patients with severe hyponatremia, serum sodium should undergo correction by 4 to 6 mEq/L per day, which can be achieved with 100 mL boluses of 3% HS at 10-minute intervals up to three total boluses. Some authorities recommend up toÂ  8 mEq/L per day.

**Mannitol**

Mannitol boluses should be given as 0.25 to 2 g/kg body weight of 15 to 25% mannitol over 30 minutes to 1 hour for the treatment of increased intracranial or intraocular pressures. Pediatric patients should receive a similar 1 to 2g/kg body weight bolus over the same timeframe. Peripheral intravenous catheters are acceptable routes of administration.
