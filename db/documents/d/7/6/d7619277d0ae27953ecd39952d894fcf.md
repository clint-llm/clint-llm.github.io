Hantaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses measuring 80 to 120 nm. The genome is divided into three segments: the large (L), medium (M), and small (S) segments coding for viral transcriptase, glycoproteins of the capsule, and protein of the viral nucleocapsid respectively. At least 11 rodent-borne viruses in the Hantaviridae family are known to cause disease in humans. Infected rodents excrete virus in urine, droppings, and saliva for several weeks to months. Humans can become infected by inhaling air contaminated with the virus and more rarely via a rodent bite. Sin Nombre virus is considered to be the most important North American hantavirus as it is responsible for the majority of cases in the US and Canada. The host for this virus is the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus).
