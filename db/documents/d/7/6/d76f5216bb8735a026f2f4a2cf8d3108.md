Several barriers could prevent a patient from adhering to the bland diet. First, many patients may find the overall texture and lack of seasoning not palatable and unsatisfying. To follow the diet correctly, there are certain items a patient must take special care to avoid. The patient should avoid or strictly limit alcohol and caffeine consumption as these components can cause worsening of a patient's reflux symptoms by causing the lower esophageal sphincter to relax. There is a linear relationship between alcohol consumption and increased risk of worsening reflux or developing GERD. Any known food that will cause the lower esophageal sphincter to relax such as peppermint, chocolate, spicy foods, garlic, tomatoes, and some citrus can also worsen reflux and cause gastrointestinal complaints. Patient compliance at home with eliminating or minimizing these items consumption is essential for adherence to a proper bland diet.

Like any other diets, strict attention to portion control and multiple frequent low volume eating (as opposed to infrequent big-volume late-night meals) is of prime importance. It is very rare that dieting -or bland diets- cause nutritional deficiencies. This can only happen with extreme measures. Eating slowly and avoidance of lying down soon after eating is strongly recommended. Chewing slowly and not going to bed less than 3 hours after eating are of prime importance. If you are eating it and it makes you feel tired, weird, uncomfortable, gassy,...; don't eat it anymore.
