# Continuing Education Activity

The glenohumeral joint is a complex joint that lacks innate stability; the humeral head relies heavily on the ligaments of the shoulder and the rotator cuff to maintain stability. The humeral head stabilizes against the glenoid, which is the lateral articular extension of the scapula. The glenoid is a relatively shallow dish that has multiple morphologies. It is located on the lateral scapula and is the socket portion of the shoulder joint that meets to articulate the humeral head. Fractures to the glenoid are often seen in association with various shoulder instability patterns, although isolated fracture can occur less commonly following direct axial loading forces to the glenoid vault or rim. Glenoid fossa fractures often present with other injuries and are the result of blunt trauma or high-velocity sporting injuries where the humeral head forcefully abuts the glenoid fossa. There have been several glenoid fracture classifications based on the mechanism of injury, location of the fracture, and specific fracture pattern following injury. Traumatic glenoid injuries encompass a wide range of clinical severity and complexity. This activity addresses the interprofessional team's clinical evaluation and management of glenoid fractures.

**Objectives:**
- Explain why the glenohumeral joint is inherently unstable.
- Describe the fracture classifications associated with the glenohumeral joint.
- Review the range of outcomes expected with the management of glenohumeral joint instability.
- Summarize the interprofessional team approach to the evaluation and treatment of glenohumeral joint fractures and instability.

# Introduction

The glenohumeral joint is a complex joint that lacks innate stability; the humeral head relies heavily on the ligaments of the shoulder and the rotator cuff to maintain stability.  The humeral head stabilizes against the glenoid fossa, which is the lateral articular extension of the scapula.

The glenoid fossa fractures are often associated with other injuries and are the result of blunt trauma or high-velocity sporting injuries where the humeral head forcefully abuts the glenoid fossa.

# Etiology

Scapular fractures, including the glenoid fossa, occur secondary to high impact blunt trauma and are often associated with other injuries.

# Epidemiology

A scapular fracture is rare and occurs in less than 1% of all fractures and only 3 to 5% of shoulder girdle injuries.

# Pathophysiology

Many authors have attempted to classify the glenoid fossa fractures. In 1984, Ideberg developed a classification that was based on plain radiology films and consisted of 6 fracture types.

# History and Physical

Accurate history is essential to help determine the mechanism of injury and risk for glenoid fossa injury vs. glenoid rim and avulsion fractures.  The physical exam included an examination of the humerus, clavicle, scapula, and shoulder joint.  The provider should assess both active and passive range of motion, strength, and neurovascular status.

# Evaluation

Scapular fractures may be diagnosed using plain X-ray films, and in a true anteroposterior (scapular plane) and the axillary view, you will have the best view of the glenoid fossa.

# Treatment / Management

Controversy exists over management of the glenoid fracture. Treatment depends on the instability, the degree of displacement, fracture gap, and fragment size.

# Differential Diagnosis

Differential diagnosis includes clavicular fracture, rib fracture, scapular body fracture, scapular process fracture, dislocation, shoulder separation, and rotator cuff injury.

# Prognosis

The outcome is considered to be good in both conservative and operative management. However, there are comorbidities and concurrent injuries that can affect outcomes.

# Complications

Anterior glenoid rim fractures can lead to recurrent dislocations, mal-union, persistent pain, and early onset of osteoarthritis.

# Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care

For many with rigidly fixed fractures or minimally displaced fractures, passive range of motion (ROM) exercises to start a few days after surgery.  Close radiographic follow up is indicated over several weeks to ensure there is no displacement and to ensure the fracture is healing appropriately.  Arthroscopic approach with rigid fixation has the least restriction in ROM, while the anterior and posterior approaches have more restriction in the abduction and rotation, and a brace is often used to limit terminal/provocative ROM which stresses the joint in various instability planes.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients should receive education regarding the potential for chronic, recurrent instability following traumatic shoulder dislocations with associated glenoid bone loss.  In general, younger patients involved in high-level competitive sports (e.g., football) are at the highest risk of recurrent shoulder dislocations.  Furthermore, glenoid bone loss in the setting of shoulder instability reduces the chance of a good outcome and return to sport, even following the appropriate surgical management and postoperative rehabilitation.  Managing patient and family expectations is paramount in all of these clinical scenarios.

# Pearls and Other Issues

The provider should consider other injuries when an injury to the scapula presents on imaging.  This scenario is typically a high impact trauma and is often associated with other injuries to the clavicle, chest, humerus, brachial plexus, c-spine, and head.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

The diagnosis and treatments of glenoid fractures are continuously evolving with enhanced imaging, new fracture classifications, and advanced operative techniques.  Additionally, this is an uncommon fracture which makes treatment and management more complicated given the limited population and studies. Two strong points surfaced in the literature.  One, the mechanism of injury should be a strong consideration of the need for imaging. Evidence shows that other thoracic injuries and a high ISS score should lead to a higher suspicion of scapular fractures and the treatment team should have a low threshold for CT imaging if an injury is suspected. Second, the degree of instability seems to have the most substantial and consistent impact on the need for surgery, but shared decision making with the patient regarding risks and outcomes merits discussion. New advanced techniques can minimize surgical risks.  Conservative treatment has been shown to be effective in non displaced fractures. Comorbidities must be considered including age, level of function, and social history can also impact outcomes and should be viable options when discussing therapy options with the patient.

The diagnosis, management, and treatment of glenoid fractures and other glenohumeral joint injuries require an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level 5] The nursing staff usually coordinates follow-up care and reports back to the clinicians regarding the progress of physical therapy and whether the pain is appropriately controlled. The pharmacist may assist in pain management, sometimes recommended progressive weaning from narcotics to alternative therapies as tolerated. Physical therapists will manage therapy and report to the team regarding progress or relapse. A team approach to the education of the patient involving nurses and clinicians will produce the best long-term results.[Level 5]
