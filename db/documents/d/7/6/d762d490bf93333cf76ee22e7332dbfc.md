In addition to the standard complications of any soft tissue surgical procedure, such as pain, bleeding, infection, and unsatisfactory scarring, there are potential adverse outcomes, particularlyÂ with pretrichial brow lifting. These include but are not limited to numbness of part or all of the forehead due to supraorbital and/or supratrochlear nerve injury, weakness of brow elevation or brow ptosis due to injury to the frontal branch of the facial nerve, hematoma or seroma, brow asymmetry, insufficient brow elevation, over-elevation of the brow, hairline irregularities, and alopecia at the scar line. Additionally, patients should be informed that they will necessarily experience numbness of the scalp posterior to the incision, and this may not ever fully resolve.
