A multi-disciplinary team approach with care coordination is optimal in patients with Klippel Trenaunay syndrome. The mainstay is symptomatic care with medical management, with only a few cases needing surgical intervention.

Skincare is important to prevent superficial infections and bleeding secondary to scratching. Children are monitored closely for limb length discrepancy and referred to orthopedics for orthotics or surgical corrections as needed. Compression stockings, limb elevation, and intermittent pneumatic compression devices are used to minimize lymphedema and venous insufficiency. Sclerotherapy-both conventional and micro-foam have been used for capillary, venous, and lymphatic malformation with promising results.

Laser treatment can be offered for port-wine stains.

Pregnant patients need anti-thrombotic therapy as prophylaxis due to a high risk of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

Rapamycin is a relatively newer therapy that can halt the progression of vascular malformation and improve the quality of life in patients with KTS. This drug works by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Rapamycin-protein complex inhibits the action of mTOR1, leading to the arrest of cell growth, thereby preventing tissue overgrowth. Patients on this medication need to be monitored closely for adverse effects and toxicity, such as hematological and lipid abnormalities.
