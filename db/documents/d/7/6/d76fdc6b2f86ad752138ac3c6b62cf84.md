Microdermabrasion devices are categorized as either crystal or crystal-free systems. The crystal-based system propels abrasive crystals at the skin at a predetermined flow rate. The most common crystal used is aluminum oxide. Sodium chloride, magnesium oxide, and sodium bicarbonate crystals are less commonly employed. With the crystal-free systems, diamonds embedded in the handpiece provide the abrasive stimulus. The following equipment is needed to perform the procedure:

- Microdermabrasion handpiece

- Disposable handpiece tips or autoclave-safe handpiece tips

- Fresh abrasion crystals (for crystal-based systems)

- Filters (for machines with a closed-loop vacuum system)

- Gentle skin cleanser

- Protective equipment (eyewear, gloves, mask)
