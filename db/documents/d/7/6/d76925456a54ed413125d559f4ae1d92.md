The infant with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome is often born premature and presents with signs of respiratory distress usually immediately after delivery, or within minutes of birth. The infant may present with decreased breath sounds and possibly diminished peripheral pulses. Upon clinical examination, such neonates have signs and symptoms of increased work of breathing, including tachypnea, expiratory grunting, nasal flaring, retractions (subcostal, subxiphoid, intercostal, and suprasternal) and use of accessory muscles, as well as cyanosis and poor peripheral perfusion. Auscultation reveals uniformly decreased air entry.Â In untreated RDS, the symptoms will progressively worsen over 48 to 72 hours towards respiratory failure, and the infant may become lethargic and apneic.
