Meckel diverticulum is a common congenital abnormality of the small intestine caused by incomplete obliteration of the vitelline (omphalomesenteric) duct. Most of the patients with Meckel diverticulum are asymptomatic, with the abnormality discovered only incidentally on imaging studies. The most common symptom developed is painless rectal bleeding. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of Meckel diverticulum and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of Meckel diverticulum.
- Identify the risk factors for developing Meckel diverticulum.
- Outline the painless rectal bleeding and characteristic "currant jelly stool" in the history and physical examination of patients with Meckel diverticulum.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by Meckel diverticulum.
