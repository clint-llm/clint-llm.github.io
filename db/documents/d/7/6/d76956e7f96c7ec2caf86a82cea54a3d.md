Monitoring the depth of anesthesia is very important during any procedure, as anesthesia that is too deep can cause hemodynamic changes. Anesthesia that is too light carries the risk of recall or awareness during anesthesia. Awareness during anesthesia is a very serious complication with potential long-term psychological sequelae such as anxiety and post-traumatic disorder. When the bispectral index (BIS) value is maintained below 60, it decreases the incidence of anesthesia awareness. Several neuro monitors based on the processed electroencephalogram or evoked potentials have been developed to evaluate the anesthetic depth. The BIS monitor is the first method that is FDA approved to assess the hypnotic effects of drugs. This activity describes the role of the BIS, its indications, contraindications and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients undergoing general anesthesia.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical relevance of bispectral index.
- Identify the equipment needed for bispectral index monitoring.
- Summarize the complications of bispectral index.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients undergoing general anesthesia with bispectral index monitoring.
