# Continuing Education Activity

Febuxostat is a medication used to manage and treat hyperuricemia and gout. It is in a class of drugs known as xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Due to an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality with febuxostat versus allopurinol, the FDA recently recommended limiting the use of febuxostat to patients for whom allopurinol is not efficacious or who experience severe adverse effects with allopurinol. This activity will describe the indications, mechanism of action, administration, adverse event profile, contraindications, and monitoring of febuxostat. It also highlights other key factors of dosing, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and relevant interactions pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with gout and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of febuxostat.
- Describe the adverse effects of febuxostat.
- Outline the appropriate monitoring for patients taking febuxostat.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance febuxostat and improve outcomes.

# Indications

Febuxostat is an inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase and is FDA-approved for the chronic management of hyperuricemia in patients diagnosed with gout.

# Mechanism of Action

Febuxostat is a non-purine selective inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which is involved in purine catabolism.

**Pharmacokinetics**

- **Absorption:**Febuxostat is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations(Cmax) attained after 1 to 1.5 hours of oral administration. Approximately 49% of the orally administered dose of febuxostat is absorbed orally.

- **Distribution:**The steady-state volume of distribution of febuxostat is approximately 50 liters. Febuxostat has high plasma protein binding(PPB) and binds primarily to albumin. The PPB of febuxostat is approximately 99%.

- **Metabolism:**Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by conjugation via UGT( uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase) enzymes, including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7. Febuxostat is metabolized by CYPs1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and non-CYP enzymes. Febuxostat also inhibits breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) activity.

- **Elimination:**The apparent mean elimination half-life (t1/2) of febuxostat is approximately 5 to 8 hours. Metabolites of febuxostat are eliminated by both hepatic and renal routes. The percentage of febuxostat excreted unchanged in the urine is less than 5%.

# Administration

Febuxostat is available in both 40 mg and 80 mg tablet formulations. Febuxostat is administered orally with an initial dose of 40 mg per day.

**Use in Specific Patient Populations**

- **Patients with Hepatic Impairment:**No dose adjustment is necessary for mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate hepatic impairment(Child-Pugh Class B) in patients receiving febuxostat therapy. No clinical studies have been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), hence use with extreme caution.

- ****Patients with Renal Impairment:********No dosage adjustment of febuxostat is necessary for mild or moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 89 mL/min). In patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl< 30 mL/min), the dose of febuxostat tablets is reduced to 40 mg once daily. American College of Rheumatology guidelines recommends febuxostat for patients with moderate to severe CKD.

- **Pregnancy Considerations:**Gout is rare in reproductive-age females due to the uricosuric effects of estrogen. In pregnant women, gout is quite uncommon. In preclinical studies, neonatal mortality has been observed at approximately 40 times the MRHD(maximum recommended human dose). Use with caution. Pharmacological management should be based on risk-benefit assessments.

- ******Breastfeeding Considerations:******No clinical information is available on using febuxostat during lactation. Hypothetically, febuxostat is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins; consequently, the concentration of febuxostat in maternal milk is likely to be low. Additionally, the oral bioavailability of febuxostat is only about 50%, so the amount an infant receives systemically is expected to be very small. However, febuxostat is present in rat milk. Hence the risk-benefit analysis is crucial before febuxostat is administered to a nursing mother. An alternative agent, allopurinol, should be considered during lactation.

**Boxed Warning**

- **Cardiovascular Events:**In randomized controlled studies, there was a higher rate of cardiovascular deaths and non-fatal myocardial infarctions and strokes in the febuxostat-treated group compared with the allopurinol-treated group. Based on this new information, the FDA is limiting the use of febuxostat to patients for which allopurinol is not efficacious or patients who experience severe adverse effects with allopurinol, and there is now a boxed warning of cardiovascular death.

**Warnings and Precautions**

- **Gout Flares:**An increase in gout flares frequently occurs after the initiation of febuxostat.

- **Hepatotoxicity:**In randomized controlled studies, liver function abnormalities were reported, including transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal.****Although this effect has not demonstrated that it is clinically significant, recommendations include a liver test panel, including serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, before initiating febuxostat treatment as a baseline measurement as well as periodically during treatment and in patients experiencing any signs of hepatic injury.

- ****Severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR):****Severe hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia & systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been attributed to febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if severe skin reactions are suspected and initiate prompt treatment.

**Drug-Drug Interactions**

- Antacids such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide delay absorption by approximately 1 hour, but the extent of absorption is not affected. Therefore, febuxostat may be administered without regard to antacid use.

- Administration of febuxostat with theophylline increases the concentration and absorption of theophylline. These differences were not deemed statistically significant in the study. However, there was a 400-fold increase in 1-methylxanthine (a metabolite of theophylline) excreted in urine due to xanthine oxidase inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of chronic long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been assessed. Caution is advised when febuxostat is administered with theophylline.

- Concurrent administration of repaglinide with febuxostat can cause severe hypoglycemia. Febuxostat inhibits CYP2C8, resulting in delayed elimination and increased concentration of repaglinide.

- Febuxostat inhibits the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and concomitant administration of febuxostat increases methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity by inhibiting hepatic BCRP.

- Rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate; febuxostat increases rosuvastatin exposure by inhibiting its BCRP-mediated efflux in the small intestine.

# Contraindications

Febuxostat contraindications include patients treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Xanthine oxidase inhibition increases concentrations of azathioprine and mercaptopurine, resulting in serious toxicity such as myelosuppression.

# Monitoring

Patient monitoring should include signs and symptoms of MI, stroke, and liver injury, as described above in the warnings and precautions section.

A treat-to-target management strategy includes urate-lowering therapy (febuxostat/allopurinol) dosing directed by serial serum urate measurements to accomplish a target serum urate is recommended over a fixed-dose drug strategy. Consequently, monitor serum urate levels and adjust the dose of febuxostat to maintain the serum urate target of <6 mg/dl. (ACR 2020 guidelines).

A lower serum urate target (<5 mg/dL) helps promote the rapid dissolution of crystals. It is suggested for patients with severe gout until total crystal dissolution and resolution of gout, according to EULAR (European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology) guidelines.

# Toxicity

There is no known human toxicity with febuxostat treatment. Febuxostat was evaluated in healthy patients in doses of up to 300 mg daily for seven days without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. Patients should be given symptomatic and supportive care in overdose.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, characterized by painful episodes of arthritis; gout results in substantial morbidity and disability.

As of early 2019, febuxostat is now recommended only for patients with gout who cannot tolerate allopurinol or if allopurinol lacks efficacy; this is particularly pertinent in patients with cardiovascular disease. Pharmacists should familiarize themselves with the patient's gout medication history and verify that febuxostat is appropriate. They can also confirm dosing and perform medication reconciliation, alerting the patient's clinician to any concerns or potential interactions. Nursing will be able to assess treatment efficacy and patient compliance and look for medication side effects, reporting any concerns to the treating physician. All healthcare providers should educate patients regarding lifestyle modifications such as limiting alcohol, purine, and high fructose corn syrup intake. The interprofessional healthcare team, consisting of clinicians (MD, DO, NP, PA), specialists including rheumatologists, specialty-trained nursing, and pharmacy, must work together to ensure that proper dosing and dispensing protocols are in place and be aware of the possibility of adverse effects, which includes informing the patient of the increased risk of gout flares upon treatment with febuxostat and treating the flares appropriately.

Delivering an augmented protocol of urate-lowering therapy by a team of clinicians, pharmacists, and nursing-led interventions to improve the treat-to-target strategy that includes patient education and shared decision-making can optimize the patient outcomes related to febuxostat therapy.
