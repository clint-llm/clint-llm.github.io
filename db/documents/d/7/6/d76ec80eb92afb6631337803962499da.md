T-PLL is an aggressive malignancy with a median survival of one to two years. The median overall survival is 21 months. Some patients may present with the indolent variant, which shows a better prognosis. Poor prognostic factors include age above 65, presence of effusion, hepatic or nervous system involvement, bulky lymph nodes, high absolute lymphocytic count, high expression of TCL1 and AKT1, and JAK3 mutation.
