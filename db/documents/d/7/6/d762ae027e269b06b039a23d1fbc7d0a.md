Given the importance of LAD for coronary blood flow, during coronary artery bypass surgery, surgeons often try to bypass this with the best possible graft, usually using the left internal mammary artery (LIMA). During such surgery, LIMA is mobilized from the chest wall keeping its origin intact.  Side branches are tied off, and the end is anastomosed to the LAD.  LIMA to LAD grafts are very durable.
