The bladder diverticulum wall histologically is formed of the bladder mucosa, part of the subepithelial connective tissue, part of the thin muscle fibers, and the adventitial layer. An outer shell composed of a fibrous capsule is present most of the time, and it acts as a surgical plane to help dissect it. Other common findings may include inflammatory process, a degree of erosion, and granulation tissue formation.
