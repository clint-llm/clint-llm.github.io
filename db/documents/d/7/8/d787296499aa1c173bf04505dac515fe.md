Sitosterolemia generally has many clinical features which overlap with other lipid disorders. Patients often develop tendon xanthomas, a key finding also found in those with familial hypercholesterolemia. They can also develop corneal arcus and xanthelasma, though these are not as commonly seen. Other symptoms are generally nonspecific, such as abdominal pain and arthralgia. Depending on the timeline of the disease, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly may also be seen.
