PIOL with CNS involvement has a poor ocular prognosis due to the intrinsic aggressive nature of the disease. In PIOL, the mortality rate ranges from 9 to 81% in a follow-up period from 12 to 35 months.

The IELSG score used for PCNSL prognostication is valid only for PVRL with CNS involvement.

In a study by Grimm et al., the patients after receiving a mix of therapies had a median survival of 31 months and median progression-free survival of 18 months, with ocular therapy causing no improvement in chances of survival.
