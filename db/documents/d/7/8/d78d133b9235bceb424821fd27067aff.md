There is a good prognosis for patients with borderline personality disorder. A longitudinal study of 290 inpatients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and reassessed at 2-year intervals over 16 years yielded the following rates of remission:

- 35% remission after 2 years

- 91% remission after 10 years

- 99% remission after 16 years

Unfortunately, the authors of this study noted that remission was associated with impoverished social relationships, leading them to suggest that patients may appear to remit because they avoid interpersonal relationships rather than gradually developing better interpersonal skills. Once achieved, remission was nonetheless sustained for over eight years in 75% of patients. Several factors were associated with the faster onset of remission, including lack of co-morbid, axis-1 disorders, no history of childhood sexual abuse, no history of family substance abuse, high baseline functioning (demonstrated at school or in the workplace), and less than 25 years. Sustained remission from borderline personality disorder has been demonstrated in several other studies as well.
