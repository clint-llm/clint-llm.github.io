The main contraindication to CAS via a transfemoral approach is unfavorable aortic arch anatomy. This can include a heavily calcified aortic arch or a type 3 aortic arch. A relative contraindication can be a history of severe allergic reaction to intravenous contrast dye. However, patients can be pre-medicated to mitigate some of this risk. For a transcarotid approach, a common carotid artery length of less than 5 cm from the clavicle is considered inadequate.
