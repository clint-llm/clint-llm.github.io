Unstable lesions are contraindicated for vestibular rehabilitation therapy, and those with ongoing labyrinthine pathology typically see little benefit from therapy. Patients with spontaneously occurring episodes of vertigo often see little benefit, as well as those who suffer from spontaneous disequilibrium.

Vestibular suppressant medications (antiemetics, antidepressants, anxiolytics) should be held for 48 hours before testing as a relative contraindication.
