Lynch syndrome results from a germline mutation in one of four mismatch repair (MMR) genes called MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Large deletions in a non-mismatch repair gene, called epithelial cellular adhesion molecule (EPCAM) which silences MSH2 expression, have also been found to cause Lynch syndrome. Mismatch repair genes are necessary for repairing incorrect pairing of nucleotide bases during DNA replication. If these “mismatches” are not corrected, then the resulting copy may not function properly leading to an increased risk for cancer. Individuals with Lynch syndrome are born with one functional allele (copy) of a specific gene and one non-functional allele of a specific gene due to an inherited mutation. The risk for cancer occurs when a mutation is acquired in the functional allele. Of note, on the rare occasion, an individual is not born with Lynch syndrome but develops a tumor with loss of both alleles leading somatic loss of the MMR proteins. Screening for Lynch syndrome can be performed on colorectal and endometrial tumor tissue by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) for the four mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) and/or microsatellite instability testing (MSI).

Lynch syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Thus first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) have a 50% chance to be affected with Lynch syndrome.
