The management of a pneumonia is multidisciplinary. Besides the administration of antibiotics, these patients often require chest physical therapy, a dietary consult, physical therapy to help regain muscle mass and a dental consult. The key is to educate the patient on discontinuation of smoking and abstaining from alcohol. Further, patients should be encouraged to get the appropriate influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. Finally, it is important to educate the patient on compliance with antibiotics if they want a complete resolution of the infectious process.

**Outcomes**

In healthy people, the outcome after a bacterial pneumonia is excellent. However, in people with advanced age, lung disease, immunosuppression, infection with aggressive gram-negative organisms (Klebsiella) and other comorbidities, the outcomes are usually poor. When a pneumonia is left untreated, it carries a mortality in excess of 25%. Pneumonia can also lead to extensive lung damage and lead to residual impairment in lung function. Other reported complications of pneumonia that occur in 1-5% of patients include lung abscess, empyema, and bronchiectasis.
