Left ventricular true aneurysms merit consideration as this can mimic false aneurysms. This is a relatively frequent complication compared to false aneurysms and occurs in 10% to 35% of patients following myocardial infarction.

A left ventricular diverticulum can also be confused with a false aneurysm. This condition is a rare cardiac anomaly with a 0.42% prevalence in adults. Congenital cases are more common than acquired cases, which are mostly due to infection or trauma.
