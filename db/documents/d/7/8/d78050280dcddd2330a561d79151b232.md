Lithium was the first mood stabilizer and is still the first-line treatment option, but is underutilized because it is an older drug. Lithium is a commonly prescribed drug for a manic episode in bipolar disorder as well as maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder in a patient with a history of a manic episode. The primary target symptoms of lithium are mania and unstable mood.

Lithium is also prescribed for major depressive disorder as an adjunct therapy, bipolar disorder without a history of mania, treatment of vascular headaches, and neutropenia. These are off-label uses, meaning they are not FDA-approved. Patients with rapid cycling and mixed state types of bipolar disorder generally do less well on lithium.
