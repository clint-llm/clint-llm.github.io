The prognosis of type I hypersensitivity depends on the extent of the reaction. In general, the reaction is short-lived, and as long as symptoms are controlled or antigen is avoided, there is a low risk of harm. However, death can occur within minutes of the onset of signs or symptoms of angioedema, anaphylaxis, or rarely severe asthma, if not identified and treated immediately. Risk of death increases with age, with about a 7-times fold in adults compared to children, and approximately 75% greater in blacks versus whites, and 30% increased risk in females.
