Since the 1970s, the incidence of ORN caused by radiation hovers at approximately 3%. ORN presents, on average, two to four years after completion of radiation treatments. There is a subset of patients who will have persistent non-healing wounds at the primary tumor site (often in the mandible and larynx) that will persist immediately after radiation therapy and ultimately result in ORN or chondroradionecrosis. Most notably, the incidence is affected by radiation dose - the higher the total dose, the more likely a patient is to develop ORN. Mechanical injury anytime after radiotherapy initiation can also predispose one to ORN; in the mandible, this is commonly seen after treatment has been completed and implants are placed for dental rehabilitation. ORN can, therefore, occur years after radiotherapy, both spontaneously or induced by an insult. Mechanical insults such as dental extractions, dental implants, or poorly fitting dentures can increase the risk of developing ORN.
