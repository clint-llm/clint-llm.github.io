Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic disorder of the skin that is classically seen as multiple, firm, flesh to pink colored nodules commonly located on the extensor surfaces of the extremities. The lesions areÂ very pruritic and the condition may occur in any age group. It is commonly associated with another disorder of cutaneous hypersensitivity such as atopic dermatitis or chronic pruritus of diverse origins. The diagnosis is mainly clinical; although certain conditions may simulate it clinically warranting differentiation. The condition is associated with significant physical and psychological morbidity and often refractory to treatments. A whole range of general measures, pharmacological approaches and psychological therapies may be needed in a patient with advanced PN.
