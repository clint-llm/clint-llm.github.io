A thorough pre-operative evaluation of patients undergoing weight loss surgery is indispensable to ensure the adequate selection of eligible candidates and to achieve good outcomes after surgery. The pre-operative workup and evaluation require tailoring for each patient, taking into consideration their comorbidities, expectations, and medical and psychological aspects involved in the peri-operative management of weight loss surgery.

As such, knowledge and application of the steps outlined above are of uttermost importance for the surgeon and clinician working with patients under evaluation for bariatric surgery.
