In 1964, Edward Bishop set forth criteria for elective induction of labor which included parity, gestational age, fetal presentation, obstetric history, and patient consent as well as a scoring system for the cervix to help predict successful induction of labor. This pelvic scoring system, widely known as the Bishop score, is still an important determination in the prediction of successful induction of labor. The pelvic score can be ascertained in a patient at the time of induction by a digital cervical exam to determine if cervical ripening is necessary before induction. This activity describes the Bishop score criteria and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of a patient at the end of her pregnancy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the criteria involved in the Bishop score.
- Describe the indications for use of the Bishop score.
- Review the clinical relevance of the Bishop score.
- Summarize the importance of the use of the Bishop score in improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes in patients awaiting labor and delivery.
