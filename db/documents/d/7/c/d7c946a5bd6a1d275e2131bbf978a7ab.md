Lacerations occur frequently in childbirth and can involve the perineum, labia, vagina and cervix. Most lacerations will heal without long term complications, but severe lacerations can lead to prolonged pain, sexual dysfunction and embarrassment. Severe lacerations need to be identified and properly repaired at the time of delivery. This activity reviews the prevention, evaluation and repair of perineal lacerations that can occur during childbirth.

**Objectives:**
- Identify multiple different perineal lacerations.
- Identify the risk factors associated with severe perineal lacerations.
- Explain the long term complications associated with severe perineal lacerations.
- Describe the available techniques to prevent severe perineal lacerations.
