Classically, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) presents in the late second trimester to the early third trimester. The most common complaint is generalized intense pruritus, which usually starts after the 30th week of pregnancy. Pruritus can be more common in palms and soles and is typically worse at night. Other symptoms of cholestasis, such as nausea, anorexia, fatigue, right upper quadrant pain, dark urine, and pale stool, can be present. Clinical jaundice is rare but may present in 14 to 25% of patients after 1 to 4 weeks of the onset of pruritus.
