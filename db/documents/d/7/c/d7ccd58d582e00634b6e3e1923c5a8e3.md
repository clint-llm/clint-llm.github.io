Grossly, cavernous malformations have a characteristic "mulberry" appearance with engorged purplish clusters of vessels. The diameter varies from 2 mm to several centimeters.

On microscopic examination, the cavernous angiomas consist of dilated, thin-walled capillaries with a simple endothelial lining and a thin, fibrous adventitia. Vessel walls lack elastic fibers and smooth muscles. The classic description of cavernous angiomas states no intervening brain tissue in between the vascular channels of the lesion. However, further studies noted intervening brain parenchyma in 70 percent of the lesions. The closely surrounding tissue is gliotic and hemosiderin-laden due to previous hemorrhages. It also contains dilated capillaries that may represent telangiectasias. Inflammation, calcification and, rarely, ossification can be found, usually in larger lesions. Developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) are also associated with cavernous malformations (10-20%) more often with lesions present in the posterior fossa than in the supratentorial compartment. A mixed vascular malformation (MVM) is a term used to describe the anomaly comprising of a developmental venous anomaly and a cavernous malformation.
