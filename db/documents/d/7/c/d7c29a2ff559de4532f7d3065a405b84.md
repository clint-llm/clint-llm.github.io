Bone scan using radioactive tracer technetium 99m methylene diphosphonate is useful in evaluating active bone formation in the body like osteoblastic metastases from prostate cancer. However, fractures can also appear as false positives on bone scans performed for metastasis. F-18 FDG-PET/CT involves an injection of a radiopharmaceutical, 18F FDG, which is seen preferentiallyÂ at sites of abnormal glucose metabolism. A fused image of PET scan and a CT scan of the whole body helps to localize the metabolic abnormality accurately. FDG PET scans help evaluate bony metastases and spinal cord masses. However, they can also be positive in infections such as vertebral body osteomyelitis as there is an altered glucose mechanism at the site of the infection.

18F NaF PET/CT is a more recent radiotracer imaging for evaluating osseous metastasis and is superior in imaging quality compared to a technetium 99 bone scan.
