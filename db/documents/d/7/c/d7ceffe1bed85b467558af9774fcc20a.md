Signs and symptoms of RAD may be missed by providers who are unfamiliar with the childâ€™s history or when the history is unknown. Symptoms may be attributed to common behavioral health disorders such as depression, anxiety, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, genetic or neurological disorders, or autism spectrum disorder. Although there is a significant symptom overlap and co-occurrence, treatment for each varies and some treatment methods may exacerbate RAD.
