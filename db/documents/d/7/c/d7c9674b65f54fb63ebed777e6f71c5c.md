Piezogenic papules are very common in the United States and worldwide. Lesions are not typically painful; therefore, before establishing this diagnosis, lesions often went unnoticed. As it stands, diagnosis is often made incidentally or not at all; therefore, the actual incidence and prevalence of this condition are likely severely underreported.

Studies have shown the incidence of PPPs in the United States to be as high as 76%, with wrist papules in 86% of cases.

Most cases appear to occur spontaneously. However, there have been reports of cases occurring in successive generations within the same family suggestive of a possible autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Despite this finding, no direct hereditary trigger has been identified. Lesions occur at any age, from infancy to adulthood. An unusual infantile variant termed infantile pedal papules occurs in non-weight-bearing infants and is characterized by larger nodules on the medial aspect of the heel. The incidence of infantile papules in one study was noted to be 6% in newborns and 39% in infants.
