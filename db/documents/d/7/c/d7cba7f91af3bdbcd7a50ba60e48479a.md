The diagnosis of cholera can be based on clinical suspicion. The characteristic high volume diarrhea and travel to an endemic area can be sufficient for a diagnosis. As such, laboratory testing is often not required before initiating treatment. The diagnosis can be confirmed, however, by the isolation and culture of V. cholerae from stool isolates. Culture can be enhanced via the use of selective media with a high pH that suppresses the growth of intestinal microflora while allowing V. cholerae to multiply. Likewise, rapid tests can be employed to identify the O1 or O130 antigen in stool samples. Dipsticks and darkfield microscopy of the stool are available methods that can be used to identify or visualize the organism rapidly.
