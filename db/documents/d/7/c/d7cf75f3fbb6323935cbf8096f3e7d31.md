There are specific populations most at risk for the development of manganism. This is due to physiological differences between ages and genders, underlying health conditions such as pre-exposure neurocognitive deficits and hepatic dysfunction, and those who are exposed environmentally via water sources or vocation.

The highest at-risk populations are infants and children secondary to decreased functionality of excretion mechanisms, increased ability of the gastrointestinal tract to absorb the metal, and increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier to manganese.

Gender also appears to contribute to differences in Mn prevalence. Women have a higher preponderance of elevated Mn levels across multiple studies from different countries, owing possibly to unknown mechanisms allowing higher absorption from dietary sources.

Countries with lax regulations on metal concentrations within water sources propose a significant risk for their respective populations. Several population studies from Bangladesh illustrate a causal link between Mn consumption from contaminated water and the deleterious effects on adolescent/child cognitive development and academic performance.
