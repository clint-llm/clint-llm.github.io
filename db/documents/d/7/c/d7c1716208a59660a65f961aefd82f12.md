Active transport at the site of the non-pigmented epithelial cells is thought to be the major contributor to aqueous humor formation. The energy required for active transport is generated via the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP, mediated by the enzyme Na-K-ATPase, which is found on both pigmented and non-pigmented ciliary epithelia. Na-K-ATPase is of specific pharmacological interest as it can be inhibited by many different molecules, including cardiac glycosides, dinitrophenol, and acetazolamide. Carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme also found in pigmented and non-pigmented ciliary epithelia, mediates bicarbonate transport across ciliary epithelium via hydration of CO, forming HCO and protons.

The formation of bicarbonate regulates pH for optimal active ion transport, which influences fluid transport by affecting Na. Chloride (Cl) is the major anion transported across the epithelium through Cl channels. Other molecules actively transported include ascorbic acid and certain amino acids. Active transport produces an osmotic gradient across the ciliary epithelium, promoting the movement of other plasma components via ultrafiltration and diffusion.
