The role of the human lymphoid system in human physiology remains an intriguing issue. Although the likelihood of lymph node metastasis is higher in large primary tumors for most solid organ malignancies, there are also many patients with large tumors who do not develop lymph node metastasis. On the other hand, there are patients with small or early-stage primary tumors who develop an extensive regional nodal disease. In addition, the presence of metastasis in lymph nodes remains a prognosticator of patient outcomes.
