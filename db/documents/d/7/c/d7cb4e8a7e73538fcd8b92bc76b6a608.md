The ideal treatment for optic atrophy would involve neuroregeneration. Unfortunately, such modalities are still not available for clinical use. Pharmacological treatment for optic atrophy has also been largely ineffective. The only focus in management is treating the exact cause before the development of significant damage to salvage useful vision. Once the condition is stabilized, low vision aids can be tried in selected individuals.

Pulse intravenous methylprednisolone has been used in conditions such as optic neuritis, arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and traumatic optic neuropathy with successful outcomes. The optic neuritis treatment trial recommended doses of 500-1000 mg/day of IV methylprednisolone for three days, followed by oral prednisolone 1 mg/Kg BW for 11 days. Beta-interferons and glatiramer acetate have been used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and related optic neuritis to reduce the occurrence of clinical lesions seen on MRI as well as the number of recurrences.

Stem cell treatment may prove to be key in the future treatment of neuronal disorders. Neural progenitor cells can be delivered to the vitreous from where they can integrate into the ganglion cell layer of the retina. These cells would turn on neurofilament genes, and migrate into the host optic nerve to stimulate the regeneration of neural elements.
