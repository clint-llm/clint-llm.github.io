Actinic purpura is a common, benign disease of elderly individuals with fair skin types. The disorder appears to be caused by dermal and vascular fragility induced by chronic sun exposure. It does not predispose to serious complications, and the risk of bleeding is minimal. However, it can cause significant aesthetic and cosmetic damage and can induce a significant psychological impact. Treatment is limited, mainly relying on creams based vitamin A derivatives and moisturizers.

Photoprotection remains the best option, and it is based on physical protective clothing, regular application of sunscreen, and behavioral therapies by avoiding excessive sun exposure and trauma.
