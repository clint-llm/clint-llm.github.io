Despite being first recognized more than 150 years ago, there is still no cure for FA.

**Physical and Occupational Therapy**

Physical therapy (PT) is the main recommendation to delay the disease's progression and preserve function.

**Devices**

Orthopedic shoes, avoiding tight clothing, and using correctly adjusted ambulatory devices like canes, wheelchairs, and orthoses, have shown benefit in ambulation, muscle spasticity, and prevention of scoliosis and other deformities. Functional electrical stimulation and transcutaneous nerve stimulation may alleviate gait and spasticity symptoms. A standing frame can help reduce prolonged wheelchair usage.

**Medication**

Medication treatment is focused primarily on pain management, heart failure, and prevention of infection.

**Surgery**

Surgery can be performed when indicated for kyphoscoliosis and foot deformities. Automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement is done when indicated.
