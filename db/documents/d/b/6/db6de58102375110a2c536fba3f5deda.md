It is complicated to predict prognosis as mastalgia presents many underlying pathological and psychological causes. However, if no underlying pathology is present, it has high rates of spontaneous remission within three months to 3 years. Factors that are affecting the prognosis include the age of onset and the underlying etiology.

For cyclic breast pain, 60% of patients will show a successful response to therapy, but recurrence is generally seen within two years, while 20% to 30% will show complete resolution.

In non-cyclic pain, there is an inadequate response to therapy unless and until the exact underlying etiology is known and adequately treated. Still, 50% of women will show spontaneous resolution.
