Prognosis in a Chance fracture in adults depends on the degree of kyphosis caused by the injury. Those with less than 15 degrees of kyphosis can be treated successfully with an extension cast/orthosis with good to fair results and no neurologic deficit. Chance fractures with more kyphosis are stabilized surgically, with >90% having good results after one year.

Unfortunately, in a significant number of people, low back pain may be a major complaint in the future.
