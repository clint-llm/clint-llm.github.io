On patient evaluation, a pure motor deficit (sensation intact) alongside a viral prodrome is potential evidence of paralytic poliomyelitis. Clinically, the prodrome may consist of headaches, myalgias, fatigue, nausea, neck stiffness, or pharyngitis. Up to 95% of poliovirus infections present as this constellation of symptoms and remain non-paralytic. In infections that progress into the spinal cord, severe muscle spasms with myalgias typically present before an asymmetrical flaccid paralysis. The paralysis tends to have a lower limb predominance. Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) with viral prodrome can also be caused by other viral infections (see differential diagnosis). It is important to note that most other enterovirus-related AFMs have an upper extremity predilection.

Poliomyelitis can present in stages, such as the acute stage, recovery stage, and residual-paralysis stage. The acute stage is mainly comprised of features, such as fever, neck stiffness, profound muscular weakness, paraparesis, and autonomic dysfunction. In the convalescent or recovery stage, the acute features disappear, and the recovery of paralyzed muscles begins. This stage can last up to two years. In the last stage, the patient is left with residual paralysis, imbalance of muscle power, and poor posture.
