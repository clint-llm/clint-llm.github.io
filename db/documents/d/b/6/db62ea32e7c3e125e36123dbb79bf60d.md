The healthcare team, e.g., physicians, nurses, pharmacists, etc., need to work together to address the proper medical use of controlled substances, e.g., pain control pharmacotherapy.Â  The healthcare team should schedule their patients for routine follow-up visits that include a history and physical exam to monitor for adverse drug effects and drug misuse. Monitoring for signs of drug misuse is a very important responsibility for the healthcare team because of the epidemic rates of drug misuse worldwide, e.g., the USA, which leads to death because of respiratory depression as in the case of opioid analgesic overdose (e.g., oxycodone, fentanyl). Methods for monitoring drug abuse as well as drug diversion include the following examples: assessment surveys, state prescription drug monitoring programs, urine screening, adherence check-lists, motivational counseling, and dosage form counting, e.g., tablet counting.
