DMARDs, especially biologic DMARDs, shall be avoided in patients with an active infection, those with preexisting bone marrow hypoplasia, leukopenia, or immunodeficiency syndromes. Methotrexate and leflunomide shall be avoided in patients with severe liver disease.

**Pregnancy and Lactation**

Methotrexate and leflunomide are contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation due to their teratogenic effects. Sulfasalazine can cause jaundice in the infant, especially if used in the third trimester of pregnancy, and shall be used with caution in lactation. While hydroxychloroquine can cross the placenta, no cases of fetal ocular toxicity have been reported, and it is considered safe to be used in pregnancy and is actually strongly recommended to be used in pregnant females with systemic lupus erythematosus as it prevents flares of the disease in pregnancy.

There is limited safety data on the biologic DMARDs in pregnancy. However, of all biologics, certolizumab is the only one that does not cross the placenta due to the larger size of the molecule and is considered relatively safer to be used in pregnancy.
