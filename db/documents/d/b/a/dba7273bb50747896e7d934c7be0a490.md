It is critical in the evaluation of pediatric post-traumatic stress disorder that the clinician obtains both the child’s and caregivers’ reports.

**DSM-V Diagnostic Criteria for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder for Children 6 years and Younger: [**Reference: American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), American Psychiatric Association, Arlington 2013].

- In children six years and younger, exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence in one (or more) of the following ways:

- Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s)
- Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others, especially primary caregivers

- Does not include events that are witnessed only in electronic media, television, movies, or pictures


- Learning that the traumatic event(s) occurred to a parent or caregiving figure

- Presence of one (or more) of the following intrusion symptoms associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning after the traumatic event(s) occurred;

- Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic event(s)
- Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or effect of the dream are related to the traumatic event(s)
- Dissociative reactions in which the child feels or acts as if the traumatic event(s) were recurring
- Intense or prolonged psychological distress at exposure to internal or external clues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s)
- Marked physiological reactions to reminders of the traumatic event(s)

- One (or more) of the following symptoms, representing either persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic event(s) or negative alterations in cognitions and mood associated with the traumatic event(s), must be present, beginning after the event(s) or worsening after the event(s)

- Persistent Avoidance of Stimuli

- Avoidance of or efforts to avoid activities, places, or physical reminders that arouse recollections of the traumatic event(s)
- Avoidance of or efforts to avoid people, conversations, or interpersonal situations that arouse recollections of the traumatic event(s)


- Negative Alterations in Cognitions

- Substantially increased frequency of negative emotional states.
- Markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities, including constriction of play.
- Socially withdrawn behavior
- Persistent reduction in the expression of positive emotions

- Alterations in arousal and reactivity associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning or worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by two (or more) of the following:

- Irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provocation) typically expressed as verbal or physical aggression toward people or objects (including extreme temper tantrums)
- Hypervigilance
- Exaggerated startle response
- Problems with concentration
- Sleep disturbance

- The duration of the disturbance is more than one month.

- The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment

Specify whether:

With Dissociative symptoms:

- Depersonalization

- Derealization

Specify if:

- With delayed expression (not met until at least six months after the event)

**(For children greater than six years old, the clinician will refer to DSM-V criteria for adults)**

Additional evidence-based screening tools have been commonly implemented in the clinical setting. These include the UCLA Posttraumatic Stress Disorder – Reaction Index (UCLA-PTSD-RI), the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC), and The Screening Tool for Early Predictors of PTSD (STEPP).
