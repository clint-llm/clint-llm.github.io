Light travels through the cornea, anterior chamber of the eye, the pupil (a hole in the center of the iris), lens, and posterior chamber before striking the retina. Within the retina, light travels past the ganglion and bipolar layers to strike the photoreceptors. The rod and cone photoreceptors convert light energy into neural impulses in the form of action potentials, which travel back through bipolar and ganglion cell layers and progress through the optic nerve. The optic nerve is a continuation of the optic disc, an area of the retina without photoreceptors, referred to as the “blind spot.” Neural activation progresses primarily to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus as well as the visual association and processing areas of the brain.

Rhodopsin is the photopigment in rods. It is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) consisting of protein scotopsin and the Vitamin A-derived cofactor, retinol. Exposure to light allows for the isomerization of retinol from its 11-cis-retinal configuration into the active all-trans-retinal conformation. Isomerization of retinol into its active all-trans-retinal conformation then sets off a cascade of changes resulting in transformation into metarhodopsin II (Meta II). Meta II activates the transducin protein, followed by the transducin alpha subunit activating cyclic guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase (cGMP phosphodiesterase). In the resting or “dark” state, cGMP directly activates cation channels that cause net depolarization of rod photoreceptors (approximately -40mV), which continuously release glutamate neurotransmitter that hyperpolarizes some surrounding cells and depolarizes others. In the activation or “light” pathway, transducin alpha subunit activation of cGMP phosphodiesterase breaks down cGMP into GMP, thereby lowering cellular levels of cGMP and thus decreasing cation channel activity. The decrease cation channel activity causes the hyperpolarization of the rod photoreceptor and reduces the release of excitatory glutamate neurotransmitters by the rod cell. This overall increase in photon absorption and decreased glutamate release is recognized as a light sensation. Notably, rod cells exhibit significant signal amplification, as each rhodopsin GPCR may activate as many as 800 transducin proteins. Reversal of rods to the resting state is mediated by arrestin, rhodopsin kinase (RK), and the closure of cGMP channels. RK phosphorylates the cytosolic tail of rhodopsin, decreasing transducin activity. Arrestin increases GTP to GDP hydrolysis, thereby inactivating transducin, a G protein. The decreased intracellular calcium, caused by the closure of cGMP-sensitive cation channels in the activating pathways, triggers intracellular proteins to activate guanylate cyclase, which restores levels of cGMP. These pathways allow for plasma membrane depolarization in the restored resting state of rod cells.
