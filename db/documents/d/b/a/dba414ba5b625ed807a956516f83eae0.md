Bilateral vocal cord paralysis is a challenging and troublesome entity in the adult and pediatric population. Surgical interventions including tracheostomy, arytenoidectomy, cordotomy, and laryngeal reinnervation have all been employed to successfully manage this condition. Risks and benefits of intervention should be weighed with each surgical technique, as well as the delicate balance between a patient airway and preservation of voice and swallowing functions. Treatment strategies should be individualized based on the patient’s clinical presentation, the surgeon’s expertise, but most importantly on the expected likelihood of spontaneous recovery. Irreversible procedures should not be performed unless the chance of spontaneous recovery is low to nil.
