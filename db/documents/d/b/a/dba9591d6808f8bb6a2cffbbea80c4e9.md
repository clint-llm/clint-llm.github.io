The etiology of thyrotoxicosis can be divided into an endogenous or exogenous source of TSH.

Increased endogenous secretion of thyroid hormone

- Grave's disease

- Toxic multinodular goiter

- Toxic adenoma

- TSH-producing adenoma or pituitary adenoma

- HCG-mediated hyperthyroidism

- Thyroiditis

- Drug-induced

Increased exogenous secretion of thyroid hormone

- Factitious hyperthyroidism

- Excessive replacement therapy with levothyroxine

The most common cause of thyrotoxicosis is Graves' disease, followed by toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG) and toxic adenoma (TA)[7]. Other causes include thyroiditis, subacute thyroiditis, painless thyroiditis, and gestational hyperthyroidism. Drug-induced thyrotoxicosis has been associated with amiodarone and iodinated contrast.

Rare causes of thyrotoxicosis include TSH-producing adenomas, struma ovarii, gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, thyrotoxicosis factitia, activation mutations of the TSH receptor, and functional thyroid cancer metastases
