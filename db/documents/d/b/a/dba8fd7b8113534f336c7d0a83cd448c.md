Healthcare workers including the nurse practitioner should be familiar with some of the signs associated with aortic regurgitation. The water hammer pulse is most often found in patients with AR but can also be observed in several other conditions. If a water hammer pulse is identified, the next step is to obtain an ECHO and rule out AR. All patients with AR need close follow up with a cardiologist. Asymptomatic patients with normal heart dimensions can be followed for many years. Symptomatic patients and those with enlarging cardiac dimension should be referred to a cardiac surgeon for valve replacement.
