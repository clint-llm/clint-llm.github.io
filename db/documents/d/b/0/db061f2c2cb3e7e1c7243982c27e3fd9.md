- A study by O'Brien revealed that there was a 44 percent cumulative rate of carpal instability during the second year after injury.

- Malunion or growth arrest were the causes of secondary distal radio-ulnar joint (DRUJ) instability in 22% of cases in the J K Andersson study.

- J B Tang observed an incidence of 30.6% after the distal radius fracture.

- Scapholunate angles were found to be irregular in 39% of patients at presentation and 35% of patients after treatment in the distal radius fractures.

- The incidence rates of distal radio-ulnar instability following the distal radius fractures are reported to be between 10% and 19%.
