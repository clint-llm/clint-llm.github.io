Patients with bone marrow edema syndrome often present with complaints of severe pain that limits functionality and daily activities. Patients will also report pain and swelling during rest and activity, which may occur suddenly or insidiously.

Classically, bone marrow edema syndrome can be divided into three phases: The first month is characterized by initial pain and dysfunction. The next one to two months are characterized by maximum pain levels. Finally, symptoms regress over the next few months following the period of maximal pain, but it should be noted that the presentation and resolution of symptoms are highly variable.
