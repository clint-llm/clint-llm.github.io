**CEA in Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Post-Treatment Surveillance to Monitor Recurrence/Residual Tumor**

CEA is a strong prognostic biomarker in patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.

Follow-up with CEA level in patients with colorectal cancers after primary treatment was found effective in detecting cancer recurrences that can be treated with curative intent in the follow-up after colorectal surgery (FACS) trial.

Serial monitoring of CEA is recommended before initiation of treatment and after that every three months during active treatment and during active surveillance to assess the response to resection and systemic therapy (chemotherapy/radiotherapy) in colorectal cancer.

In colorectal cancer, serum CEA normalizes in 6 weeks after the resection of the tumor. Therefore, persistently elevated CEA levels may indicate residual tumor due to incomplete resection or recurrence of the tumor. Restaging malignancy should be considered if there is persistently rising CEA above baseline, potentially suggesting cancer progression. CEA level should not be checked too early, i.e., 4 to 6 wks. of starting a new therapy as some chemotherapeutic agents may elevate CEA falsely.

As endorsed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines (2006 and 2013 updates), for patients with stage II and stage III colorectal cancer who are candidates for surgery or chemotherapy, post-operative/post-treatment CEA measurement should be done every three months for at least two years along with annual CT scans, followed by every six months for five years.

The sensitivity and specificity of serial measurement of CEA in detecting recurrent colorectal cancer are approximately 80% and 70%, respectively.

**Post Resection Detection of Liver Metastasis/Oligometastases**

CEA measurement is the most sensitive detector of liver metastasis from colorectal cancers that can be resected surgically.

**CEA in Medullary Carcinoma of the Thyroid**

According to the revised guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the management of medullary thyroid carcinoma, CEA is not a specific biomarker for medullary carcinoma. However, measuring CEA levels is very helpful in assessing the disease progression and post thyroidectomy monitoring. According to Chen et al., the North America Society for Neuroendocrine Tumors (NANETS) guidelines, preoperative levels above 30 µg/L indicate the extra-thyroid spread of the disease. In contrast, levels greater than 100 µg/L are associated with invasive disease, including lymph node involvement and distant metastasis.

It is recommended to plan surgical treatment with total thyroidectomy, central cervical lymph node dissection, and unilateral lateral cervical lymph node dissection when CEA levels are greater than 30 µg/L. Pre-targeted radioimmunotherapy (radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies against CEA) is a promising treatment modality in treating medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. Patients with persistent CEA levels after colon cancer surgery and a negative diagnostic workup for metastatic disease should steer the diagnostic workup towards medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, including calcitonin measurement and neck ultrasound.

**CEA in Ascitic Fluid**

CEA levels are proven to be of some value in cases where ascitic fluid cytology is inconclusive. Serum levels greater than 5 µg/L are suggestive of carcinoma. However, higher values were common in cancers with peritoneal involvement with a sensitivity of 51 % and specificity of 97% for carcinomatosis (p <0.01).

**CEA in Pleural Fluid**

An elevated CEA level in a patient with pleural fluid and negative cytology precludes more invasive modalities such as VATS guided biopsy to rule out malignant etiology. In contrast, lower CEA levels may support a close follow-up.

**CEA in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)**

Due to limited preoperative imaging sensitivity, 30% of patients with stage I NSCLC have positive N2-N3 nodes at the time of diagnosis. Preoperative CEA levels help identify patients with advanced disease that might be missed on imaging. Higher CEA levels correlate with advanced stage, nodal metastasis, and poor survival. It potentially identifies the patient population who would benefit from invasive mediastinal lymph node staging by mediastinoscopy or endoscopic ultrasound and benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy than upfront surgery.

**CEA in Breast Cancer**

Currently, routine use of CEA in screening for breast cancer is not recommended as per ASCO due to limited sensitivity and specificity. However, in addition to CA 15-3 and CA 27.29, CEA and diagnostic imaging can be used to monitor patients with metastatic disease receiving active therapy.
