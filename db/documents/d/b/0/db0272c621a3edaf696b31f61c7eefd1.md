Obesity is defined by calculating the Body Mass Index (BMI) of an individual. A BMI of >30 kg/m2 is considered clinically obese.

Physical inactivity and high calorific consumption have been directly correlated with an increasing BMI. Socioeconomic status indirectly correlates to an increasing BMI. Despite these links being clear for many years, the causation between these factors is not fully understood.

An increasing number of patients with obesity are presenting to orthopedic departments. An elevated BMI can impact orthopedic issues through two broad mechanisms: biomechanically and metabolically. These two concepts cause issues to both the bone itself and/or the surrounding soft tissue and its structures.
