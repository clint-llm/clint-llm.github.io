**Imaging Features**

**Ultrasound:**Capillary hemangiomas appear as irregular lesions in orbit, demonstrating high internal reflectivity with irregular acoustic structures. A scan shows low to medium reflectivity with high spikes produced by the septae. Increased flow within aÂ lesion can be demonstrated by Doppler echography.

**Computed tomography (CT) scan:**Capillary hemangiomas appear as well-defined to irregular pre-septal or post-septal, intraconal, or extraconal-heterogenous soft tissue masses, which enhance with contrast. There is no evidence of calcification or bony erosion. They may appear well-defined or ill-defined.

**Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):**they appear as well-defined or ill-defined lesions that are hypointense on T1 weighted images and hyperintense on T2 weighted images. The characteristic feature is the presence of flow voids within the lesion. They demonstrate diffuse enhancement with Gadolinium contrast which is best appreciated in fat-suppressed images.
