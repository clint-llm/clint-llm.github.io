Lichen striatus (LS) is uncommon and occurs most frequently in children. It presents as a pink rash with raised spotting that comes together to form singular or multiple, dull-red, potentially-scaly linear bands that affect the Blaschko lines. While these lines are typically invisible, disorders like lichen striatusÂ may bring these to light.
