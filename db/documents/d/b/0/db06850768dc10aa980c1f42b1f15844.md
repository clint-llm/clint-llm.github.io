Septic arthritis classically presents with acute onset monoarticular joint pain, fever, swelling, and a reluctance or refusal to move the affected joint. Fever may be present in 40% to 60% of cases but is a nonspecific finding.

Children with septic arthritis may present with local symptoms only or both local and systemic symptoms.

Local symptoms:  Pain, joint swelling, warmth, limited range of motion, limp, refusal to use or move the affected joint (pseudoparalysis)

Systemic symptoms: Ill appearance, fever, tachycardia, fussiness/irritability, decreased appetite

Physical

The knee is the most common joint involved in septic arthritis, followed by the hip, shoulder, and ankle. Effusions are common on examination. The range of motion is limited and palpation may be associated with pain. Most staphylococcal infections are associated with monoarticular involvement but Neisseria often involves multiple joints.  Group B streptococci often involves the sternoclavicular and sacroiliac joints. Most prosthetic joint infections will have a draining sinus.
