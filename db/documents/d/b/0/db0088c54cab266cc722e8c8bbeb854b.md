Cogan syndrome is believed to be an autoimmune disease due to the detection of different autoantibodies and associated vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa, and collagen vascular disease.

Molecular mimicry is one of the mechanisms through which autoimmunity can arise. This happens when the exogenous agents such as bacteria, viruses, and others and human normal host-cell components share the antigenic determinants.

A study was done in 2002 in which a peptide called Cogan peptide was discovered in 8 patients. The peptide was like reovirus III major core protein lambda and SSA/Ro.
