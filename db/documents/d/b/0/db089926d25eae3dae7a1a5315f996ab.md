Neonatal GC is often acquired during delivery; thus, there usually is a history of suspected or confirmed maternal gonorrheal infection. Bacterial conjunctivitis can occur at any time, but GC is considered in symptomatic neonates after the first day of life, specifically, days 2 to 5, since chemical conjunctivitis (secondary to silver nitrate, antibiotic drops) is often the cause in the first 24 hours. A physical exam may reveal the following:

- Conjunctival injection, chemosis

- Edema of the eyelids

- Mucopurulent discharge

- Tenderness of the globe

- Lymphadenopathy, preauricular

In the non-neonatal population, GC may present with similar symptoms and should at least be considered in sexually active individuals that present with conjunctivitis with or without genital symptoms. Regardless, a detailed sexual history of the mother and non-neonatal cases of conjunctivitis should be obtained to refine the differential diagnoses for conjunctivitis.
