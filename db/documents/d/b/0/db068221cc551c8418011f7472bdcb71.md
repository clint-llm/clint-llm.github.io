The American Fertility Society classifies the severity of the disease in three stages as follow:

- Mild disease: few filmy adhesions involving less than a third of the uterine cavity with normal menses or hypomenorrhea.

- Moderate disease: filmy and dense adhesions, the involvement of one-third to two-thirdsÂ of the cavity, and hypomenorrhea.

- Severe Disease: dense adhesions involving more than two-thirds of the cavity with amenorrhea.
