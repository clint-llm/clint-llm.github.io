As stated previously, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction is generally regarded as a diagnosis of exclusion. The differential for epigastric and/or right upper quadrant pain is wide. It is, therefore, important that appropriate testing is performed to rule out other disease processes prior to formally diagnosing and treating sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. The spectrum of obstructive biliary pathologies, including choledocholithiasis and malignant conditions such as cholangiocarcinoma, should receive specific attention. These must especially be considered if bile duct dilation and elevated transaminases are present.
