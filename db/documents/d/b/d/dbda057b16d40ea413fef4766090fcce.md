Numerous studies have shown Virchow's node to be of clinical significance, especially concerning malignancies. Due to its lymphatic function, the Virchow's node is a potential seeding site for not only gastrointestinal malignancies, but also pulmonary adenocarcinoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, and ovarian cancer, among others.

Considering its anatomy, researchers have theorized that Virchow's node results in certain complications secondary to mass effect.

Virchow's node is an important clinical finding in association with metastatic malignancy, certain infections, and even a potential cause of neurovascular pathologies and hence should merit consideration in clinical practice.
