Interprofessional communication between primary care clinicians, gastroenterologists, surgeons, oncologists, pharmacists, nurses, and laboratory personnel is necessary for professionals to stay on the same page in treating ZES. Diagnosing ZES can be challenging with the wide use of PPIs for heartburn, but patients may suffer from unexplained chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, and even dysphagia from esophagus damage secondary to excess gastric acid secretion. Nurses can assist in patient evaluation, may administer medications, and answer patient questions regarding their condition. Pharmacists will ensure appropriate dosing, perform medication reconciliation, and can counsel the patient on their medication regimen. All interprofessional team members must report any concerns to other team members for corrective interventions.

An interprofessional approach with a social worker and a case manager is needed if patients have difficulty coping with situations that endanger their social life. Because Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is challenging to cure, patients must stay on PPIs to control symptoms, which could be daunting. Continuous support must entail support not only from medical professionals but also from close family members and friends. [Level 3]
