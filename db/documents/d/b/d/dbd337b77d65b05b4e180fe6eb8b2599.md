Trichomoniasis occurs more frequently in people with multiple sexual partners who also have other sexually transmitted infections. In one study with 4057 participants, T. vaginalis infection was found in 0.5% of males and 1.8% of females in the study population. They found prevalence among Black study participants to be higher, with 4.2% and 8.9% infection rates noted in males and females, respectively.

According to another article, the estimated infection rate of Trichomoniasis vaginalis is 3.2%. T. vaginalis infection rates in the United States are higher than combining Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infection rates. Trichomoniasis is most prevalent amongst women ages 40 to 49, which is starkly different from the rate of chlamydia infections, which peaks in the 19 to 24-year-old age group.
