In fetal circulation, gas exchange occurs in the placenta. From the placenta, oxygenated blood travels through the umbilical vein into the Inferior vena cava (IVC) through the ductus venosus (DV), bypassing the liver circulation. In the heart, most of the oxygenated blood is shunted from the right atrium to the left atrium through the foramen ovale (FO). From the left atrium, blood is pumped to the left ventricle and into the aorta to reach systemic circulation. A small portion of blood is pumped from the right atrium to right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. From the pulmonary artery, blood is shunted to the aorta through the ductus arteriosus (DA), bypassing the lungs. Deoxygenated blood return to the placenta by the umbilical arteries.

CCHD is silent in fetal life because fetus receives oxygenated blood from the placenta and either the FO or DA can increase systemic blood flow. After DA and FO closure soon after birth, most CCHD become symptomatic. Cyanosis may be caused by persistence of fetal circulation, right-to-left shunting across the FO and ductus DA in the presence of pulmonary outflow tract obstruction or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.
