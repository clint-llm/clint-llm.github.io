Traumatic fibromas are generally removed via excisional biopsy and enucleation to prevent a recurrence.

TUGSE can be treated with an antibiotic to reduce the microbial load that is likely present on the lesion surface.

Inflammatory papillary hyperplasia occasionally requires no treatment, whereas others may involve surgical excision of inflamed papillary tissue.

Thermal injuries are typically self-limiting and will resolve as long as the site is protected from repeated trauma or additional exposure to extreme temperatures. Palliative treatment is recommended from topical benzocaine cream or petroleum jelly to protect the ulcerated mucosa. There is no standard of care for intraoral burns; however, management of inflammation or pain is always indicated.

Aspirin-induced oral lesions are chemical burns, which typically only require local palliative measures for healing, similar to chemical burns.
