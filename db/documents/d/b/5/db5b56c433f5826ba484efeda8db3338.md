The patient's primary dental provider often evaluates malocclusion. The primary dental provider may be a general dentist, pediatric dentist, or orthodontist. Referalls to the orthodontist are made for patients who exhibit malocclusions that may be detrimental to the patient's dental status and quality of life. A simple oral evaluation is the most common way to diagnose malocclusion; however, radiographs help to evaluate further. Extraoral radiographs, such as the panoramic radiograph and cone-beam computed tomography radiographs, are common types of radiographs taken to examine a patient.

Each imaging method allows the clinician to determine the position of the teeth and evaluate if they are emerging at the right time and place within their respective jaw. CBCT image is beneficial in several ways, especially as it provides a three-dimensional view of the entire face. This allows for a more accurate diagnosis of the malocclusion and permits analysis of a patient's airway and temporomandibular joint.

One such radiograph unique to orthodontics is the cephalometric projection. The cephalometric projections capture a lateral image of the face whereby relationships between the skull and the jaws can be made. These projections can additionally help orthodontists predict the dental age of a patient and growth potential and highlight sagittal discrepancies, all of which can aid treatment planning.
