The evidence for the widespread application of cricoid pressure is equivocal. The American Heart Association removed cricoid pressure from in-hospital and out-of-hospital resuscitation algorithms. This information was based upon practitioners' ineptitude at correctly performing the technique on mannequins.

Increased support of cricoid pressure in the United States compared to the rest of the globe is attributed to greater concern for medico-legal entanglements. There is a low level of evidence by expert consensus for the use of cricoid pressure. Despite its use, aspiration is not fully preventable.
