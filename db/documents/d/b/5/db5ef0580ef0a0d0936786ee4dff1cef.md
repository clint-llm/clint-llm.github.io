Hydronephrosis and hydroureter result from obstruction of urine flow in the urinary system at the renal pelvis and ureter level, respectively. This is common in all age groups, from newborns to elderly patients. Both conditions should be promptly diagnosed and treated to prevent severe renal dysfunction. This activity reviews the etiology, epidemiology, and diagnosis of hydroureteronephrosis and highlights the role of prompt management for timely prevention of renal dysfunction.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the broader etiology of hydronephrosis and hydroureter.
- Summarize the epidemiology and pathophysiology of hydronephrosis and hydroureter.
- Review the evaluation and management options for hydronephrosis and hydroureter.
- Describe the importance of collaboration amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients with hydronephrosis and hydroureter and improve outcomes.
