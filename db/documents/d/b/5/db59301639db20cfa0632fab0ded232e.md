Most thyroid adenomas are sporadic and not hereditary. However, some environmental and genetic factors are associated with the presence of a thyroid adenoma. For example, iodine deficiency is a well-known environmental risk factor accused of causing the development of a thyroid adenoma, and it is the most common reason for the development of thyroid nodules around the world, especially in underdeveloped countries.

In addition, rare genetic mutations in BRAF, RET, KRAS, and genetic rearrangement of the PAX8-PPAR gene are strongly associated with the development of thyroid adenomas.
