Treatment of gait disturbances initially involves diagnosing the underlying cause. A proper diagnosis leads to more accurate treatment plans. These plans can require a multi-faceted approach incorporating, physiotherapy, medications, and deep brain stimulation.

Patients with vitamin deficiency can be educated and prescribed proper supplementation to increase their bodyâ€™s levels. Following up with routine laboratory work is essential in these patients to ensure therapeutic levels of vitamins are reached. Similarly, lifestyle modifications can be employed to ensure that patients are repleting nutritional deficiencies through the foods they consume. Patients with neurologic causes of gait disturbances can be treated with medications to provide symptomatic relief as well as increasing neurotransmitter levels to improve gait.

Most of the improvements have been made with Parkinson's disease with effective medications, deep brain stimulation at the subthalamic nucleus, and allied healthcare gait improvement techniques (external cueing physiotherapy intervention which uses visual and auditory cues aimed at improving gait, treadmill walking, cognitive training, and home-based exercise programs).

Patients can benefit from multimodal rehabilitation, gait training, use of assistive devices, and fall prevention measures. Commonly used exercise interventions such as muscle strength, power, and resistance training, as well as coordination training, can improve routine and maximum gait speed in the elderly.
