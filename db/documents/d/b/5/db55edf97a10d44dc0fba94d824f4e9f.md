The hemorrhage due to acquired hemophilia is challenging to differentiate from other bleeding diatheses. The main differential diagnosis includes

- Congenital hemophilia A, B, and C (mixing study; quantitative factor assays)

- Factor XII deficiency (the quantitative measurement of factor activity; titers of factor inhibitors)

- Medication usage-unfractionated heparin, warfarin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, direct factor Xa inhibitor (history; coagulation profile)

- Antiphospholipid syndrome (laboratory assays for anticardiolipin and anti-Î²-glycoprotein I antibodies; lupus anticoagulant)
