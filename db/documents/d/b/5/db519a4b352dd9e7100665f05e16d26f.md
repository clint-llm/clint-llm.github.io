The recent improvement in the medical management of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis has shown comparable rates to carotid endarterectomy for reduced stroke risk. As a result, medical management has become more favorable and is currently the advocated preference for patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

In addition to the currently used imaging modalities for carotid artery assessment, contrast-enhanced ultrasound is a new and increasingly used modality. Contrast enhancement correlates with the presence and degree of intraplaque neovascularization on histology. Also, researchers have found that plaques with a more substantial amount of contrast enhancement have a significantly increased density of microvessels in corresponding regions on histology. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound has provided helpful information on carotid atherosclerotic plaques, such as ulceration and intraplaque neovascularization.
