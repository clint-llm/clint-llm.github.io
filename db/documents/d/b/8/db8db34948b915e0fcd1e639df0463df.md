Alzheimer's disease is typically a disease of old age. The global prevalence of dementia is reported to be as high as 24 million and is predicted to increase 4 times by the year 2050. The estimated health care cost of Alzheimer's disease is $172 billion per year in the United States alone. In 2011, the United States had an estimated 4.5 million people age sixty-five and above, living with clinical Alzheimer's disease. The incidence of Alzheimer's disease doubles every 5 years, after the age of 65. Age-specific incidence increases significantly from less than 1% per year before 65 years of age to 6% per year after 85 years of age. Prevalence rates increase from 10% after the age of 65 to 40 % after the age of 85. Incidence rates of Alzheimer's disease are slightly higher for women, especially after 85 years of age.
