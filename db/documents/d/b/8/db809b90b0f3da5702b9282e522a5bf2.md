Depressive cognitive disorder continually poses a diagnostic difficulty. These cases demonstrate symptoms of a major depressive disorder associated with cognitive impairment. It may be due to numerous causes with several etiologies. While the record may illustrate that the person has pseudodementia, the reason is complicated to know without a comprehensive examination, assessing cognition, and ordering laboratory tests.

For the early diagnosis and treatment of depressive cognitive disorders, collective interprofessional activity is meaningful. For example, if an aged person complains of memory problems along with behavioral disturbances, the clinician should contemplate the differential of depressive cognitive disorders. An additional difficulty in old-age is polypharmacy and medication interactions. The pharmacist should frequently monitor the drug dispensing and discuss with the physician if there are any potentially lethal prescriptions. Eventually, a psychiatric nurse and a social worker should be involved in the supervision of these cases as they want assistance services, a stable living atmosphere, and appreciating caretakers. An interprofessional squad strategy is crucial if one wishes to enhance outcomes and decrease undesirable circumstances related to depressive cognitive disorders.
