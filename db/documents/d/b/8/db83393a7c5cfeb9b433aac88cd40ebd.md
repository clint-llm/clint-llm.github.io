On average, there are as many as a few hundred conidia inhaled by humans daily.

Species prevalence has changed over the past decade. A. fumigatus used to be the culprit of 90% of infections. In recent studies, it has been shown that A. fumigatus species complex is responsible for approximately 60% of infections followed in frequency by A. flavus, AspergillusÂ niger, and A. terreus respectively.

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is usually seen in patients with underlying conditions and risk factors such as severe prolonged neutropenia, inherited immunodeficiency, steroid dependency, use of immunosuppressive medications, transplant patients, AIDS.

Other forms of aspergillosis such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), allergic sinusitis, and saprophytic infection are important causes of morbidity but are seldom life-threatening.
