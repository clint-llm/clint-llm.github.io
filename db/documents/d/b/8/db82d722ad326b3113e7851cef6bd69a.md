The predominant etiology of PIVH is the fragility of the vessels in the germinal matrix and the immature cerebral autoregulation mechanism in the preterm neonate.

Blood vessel morphology in the germinal matrix of the neonate differs from that in other cortical areas, mainly due to the increased metabolic demand required by the rapid turnover of precursor cells in this region. Blood vessels supplying the germinal matrix have a higher density and area than other cortical areas. In addition to this, the vessel morphology differs, mainly in that vessels supplying the germinal matrix are more round versus flat in other cortical regions due to a level of vessel immaturity.

Damage to the surrounding white matter tissue from PIVH has been attributed to compression from ventricular dilation and direct white matter tissue trauma from the weakened ependymal lining. Compression on the adjacent white matter from dilated ventricles has been shown in non-human models to [roduce axonal damage, white matter edema, and various reactive cellular components. A similar mechanism is present when the ependymal lining stretches and ruptures exposing blood products and other reactive cellular components directly to the white matter.
