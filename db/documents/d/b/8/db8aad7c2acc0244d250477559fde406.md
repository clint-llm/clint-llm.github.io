In 1975, pharmacologist Tuttle and chemist Mills, discover the compound dobutamine by modifying the structure ofÂ isoproterenol/isoprenaline. They published an article "Dobutamine: development of a new catecholamine to selectively increase cardiac contractility"

Dobutamine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for short-term use in patients with decreased contractility due to heart failure or cardiac surgical procedures leading to cardiac decompensation.

Dobutamine can be used as temporary intravenous inotropic support until resolution of the acute inducing factors or the patient receives more definitive treatment, such as coronary revascularization, mechanical circulatory support, or heart transplant. Short-term intravenous inotropic support should be given to patients in cardiogenic shock to preserve systemic blood flow and protect from end-organ damage.

Patients can reasonably receive dobutamine in continuous intravenous form for inotropic support to bridge patients with late-stage heart failure, stage D, that is refractory to guideline-directed medical therapy until patients who are candidates for and awaiting cardiac transplantation or mechanical circulatory support receive the appropriate long-term treatment.

Continuous intravenous inotropic dobutamine support can reasonably be given in the short term for hospitalized patients with severe systolic dysfunction who present with low blood pressure and a significantly decreased cardiac output to preserve systemic blood flow and protect from end-organ damage.

Continuous intravenous inotropic dobutamine support can reasonably be given for the long-term in palliative patients with late-stage heart failure, stage D, who are not candidates for mechanical circulatory support or cardiac transplantation for symptomatic control, regardless of guideline-directed medical therapy.

Intravenous inotropic dobutamine can be given off-label to patients to induce pharmacological stress during stress echocardiography if patients cannot perform an exercise stress test.
