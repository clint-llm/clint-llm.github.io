Giardiasis is caused by the protozoa Giardia duodenalis (also referred to as Giardia lamblia and Giardia intestinalis). Infected animals excrete cysts into freshwater, where they are immediately infective and can exist for weeks to months. Seven genetic assemblages (A-F) have been identified, with only genotypes A and B being known to infect humans.

Ingesting cysts through contaminated water or person-to-person direct contact causes human infection. Inadequate hygiene and sanitation play a vital role in transmission. Nowadays, daycares have become epicenters of the infection mainly through lack of proper handwashing while handling and changing diapers.
