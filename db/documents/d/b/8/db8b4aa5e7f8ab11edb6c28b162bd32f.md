There is no well-defined etiology for systemic lupus erythematosus. The classical precipitating factor is sunlight exposure in a patient with the abnormal milieu of genetic predisposition and immune dysregulation. Drug-induced SCLE has been reported as well. Commonly used drugs that have been associated with SCLE are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, Â anticonvulsants, beta-blockers, and immune modulators, including TNF alpha inhibitors. There have been case reports of the development of SCLE in malignancies.
