ALM accounts for 2 to 3% of all new melanomas. The average age of diagnosis for ALM is 62.8 years. The incidence of ALM in all populations increases with age, and a sharp increase is seen in incidence per person year after the age of 80. Similar numbers of males and females are affected; however, females are more commonly diagnosed at an earlier stage than males. ALM has a disproportionately higher incidence in non-white patients compared to other melanoma subtypes.

Although studies from Mexico, Taiwan, and China have found it to be the most common subtype in their populations.
