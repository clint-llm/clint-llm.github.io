Besides distinguishing delirium from dementia, it is crucial to identify superadded delirium in a pre-existing dementia patient as it leads to prolonged length of hospital stay, accelerated cognitive and functional decline, increased healthcare costs, and ultimately death.

Studies have shown up to 2Â to 4 times increased mortality in patients who develop delirium in the ICU setting, and up to 1.5 fold increased risk for death in a year following hospitalization in those admitted to general medical, geriatric service, and nursing home residents with comorbidities such as stroke and dementia.
