**Risk****Factors**

A significant proportion of pleural space infection present as complications in community- or hospital-acquired pneumonia.

- Age under 60 years old

- Poor oral hygiene

- Disorders with a predisposition to aspiration (seizure, alcoholism, central nervous system disease)

- IV drug misuse

- Diabetes

- Cardiovascular disease

- Liver cirrhosis

- Other immunocompromised states (HIV infection, malignancy)

One prospective observational study found six risk factors associated with patients admitted with community-acquired pneumonia who subsequently developed empyema include albumin less than 30 g/L, sodium below 130 mmol/L, platelet count greater than 400 X 109, C-reactive protein over 100 mg/L, and a history of alcohol abuse or intravenous drug use.

**Bacteriology**

Aerobic Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species and Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the predominant microorganisms in community-acquired empyema.S. pneumoniaeÂ as the major pathogen in surgically treated empyemas. Also, anaerobic isolates were found in higher incidence in CAP than previously reported.Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and gram negatives including Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae, are pathogens commonly seen in hospital-acquired empyema. Anaerobes are slow growing organisms that notoriously yield negative culture media. Therefore, broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with anaerobic coverage is warranted.

Fungal empyema is a clinical entity that is rare but carries a high mortality. One single center retrospective analysis isolated Candida and Aspergillus species from 65 critically ill patients w/ variable comorbidities, including malignancy. The majority of these cases were nosocomial infections or had concomitant fungemia.
