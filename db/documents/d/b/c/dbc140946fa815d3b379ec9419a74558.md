Prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors are known as prolactinomas. They are the most frequent secretory tumors of the pituitary gland accounting for at least 40% of all pituitary tumors. These areÂ reported more commonly in women. Other causes of increased prolactin, apart from pituitary adenomas, include craniopharyngioma and other sellar or para-sellar masses, infiltration of the hypothalamus, and head trauma. Mild elevations in prolactin may also be seen in patients with hypothyroidism, polycystic ovarian disease, and secondary to the use of certain medications such as antipsychotic agents, opioid analgesics, antidepressants, among others. Physiological causes of increased prolactin levels include stimulation of the nipple and sexual intercourse.

Excessive production of GH leads to acromegaly and gigantism. The incidence of acromegaly is 5 cases per million per year, and the prevalence is 60 cases per million.

Excessive ACTH production leads to the presence of hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome). The incidence of Cushing syndrome is 2.4 cases per million.

Pituitary adenomas that produce TSH (TSHoma) represent less than 1% of functioning pituitary adenomas, with the Swedish National Registry reporting an incidence rate of 0.15 cases per million population per year.

The simultaneous presence of a pituitary adenoma with a pancreatic endocrine tumor and a parathyroid tumor is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 syndrome.
