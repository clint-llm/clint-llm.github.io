The levator palpebrae superioris has strong associations with the superior rectus muscle, superior tarsal muscle (Müller muscle), and orbicularis oculi. The superior branch of the oculomotor nerve dually innervates the superior rectus muscle and levator palpebrae superioris muscles, allowing synchronous elevation of the upper eyelid during upward gaze.

The location of the superior tarsal muscle is posterior to the levator aponeurosis extending from the inferior aspect of the levator palpebrae superioris to the superior aspect of the tarsal plate. It is sympathetically innervated and assists with eyelid retraction.

The levator palpebrae superioris is the major antagonistic muscle of the orbicularis oculi, whose primary function is eyelid closure.
