There are two types- the congenital and the acquired type. In the most common congenital type, talocalcaneal coalitions are due to the failure of mesenchymal segmentation and differentiation.

The acquired type is less common and can be due to trauma, degeneration, inflammatory arthritis, or infections of the hindfoot or midfoot.
