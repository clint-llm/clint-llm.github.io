Diltiazem is an oral and parenteral non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It is used in many clinical scenarios as an antihypertensive, anti-arrhythmic, and anti-anginal. FDA-approved indications include atrial arrhythmia, hypertension, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and chronic stable angina. Diltiazem also has numerous off-label indications for migraine prophylaxis, anal fissures, and pulmonary hypertension. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, approved and off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, relevant diltiazem interactions, and monitoring of patients treated with diltiazem. It also emphasizes the pertinent interprofessional team members' role when prescribing diltiazem for any of its intended indications.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the mechanisms of action for diltiazem.
- Identify the approved and off-label indications for diltiazem use.
- Review the adverse events for diltiazem therapy.
