Ohm law is a relationship between three physical phenomena: current, voltage, and resistance. Current is defined as the flow of positive charge from a source to a negative charge source.Â Ohm law was originally an empirical derivation based on the relationship between current and voltage; however, it has remained consistent in microscopic and macroscopic observations. Ohm law is widely used in electronics and in creating circuits, as well as in battery development and other electrochemical applications.
