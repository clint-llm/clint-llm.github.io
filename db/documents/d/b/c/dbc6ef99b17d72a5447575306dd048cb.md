The tongue comprises intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. The intrinsic muscles consist of superior and inferior lingual longitudinal muscles, the transverse lingual muscle, and the vertical lingual muscle. The intrinsic muscles of the tongue act predominantly to alter the shape of the tongue. The extrinsic muscles determine the tongue's movement and position.

There are four sets of paired extrinsic muscles: the styloglossus, hyoglossus, genioglossus, and palatoglossus muscles. The styloglossus muscle acts to lift the lateral edges and to retract the tongue. The hyoglossus muscle causes retraction as well as depression of the tongue. The genioglossus muscle protrudes the tongue. The palatoglossus muscles elevate the posterior part of the tongue. The former three muscles are innervated by the hypoglossal (XII) nerve, whereas the palatoglossus muscle is innervated by the vagus (X) nerve.
