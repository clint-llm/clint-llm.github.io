Mitral stenosis is a significant disease process that affects millions of people worldwide. With more safe options for treatment and better overall operative rates with newer technology, we can now help treat patients with percutaneous intervention in those who have suitable valve anatomy. Untreated MS causes the patient's morbidity and mortality, especially when combined with other cardiac or pulmonary disease processes. When the finding of MS arises, it should be addressed if surgical intervention is warranted. We need to continue to monitor outcomes of both open vs. percutaneous mitral valve repairs to continue to gain knowledge of what changes we need to make to help guide the future of rheumatic mitral heart disease.
