Meningioma commonly originates from meningothelial arachnoid cap cells. Most meningiomas are sporadic, benign, and slowly growing. They usually exhibit one or more focal chromosomal deletions; however, malignant meningiomas often have multiple chromosomal mutations. More genetic mutations are associated with accelerated growth and increased tumor grade.

A genetic mutation on chromosome 22 in neurofibromatosis type 2 is one of the most common predisposing conditions seen in sporadic meningiomas. Other chromosomal mutations reported in meningiomas are 1p, 6q, 14q, and 18q. There are also genes found in inherited meningiomas such as CREB binding protein, protein patched homolog 1, phosphatase and tensin homolog, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, Von Hippel–Lindau, and neurofibromatosis 1.
