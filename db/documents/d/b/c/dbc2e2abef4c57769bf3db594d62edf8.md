The differential of conditions causing anisocoria may be divided into three sub-categories, depending upon whether the anisocoria increases in dim light, in bright light, or remains equal in both lighting conditions.

**Causes of Anisocoria Greater in Dim Light******

**Horner Syndrome**

Horner’s syndrome occurs as a result of a lesion along the oculo-sympathetic pathway. Clinical features include ipsilateral miosis, ptosis, anhidrosis, enophthalmos, and loss of ciliospinal reflex. Inverse ptosis (upside-down ptosis), a condition where the lower eyelid elevates due to underlying denervated tarsal muscle, may also be seen. It is worth noting that the enophthalmos in Horner syndrome is not a true enophthalmos. It results due to evident narrowing of vertical palpebral fissure height, producing an apparent sunken appearance of the globe.

Prior knowledge of the sympathetic pathway is important to localize the lesion and understand the rationale behind the clinical presentation of Horner syndrome.

The sympathetic pathway comprises a three–order neuronal chain. The first–order neuron arises from the posterolateral hypothalamus and synapses at the C8-T2 level in the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord, also called the ciliospinal center of Budge. The second-order neurons now travel across the apex of the lung and along the sympathetic chain, ultimately synapsing at the level of the superior cervical ganglion. The third-order neurons (postganglionic fibers) travel with the internal carotid artery (ICA) through the cavernous sinus and then along the abducens nerve. It then follows the first division of the trigeminal nerve as the nasociliary nerve and later as the long ciliary nerves to supply the dilator pupillae.

Anhidrosis is typically present in cases of central (1 order) or pre-ganglionic (2 order) lesions. Although the classical clinical features are sufficient to diagnose Horner syndrome, several pharmacological tests are available to confirm a case of suspected Horner syndrome, as summarised in Table 2.

**Drug**

**Mechanism of Action**

**Response**

**Rationale**

**Localization**

**Remarks**

Cocaine

(2 drops, 4% or 10%)

Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (released at nerve terminals)

Anisocoria > 1 mm after 45-60 mins, diagnostic of  Horner’s syndrome on the miotic side

Horner pupil has negligible noradrenaline at the synaptic cleft.

No role in the localization of the lesion

Better than apraclonidine for children as the latter causes CNS/respiratory arrest

Apraclonidine (0.5% or 2%)

α-2 adrenergic agonist + weak α-1 agonist activity on iris dilator

Horner pupil dilates, and the anisocoria decreases. This is known as the “reversal of anisocoria.”

Only the Horner’s pupil will dilate in response to weak α-1 due to denervation hypersensitivity

Theoretically more sensitive for the post-ganglionic lesions. No definitive role

Not useful for acute-onset Horner syndrome as the denervation hypersensitivity takes 2-5 days to set in

Phenylephrine (10% or 2.5%)

Direct sympathomimetic activity

Horner pupil dilates

Direct action of the drug

No role in localizing sympatholytic lesion

It helps in ruling out mechanical causes

Hydroxyamphetamine (1%)

Presynaptic norepinephrine release from intact post-ganglionic neuron

Horner pupil with post-ganglionic lesion will not dilate. Pupils dilate if 1/2 order neuron dysfunction is present.

Presynaptic norepinephrine release will only occur if the post-ganglionic pathway is intact.

Post-ganglionic location if the Horner’s pupil does not dilate

Cocaine interferes with the efficacy of hydroxy-amphetamine, and thus, the two tests must be used at least 3 days apart.

Anisocoria due to Horner syndrome associated with pain should be treated as an emergency warranting immediate recognition. The most important cause of a painful Horner’s syndrome is ICA dissection.

Children with anisocoria must be evaluated for birth trauma. It is the most common cause of congenital Horner’s syndrome. If no evidence of trauma is found, a dedicated work-up to rule out neuroblastoma is mandated in children. Appropriate imaging, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) head, neck, chest, and abdomen, should be carried out for timely detection and appropriate management.

**Cholinergic Medications**

Cholinergic medications can cause miosis of the pupil through activation of the sphincter pupillae. The most common eye drop is pilocarpine, which has historically been used to treat glaucoma.

**Posterior Synechiae**

If posterior synechiae (abnormal connections between the iris and the lens) develop, the pupil may not be able to dilate fully. This can be caused by uveitis, angle-closure glaucoma, or other inflammatory conditions. The best way to evaluate for posterior synechiae is with a slit lamp examination. In this case, the underlying condition needs to be treated.

**Causes of Anisocoria Greater in Bright Light**

**Third Nerve Palsy**

The parasympathetic fibers run along the periphery of the third nerve. Thus, compressive lesions of the third nerve would affect the parasympathetic fibers. This inhibits the signal to the sphincter pupillae, causing unopposed dilation of the pupil on the affected side. A third nerve palsy can be differentiated from other causes if the oculomotor component is affected. There would be significant ptosis of the affected upper eyelid due to inhibition to the levator palpebrae superioris. The eye would also be abducted and depressed, also known as "down and out." This is due to the unopposed action of the lateral rectus and superior oblique, which are the two extraocular muscles not innervated by the third cranial nerve.

**Migraine Headache**

A migraine headache can cause anisocoria associated with pain. The pupil will typically be dilated, and the dilation often resolves after the headache has subsided.

**Cycloplegic Medications**

Cycloplegic medications cause paralysis of the sphincter pupillae, which in turn causes unopposed dilation. This pupil will, at most, minimally constrict with light and, much of the time, will not react at all due to paralysis. Pilocarpine will not be effective in causing this pupil to constrict. Cycloplegic eye drops include cyclopentolate, atropine, and tropicamide. The same effect can be achieved if a patient touches an anticholinergic medication and then touches the eye. Getting a history of cycloplegic medication use is the best way to make this diagnosis.

**Sympapathomymetics**

Eye drops that cause activation of the dilator pupillae can cause mydriasis of the pupil. There still should be some reactivity of the pupil. The dilation is not as great as with cycloplegic medications.

**Adie Tonic Pupil**

In this condition, the larger pupil fails to constrict to the extent of the other pupil. However, when the eye accommodates, the pupil has greater constriction. This cause of anisocoria can be diagnosed with dilute pilocarpine, which causes significant constriction of the larger pupil. Other causes of a dilated pupil typically do not respond to dilute pilocarpine, helping confirm the diagnosis of Adie tonic pupil.

**Traumatic Mydriasis**

Damage to the pupillary sphincter due to trauma or intraocular surgery may leave the pupil dilated and potentially with an irregular shape. The pupil may then be unable to constrict. The best way to diagnosis traumatic mydriasis is to get a complete history of ocular trauma and eye surgeries and then perform a slit lamp exam. Mydriasis due to trauma may improve over time or remain permanent. An irregular pupil after intraocular surgery has a higher likelihood of remaining permanent.

**Causes of Anisocoria that is Equal in Bright and Dim Light Conditions**

**Physiological Anisocoria**

Physiologic anisocoria is usually defined as a pupillary inequality of 0.4 mm, seldom greater than 0.8 mm, not due to a secondary cause. If the anisocoria is physiologic, the difference in pupil sizes should remain equal in dim and bright lights. This also should be something that patient has had for a long time and has not acutely changed. The difference in pupil size in physiologic anisocoria remains stable over time and is not a concern for an underlying medical condition.
