Patient and family education on the diagnosis of ITP, bleeding risks associated with this disease, and proper treatment, especially compliance with medical therapy, is essential for patients.

Children with ITP should be restricted from activities associated with a bleeding risk from trauma when their platelet count is less than 30,000/microL. These activities include but are not limited to contact and collision sports (i.e., football, boxing, lacrosse, and hockey) or any other activities associated with a risk for head injury (i.e., baseball, soccer, skiing, or gymnastics). Both children and adults should avoid antiplatelet medications, which include aspirin, ibuprofen, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs). Anticoagulants (i.e., heparin, enoxaparin, warfarin) should also be avoided in patients with platelet counts less than 20,000/microL.

Patients and caregivers must be counseled on proper treatment and when to seek medical care.
