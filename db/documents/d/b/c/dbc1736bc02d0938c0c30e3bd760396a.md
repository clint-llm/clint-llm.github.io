The American Herbal Products Association advises against its use by pregnant women except under the direct supervision of a licensed clinician. The US Pharmacopeia advises that those with liver disorders not use the herb.  The Pharmacopeia also states that if symptoms of liver dysfunction occur, use should be stopped immediately, and a clinician should see the patient.  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that the data does not show that the use of black cohosh is efficacious in treating menopausal symptoms. The North American Menopause Society echoes this position. Since some compounds in black cohosh have estrogenic activity, it would be prudent to avoid its use when there is a history of breast cancer, endometrial cancer, thromboembolic disorders, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, endometriosis, and fibroids. Due to reports of liver toxicity, it is not recommended with a history of any liver disorder. The US Pharmacopeia recommended that the product contain the following label: "Discontinue use and consult a healthcare practitioner if you have a liver disorder or develop symptoms of liver trouble, such as abdominal pain, dark urine, or jaundice."
