Myofascial pain syndrome can cause a reduction in the quality of life. Long-term pain is usually associated with mood disorders (depression and anxiety). It can decrease the mobility of the patient, decreasing daily activity, which further precipitates the condition.

Undesirable effects of drug therapies may occur if the patient does not follow the doctor's instructions carefully. Similarly, if the approach to physical activity does not follow certain rules set by competent personnel, muscle trauma may occur.
