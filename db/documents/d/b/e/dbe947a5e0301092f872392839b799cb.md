Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) can cause a significant risk for the fetus, and it is one of the treacherous risk factors for sudden fetal demise.

- Sudden intrauterine demise (odds ratio 1.46 [95% CI 0.73–2.89])

- Meconium-stained amniotic fluid (2.60 [1.62–4.16])

- Spontaneous preterm birth (3.47 [3.06–3.95])

- Iatrogenic preterm birth (3.65 [1.94–6.85])

- Neonatal ICU admission (2.12 [1.48–3.03])

Maternal bile acids are transported through the placenta to the fetus and accumulate in the amniotic fluid to cause complications. The incidence of preterm labor also increases in women with ICP, the cause is unknown, but possibly related to bile acid accumulation in the uterine myometrium causing increased uterine activity. Sudden fetal death is the most concerning complication of ICP; the cause of fetal death is not well understood; still, it possibly has a relationship to the toxic effects of bile acids on the fetal heart, causing arrhythmias and chorionic vasospasm causing deprivation of maternal oxygenated blood to the fetus causing asphyxia.
