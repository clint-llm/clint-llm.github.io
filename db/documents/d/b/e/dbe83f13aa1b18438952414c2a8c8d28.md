Medical management of these patients should beginÂ in the emergency department. In the first 24 hours, there is a very high risk of rebleeding, and this risk can be reduced markedly by controlling blood pressure. Systolic should be kept less than 140 mmHg.

- Labetalol and nicardipine are good first-line agents.

- Nitroglycerin and nitroprusside should be avoided as they are associated with an increase in intracranial pressure.

Remember to control the patient's pain. It is not only the right thing to do; adequate pain control will make it easier to control the blood pressure.

Use antiemetics as needed.

Nimodipine may be added in the first 96 hours to help decrease the degree of vasospasm.

Antiseizure medications should also be initiated.
