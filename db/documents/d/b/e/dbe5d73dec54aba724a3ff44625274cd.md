A patient in sinus bradycardia should be evaluated for hemodynamic instability. If found to be hemodynamically unstable the patient can be treated with intravenous (IV) atropine. If the patient's symptoms and heart rate do not improve, the patient is a candidate for a temporary pacemaker. If the patient on arrival is hemodynamically stable but has signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction, they should be treated for an acute myocardial infarction appropriately. If there are no signs or symptoms of acute myocardial infarction in a hemodynamically stable patient, then workup should be initiated for an infectious cause (including chest x-ray, blood cultures, urinary analysis, viral panel) together with thyroid function tests. If a patient is found to have an infectious cause or a thyroid abnormality, the patient should be appropriately treated for these underlying causes and re-evaluated.  The patient's medication list should also be reviewed for possible causes of bradycardia. If a patient has comorbid conditions that require him to be on certain medications which may be causing his sinus bradycardia then in the patient may be a candidate for a permanent pacemaker.
