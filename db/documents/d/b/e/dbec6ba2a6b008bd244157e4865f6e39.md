Treatment includes the management of the underlying pathology. Depending on the underlying cause, appropriate antimicrobial agents and tetanus immune globulins are administered if the disease is suspected or confirmed. Deep brain stimulation for dystonic opisthotonos associated with Parkinson’s disease has produced variable outcomes.

Supportive measures include maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance and ventilatory support, nutritional support, either parenteral or enteral. Avoidance of triggers like noise in tetanus or the sound of water in rabies reduces precipitation of the spasms. A dark, soundproof room is preferred. Oral administration of medication such as benzodiazepines and baclofen can be administered to improve the spasms. Intrathecal baclofen can reduce spasticity/dystonia.

It is important to educate patients, caretakers, and colleagues about opisthotonus and its many consequences. Successful interventions with early identification and treatment may help to slow progression and improve the quality of life. Older adults should pay attention to their ability to prevent some of the associated causes, especially tetanus. It is important to maintain adequate tetanus prophylaxis on all older patients (age 60 and beyond) as they forget about preventive immunization.
