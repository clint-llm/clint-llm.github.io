Overactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular and renal diseases.

Overactivation of the RAAS is also implicated in the development of secondary hypertension due to primary hyperaldosteronism. Primary hyperaldosteronism is the excess aldosterone production either by an adrenal adenoma (Conn syndrome) or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia producing excess aldosterone.

Medications targeting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system include:

- **Direct Renin Inhibitor:**Aliskiren has not improved renal or cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.

- **Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i):**Commonly used agents include lisinopril, captopril, ramipril, enalapril, fosinopril, and benazepril. These are used as first-line agents for the management of hypertension. These agents have improved cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, including reduced hospitalizations for heart failure and CV mortality.

- **Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB):**Commonly used agents include valsartan, candesartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, and telmisartan. These are used as first-line agents for the management of hypertension. Multiple agents have been shown to improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, including reduced heart failure and CV mortality hospitalizations.

- **Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists (MRA):**Spironolactone, eplerenone, and finerenone have improved outcomes in patients with a history of heart failure. Spironolactone and eplerenone have been shown to reduce hospitalizations and mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

- **Aldosterone Synthase Blocker:**Baxdrostat, a selective aldosterone synthase inhibitor, has shown promising results in patients with resistant hypertension in a recent phase 2 clinical trial with dose-dependent reductions in blood pressure.

- **Blockers of ENaC:**Amiloride and triamterene. These do not have any effect on the mineralocorticoid receptor.

These agents result in a reduction in vasoconstriction and improved renal perfusion.
