Diseases affecting the peripheral nerve fibers of the somatic nervous system are called peripheral neuropathy. They can classify according to the causes, including congenital and acquired diseases. They can also classify according to the primary pathology of the axons (axonal neuropathy) or the myelin sheath (demyelinating neuropathy). The axonal peripheral neuropathy consisted of a big group of causes mostly toxic-metabolic in nature, such as diabetes mellitus and B group vitamin deficiency. They present mainly with length-dependent sensory impairment and weakness, the so-called glove and stocking distribution. Pain and temperature sensations are more selectively affected. The demyelinating neuropathies are not length-dependent. They are often immune-mediated, resulting in more diffuse sensorimotor involvement and early loss of deep tendon reflexes. The sensory involvement is more selective with joint position and vibratory sensory loss.

Numerous congenital diseases of sensory and motor control arise from either defect in the CNS, peripheral nervous system, or the muscle itself. Due to the extensive range covered by the somatic nervous system, these conditions can either localize to a region of the body or can be widespread and generalized. Some of these include.

- Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease

- Fabry disease

- Refsum disease

- Porphyrias

Acquired peripheral neuropathy may include:

- Diabetes mellitus

- Trauma: Cauda equine syndrome, conus medullaris, herniated disk, brachial and lumbar plexus injury

- Spinal stenosis- Radiculopathy

- Familial/ Sporadic: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)

- Autoimmune: Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS), Lambert-Eaton syndrome, amyloid neuropathy

- Infectious: Lepromatous form of leprosy, diphtheria
