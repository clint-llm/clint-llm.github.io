There are a variety of treatment options for ulcerations. Chronic non-healing ulcers are typically treated with debridement.

Offloading to lower the abnormal peak pressures is integral to the healing process.

As alternatives for ulcer closure, bioengineered tissues can also be used.

Negative pressure wound therapy is a primary wound-closure method that can also be used to prepare the wound bed before other treatment modalities and is helpful for both acute and chronic ulcers.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is thought to be an effective treatment method in conjunction with local wound care, like offloading and debridement.

Peripheral neuropathy contributes significantly to the development of ulcers, and proper wound care and management are vital for the treatment. Nitric oxide plays a crucial role in peripheral vasculo-neuropathies, and its induction is essential in ulcer management.
