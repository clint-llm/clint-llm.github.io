There is not much literature on variants of the suprascapular nerve. Literature by Polguj et al. describes three variants in the relationship betweenthe superior transverse scapular ligament, suprascapular vessels, and nerve. The first variant, which is the most common, is where the suprascapular artery runs superior to the superior transverse scapular ligament, while the nerve and vein run inferior to the ligament. The second is where both the artery and vein run superior to the ligament, and the nerve runs inferior. The third variant, which is the least common, is where the artery, vein, and nerve pass inferior to the superior transverse scapular ligament.
