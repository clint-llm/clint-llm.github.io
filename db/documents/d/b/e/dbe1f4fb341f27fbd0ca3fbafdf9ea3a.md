Clinicians need to be more diligent when prescribing doxycycline to avoid a dangerous drug-resistant infection. Doxycycline hyclate therapy requires an interprofessional team approach, with clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists all collaborating to achieve optimal patient results. Since adverse effects are rare and varied in symptoms, it is crucial for those involved in the care of patients undergoing doxycycline hyclate therapy to understand the mechanism of action, dosing protocols, and signs of toxicity. If toxicity occurs, normal liver function should be confirmed with liver enzyme tests and biopsy, if required. The clinician and pharmacist are responsible for medication reconciliation to prevent drug-drug interactions. After the patient stabilizes, the healthcare team should determine the reason for toxicity and potentially report any new findings. Interprofessional care will result in better patient outcomes and fewer adverse events with doxycycline. [Level 5]
