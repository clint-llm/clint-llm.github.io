**Structure**

The masseter muscle is one of the muscles of mastication. It is a powerful superficial quadrangular muscle with two divisions: superficial and deep. The superficial portion of the masseter muscle originates from a thick aponeurosis on the temporal process of the zygomatic bone and the anterior two-thirds of the inferior border of the zygomatic arch. The fibers of the superficial portion pass inferior-posteriorly over the deep portion and insert onto the angle of the mandible (masseteric tubercle) and the inferior portion of the lateral surface of the mandibular ramus. The superficial masseter muscle has a quadrangular shape appearance on gross examination due to its origins and insertions. The deep portion of the masseter muscle originates from the entire surface of the zygomatic arch. The fibers run inferiorly and insert along the mandibular ramus superior to the masseter muscleâ€™s superior portion. Anteriorly, the deep portion is covered by the superior portion of the masseter, while posteriorly, the parotid gland covers the deep portion.

**Function**

The masseter muscle is one of the four muscles responsible for the action of mastication (chewing). When the masseter contracts it causes powerful elevation of the mandible causing the mouth to close. Its insertion along the angle and lateral surface of the ramus also allows it to aid in the protrusion of the mandible allowing for the anterior motion of the jaw.
