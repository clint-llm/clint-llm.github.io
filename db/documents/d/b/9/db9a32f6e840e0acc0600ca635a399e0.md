Educating patients and care providers about the visually devastating nature of the HSV keratitis and the need for adherence to treatment are very important. As herpes simplex virus is ubiquitous in nature and nearly impossible to avoid infection, the following measures will help in the prevention of both acquiring and recurrence of the disease.

- Oral antiviral prophylaxis of pregnant women at 36 weeks and opting for elective cesarean delivery prevents neonatal spread during birth

- Avoid oro-labial contacts of adults to newborns.

- Long term oral antiviral prophylaxis prevents recurrences in corneal graft and stromal keratitis and keratouveitis.

- Long term oral antiviral prophylaxis prevents recurrences in corneal graft following penetrating keratoplasty for uncontrolled epithelial keratitis or for dense stromal scar secondary to HSV keratitis
