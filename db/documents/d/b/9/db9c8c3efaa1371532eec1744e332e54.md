Sodium bicarbonate is a chemical compound made of sodium (Na+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-), for which the indications are many.

FDA approved indications include:

- Cardiac conduction delays

- QRS prolongation (ex. tricyclic antidepressant poisoning)

Under arrhythmias and cardiovascular instability, sodium bicarbonate can be administered to adults at 4 to 8 hour IV infusions. Each dose should be monitored and planned in a standard protocol to help evaluate the degree of response expected and predicted to understand the necessity to advance further infusions or withhold administration, given its fluid overloading effects.

Metabolic acidosis, related to:

- Severe renal disease

- Uncontrolled diabetes

- Severe primary lactic acidosis

- Circulatory insufficiency due to shock

- Severe dehydration

- Extracorporeal circulation of blood

- Cardiac arrest

- Drug toxicities

- Barbiturates

- Salicylate

- Toxic alcohols

- Urine alkalization

- Severe diarrhea with HCO3 loss

Non-FDA approved indications:

Nebulized sodium bicarbonate is an excellent option to treat chemical injuries resulting from chlorine gas, especially within the pulmonary mucosa. The belief is that the inhaled gas neutralizes when it reacts with water and bicarbonate within the respiratory system.
