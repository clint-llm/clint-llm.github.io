The greater saphenous vein is the longest vein in the body. It emerges from the dorsal foot veins medially and runs anteriorly to the medial malleolus. It continues on the medial side of the leg along the tibial side of the calf region beside the edge of the tibia up to the knee. The GSV then runs in a direction posterior and medial to the knee curving behind the medial femoral condyle.

Above the knee, it returns to a more medial position through the medial aspect of the thigh before draining into the common femoral vein at the saphenofemoral junction. Through the whole course of the GSV, it runs in a superficial plane to the muscles and deep fascia of the lower limb. The saphenous nerve runs along the vein at the lower two-thirds of the leg. This orientation makes it more susceptible to injury, to postoperative pain and paresthesias.
