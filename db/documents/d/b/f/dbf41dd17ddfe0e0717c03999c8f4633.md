The prevalence ofÂ actinic cheilitis is higher among fair-skinned populations and those closer to the equator where there is more UV exposure. Men are affected more than women, likely due to their comparatively increased work in the sun and less use of protective lip balm and cosmetics. The exact prevalence of AC is unknown, as the majority of data focuses on the incidence of SCC. In the US, there are more than 3500 new cases of lip cancer annually, 90% are SCC.
