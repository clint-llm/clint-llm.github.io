The diagnosis of Castleman disease is always a challenge in clinical experience, as it does not have specific features that could be distinguished from other diseases causing lymphadenopathies.

**Major Criteria**

- Histopathologic screening of lymph nodes is done to assess a single node involvement (suggestive of UCD) or a multimode involvement (suggesting MCD) after excluding other infectious, malignant, and autoimmune disorders that exhibit their characteristic features in the lymph nodes. In addition, their characteristic lymph node features are also noted.

- The lymph node size must be enlarged.

**Minor Criteria**

**Laboratory**

- Elevated CRP or ESR

- Anemia

- Thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis

- Hypoalbuminemia

- Renal dysfunction or proteinuria

- Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia

**Clinical**

- B symptoms: fever, weight loss, night sweats, fatigue

- Splenomegaly or Hepatomegaly

- Fluid accumulation( edema, anasarca, pleural effusion)

IL-6 has proven to be a specific biomarker for this disease, contributing to its pathogenesis, symptomatology, and histopathology. However, raised blood levels of IL-6 and soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL2R), VEGF, IgA, IgE, lactate dehydrogenase, β-2-microglobulin do not specifically indicate the presence of this disease but are essential for supporting its diagnosis.

The patient must also undergo serology tests for HIV and HHV-8 and search for HHV-8 DNA in peripheral blood by polymerase chain reactive (PCR) to discover associations with CD.

Before formulating a treatment plan, physicians should perform a thorough clinical staging to detect other sites of involvement. An evaluation including serum protein electrophoresis, bone marrow examination, CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, radiographic skeletal survey, and gallium scan provides essential information in detecting the extent of the disease and also distinguishes multicentric from localized Castleman disease.

These outlined criteria require careful collaboration between the clinical team and laboratory physicians. Definitive diagnosis should only be made when all other causes of lymphadenopathy are investigated and excluded. Elimination of other diseases may require biopsies, serologic or histologic studies, and clinical correlation.
