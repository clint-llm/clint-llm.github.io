Arsenic is a naturally occurring metalloid element with ubiquitous distribution throughout the earth's crust and groundwater; it is also found in lower levels in the air and food products, particularly, crustaceans and seafood. The release of arsenic into the environment propagates through weathering and mining processes, as well as other natural phenomena such as volcanic activity. Arsenic is a byproduct in smelting processes for many ores including gold, lead, cobalt, nickel, and zinc.

Arsenic was previously used in herbicides, wood preservative treated products, many traditional remedies, as well as in, defoliants used in the distillation of process in beer, wine whiskey, and other alcohol-containing products.

Arsine gas is employed in the production of gallium arsenide which is still used today as an integral component in semiconductors, lasers, light-emitting diodes, photoelectric chemical cells, and microwave devices. One of the most significant causes of chronic arsenic toxicity is contaminated drinking water, through erosion of land sources, and contaminated wells and aquifers.
