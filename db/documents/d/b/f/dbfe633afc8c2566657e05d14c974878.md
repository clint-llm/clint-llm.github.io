Enalaprilat is the active metabolite of the oral prodrug enalapril maleate. Enalaprilat is poorly absorbed orally and must be administered intravenously. It inhibits angiotensin I to angiotensin II conversion via competitive inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).

**Pharmacokinetics**

Following intravenous administration of an enalaprilat, a small fraction is bound to ACE. The amount bound does not increase with a higher dose, indicating a saturable binding site for enalaprilat. The effective half-life for enalaprilat is around 11 hours. Enalaprilat is poorly absorbed following oral administration. Enalaprilat is primarily excreted via the kidneys, and more than 90 percent of a given dose is eliminated in the urine as an unchanged drug within 24 hours. Drug disposition remains unchanged for patients withÂ creatinine clearance of more than 30 ml per minute. In patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml per minute, the time for Cmax, Tmax, and steady-state may be altered. Animal studies in dogs show that enalapril does not cross the blood-brain barrier and is found in the brain at very low concentrations. Studies conducted in rats show minimal tissue accumulation after multiple doses of enalapril maleate.
