An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach to care for the patient can help achieve the best possible outcomes. The primary outcome is to improve patients' comfort and nursing care. Nurses are vital members of the interprofessional group as they will monitor the patient's vital signs and assist with the education of the patient and family. For the management of pain, wound infection, muscle contraction, the pharmacist will ensure that the patient is on the right analgesics, antispasmodic, anticholinergic, and appropriate antibiotics. The radiologist also plays a vital role in determining the cause. Without providing a proper history, the radiologist may not be sure what to look for or what additional radiologic exams may be needed. When the patient is to be discharged home, consultation should be made with a social worker and community nurses who can monitor the patient and make referrals as needed. Prompt referrals are warranted to improve outcomes. Physical therapists must be consulted for early ambulation to prevent contractures. Rehabilitation is essential in the management of patients who developed opisthotonus. Unrehabilitated patients may develop ulcers, chronic spasticity, contractures, and even scoliotic deformities.
