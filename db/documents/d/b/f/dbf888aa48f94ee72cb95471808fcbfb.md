This article will serve as a brief overview of the development of the urogenital system, a critical process of development occurring from 1-20 weeks of human development.

Urogenital development plays an essential role in human function and reproduction; consequently, malfunction or maldevelopment of this system may result in profound deleterious effects on fertility, urinary continence, and renal function. During week one to week 6, the human embryo is sexually indifferent; genetically male and female embryos are phenotypically alike, both expressing mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts. Around week 7 of development, sexual differentiation begins and continues until the sex, based on the external genitalia, of an embryo can be fully distinguished around week 12, and further phenotypic differentiation completes near week 20â€”the driving force for this phenotypic differentiation between females and males is primarily hormonal influence.
