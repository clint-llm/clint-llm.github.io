The exact etiology of prurigo nodularis remains poorly understood. Although the role of unimpeded itch-scratch cycle is uncontested, the exact sequence of events leading to the final clinical picture remain conjectural.  Prurigo nodularis is accompanied by long-standing pruritus and thought to develop as a reaction to repeated scratching in patients with chronic prurigo of various etiologies including dermatological, systemic, infectious, and neuropsychiatric

Anecdotal data suggests causative role or association of infectious agents such as hepatitis C, Helicobacter pylori, Strongyloides stercoralis, mycobacteria and HIV in PN

Increase in the number of sensory structures of the epidermis (merkel cells) and dermis (papillary dermal nerves) is encountered in PN lesions

The density of mast cells and neutrophils is increased in PN although there seems to be no increase in their degranulation products. In contrast while the number of eosinophils remains maintained, their products such as the major basic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin show higher than normal levels.

The pruritus in PN seems to be a result of cutaneous neurogenic inflammation mediated by various neuropeptides especially substance P, calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP)

Individuals with PN also show elevated levels of Interleukin 31(IL-31), a T-cell–derived highly prurigogenic cytokine
