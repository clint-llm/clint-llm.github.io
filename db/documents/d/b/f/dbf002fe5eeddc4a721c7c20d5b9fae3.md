Many CSF leaks, especially traumatic causes, resolve spontaneously and are associated with a good prognosis. Among the remaining patients, more than 90% resolve with surgical repair. Meningitis may complicate the clinical course in a small proportion of cases which may worsen the prognosis, especially among the late-onset CSF leaks. Prognosis is guarded among patients needing repeated surgical procedures due to the added surgical morbidity and the additional risk of meningitis.
