Physical therapists trained in the Mckenzie method will prescribe exercises in association with the centralization phenomenon mentioned above. Given that most people classify with a directional preference for spinal extension, this will be the direction of their prescribed exercises.

Examples of such spinal extension exercises include, but are not limited to:

- Prone position lying flat (patient lies flat on their stomach)

- Prone position propped on elbows (patient lies flat on their stomach and props themselves onto their elbows with the spine in extension)

- Prone position propped on hands (patient lies flat on their stomach and props themselves onto their hands with elbows in full extension, with the spine in extension)

- Standing lumbar extension (patient stands upright with feet shoulder-width apart, and puts hands on the lower back while extending the spine)

Similar exercises may be performed targeting spinal flexion, rotation, or lateral bending.
