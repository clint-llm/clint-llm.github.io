Sympathomimetics administration may be via virtually any route available, including oral, rectal, topical, IO, IV, IM, intrauterine, endotracheal, and inhalation. The term sympathomimetic forms a broad classification of medications, which is why a complete review of the wide variety of administration routes is beyond the scope of this article. Single sympathomimetic agent routes of administration may differ according to different desired pharmaceutical effects. Epinephrine administration – IV, IM, IO, endotracheal – is indicated emergently. Airway swelling requires inhaled epinephrine. Epinephrine and isoproterenol administration may be via the intramuscular route.

Oral administration may be further subdivided based on temporal characteristics. Pseudoephedrine extended-release capsules are designed to release their medication gradually. After the capsule dissolves, the medication granules dissolve at different rates. Interference with the capsule may alter the rate of the capsule's dissolution, thus modifying the pharmacological onset, duration, and effect. For this reason, extended-release capsules should not be crushed or broken.
