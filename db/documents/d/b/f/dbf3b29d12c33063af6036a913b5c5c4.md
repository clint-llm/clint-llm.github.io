Collagen vascular disease encompasses a diverse group of immunologically mediated entities that share overlapping clinical and histopathologic features as well as manifest in characteristic patterns of interstitial lung disease. The collagen vascular diseases which commonly affect the pulmonary system include rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic sclerosis (SSc), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), and Sjogren’s syndrome (SS). The degree of lung involvement and spectrum of thoracic findings vary among the disorders, may be seen with clinically early or late disease, and portends certain patient outcomes. Identification of pulmonary involvement has important therapeutic and prognostic implications. Collagen vascular disease may be associated with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP).
