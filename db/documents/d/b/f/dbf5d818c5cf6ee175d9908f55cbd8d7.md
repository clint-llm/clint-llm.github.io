Diagnostic laboratory assays are essential to confirm the clinical suspicion of gonorrhea. Laboratory confirmation of N. gonorrhoeae infection is made by direct detection of the gonococcal pathogen in urogenital, anorectal, pharyngeal, or conjunctival swab specimens or first-catch urine.

Populations that engage in anogenital sexual intercourse and/or insertive oral sex will require screening for gonorrhea from the anus and pharynx in addition to urogenital screening.N. gonorrhoeae or its genetic signature in genital or extragenital samples by light microscopy of stained smears, culture, or nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs).

The routine utilization of NAATs to screen at-risk asymptomatic patients have demonstrated that pharyngeal and rectal gonococcal infections are not uncommon manifestations.

The development of commercially available point-of-care assays for N. gonorrhoeae infection has impacted the time to treatment. However, while these point-of-care assays have few false-positive results, i.e., they demonstrate high levels of specificity, their sensitivity profiles range widely, with false-negative rates varying from 13% to greater than 90%.N. gonorrhoeae.
