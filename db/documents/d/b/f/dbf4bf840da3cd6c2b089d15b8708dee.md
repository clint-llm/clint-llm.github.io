The Bishop score reflects the normal changes the cervix undergoes in parturition (the process of childbirth). Extensive cervical remodeling is needed for the cervix to dilate and pass a fetus fully. While human parturition is not completely understood, it is a complex system that involves interactions between placental, fetal, and maternal mechanisms. The nonpregnant cervix extracellular matrix is primarily made up of tightly packed collagen bundles. Gradually throughout the pregnancy the composition of the cervix changes with decreased collagen density and an increase in hyaluronic acid and water content. In the days to weeks before delivery, through a cascade of events, inflammatory mediators increase the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins invading the cervix mediate the release of metalloproteases that break down collagen and change the cervical structure. Cervical softening and distention results from these extracellular matrix compositional changes, specifically, increased vascularity and stromal and glandular hypertrophy, and are due in part to an increase in collagen solubility.
