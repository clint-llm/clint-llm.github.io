Autopsy of a previous case revealed bilateral pleural hyperinflation that stayed inflated even after the thoracic cavity was opened. There were many mucus plugs but no effusions in the pleura or pericardium. Histologically, the autopsy revealed thickening of the airway and basement membrane, along with inflammation of airway lumens and eosinophils, mimicking asthma. The airways were filled with mucus exudates. Case series revealed hyperdistention and revealed signs of alveolar tear, parabronchial and perivascular widening, and connective tissue tearing all pointing towards pulmonary interstitial emphysema.
