The explanations of cytostatic and cytotoxic actions of anthracyclines point to a number of different mechanisms, including free radical formation, lipid peroxidation, direct membrane effects, and enzyme interactions. The following elucidates some of these theories:

**Enzyme Interaction**

The most widely accepted explanation for the action of anthracyclines is their interaction with topoisomerase-II. The ternary complex thus formed prevents the re-ligation of the ds-DNA breaks. Subsequently, it promotes growth arrest and apoptotic cell death.

**DNA Intercalation**

Anthracyclines have a chromophore moiety that has an intercalating function and inserts between adjacent base pairs of DNA when localized to the cell's nucleus; this inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis, especially in highly replicating cells blocking cell division.

**Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)**

Redox reactions generate reactive oxygen species in the presence of cytochrome P450 reductase, NADH dehydrogenase, and xanthine oxidase. The excess ROS cannot be detoxified, resulting in oxidative stress, DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation triggering cell apoptosis.

**DNA Adduct Formation**

These drugs are known to form adducts with DNA promoted by formaldehyde-releasing pro-drugs. The adducts block specific transcription factors and eventually initiate apoptosis.
