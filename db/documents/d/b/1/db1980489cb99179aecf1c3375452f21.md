Kaposi varicelliform eruption is a serious condition that may have fatal outcomes.

The disease may occur as a primary or a recurrent type of infection. The primary form mainly concerns children and is usually disseminated and associated with systemic symptoms and life-threatening complications such as bacterial sepsis, viremia, and multiple organ involvements. The recurrent type occurs in adulthood and is usually a milder and more localized form, generally presenting without viremia.

Septicemia resulting from secondary bacterial infection of cutaneous lesions also increases the morbidity and the mortality The most common species isolated from patients with  Kaposi varicelliform eruption are Staphylococcus aureus, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Risk of ocular involvement exists when herpes simplex virus-associated Kaposi varicelliform eruption affects the face. Ocular anomalies include uveitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, and blepharitis. The most serious ophthalmological sequela is herpetic keratitis which may lead to vision loss resulting from corneal scarring.
