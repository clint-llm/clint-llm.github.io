The diagnosis and management of carpal tunnel syndrome are done with an interprofessional team that includes the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, physical therapist, neuro/orthopedic/plastic surgeon, and the emergency department provider. The initial treatment is usually conservative combined with limiting repetitive activities. A properly fitted nighttime wrist splint can be offered. An occupational therapist trained in hand therapy also may be a beneficial referral. Combined therapy may be more beneficial than any single treatment. A short course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication can relieve symptoms but some do not feel it is of adequate benefit.

Many other treatments are available to treat carpal tunnel syndrome including surgery. An orthopedic specialty nurse can assist at all phases of care, regardless of whether treatment is conservative or surgical. While surgery can relieve symptoms, recurrence is not uncommon. The patient must be fully educated about the potential complications of surgery which should only be undertaken after conservative treatments have failed. An interprofessional team approach will lead to better outcomes for patients with CTS.
