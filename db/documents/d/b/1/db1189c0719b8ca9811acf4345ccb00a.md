NNRTIs as a drug class are commonly associated with central nervous system (CNS) effects. These effects include impaired concentration, vivid or abnormal dreams, insomnia, suicidal ideation, nausea, and vomiting.

Like the majority of the NNRTIs, efavirenz correlates with a wide array of drug interactions due to the phase I cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Efavirenz is a substrate, inducer, and inhibitor of CYP3A4.

Lipodystrophy is also a class-wide effect of NNRTIs and may occur during treatment with efavirenz.
