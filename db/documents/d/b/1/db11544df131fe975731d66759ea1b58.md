During the first 30 days of life, there are special considerations in planning a safe general anesthetic. To safely anesthetize a neonate, you must plan your setup, obtain any necessary special equipment in the operating room, decide on weight-based and appropriate anesthetic drugs for neonates, and make a plan to keep the neonate warm hang dextrose containing fluids. One should also make an appropriate plan and backup plan for intubation, position carefully, and calculate maximum allowable blood loss. Clear communication between the anesthesia and surgical team is key and will help guide neonatal anesthetic plans.
