An elevated level of chloride (over 60 mmol/L) in the sweat is diagnostic for cystic fibrosis, sweat chloride levels in less than 29mmol/L is normal. A level between 30 to 60 mmol/L is considered borderline, and repeat sweat test or further testing is required. This range may reflect a heterozygous carrier which cannot be accurately detected with sweat testing. The result of a positive newborn screen needs to be interpreted together with the sweat to test to reliably diagnose CF. Specific known mutations of CF do not cause elevated sweat chloride, and therefore sweat testing does not provide clarity.

Patients with a positive newborn screen and a negative sweat test sometimes receive diagnoses other than CF, such as CF-related metabolic syndrome (CRMS) and CF screen-positive, inconclusive diagnosis (CFSPID). A normal sweat chloride test does not exclude the diagnosis, in which case the clinician should pursue genotyping or other alternative diagnostic studies (such as nasal membrane potential difference, intestinal current measurement, semen analysis, or assessment of pancreatic function), especially if there is a high index of clinical suspicion for cystic fibrosis.
