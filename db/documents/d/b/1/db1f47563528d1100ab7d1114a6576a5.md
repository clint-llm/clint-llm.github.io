Fibrous papules are solitary, dome-shaped, skin-colored to red papules located on the central face, usually around the nose and on the malar eminences. They can have tiny telangiectatic vessels located on the surface of the papule. In TS, angiofibromas typically arise symmetrically on the cheeks, nasolabial folds, nose, and chin. They can start off as erythematous macules that form into the red to red-brown papules that can coalesce into plaques.

Pearly penile papules are pearly, white, dome-shaped, closely aggregated small papules located on the glans penis in a multilayered and circumferential manner on the corona.

Periungual angiofibromas begin to occur in TS in late childhood to early adulthood. They arise from the lateral or proximal nail fold and more commonly occur on the toes. They can be painful and can distort the shape of the nail.

Oral fibromas occur most commonly on the gingiva, but lesions can also occur on buccal or labial mucosa and occasionally the tongue.

Clinical findings in Birt-Hogg-Dube include fibrofolliculomas, perifollicular fibromas (some authorities consider perifollicular fibroma to be related to angiofibroma), and trichodiscomas. These are all present as skin colored to hypopigmented papules on the head and neck or upper trunk.
