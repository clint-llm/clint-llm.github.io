Blood pressure is a cardinal vital sign that guides acute and long-term clinical decision-making. Given its importance in directing care, measuring blood pressure accurately and consistently is essential.

In general, two values are recorded during the measurement of blood pressure. The first, systolic pressure, represents the peak arterial pressure during systole. The second, diastolic pressure, represents the minimum arterial pressure during diastole. Finally, a third value, mean arterial pressure, can be calculated from the systolic and diastolic pressures. The formula used is as follows:

- MAP = DP + 1/3 (SP - DP) or MAP = DP + 1/3 (PP)

- PP = pulse pressure

Another method of blood pressure measurement is in use, termed automated office BP (AOBP). The AOBP measurement assesses blood pressure after the patient has rested for five minutes, followed by a fully automated series of five readings over five minutes, with the patient resting quietly alone. This method helps providers get a reading that corresponds more closely with ambulatory-awake blood pressure readings, as it alleviates the possibility of white-coat hypertension.
