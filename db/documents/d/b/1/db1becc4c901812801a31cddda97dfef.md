The best initial investigation is an electrocardiogram, which should be done in all patients presenting with chest pain. The findings vary from normal EKG to ST-segment changes, which will resolve either spontaneously or with treatment. Serial cardiac troponin testing is also indicated to rule out myocardial infarction. In a case where there are no EKG changes, and patients have recurrent symptoms, ambulatory EKG can also be done to detect episodes of ST-segment elevation or depression with or without angina. Exercise has been shown to trigger spasm, so exercise testing can also be done to induce spasm once ECG and cardiac troponins have ruled out acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Stress tests combined with imaging will often yield perfusion defects/ ischemia in the territory of coronary artery suffering from spasmodic episodes. Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) will usually reveal non-obstructive coronaries, in which cases coronary functional testing via checking coronary flow reserve and coronary microvascular resistance is the next step, typically done by methods as fractional flow reserve (FFR), coronary flow reserve (CFR), instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR), and index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR). Provocative testing can be undertaken to look for coronary vasospasm.

Invasive coronary angiography with provocative testing is the gold standard for the diagnosis.
