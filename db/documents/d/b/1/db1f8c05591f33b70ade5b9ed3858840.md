Lowe syndrome is an extremely rare genetic disorder that follows an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. Affected males have not been reported to reproduce. De novo genetic mutations occur in about one-third of males affected by Lowe syndrome.

Genetic counseling is recommended for family members of the affected patient. Prenatal genetic testing is available to aid in counseling. Women with children affected by oculocerebrorenal syndrome should undergo prenatal genetic testing to assess for germline mosaicism.

Due to the plethora of systemic complications associated with Lowe syndrome, multidisciplinary evaluation and vigilant surveillance is essential. Parents with affected children should be educated on potential complications of hypotonia, such as feeding difficulties and delayed motor milestones from birth. Conduct disorders, particularly in the setting of low vision and intellectual impairment, can lead to self-destructive behaviors. Treatment includes behavior modification programs, individualized therapy, and antipsychotics.
