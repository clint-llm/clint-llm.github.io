While environmental factors likely play a role in disease prognosis, KCN is considered hereditary.

A peer-review literature search may reveal that the estimates for KCN incidence estimates may range between 50 and 230 per 100,000 (about 1 per 2,000).

More specific and sensitive diagnostic tools may allow subtle KCN forms to be detected in the future. New studies conducted internationally suggest a prevalence as high as 1:375 in some populations.
