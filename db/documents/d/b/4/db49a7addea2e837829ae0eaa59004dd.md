There is a vast amount of literature on marijuana and its health benefits. Unfortunately, the majority of these are anecdotal reports. Without clinical trials and a lack of a universal formula for marijuana, there appearÂ to be significant controversies in the clinical benefits of marijuana. All healthcare workers, including nurse practitioners and pharmacists, should educate patients that marijuana may not be the panacea for all medical disorders. To date, marijuana has been shown to improve appetite and reduce mild nausea. Until data from randomized clinical trials are available, the prescription of marijuana should be limited as more evidence seems to indicate that this product may not be entirely safe for long-term consumption.

In acute intoxication, triage nurses and emergency department physicians should maintain patent airway breathing and circulation. Psychiatrists should evaluate for the signs of psychosis and administer proper treatment. Similarly, critical care physicians should take care of the patient while in ICU. Finally, clinicians should refer patients with cannabis dependency to social workers. As depicted above, clinicians(MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), pharmacists, specialists, nurses, and other healthcare providers are involved in taking care of the patient and an interprofessional team approach will minimize the risk of substance use disorder.
