An estimated 1,197,704 violent crimes occurred nationwide in 2015, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting Program. Violent crimes are determined according to a Hierarchy Rule: murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. The collection, preservation, and forensic analysis of the evidence with most crimes are often critical in determining a person's guilt or a person's innocence. The forensic exam is beneficial to law enforcement and the medical setting to provide a comprehensive medical forensic examination with the collection of evidence knowing the patient's body is the crime scene. Evidence must be identified, collected, packaged, secured, and maintained correctly, then released to Law Enforcement following a strict chain of custody rules so that it can be analyzed appropriately and used later in legal proceedings. When collecting evidence, the examiner must wear gloves at all times and change them often utilizing the clean technique. Following proper collection, handling, and storage of evidence will reduce the possibility of cross-contamination or degradation of DNA.
