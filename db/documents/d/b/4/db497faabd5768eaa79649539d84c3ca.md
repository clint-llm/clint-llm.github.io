The stone formation, urinary tract infection (UTI), and malignancies can be caused by urine stasis in the diverticula, leading to chronic inflammation. The overall occurrence of tumors in the diverticula ranges from 2 to 10%, and the prognosis is usually poor due to the lack of a smooth muscle layer. The lack of the muscularis propria layer may predispose interdiverticular tumors to bladder wall infiltration and possible dissemination to other organs in principle; nevertheless, the aggressiveness of these tumors, their likelihood of spreading, and their clinical consequences are all uncertain.

Urothelial cell carcinoma is the most common kind of cancer in those diverticula, preceded by squamous cell carcinoma. Usually, those patients' age is between 65 and 75.
