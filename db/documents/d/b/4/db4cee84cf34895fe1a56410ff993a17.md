Most patients who have used a noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation device before need a little education about the device. It is the patient who has never used the device before or the ones that are anxious who will need help to ensure that they do not "fight" the device. The full face mask devices can cause some claustrophobe feelings for patients. Education and coaching from the medical provider are important for the patient to become comfortable and use the device.  When dealing with a patient that is in an acute respiratory distress situation the prehospital provider will need to assemble the NIPPV device quickly. Ensure that the device is attached to a properly filled oxygen source because the majority of the devices will use a large amount of oxygen (refer to specific manufacturers devices) in a short period of time. Initially, just apply the mask to the face of the patient and coach them to take in deep breaths.  Once the patient can tolerate the mask, then you can apply the head strap. Reassess the patient frequently for improvement in their respiratory status, lung sounds and how well they are tolerating the device.
