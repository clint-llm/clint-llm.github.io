Dental infections originate in the tooth or its supporting structures and can spread to the surrounding tissue. Dental infections were, historically, a common cause of death. Fortunately, due to improved dental hygiene, modern dentistry, and antibiotics, dental infections are rarely life-threatening today. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of dental infections and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of dental infections.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with a dental infection.
- Summarize the treatment options available for dental infections.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving coordination and communication to advance care for patients with dental infection and improve outcomes.
