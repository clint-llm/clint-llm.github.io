The etiology of depression is multifactorial and complex resulting from interactions between biological vulnerabilities and environmental factors.

**Genes and Heritability**

A meta-analysis found that heritability is a main risk factor for mental health concerns, including depression, between ages 13 and 35.

Offspring of depressed parents have an increased risk of 2 to 4 times compared with offspring of healthy parents. Genes-environmental interaction contributes to this risk, specifically by increasing susceptibility to environmental stress.

**Psychosocial Risk Factors**

Stressful life events often precede the onset and recurrence of depressive symptoms and episodes in adolescents, especially with girls.

**Cognitive Risk Factors**

Depressed adolescents have an attentional bias and a memory bias. They recall more negative and fewer positive words than a non-depressed adolescent.

**Other Factors**

- Sleep problems such as shorter rapid eye movement (REM) latency, higher REM density, decreased sleep efficiency, and higher frontal slow-wave activity were associated with the development of depression

- Co-morbid medical illness: Epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and others

- Other mental illness: Anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

- Medications: Corticosteroids, interferons, mefloquine, progestin-releasing implanted contraceptives, and propranolol

- Substance use: Alcohol
