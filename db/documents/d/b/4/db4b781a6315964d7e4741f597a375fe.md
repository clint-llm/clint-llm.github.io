- The obturator internus muscle is the lateral border of the ischiorectal fossae.

- The levator ani is the superior boundary of the anal triangle. It functions to support and raise the pelvic floor. Levator ani consists of the puborectalis, pubococcygeus, and iliococcygeus muscles.

- The coccygeus muscle also supports and raises the pelvic floor.

- The internal anal sphincter is comprised of involuntary smooth muscle. It is a continuation of the circular muscle of the rectum.

- The longitudinal muscle layer of the rectum combines with some fibers of the levator ani muscle to form the conjoined longitudinal muscle.

- The external anal sphincter consists of voluntary skeletal muscle. It divides into three parts: subcutaneous, superficial, and deep.
