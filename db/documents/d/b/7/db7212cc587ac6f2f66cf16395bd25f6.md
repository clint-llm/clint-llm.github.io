By definition, to diagnose idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension, all other causes of elevated pulmonary artery pressures must be ruled out. A clinician should start with the least invasive testing before pursuing the right heart catheterization, which cinches the diagnosis of pulmonary artery hypertension. Serological testing should focus on ruling out connective tissue disease (scleroderma, systemic sclerosis, lupus), HIV, cirrhotic liver disease causing pulmonary hypertension, and schistosomiasis.

Electrocardiogram (ECG), chest radiography, and pulmonary function tests may provide important clues to diagnosing pulmonary hypertension, though none of these modalities provide enough sensitivity or specificities to serve as a screening tool. On ECG, right-axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy are observable 79% and 87% of the time. Chest radiographic findings of increased pulmonary vascular pressure include attenuated vascular markings and enlargement of the main and hilar pulmonary arteries. Patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension may have mild reductions in total lung capacity (TLC) and forced vital capacity (FVC). The diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLco) is also significantly less in patients with IPAH. Measurement of oxygen saturation during sleep and exercise must be part of the workup for patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension, as the slightest degree of hypoxia may induce further pulmonary artery vasoconstriction propagating hypertension.

The echo-doppler is the first test to obtain on patients with suspected elevated pulmonary artery pressure.Â The echo-doppler is useful as a screening tool; however, it is only 50% accurate in estimating PASP. The variability of determining PASP on echo-doppler is due to dynamic changes in volume status of a patient (causing changes in vena cava diameter, therefore different estimates of right atrial pressure), doppler probe positioning, and variability in estimating peak jet velocity. Estimating PASP with Doppler echocardiography to make a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension should be in conjunction with an overall Doppler examination of the heart as some patients may have underestimated PASP yet have right ventricular dilation or dysfunction. The role of exercise echocardiography in identifying or prognosticating patients with PAH remains controversial.

A right heart catheterization is necessary to diagnose pulmonary artery hypertension (as opposed to pulmonary hypertension). This intervention gives a complete hemodynamic assessment, including measurement of pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and transpulmonary and diastolic pressure gradients. Left heart catheterization is often pursued in the same setting because left heart filling pressures may lead to an alternate cause of elevated pulmonary artery pressures (left heart failure causing pulmonary venous congestion).

The fifth world symposium on PAH defines pulmonary hypertension as a mean PAP greater than 20 mmHg at rest. Pulmonary artery hypertension is defined by mean PAP greater than 20 mmHg at rest and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) less than 15 mmHg, and peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) greater than 3 Woods units.
