Several organs play a role in edema. The lymphatic systemÂ drives fluid and protein away from the interstitium, and a system of fine lymphatics provide a network of channels throughout the body via lymph nodes to the thoracic duct. Valves function in the lymphatic system to provide a one-way outflow. As fluid moves through the body, it undergoes excretion through the kidneys, lungs, feces, sweat, and skin. Therefore, a variety of organs may be involved in situations of fluid overload.

Capillary dynamics is critically different in the vasculature of various organs.

Alveolar capillaries also have a lower capillary hydraulic pressure, which is due to perfusion from the low pressures in the right ventricle. Alveolar capillaries are also more permeable than skeletal muscle to protein, resulting in smaller transcapillary hydraulic and oncotic pressure gradients.

Kidneys also play a critical role in edema. The renal sodium and water retention seen in heart failure and cirrhosis result from a hypovolemic-induced fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and increased tubular reabsorption.
