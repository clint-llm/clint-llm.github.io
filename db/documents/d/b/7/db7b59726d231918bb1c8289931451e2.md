The thyroid is an endocrine gland located just below the cricoid cartilage in the neck, and it is composed of both the right and the left lobes separated by an isthmus. The thyroid gland functions to produce the thyroid hormone, which is needed by the body to carry out different metabolism. Follicles comprise the thyroid and are the functional and structural units of the gland.

Up to half of follicular carcinoma cases show RAS point mutations, while one-third may show PAX-PPAR-gamma rearrangements, and only 3% show both.
