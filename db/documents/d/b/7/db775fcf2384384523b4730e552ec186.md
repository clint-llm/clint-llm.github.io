Pathogenesis is not entirely clear. Aortic and mitral valves are the two most common locations of Lambl excrescences. However, ischemic events were more commonly observed in association with the ones on aortic valves as com­pared to mitral valves. It is postulated that due to high stress from blood-flow jets causing shearing forces and trauma on the heart valves endocardium develops occasional tears. These tears occur on the valvular cusps at the coaptation site followed by fibrin deposition and small thrombi formation on endothelial injury and subsequent overgrowth of endothelium over extended periods of time with advancing age.

The pathogenesis of embolic phenomena causing distal organ ischemia and injury such as ischemic stroke, acute coronary syndrome, or pulmonary embolism remains unclear. While the possibility of Lambl excrescences breaking off and embolizing seems obvious; however, fragments of broken valvular strands are not usually seen in the target arteries of distal organs. There is substantial evidence suggesting only an association between Lambl excrescences and embolic events such as ischemic strokes and coronary syndromes. However, a direct causal relationship is not yet established.
