Ultraviolet radiation is strongly associated with DNA mutations and the development of melanoma.

BRAF is an oncogene often altered in melanomas. The most common BRAF mutation in this setting leads to theÂ p.V600E protein substitution, expecially in the low-CSD (cumulative ssun damage) group.

NF1, NRAS, BRAF (non-V600E mutations), KIT are commonly altered in the high-CSD group.

TERT is commonly altered in the promotor region and is related to both groups.

CDKN2A is the gene encoding for p16 protein and is frequently altered in melanomas. p16 is an oncosoppressor and is inhibited during melanoma carcinogenesis either directly or indirectly.
