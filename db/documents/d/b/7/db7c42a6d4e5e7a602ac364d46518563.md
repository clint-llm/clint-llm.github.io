There is no specific treatment for night terrors other than comforting the child. Reassurance and education for the parents or guardians are strongly encouraged especially to ensure the safety of the child during a night terror.

If there is excessive stress or conflict in the child’s life, a combination of therapy and coping techniques can be recommended to help decrease the frequency of episodes. Medication administration is strongly discouraged and not indicated.

Rarely is a sleep study ever indicated since the prognosis of night terrors is good and self-limiting; however, there is developing research involving scheduled awakenings through the night with a vibration machine to help improve quality of life.
