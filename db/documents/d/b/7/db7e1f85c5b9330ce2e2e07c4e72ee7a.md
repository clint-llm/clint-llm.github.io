Eyes allow visualization of the world by receiving and processing the energy of light as it enters the eye. This light interacts with the structures and nerves of the eye to create images. Adjustments via the muscles connected to the lens, ciliary bodies, and muscles that make up the iris are stimulated by several nerves. This is known as the pupillary light reflex. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of the abnormal pupillary light reflex and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with abnormal pupillary reflexes.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the mechanism of pupillary light reflex.
- Describe the different pathologies associated with abnormal pupillary light reflexes.
- Review the management considerations for patients with pathological pupillary light reflex abnormalities.
- Explain the potential clinical impact that the early detection of an abnormal pupillary light reflex can have on a patient, and how the systematic approach could help evaluate and treat patients with abnormal pupillary reflexes to improve outcomes.
