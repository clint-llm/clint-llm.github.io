The pathogenesis of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is poorly understood. There is evidence supporting a direct cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy as the initial trigger in neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis pathophysiology. For instance, intradermal bleomycin injections caused pathologic changes consistent with those seen in neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis. Interestingly, patients with malignancies who develop neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis typically do so after their first course of chemotherapy.

One proposed mechanism emphasizes the direct cytotoxic effect of the offending agent. The release of toxic byproducts secondary to cell death promotes neutrophil recruitment to the eccrine glands, while another model suggests that neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is a reactive process in response to an underlying malignancy (paraneoplastic phenomenon). Another model suggests abnormal neutrophil response and function in response to some offending agent (drug versus malignancy).
