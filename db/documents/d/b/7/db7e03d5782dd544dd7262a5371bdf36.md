The differential diagnosis of vitamin B6 toxicity is broad and includes deficiency or toxicity of other vitamins, including vitamin B12 as the symptoms are similar. Other causes of peripheral neuropathy merit consideration include diabetes mellitus, autoimmune disorders (lupus), chronic liver disease, end-stage liver disease, HIV/AIDS, hypothyroidism, Lyme disease, lymphoma, monoclonal gammopathy, syphilis, porphyria, drugs (amiodarone, digoxin, lithium, isoniazid), and toxins (heavy metals, ethanol, organophosphates). Exposure history and the temporal course will help differentiate many of these etiologies.Â  Additional laboratory testing and nerve conduction velocity studies may also be helpful.
