In congenital subglottic stenosis, symptoms usually appear shortly after birth. The main symptoms are biphasic stridor, dyspnea, air hunger and suprasternal, intercostal, and diaphragmatic retractions. Abnormal cry, aphonia, or hoarseness occur when the vocal cords are affected. In acquired subglottic stenosis, there is a history of laryngeal insult, and symptoms usually occur 3 to 4 weeks after the insult.
