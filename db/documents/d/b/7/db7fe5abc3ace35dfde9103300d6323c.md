The falx cerebri receives its innervation from all three branches of the trigeminal nerve and receives sympathetic fibers predominantly from the superior cervical ganglia.Â  Additionally, the falx may receive additional innervation from the dorsal rami of cervical nerves 1,2, and 3, the hypoglossal nerve, and recurrent branches of the vagus nerve.
