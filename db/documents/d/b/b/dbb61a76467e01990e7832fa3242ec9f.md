The goals of postoperative surveillance are to detect locoregional recurrence and manage any treatment complications that may arise. Surgery and radiation can result in long-term swallowing difficulties (xerostomia, mucositis, trismus) as well as cosmetic defects from facial nerve paralysis. Early intervention for facial nerve reconstruction and rehabilitation, as well as consultation with speech pathologists for swallowing difficulties, are vital for allowing the patient to re-integrate as much as possible into their pre-treatment functional status and improve quality of life.

Over 70% of recurrences occur within the first 3 years of treatment, except for low-grade malignancies and adenoid cystic carcinoma.Â According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for post-treatment surveillance, patients should receive regular follow up every 1 to 3 months in the 1 year after treatment, every 2-6 months in the 2 years, every 4-8 months in the 3 to 5 years, and every 12 months after the 5 years.
