Several inherited macular dystrophies have a clinical appearance similar to STGD1. Distinguishing between these similar-appearing conditions is essential for prognostication, systemic associations, and genetic counseling.

**Pattern Dystrophy (PD)**

Marmor and Byers first proposed the term “pattern dystrophy” for a spectrum of characteristic fundus patterns (butterfly, reticular pigmentary). It is the most common masquerade for STGD1.

**Autosomal Dominant Stargardt-like Macular Dystrophies**

These include variants associated with the ELOVL4 and the PROM1 genes.

**Batten Disease/Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis**

It is a rare metabolic disease caused by defects in the processing of lysosomal storage. This leads to apoptosis of both the photoreceptor (retina) and the neuronal (brain) cells. The life expectancy of these patients is usually 20-30 years. A large number of children present to the ophthalmologist with vision loss. These patients present with early-onset visual loss and severe color vision deficiency.

The disease progression is usually rapid. Ocular examination shows vascular attenuation and optic disc pallor. OCT reveals thinned retinal nerve fiber layer, while dark-adapted (DA) full-field ERG shows an absent or electronegative wave. High suspicion should be maintained in young patients diagnosed with severe STGD1 with rapid progression.

**Maternally Inherited Diabetes and Deafness (MIDD)**

These patients present in the third to seventh decade. Ocular examination shows pigmentary changes at the macula, areas of RPE atrophy, and fleck-like deposits. FAF shows hyperautofluorescent spots with corresponding subretinal deposits on OCT. The patients have distinguishing features like personal or family history of early-onset diabetes mellitus and hearing loss. Other distinguishing features include the absence of a dark choroid on FFA and the presence of outer retinal tubulations on OCT.

**Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD)**

It can mimic the late-onset STGD1, as the flecks may be mistaken for drusens. A careful examination can help distinguish the two as drusens tend to become confluent toward the center of the macula. Flecks show intense hyper AF while drusens may be mild hyperautofluorescent or even hypoautofluorescent.
