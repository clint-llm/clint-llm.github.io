Lymph nodes can enlarge in response to numerous etiologies, including malignancy, infections, and autoimmune disease.

Infections can be thought of as local or systemic, or classified according to the causative organism. While a significant proportion of lymphadenopathy occurs as a result of bacterial and viral infections, it is important not to forget parasitic infections. Lymphatic filariasis is said to be one of the leading causes of disfigurement and the second most common reason behind permanent disability in the world.

It has been noted that axillary lymphadenopathy is usually due to infectious conditions like sarcoidosis, cat scratch disease, Staphylococcal, and Streptococcal skin infections, or malignancies like breast cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma.

In breast cancer cases, it is essential to note the number of lymph nodes involved, as the prognosis is worst (in case of relapse) if four or more axillary lymph nodes are involved.  Thus axillary metastasis is not only a marker of diagnosis but also indicates its aggressive phenotype.

The radiological examination of the axillary group of lymph nodes in the case of breast cancers is possible by the computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) that gives high-resolution images. The ultrasound is good to detect morphological abnormalities such as hilar infiltration, cortical thickening, peripheral vascularization, and destruction of the kidney-shaped appearance.
