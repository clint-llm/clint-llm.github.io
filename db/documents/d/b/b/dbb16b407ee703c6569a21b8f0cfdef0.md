Additional components for consideration in trauma resuscitation are to minimize the use of crystalloid fluid due to the potential for increasing the inflammatory response. Studies have also shown early use of blood products improve outcomes in trauma patients.

Choices of fluid for septic shock resuscitation vary. Crystalloids are the fluids of choice in septic shock resuscitation, but no crystalloid solution is specifically favorable over the other due to a lack of evidence of direct comparisons in septic shock patients.
