**Common Reactions**

Flushing: Niacin often causes generalized pruritus, and a burning sensation is usually limited to the face and chest and lasts 20 to 30 minutes. This adverse reaction, however, decreases in frequency and severity with time.

One reaction to consider is niacin’s effects (whether used alone or combined with statin medications) on glycemic control in patients with dyslipidemia, regardless of their diabetes mellitus status. In non-diabetic patients with dyslipidemia, on average, five years of niacin therapy, whether used alone or in laropiprant combination therapy, was associated with a 34% increased risk of developing diabetes.

Other adverse effects include hyperuricemia, gastrointestinal disorders, rash, increased homocysteine levels, hypotension, dyspepsia, elevations in AST and ALT, nausea, vomiting, and paresthesias.

**Serious Adverse Reactions**

Peptic ulcer disease, arrhythmias, anaphylaxis, hepatotoxicity, hepatic necrosis, fulminant, macular edema
