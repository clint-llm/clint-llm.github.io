All patients who have hydatidiform mole should be up for hCG surveillance and monitoring. Surveillance protocols differ from one country to another, but principles are the same. In the United Kingdom (UK), serum and urine hCG levels are measured every two weeks until the values come to normal range, then urine hCG levels are measured monthly. Patients who achieve normal hCG values within 56 days of uterine evacuation have a low risk of developing a malignant disease and are further monitored for six months from the evacuation date. If the first hCG reading was normal after 56 days, monitoring every month should continue for the next six months.

During the hCG follow-up period, patients are advised to use reliable contraception, including a combination of methods. After finishing hCG monitoring, serum or urine hCG concentrations should be measured six weeks and ten weeks after every pregnancy to ensure there is no reactivation of a previous molar disease.

Follow up following evacuation of a hydatidiform mole is vital to detect trophoblastic sequelae (invasive mole or choriocarcinoma), which occurs in nearly 15 to 20% with complete mole and 1 to 5% with partial mole.
