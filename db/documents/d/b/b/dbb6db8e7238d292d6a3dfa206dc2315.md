While the exact incidence of xeroderma is not known, it commonly affects both males and females of all age groups. Studies have shown that there is an increased prevalence in older patients, particularly over the age of 60 years. Moreover, it is commonly seen in those with underlying diseases (i.e., diabetes mellitus, renal failure, hypothyroidism, etc.) or in those taking associated medications.

Xeroderma may occur alone, in the setting of other dermatologic conditions (i.e., atopic dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, etc.), or in individuals with a family history of dry skin.
