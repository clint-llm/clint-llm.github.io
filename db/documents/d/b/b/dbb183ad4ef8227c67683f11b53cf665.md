The incidence of external iliac artery agenesis remains unknown since the condition only manifests itself when symptomatic. In the congenital absence of an external iliac artery, compensatory blood flow patterns provide arterial perfusion to the lower extremity. The most common anatomy observed in these cases involves the distal internal iliac artery being continuous with the common femoral artery. Descriptions of an external iliac artery with an unusual, deep pelvic course may also represent a form of agenesis.

Arterial coiling occurs most frequently in the carotid arteries as a result of excessive elongation related to aging. Coiling rarely occurs in peripheral arteries such as the external iliac. Corkscrew external iliac arteries have been reported.

Corona Mortis is a vascular connection between the obturator and external iliac or inferior epigastric vessels that occurs in 9.8% of patients.
