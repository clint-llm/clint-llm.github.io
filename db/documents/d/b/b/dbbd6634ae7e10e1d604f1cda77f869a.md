The first objective, post-diagnosis of T-PLL, is to determine the disease activity. A "watch and wait" attitude is appropriate for those few patients with inactive disease. However, this is tempered by the fact that these individuals will progress shortly to active disease. It is, therefore, best to approach all patients in both a preparatory and anticipatory mode. A number of preparations should begin concurrently in anticipation of the rapid progress of T-PLL. Patients should undergo screening for their eligibility in clinical trials. Simultaneously, patients can undergo a CMV status check, and their siblings begin HLA typing, the former regarding alemtuzumab therapy and the latter for allogeneic bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant would become especially important if the patine obtains a CR on Alemtuzumab. These preparations are best done concurrently, NOT sequentially.
