Peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK) is an inflammatory condition and affects the juxtalimbal cornea. There is a complex interplay between host autoimmunity, the anatomy and physiology of the peripheral cornea, and the environment. The underlying cause could be local or systemic, infectious or noninfectious. Progressive stromal lysis can cause corneal perforation, which is an emergency. PUK occurring in patients with an underlying autoimmune disease indicate significant morbidity and mortality. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of peripheral ulcerative keratitis and describes the role of the healthcare team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of peripheral ulcerative keratitis. 
- Describe the risk factors for developing peripheral ulcerative keratitis.
- Summarise the classic patient history, presentation, and physical examination findings associated with peripheral ulcerative keratitis.
- Describe the management considerations and goals for patients with peripheral ulcerative keratitis.
