Dental anxiety affects children and adults, and its prevalence has been reported in the literature as approximately 20% in various population-based studies. As a result, patients can develop avoidance tendencies, potentially leading to poor dental health. This severe form of dental anxiety has been found to affect approximately 5% of the general population. When non-pharmacological anxiety management methods are insufficient, conscious sedation becomes extremely useful.

Drugs used in conscious sedation can be titrated to achieve the desired balance between the procedure's safety, the operator's ability to facilitate the required treatment, and the patient's anxiolysis needs[4].

It is important to remember that adequate local anesthesia must be administered with sedative drugs. The clinician must not compensate for poor insufficient local anesthesia by deepening levels of sedation due to the potential complications associated with deep sedation, including increased morbidity and mortality. When a trained operator delivers conscious sedation effectively, it is a safe alternative to general anesthesia, which helps to reduce waiting list times and eliminate the complications associated with having a general anesthetic.
