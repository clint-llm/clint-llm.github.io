Multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms predispose to a reflux diathesis in patients with Barrett's esophagus. A decrease in the lower esophageal sphincter tone increases the reflux of both acidic and bile in the distal esophagus. The presence of a hiatal hernia can serve as a pocket for gastric acid, increasing distal esophageal acid exposure. Ineffective esophageal motility and gastric acid hypersecretion are also potential causes of increased esophageal acid exposure. The frequency and interplay of these mechanisms differ among patients.

Animal studies suggested that transcommitment is the principal pathogenic mechanism in Barett's esophagus. Transcommitment highlighted how the esophageal stem cells that normally differentiate into squamous cells differentiate into abnormal columnar cells in response to injury. Subsequently, circulating bone marrow stem cells were shown as precursors of Barrett's epithelium. Most recently, the migration of cells from the gastric cardia has been shown to be responsible for metaplasia of the distal esophagus. However, the true mechanism of metaplastic change is still unknown.
