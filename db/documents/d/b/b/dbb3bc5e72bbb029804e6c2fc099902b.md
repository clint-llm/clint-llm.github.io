Proteins C and S are glycoproteins synthesized in the liver, which function to maintain the physiologic function of coagulation within the body. When mutated or dysfunctional, they can cause symptoms of blood clotting in all ages, with onset from birth to late adulthood. These thrombophilias prompt care from interprofessional healthcare teams, which include primary care providers, hematologists, nurses, and pharmacists.

This team-based approach provides an integrated, evidence-based strategy to treat patients with symptomatic thrombophilias and monitor asymptomatic thrombophilias. The interprofessional team should be up-to-date with the latest management guidelines for anticoagulation use and regularly monitor the INR to maintain therapeutic ranges. Patients should be educated on their disease, medication compliance, and factors that may interfere with medication to cause sub-therapeutic or toxic levels. Genetic counseling should be offered to at-risk patients with a history of thrombophilia or a family history of the disease. The interprofessional team should be able to inform their patients about the risk and probability of the condition being transmitted to offspring.

The care of protein C and protein S deficiency is most beneficial when managed in an interprofessional team strategy to form a therapeutic alliance and enhance patient-centered care to achieve the desired outcome.
