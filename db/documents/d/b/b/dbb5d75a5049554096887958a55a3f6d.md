Tacrolimus is a medication used in the prevention and treatment of solid-organ transplant rejection. It is in the calcineurin-inhibitor class of medications. This activity outlines the indications, action, and contraindications for tacrolimus as a valuable agent in preventing solid-organ transplant rejection (and other disorders when applicable). This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the management and care of patients post solid-organ transplant.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the medical indications for tacrolimus use.
- Outline the potential adverse effects of tacrolimus.
- Summarize the appropriate monitoring parameters for efficacy and toxicity of tacrolimus.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of patients on tacrolimus, and improve patient outcomes.
