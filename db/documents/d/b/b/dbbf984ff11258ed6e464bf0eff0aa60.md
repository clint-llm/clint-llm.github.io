Renal calculi are the products of crystallization of specific stone-forming components seen in about 10% of people, and 80% of these are calcium stones.

The acute management of renal calculi has been well studied and standardized.

Among urinary chemicals, oxalate is the single strongest promotor of renal calculi. Kidney stone risk increases 2.5 to 3.5 times when the urinary oxalate level increases from 20 mg a day to 40 mg. Even relatively small changes in urinary oxalate can have a very significant impact on kidney stone production.
