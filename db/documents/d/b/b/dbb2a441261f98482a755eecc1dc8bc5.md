Nicks procedure is performed to avoid patient prosthesis mismatch in patients with the small aortic annulus. The main goal is to implant a prosthetic valve with an indexed effective orifice area of at least 0.85 cm2/m2. This activity reviews the management and surgical options of small aortic annulus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the position of the excision of the noncoronary leaflet of the aortic valve.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to the Nicks procedure.
- Review appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and their clinical significance with aortic root enlargement.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance Nicks procedure and improve outcomes.
