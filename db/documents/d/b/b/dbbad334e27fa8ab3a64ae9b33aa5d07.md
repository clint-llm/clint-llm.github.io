In general, neurodevelopmental outcomes in congenital hypothyroidism (CH) are excellent. Early and adequate therapy initiation, prior to 2nd week of life, will result in an appropriate global intelligence. However, mild or subtle deficits in verbal skills, attention, memory, or motor development may be observed, particularly in those with severe CH. The severity of CH and pretreatment T4 level are important predictors of adverse cognitive and motor outcomes.
