Parents should immediately seek further evaluation if the child has: an undiagnosed pigmented lesion, more than six CALMs, CALMs and nodules on the skin, CALMs and a learning/language/developmental delay, and family members with multiple CALMs or a diagnosis of NF1.

For a patient diagnosed with NF2, annual history and physical examination should be done that includes cutaneous, ophthalmology, and audiology examination. Beginning at 10 years of age, annual brain MRI should be done for early detection of tumors associated with NF2.

Most children diagnosed with NF1 may suffer from learning difficulties, writing problems, and attention difficulties. Parents should be given education about these problems and ways to handle them. Rehabilitation programs should be considered for more serious ones.
