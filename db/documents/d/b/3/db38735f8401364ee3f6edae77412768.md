The mechanisms our bodies utilize to heal wounds are relatively well understood and involves complex interactions between inflammatory mediators and cells. Wounds can be left to fill in on their own through secondary intention, or the wound edges can be approximated with sutures, staples, or other tools which allow the wound to heal by primary intention.

Immediately after the damage occurs, the healing process begins. Injured tissue is repaired, missing tissue replaced, and the epithelial layer restored. Keratinocytes, fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, and immune cells all play important roles to support inflammation, cell migration, and angiogenesis.

A superficial laceration confined to the epidermal layer heals quickly and regenerates from adnexal appendages such as hair follicles, sweat, and sebaceous glands housed in the dermal layer. This method of repair is relatively quick and takes mere days. More extensive injuries that involve the dermis require much more time to heal and leave a noticeable scar.
