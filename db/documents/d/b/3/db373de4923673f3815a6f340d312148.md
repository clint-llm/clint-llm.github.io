Enhancement of healthcare team outcomes on CBS primarily revolves around primary care working with interdisciplinary fields such as ophthalmology, neurology, and psychiatry. When patients can be appropriately assessed and meet diagnostic criteria for CBS, providing education and reassurance on the condition is often all that is needed to reduce anxiety, concerns, and other adverse outcomes related to CBS.

Interprofessional care coordination is also necessary for managing CBS. Pharmacists can provide information regarding potential medication causes for the patient's presentation. Nurses can assist with examinations, perform patient counseling, and serve as care coordinators among various practitioners.

All interprofessional team members are tasked with providing accurate records of their interactions and interventions with the patient. They need to be empowered to contact other team members if they have any concerns about the patient's condition or note any status changes. This interprofessional model will provide the best opportunity for a positive outcome. [Level 5]
