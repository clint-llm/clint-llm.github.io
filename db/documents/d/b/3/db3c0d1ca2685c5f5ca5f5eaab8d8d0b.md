A coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) is defined as 100% occlusion of a coronary artery for a duration of greater than or equal to 3 months based on angiographic evidence. The TIMI (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction) flow grading system is a scoring classification from 0-3 referring to the levels of coronary blood flow assessed during coronary angiography. The TIMI flow grading system is as below

- TIMI 0 flow (no perfusion-complete occlusion) - the absence of any forward flow beyond a coronary occlusion.

- TIMI 1 flow (penetration without perfusion) - faint forward flow beyond the occlusion, associated with an incomplete filling of the distal coronary bed.

- TIMI 2 flow (partial reperfusion) - delayed forward flow with complete filling of the distal coronary bed.

- TIMI 3 flow (full perfusion) - normal flow, which fills the distal coronary bed.

A "true" CTO is defined as 100% occlusion of a coronary artery with TIMI 0 flow; whereas a "functional" CTO is defined as severely stenotic, yet, less than a 100% occlusion of the coronary artery with TIMI 1 flow for a duration of greater than or equal to 3 months based on angiographic evidence.
