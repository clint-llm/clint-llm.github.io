Most of the available penicillins have a short half-life, less than an hour mostly. Administration of the parenteral agents is every four hours, usually when treating serious systemic infections with normal renal function. Piperacillin and ampicillin require dose adjustment when given in patients with renal insufficiency (GFR less than 10 ml/min). Other agents like nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, and dicloxacillin have the hepato-biliary mode of excretion and therefore require no modification in renal impairment.

All penicillins achieve therapeutic levels in pleural, pericardial, peritoneal, synovial fluids, and urine. Of note, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration is poor in the absence of inflammation but achieves therapeutic levels in meningitis.
