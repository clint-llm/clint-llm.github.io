The disease needs to be differentiated from central retinal vein occlusion and diabetic retinopathy.

In central retinal vein occlusion, the veins are dilated and tortuous, and usually have flame shaped superficial hemorrhages in all quadrants, microaneurysms and hard exudates are not as common at the posterior pole, there can be the presence of optico-ciliary shunts at the disc with disc edema. Central retinal artery perfusion pressure is normal, and on fundus fluorescein angiography, there is a delay in arterio-venous transit time with staining of veins in late phase and pooling of dye at macula suggestive of edema.

In patients with diabetic retinopathy, the pathological changes are seen at posterior pole with dilated and beaded vessels, dot and blot, flame-shaped hemorrhages, and microaneurysm with leaking hard exudates. On fluorescein angiography, there is no delay in arterio-venous transit time. There will be leaking microaneurysms and edema, leaking neovascularisation can be noted.
