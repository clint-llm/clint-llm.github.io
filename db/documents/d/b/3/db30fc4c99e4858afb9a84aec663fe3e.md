The diagnosis and management of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is with an interprofessional team consisting of a cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, electrophysiologist, internist, primary care provider and the nurse practitioner. There are several treatments for the disorder. Besides pharmaological therapy, some patients may benefit from surgery. The surgical options include a mitral valve replacement, left ventricular myomectomy, pacemaker or AICD insertion or a heart transplant. The outcomes of these patients is good as long as they remain compliant with treatment. Unfortunately, even after treatment many continue to have atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. For those untreated, sudden death may be the first symptom.
