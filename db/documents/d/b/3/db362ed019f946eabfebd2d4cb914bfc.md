All infants born to mothers with a history of genital HSV have surface and mucosal cultures performed at 24 hours of life and also a blood HSV PCR. If these studies are negative, and the infant is asymptomatic, the infant may be discharged with the mother. Infants born to mothers with active genital lesions and having a prior history of HSV, whether it be C-section or vaginal delivery, are to be screened with mucosal  HSV cultures, blood for HSV PCR.
