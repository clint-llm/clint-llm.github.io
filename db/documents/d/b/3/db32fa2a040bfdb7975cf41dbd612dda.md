# Continuing Education Activity

Psychiatric symptoms are a common comorbid feature of hypothalamic hamartoma with epilepsy. They are most disabling and are a significant challenge for the patient and their families. Most commonly, psychiatric symptoms present with externalizing behaviors such as aggression and rage attacks. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and management of psychiatric symptoms and discusses the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of hypothalamic hamartoma with epilepsy.
- Outline the typical presentation of psychiatric symptoms in patients with hypothalamic hamartoma and epilepsy.
- Describe the treatment and management of psychiatric symptoms in patients with hypothalamic hamartoma and epilepsy.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination, collaboration, and communication amongst an interprofessional team members to enhance care for patients with psychiatric symptoms associated with hypothalamic hamartoma and epilepsy.

# Introduction

Hypothalamic hamartomas are benign congenital tumors that arise from the ventral hypothalamus.

The intrahypothalamic subtype of hypothalamic hamartoma, in particular, is also associated with neurobehavioral comorbidity, including cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms.

Psychiatric symptoms are a common comorbid feature of hypothalamic hamartoma with epilepsy.

# Etiology

A hamartoma is a discrete lesion that resembles a neoplasm but often arises from an errant organ and contains atypical portions of tissue elements.

Hypothalamic hamartoma develops in the fifth to sixth week of gestation that appears in and/or around the hypothalamus arising from infundibular recess and mammillary bodies. There is a theory that a defect in the fetal development of the hypothalamus results in the development of the tumor. Pathologically hypothalamic hamartoma consists of mature neurons and glial cells with a range in size from 10 to 30 mm.

The cause of hypothalamic hamartoma remains unknown. Cases are usually sporadic with no identified family history, and the patient remains the only affected individual. classically presents with hypothalamic hamartoma and polydactyly.

# Epidemiology

The estimated prevalence of hypothalamic hamartoma with epilepsy is 1 case per 50000 to 100000 in children and adolescents.

# History and Physical

The clinical presentation of hypothalamic hamartomas depends on their region of attachment to the hypothalamus.

Parahypothalmic hamartomas, also known as pedunculated, occur in the anterior hypothalamus arising from the inferior surface of the hypothalamus, tuber cinereum. This subtype of hypothalamic hamartoma is associated with central precocious puberty.

Conversely, intrahypothalamic hamartomas, also know as ‘sessile’ occur in the posterior hypothalamus with an attachment level at the mamillary bodies.

Cognitive impairment can present as language delay with learning disabilities. Behavioral disorders are associated more commonly with hypothalamic hamartomas and gelastic seizures. These include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (75%), aggressiveness, anxiety oppositional defiant disorders (83.3%), and conduct disorders (33.3%).

Patients with gelastic seizures present with affective aggression. The definition of affective aggression is as being out of control, damaging one's property, physical harm to oneself, aggressive without a purpose, aggressive with stronger children when aggressive, and express remorse after aggression. Some children also present with predatory aggression. Predatory aggression includes the ability to control their behavior when aggressive, protects oneself when aggressive, fights with weaker children, and tries to get something out from being aggressive. More commonly, patients with hypothalamic hamartomas and gelastic seizures support affective aggression. These aggressive episodes arise quite suddenly and are not motivated by ill will towards the victims.

Other predictive factors associated with an increased likelihood of aggression include male gender, the presence of intellectual disability, younger age at the time of first seizure, and multiple seizures. Postulates are that seizure activity in patients with hypothalamic hamartoma is a contributing factor to neurobehavioural deficits. The cause of rage and aggression are poorly understood but are thought to be influenced by gender and hormonal dynamics.

# Evaluation

Since hypothalamic hamartomas present with a plethora of psychiatric symptoms, these patients need a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation process. Diagnostic tools, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) and the Overt Aggression Scale, can be useful.

Child and adolescent psychiatrists frequently have to evaluate youth presenting with rage and anger. Distinguishing between predatory and affective aggression at this time is very important. Also, if the patient presents with a history of inappropriate smiling or giggling, this should alert the psychiatrists that gelastic epilepsy could be present, and the patient should obtain a referral for a thorough neurological assessment. Gelastic seizures often fail to demonstrate EEG changes; therefore, a video EEG is the recommended approach.

# Treatment / Management

The gelastic seizures associated with hypothalamic hamartomas are complicated to treat or manage.

If precocious puberty is the isolated finding with the hamartoma, then medical management is focused on suppressing the pubertal development. An example of this treatment plan would be the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog.

There are no proposed treatment algorithms for behavioral and psychiatric symptoms in patients with hypothalamic hamartoma.

Behavioral symptoms are common in children with epilepsy. Often parents report their children being more restless and irritable before seizure onset. Controlling seizures ultimately controls aggressive behavior in children. The literature describes this phenomenon in several places. Surgical removal of hypothalamic hamartoma is the more definitive treatment in controlling seizures. After surgical removal, three patients became seizure-free, eight had over 90% reduction in seizures, and all of these eleven patients experienced a dramatic improvement in behavior and cognition.

# Differential Diagnosis

Hypothalamic hamartomas are unique in their presentation with gelastic seizures. Other tumors arising from the ventral hypothalamus such as craniopharyngiomas, astrocytomas, optic nerve gliomas do not usually present with gelastic seizures. However, these tumors can be associated with endocrine dysfunction and very rarely associated with central precocious puberty. The differential diagnosis for incessant laughter is broad; however, a thorough history and physical exam along with neuroimaging, video EEG, and psychiatric screening can aid in the diagnosis of gelastic seizures with hypothalamic hamartomas.

# Prognosis

Prognosis is dependent on numerous factors such as the size, location, early manifestations of gelastic seizures, behavioral, cognitive impairment, and central precocious puberty. Large sessile hypothalamic hamartomas are likely to present with all of the above features.

The success rate for gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy is high in treating central precocious puberty.

Gelastic seizures are quite distressing for the patient and the family. As they tend to be refractory to antiepileptic drugs, surgery is the predominant treatment choice. Neurosurgical techniques tend to resolve the symptoms rapidly in these patients. Early intervention is quite critical as this condition is progressive with worsening cognitive and behavioral issues over time. Often the lesion is inaccessible through an open approach; therefore, minimally invasive surgical or radiosurgical therapies are options, but with variable result outcomes. Only 50% of the patients achieved cure by endoscopic disconnection of hypothalamic hamartomas.

# Complications

Complications with open surgical procedures are high.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients and families require education regarding gelastic seizures as these can be quite challenging to manage. Parents should understand the potential for rage behaviors, mood disorders, aggression in patients with hypothalamic hamartoma, and epilepsy — approximately 43% of patients present with significant aggression.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

The management of hypothalamic hamartomas is best done with an interprofessional team chiefly because of its rarity and vague symptoms. Clinicians need to be aware that besides seizures, these lesions can present with psychiatric symptoms in the form of rage behaviors, mood disorders, and aggression.

Early seizure onset is also associated with cognitive impairment. The neurobiology of rage and aggression is poorly understood but is mostly under the influence of hormonal dynamics such as cortisol and testosterone.

Psychiatric outcomes improve after surgery in patients with hypothalamic hamartoma with epilepsy. There is no current available pharmacotherapy for psychiatric symptoms recommended at this time, needing further clinical trials to explore this possibility.

Despite the absence of a pharmaceutical standard of treatment, when pharmaceutical therapy is the initial treatment option, the pharmacist must have involvement and verify dosing and assist the team by performing medication reconciliation. Nursing can monitor the effectiveness of treatment, and report any concerns to the treating clinician. Nurses are also in the best position to observe for adverse medication effects and will assist in helping if a surgical option is chosen. All providers are responsible for educating and counseling the patient's family regarding gelastic seizures. Only with a full, interprofessional team approach can outcomes be directed optimally.
