Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is a clinical diagnosis that requires a high index of suspicion. Labwork including creatine kinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and aldolase are typically normal, although these may be elevated very early in the disease process or acute steroid myopathy of critically ill patients.
