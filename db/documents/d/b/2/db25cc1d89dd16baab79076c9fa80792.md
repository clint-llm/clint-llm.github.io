The symptoms in this condition range remarkably from asymptomatic to aggressive, vision-threatening. Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) can be evident at birth but is most often detected later in life. Abnormal developmental differentiation of endothelial cells leads to secondary alterations of the Descemet membrane. This results in multiple laters of epithelium-like cells within the corneal epithelium. These aberrant cells migrate secreting atypical basement membrane resulting in thickening of the Descemet membrane. Groupings of polymorphic irregularities are evident at the Descemet membrane. These are associated with varying levels of corneal opacification and endothelial degradation. In mild disease with sparse tissue irregularities limited only to the posterior cornea patients may report blurred vision, glare symptoms and, infrequently, eye pain.

Compromises at the Descemet membrane in PPCD are associated with topographic changes in the cornea. Corneal steepening may manifest as regular astigmatism, irregular astigmatism or keratoconus. In patients with intact neurodevelopment of the visual system, visual function can be improved with glasses, standard or specialty contact lenses or certain refractive procedures. However, infants and toddlers have incomplete development of their abilities to process visual stimuli. Any significant asymmetry in refractive status during the critical or sensitive period, up to age 3 and age 9 respectively, may delay or limit the maturation of visual sensory development in one or both eyes

In severe cases of PPCD, the risk for permanent loss of vision is increased. Endothelial compromise affects corneal deturgescence. Significant endothelial compromise can lead to focal or diffuse corneal edema. As fluid accumulates in the corneal stroma, swelling and opacification occur. Corneal bullae may form migrating anteriorly resulting in sharp eye pains. Vision may be profoundly limited by dense central corneal edema. Further corneal decompensation will occur. Surgical intervention is necessary to restore endothelial function and regain some level of corneal clarity

With PPCD the abnormal cells have several epithelium-like characteristics. The aberrant corneal endothelium is multilayered with keratin, numerous microvilli, and desmosomes. The thickened tissue has greater biomechanical resistance to an outside force. This can alter corneal hysteresis leading to an over-estimation of measured intraocular pressures which confounds the diagnosis of glaucoma.

Irregular basement membrane secretions bridging the anatomical angle can lead to elevated intraocular pressure and secondary glaucoma

Penetrating keratoplasty is required for 20-25% of patients with significant endothelial involvement and diffuse corneal edema
