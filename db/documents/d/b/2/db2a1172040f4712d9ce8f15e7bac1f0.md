The pathogenesis of SPS has been explained by B-cell-mediated autoimmune inflammation that affects different components of inhibitory GABAergic neurons and their synapses.Â Production of autoantibodies against antigens involved in GABA synthesis and release within the central nervous system results in a dysfunction of major inhibitory pathways leading to impaired truncal and axial muscles' impaired relaxation due to hyperexcitability the motor cortex. Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is an intracellular enzyme that transforms glutamate into GABA and is a primary target and the most common antigen identified in classic SPS.

Primarily, the production of anti-GAD65 antibodies is a hallmark of a pathological process in classic SPS and is found in 70-80% of cases. In addition to classic SPS, anti-GAD antibodies have been associated with other autoimmune neurological disorders, including limbic encephalitis, autoimmune epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, myoclonus, and nystagmus. They now comprise GAD antibody-spectrum disorders (GAD-SD).

Additional antigens described with SPS include GABA(A) receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein-6 (DPPX) as well as glycine receptor (GlyR), which is associated with PERM.

A paraneoplastic variant of SPS is associated with antibodies against amphiphysin or gephyrin. Amphiphysin is an intracellular presynaptic protein involved in the endocytosis of the vesicle membrane and regulates the expression of GABA receptors at the axon membrane. It is demonstrated that antibodies against amphiphysin can decrease the amount of GABA receptors by reducing the endocytosis of the GABA-containing vesicles. Therefore, this diminishes the presynaptic vesicle pool and leads to impaired GABA transmission.
