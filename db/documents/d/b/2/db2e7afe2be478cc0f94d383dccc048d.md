The management is usually conservative, with medical and endoscopic therapy in the initial stages. Conservative management options are a healthy balanced diet, pain management, pancreatic rest, and abstinence from alcohol and smoking. Usually, these measures provide short-term relief, and occasionally they do provide long-term benefits. Endoscopic therapies are beneficial but could involve a therapeutic failure in about 10 to 20% of patients. The usual definitive therapy is surgery (Whipple pancreaticoduodenectomy) in most cases that are refractory to conservative therapy or in which the diagnosis is inconclusive.
