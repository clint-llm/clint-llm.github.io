The presence of the triad of secretory breast epithelium, prolactin stimulus, and ductal obstruction is needed to form galactocele.

****Secretory breast epithelium:****The most common demographic patient group that presents with galactocele are women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, during lactation, or sometimes seen even after cessation of lactation. Ductal proliferation is predominantly controlled by estrogen, whereas acinar differentiation is a progesterone effect facilitated by estrogen. These hormones contribute to mammogenesis. The hormonal influence of chorionic gonadotropin forms lobules that have acini with larger size and number of epithelial cells. Small amounts of milk can be secreted as early as week 16 of gestation.

- Difficulty in breastfeeding - For example, infants with cleft palate

- If breastfeeding is contraindicated and breastmilk is not emptied
- For infants with phenylketonuria, rare amino acidurias, and classic galactosemia
- For infants with an untreated congenital diaphragmatic hernia, Oesophageal atresia, tracheo-oesophageal fistula, intestinal obstruction, etc
- For infants whose mothers have diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV), or Ebola
- For infants whose mothers are taking medications or radioactive agents that might be harmful to the infant

-  The oral-contraceptive pill has also been implicated in the formation of galactocele due to excessive stimulation of the breast epithelium.

**Prolactin stimulus:**Thirty cases of galactoceles to date have also been reported in male infants due to trans-placental passage of prolactin or with previous cases citing a pituitary adenoma as the cause associated with chronic galactorrhoea.****Rarely, galactocele can occur in adult males resulting from hyperprolactinemia.****Hyperprolactinemia is caused by prolactinomas which may be associated with MEN1 or with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism

**Ductal obstruction:**Recently, post-breast-augmentation galactoceles have also been reported, with periareolar incisions being a significant risk factor as they can cause ductal injury and subsequently ductal obstruction. However, breast augmentation procedures via the inframammary approach, which is usually considered a protective approach in terms of risk factors for induction of postoperative galactorrhea, also has been demonstrated to cause galactocele in some cases reported in the literature.

The proposed theory is that intercostal nerves are stimulated from surgery, leading to autonomic control over central neurogenic paths diminishing dopamine output into hypophysis’ portal circulation, increasing prolactin levels and milk secretion, and subsequently causing an increase in prolactin levels.
