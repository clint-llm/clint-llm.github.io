Vinyl chloride toxicity occurs mainly through occupational exposure during the polymerization of VCM into PVC; however, community exposures secondary to industrial spills have occurred.

Beyond the direct industrial production of PVC, low levels of VCM are detectable in cigarette smoke, and PVC waste in the environment can be broken down by endogenous bacteria to VCM.
