Most cases of pseudomyxoma peritonei are discovered in an advanced stage due to its indolent behavior. Pathological diagnosis is crucial to determine the treatment plan. When suspicious lesions are encountered incidentally during laparoscopy or laparotomy, the best strategy is to take generous biopsies, remove appendix if accessible, and only proceed with further treatment after pathological confirmation of the diagnosis and clinical assessment of the patient. During follow-up, the primary care provider, nurse practitioner or internist should be aware of recurrence and consider imaging studies and referral to the oncologist. Pseudomyxoma peritonei treatment is best in an interprofessional team approach including specialists, oncology trained specialty nursing, and when necessary, pharmacists, collaborating for optimal patient care and outcomes.
