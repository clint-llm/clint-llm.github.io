It is very important to gather a detailed history of symptoms in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Symptoms depend on the location and size of the tumor and similar to symptoms produced by any benign or malignant brain tumors. GBM typically presents with progressive neurological symptoms over days to weeks. Headache is the most common symptom followed by seizures, focal neurological deficits, and symptoms associated with raised intracranial pressure like nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, and altered mental status. Due to nonspecific symptoms, which can also occur in infectious, inflammatory, or other disease processes, physicians should have a high suspicion of malignancy.
