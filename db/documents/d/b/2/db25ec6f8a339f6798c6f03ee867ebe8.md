In twins, the doubling of placental mass explains the increased risk for complications like preeclampsia and gestational diabetes and an increased risk for placenta previa. A higher incidence of velamentous cord insertion may create additional risks for vasa previa.

On rare occasions, twin reverse arterial perfusion can occur. This condition leads to an abnormal fetus with the pathophysiology of being "parasitic" to the other twin's circulation.
