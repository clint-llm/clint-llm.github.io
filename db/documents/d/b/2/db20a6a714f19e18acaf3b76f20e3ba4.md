Kaposi’s varicelliform eruption is a rare condition that was first described in 1887 by Moritz Kaposi. It occurs more frequently in children, probably due to its relationship with atopic dermatitis. However, adult cases have been reported. The incidence is not precisely known due to its rarity and the lack of large case series.

The disease equally affects men and women and does not appear to have a specific ethnic predominance.
