To date, the major etiologies that may lead to placental insufficiency are poorly understood and are still being studied. There are known associated maternal risk factors, which include pre-eclampsia or other maternal hypertensive disorders, maternal cigarette use, maternal drug use including cocaine or heroin, maternal alcohol consumption, primiparity, advanced maternal age, and prior history of delivery of IUGR neonate.

Studies analyzing Doppler waveforms in various placental vessels of mothers who smoked cigarettes during pregnancy demonstrated reductions in the blood flow velocity waveforms, thus indicating the nicotine exposure can lead to altered placental vasculature.

Any maternal condition that can lead to a compromise in the fetal circulation puts the fetus at risk for placental insufficiency. Additionally, certain medications such as antineoplastic, anticonvulsants, or anti-coagulants can interfere with fetal growth. Extremes of maternal body mass index, including maternal malnutrition, have also been associated with the development of IUGR neonates.
