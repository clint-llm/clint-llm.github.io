Patients will present with obvious spinal deformity with or without a known syndromic pathology. It is important to recognize that the initial presentation of a syndrome may be a spinal abnormality. Complete pediatric history including birth history should be gathered. Physical examination should include a full neurologic assessment as well as a photographic assessment of the spinal deformity. Furthermore, the patient’s spinal flexibility should be examined clinically on the examination table (when possible) to determine the relative rigidity of the spinal column.
