The diagnosis is mainly clinical. A skin biopsy shows mild acanthosis and hyperkeratosis. Increased melanin is seen in the basal layer although the number of melanocytes tends to be normal. Dermal melanophages can be seen. Other features reported in histopathology include elongation of the rete ridges, smooth muscle, and sebaceous gland hyperplasia.Â The hyperproliferation of keratinocytes, melanocytes, arrector pili muscle and dermal nerve fibers have been reported in recent studies. Some immunohistochemical studies have shown increased expression of some markers like epidermal Ki-67, melan-A, and keratin 15 in the lesional and perilesional skin as compared to normal skin. Dermal nerve fiber length and expression of smooth muscle actin have also been reported to be higher in the lesional skin of Becker melanosis.
