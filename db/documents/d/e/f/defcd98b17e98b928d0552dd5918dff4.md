The most common clinical presentation of Riedel thyroiditis is a hard and enlarged thyroid. Obstructive symptoms due to the involvement of neck structures are frequent. Dyspnea due to tracheal involvement, dysphagia due to esophageal involvement, stridor due to recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement, and venous sinus thrombosis due to the involvement of the vasculature can be present. Exophthalmos is secondary to the involvement of the retrobulbar tissues.

On examination, a hard mass is palpable in the anterior neck, which may be immobile when swallowing as it is adherent to the surrounding neck structures. A positive Chvostek or Trousseau sign is indicative of hypoparathyroidism secondary to parathyroid gland involvement.
