The cerebellum maintains our coordination and balance. Cerebellar dysfunction causes difficulty with coordination, imbalance, and gait disorders. Possible etiologies are vascular, idiopathic, traumatic, autoimmune, metabolic, infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic. Neurological evaluation is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Cerebellar dysfunction can have a tremendous impact on patients, especially on the quality of life, balance, gait, morbidity, and mortality. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of cerebellar dysfunction.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of cerebellar dysfunction.
- Review the evaluation of cerebellar dysfunction.
- Outline the management of cerebellar dysfunction.
-  Explain to enhance a health professional's understanding of cerebellar dysfunction.
