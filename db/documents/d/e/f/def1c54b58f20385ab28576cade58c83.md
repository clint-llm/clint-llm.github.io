**Prenatal Counseling**

Prenatal counseling for parents with fetuses diagnosed with Edwards syndrome has a multifaceted issue, including the complexity of the varied presentation at birth, the unavoidable ethical issues due to the high fatality rate, and the significant developmental disability associated with it. When a prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 18 is made, the parents have difficulty making decisions regarding resuscitation, life support, intensive care, and surgical options. We need to provide parents with accurate survival figures and co-morbidity. The parents should be explained about all options available for management during the neonatal period and beyond. It will be beneficial for parents to get in touch with family support groups.Â The parents should be aware of the recurrence risk of 1% in subsequent pregnancies, which can be as high as 20% in partial trisomy due to unbalanced translocation.
