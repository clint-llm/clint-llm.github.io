Microscopically, Purkinje cells have a large, flat, highly branched dendritic tree and a single long axon that forms an inhibitory projection to the cerebellar nuclei. The plane of the dendritic tree is perpendicular to the folds in the cerebellar cortex, with parallel fibers passing through the distal dendritic trees of a large number of Purkinje cells forming weak synapses. A single climbing fiber, as noted above, makes a few hundred synapses to the soma and proximal dendrites. Any given climbing fiber is one of about ten axons from an inferior olivary cell so that the same inputÂ is distributed among multiple Purkinje cells.
