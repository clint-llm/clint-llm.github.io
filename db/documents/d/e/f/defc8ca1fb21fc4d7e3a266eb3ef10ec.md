The signs of inflammation include loss of function, heat, pain, redness, and swelling. Inflammation is part of the body's complex biological response to harmful stimuli, such as irritants, pathogens, and damaged cells.

It is clinically useful to differentiate inflammation and infection as there are many pathological situations where distinguishing them is highly essential to evaluation and treatment.
