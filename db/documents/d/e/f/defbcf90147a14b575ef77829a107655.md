Middle lobeÂ syndrome (MLS) is a relatively uncommon clinical entity that is under-recognized in clinical practice. It was first identified clinically in 1948 by Graham et al. in a case series involving 12 patients with nontuberculous middle lobe atelectasis secondary to extensive compression by enlarged lymph nodes.
