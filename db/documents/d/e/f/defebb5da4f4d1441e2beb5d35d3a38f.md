Postoperative nursing education includes application of ophthalmic ointment twice daily to the eye until seen again in clinic. The patient should be instructed to keep the eye clean and dry and to use artificial tears daily. Patients should avoid manipulating the eyelids and should refrain from wearing contact lenses until cleared to do so by their surgeon.
