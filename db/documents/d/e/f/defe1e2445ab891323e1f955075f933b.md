Trichinellosis is caused by consuming raw or undercooked meat of infected animals. Patients should receive education about the risk of transmission when consuming undercooked or raw meat. There are no reports of human to human transmission. Cases can occur in clusters among groups of people from the same community or family who have consumed infected meat from a common animal. Patients should be educated to heat the meat to at least 77 degrees Celsius which kills Trichinella larvae. Patients should also receive counseling regarding proper food safety practices.
