The pathophysiology may include osseous or soft tissue imbalance.

**Clubfoot:**Multiple muscle contractures that work simultaneously contribute to the characteristic appearance of the clubfoot. This results in medial deviation of the forefoot and midfoot compared to the hindfoot. More specifically, the bony deformities consist mainly of medial deviation and rigid plantar flexion of the talus, which acts as a pivot point for the calcaneus (hindfoot) and the tarsal bones (midfoot).

The calcaneus is rotated medially around the talus (hindfoot varus), and the navicular and cuboid tarsal bones are also displaced medially, resulting in forefoot adduction. Overall, the bony deformities can be summarized by the CAVE mnemonic, which consists of the Cavus of the midfoot, Adductus of the forefoot, Varus, and Equinus of the hindfoot.

**Planovalgus:**Ligamentous laxity or muscle imbalance is considered the cause of pes planovalgus deformity. The posterior tibialis tendon is important for maintaining the foot arch, and when it is weak, flatfoot will ensue. Pes planovalgus has also been associated with excessive tension in the soleus, triceps surae, and gastrocnemius muscles.

**Cavovarus:**The deformity results from muscle imbalances; the stronger peroneus longus and posterior tibialis muscles overpull against the weaker anterior tibialis and peroneus brevis muscles, respectively, causing plantarflexion of the first ray of the foot with forefoot pronation and compensatory varus deformity of the hindfoot.

**Congenital vertical talus:**The main characteristic is a vertically oriented plantarflexed talus in relation to the navicular bone and a resultant fixed talonavicular dislocation. The navicular bone deviates dorsolaterally. This leads to a hypoplastic navicular bone and abnormally shaped talus. The hindfoot resumes an equinus and valgus position, resulting from the Achilles tendon and subtalar capsule contracture, and may also lead to calcaneocuboid dislocation.

**Metatarsus adductus:**Even though the exact etiology is unknown, the most accepted theory is increased intrauterine pressure, also known as the intrauterine packaging phenomenon.

**Skew foot:**The etiology of the skew foot is unknown; however, muscle imbalances have been speculated to play a role. More specifically, a misplaced anterior tibialis tendon insertion in combination with Achilles tendon contracture could lead to skew foot deformity.
