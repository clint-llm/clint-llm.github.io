The staging of aneurysmal bone cysts has its basis in Enneking’s staging of benign musculoskeletal neoplasms

- Stage 1: Latent (inactive) - These tumors are usually found incidentally and are asymptomatic.

- Stage 2: Active - These tumors are discovered due to the symptomatic discomfort of the patient.  They are steadily growing and may be palpable.

- Stage 3: Aggressive - These tumors are typically found due to significant patient discomfort and a possible visible abnormality with inflammation. Although these tumors are benign, they act very similarly to low-grade malignancy.
