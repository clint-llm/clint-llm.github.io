Congenital melanocytic neviÂ can sometimes be very hard to differentiate from acquired atypical nevi or melanoma. When this is the case, a biopsy should be performed in order to rule out the latter. Ideally, it should be excisional. Other differential diagnoses include smooth muscle hamartomas, Becker melanosis, and plexiform neurofibromas.
