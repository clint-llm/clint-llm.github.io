Obtaining a history in a nonjudgmental way is crucial and should include pain descriptors: duration, intensity, location, exacerbating andÂ alleviating factors, and any associated psychologic components. The location and onset can help to differentiate entry versus deep pain. Whereas a burning pain more commonly links to vaginitis, vulvodynia, atrophy, or inadequate lubrication, a deep aching pain may be noted in pelvic congestion syndrome, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, retroverted uterus, uterine fibroids, and adnexal pathology. A situational versus a more generalized description (occurs only with certain partners or with all encounters) may more strongly link with psychologic considerations.

In the first step of physical examination, it is always advisable to educate the patient about the examination and her anatomy in detail.
