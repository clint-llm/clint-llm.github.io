CF is caused by a genetic mutation in a gene on chromosome 7 that codes for a protein transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which functions as a transmembrane cAMP-activated chloride channel.Â Both copies of the gene are mutated in clinical disease.

There are over 2000 different mutations in the CFTR gene that can cause disease. These mutations are divided into five classes:

- Defective protein synthesis

- Defective protein processing

- Disordered regulation

- Defective chloride conductance

- Accelerated channel turnover
