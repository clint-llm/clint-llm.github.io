Proposed mechanisms involve the vascular, hormonal, and cellular systems.

**Vascular:**One of the most common radiologic findings, transverse sinus stenosis, suggests a vascular component. However, the consensus is that this is likely secondary to the increased pressure rather than the cause of the increased pressure; this results in a feed-forward cycle that is relieved by removal of CSF.**Hormonal:**Aldosterone excess (associated with obesity and PCOS) commonly correlates with PTC and is suggested to affect the mineralocorticoid receptor of the choroid plexus leading to increased CSF production.

**Cellular:**Increased outflow resistance to CSF has been demonstrated in multiple experimental studies and is the leading theory for causation of PTC. The outflow resistance could be due to an effect of estrogen or retinoic acid (both elevated by increased adiposity) on epithelial cells leading to less outflow of CSF. Finally, the predilection of PTC for younger populations could be explained by decreased CSF production with aging.  Approximately 600 milliliters is produced daily but decreases with increasing age.
