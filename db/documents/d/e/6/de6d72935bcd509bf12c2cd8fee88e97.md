The suspected diagnosis should be confirmed by an analysis that measures the rate of DNA repair on skin cells (fibroblasts). This technique is done on skin specimens taken by biopsy. The fibroblasts will be cultured and then exposed to ultraviolet rays to measure the rate of repair of their DNA. In Cockayne syndrome, the test shows a lower than normal repair rate.

The genetic test, in other words, the search for the ERCC6 or ERCC8 gene mutation, is possible from a blood sample. The examination is performed in specialized laboratories.
