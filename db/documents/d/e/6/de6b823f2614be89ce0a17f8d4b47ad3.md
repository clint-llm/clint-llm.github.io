Alprostadil is a synthetic analog of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and shows a multifariousness of pharmacologic actions. Alprostadil binds as an agonist to prostaglandin receptors, e.g., EP2 which in turns activates adenylate cyclase leading to accumulation of 3'5'-cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) which is responsible for the pharmacologic effects of the medication including smooth muscle relaxation, causing vasodilation (increasing peripheral blood flow; helps in erectile dysfunction) and bronchodilation, and inhibits platelet aggregation.
