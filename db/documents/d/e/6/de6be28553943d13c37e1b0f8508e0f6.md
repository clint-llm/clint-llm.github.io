Complications of osseointegrated bone conduction prosthesis include bone and soft tissue related complications, with the latter being more common. Soft tissue related complications included: soft tissue reactions ranging from erythema and tenderness to granulation tissue. Other common soft tissue related complications included skin overgrowth and hypertrophic scar and keloid formation. Most complications can be treated on an outpatient basis. To reduce the incidence of soft tissue complications, patients need a multidisciplinary approach with adequate instruction regarding hygiene and an established protocol regarding regular follow-up with their otolaryngologist and audiologist. Failure to do so leads to an increased incidence of preventable soft-tissue complications. Finally, bone-related complications include failure of osseointegration with extrusion of the implant, which requires removal of implant and re-implantation. This complication is common in patients younger than 5 years of age due to their thinner skull or poor bone quality.
