The management of acromegaly and gigantism should be done with an interprofessional team that includes an endocrinologist, neurosurgeon, internist, cardiologist, rheumatologist, pulmonologist, oncologist, nursing staff, and pharmacists. Clinicians, including specialists and mid-level practitioners, will guide the overall direction of care, but interprofessional care coordination and open communication are crucial to successful case management. Nurses will often help coordinate the activities of the clinicians, as well as assist in patient evaluation during surgical procedures and provide patient counsel. Pharmacists are vital resources for the pharmacological management of the disease, verifying agent selection and dosing, performing medication reconciliation, and counseling patients on the proper use of their medication and wheat adverse events might present. Any team member who notes a change in patient status should communicate their findings to the rest of the team and document their observations in the patient's medical record. This interprofessional approach to care will yield the most effective therapy delivery and improve patient outcomes. [Level 5]

Untreated acromegaly has increased mortality compared to the general population. The major contributors to mortality are cardiovascular disease (60%), respiratory disease (25%), and malignancies (15%). Mortality rates are similar to the general population in patients with controlled GH secretion. Besides the level of GH, the presence of cardiac disease is an important prognostic indicator. The presence of cardiac disease at diagnosis has a 100% mortality rate at 15 years. The mortality rate of patients with acromegaly and diabetes at 20 years is 80%.
