CTO lesions are diagnosed in patients who are undergoing coronary angiography as part of the evaluation of ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, or valvular heart disease. Patients with ischemic heart disease generally present with typical chest pain symptoms (stable or unstable angina), atypical chest pain, NSTEMI, or STEMI. In contrast, patients with different types of cardiomyopathies or valvular heart disease may present with a variety of symptoms, including decompensated congestive heart failure. Therefore, during history taking in patients suspected of having ischemic heart disease, it is essential to have them describe and subjectively quantify their symptoms.

The history should also include risk factors for cardiovascular disease (diabetes, tobacco abuse, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) and non-cardiac causes of the patient's symptoms, including pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, esophageal rupture or perforating peptic ulcer. Physical examination in these patients should include complete auscultation of the heart and lung sounds together with assessment for heart failure signs including jugular venous distention, Kussmaul sign, hepatojugular reflex, ascites, and peripheral edema.
