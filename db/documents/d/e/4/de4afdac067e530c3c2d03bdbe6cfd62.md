**Sympathetic Ophthalmia**

- Sympathetic ophthalmia is an autoimmune condition that is a direct response of penetrating trauma or surgery to the eye, exposing ocular molecules as antigenic material leading to the immune system developing an inflammatory response to the uvea. This condition also leads to bilateral non-necrotizing granulomatous uveitis.

**VKH-like Medication Toxicity (checkpoint inhibitors)**

- Checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to cause “VKH-like” medication toxicity that resolves with discontinuation of the inciting medications.

**Choroidal Melanoma**

- Patients with choroidal melanoma may develop serous retinal detachments, and non-pigmented melanomas may appear as subretinal pigmentary loss similar to VKH.

**Infectious Posterior Uveitis**

- Syphilis, tuberculosis, and endogenous endophthalmitis can present with subretinal nodules, intraocular inflammation, and serous retinal detachment.

**Alport and Cogan Syndromes**

- Both Alport syndrome and Cogan syndrome can exhibit bilateral hearing deficits and retinal manifestations. Alport syndrome shows choroidal thickening but is characterized by significant inner retinal changes. Cogan syndrome is characterized by retinal vasculitis rather than subretinal changes.

**Sarcoidosis**

- Sarcoidosis is a distinct cause of posterior uveitis and can have multiple presentations. Periphlebitis and “candle-wax drippings” on fluorescein angiogram can help differentiate sarcoidosis from VKH.

**Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Chorioretinopathy**

- Serous retinal detachments may be seen in lupus choroidopathy, but patients with lupus choroidopathy do not typically show choroidal thickening and often have significant systemic manifestations of their disease.
