Abnormal calcium deposition is hypothesized to be due to either abnormal brain calcium metabolism or metastatic deposition due to locally altered blood-brain barrier.Â Defective iron transport and free radical production cause tissue damage, which initiates calcification around a nidus composed of mucopolysaccharides and related substances. The calcium deposition starts within the vessel wall and perivascular space and slowly extends to involve the entire neuron. Progressive calcification compresses nearby vessels reducing blood flow and hence continuing the vicious cycle of decreased blood flow, tissue injury, and mineral deposition.

High levels of copper, zinc, magnesium, iron, and altered glucose metabolism in basal ganglia have also been reported. An increase in CSF levels of CNS-specific peptide, homocarnosine, and low histidine levels have been found in some cases.
