**Identifying Latent Safety Threats**

The concept of latent safety threats (LST) has origins within the aviation industry, in which latent failures were entities that could have a damaging consequence but may lie dormant.

Another study describes the process of using simulation following an adverse event to identify latent safety threats.

In another study at a single institution, 49 in situ simulation exercises yielded identification of 56 latent safety threats (LST), for an average of 1.1 per scenario, suggesting that every single simulation had the opportunity to improve the quality of care.
