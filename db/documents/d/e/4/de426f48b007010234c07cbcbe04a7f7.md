There are no recommended diagnostic exams for monitoring the use of tropicamide. Pupillary dilation and dimness of near vision denote that the drug's action has started. If the pupil reacts to light, that means that the pupil is not fully dilated, and more time or more administration of tropicamide eye drops is needed for the maximal action to come.
