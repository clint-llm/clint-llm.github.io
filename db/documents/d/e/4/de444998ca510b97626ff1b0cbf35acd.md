Early recognition and treatment of PRES can help reduce the incidence of complications and improve patient outcomes. Awareness and education are instrumental for the proper management of PRES and its risk factors and etiologies. For instance, educating patients about blood pressure management can decrease the likelihood of cerebral autoregulation dysfunction, leading to PRES and other complications. Knowledge about the effects of cytotoxic immunosuppressants on the blood-brain barrier, even in non-hypertensive patients, can help care providers become more mindful about the development of PRES in patients taking these medicines.
