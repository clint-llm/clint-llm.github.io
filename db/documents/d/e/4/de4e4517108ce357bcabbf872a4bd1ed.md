Neisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative bacterium that inhabits the mucosal surface of the nasopharynx in approximately 10% of healthy persons. The invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is a severe form of Neisseria meningitidis infection, most commonly manifested as meningitis or septicemia. Initially, non-specific symptoms of infection with fever often lead to a rapid deterioration of the patient's condition and death within 12 to 24 hours of the onset of the disease. This activity reviews Neisseria meningitidis as a disease and discusses the role of the interprofessional team in educating patients on the need for meningococcal prophylaxis and the options available.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the global health burden of meningococcal disease.
- Describe the modalities available for post-exposure chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal disease.
- Review the indications for meningococcal meningitis prophylaxis.
- Explain the features of Neisseria meningitidis as a disease and discuss the need for meningococcal prophylaxis.
