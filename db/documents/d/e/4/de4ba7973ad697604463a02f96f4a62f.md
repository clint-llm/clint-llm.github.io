A patient requiring a conventional hearing aid may encounter a range of professionals working within ear and hearing services. Medically trained audio-vestibular physicians and ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeons will investigate the cause of hearing loss and may refer to audiology for testing and fitting. There will be regular contact with an audiologist, a clinically trained healthcare professional in diagnosing and managing adult and child hearing loss and balance, who performs the audiometric tests, hearing aid fitting, and maintenance. In lowerÂ and middle-income countries, where resources can vary, ENT surgeons may also perform this role.

ENT surgeons can manage patients with any complications of conventional hearing aids such as earwax impaction, external ear infection, and foreign body in the ear when a part of the hearing aid may break off into the ear canal.
