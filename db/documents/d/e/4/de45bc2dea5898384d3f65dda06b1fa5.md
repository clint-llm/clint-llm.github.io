Riboflavin deficiency is not common in the USA. The best way to prevent it is to educate the patient on a healthy diet. The primary care provider, nurse practitioner, pharmacist, and the dietitian, working cohesively as an interprofessional team, should regularly encourage patients about eating fruits and vegetables. Also, most cereals are fortified with multivitamins. These disciplines need to communicate across interprofessional boundaries to guide patient outcomes optimally. The pharmacist can indicate optimal supplemental dosing along with the dietician, who can monitor dietary sources and recommendations for riboflavin-rich foods. The pharmacist can recommend particular supplements, and the nurse can track therapeutic progress on followup visits before the clinician sees the patient, charting all pertinent data regarding changes in status. All this occurs under the guidance of the physician or NP who manages the case. Empirically recommending vitamins for everyone is not recommended, which is why an interprofessional team approach is more beneficial to patient outcomes.
