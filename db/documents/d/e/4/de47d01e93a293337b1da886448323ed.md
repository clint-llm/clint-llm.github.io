The prognosis for most patients with Pancoast tumors is poor as they are diagnosed late in the course of the disease and generally present after the local spread of disease. Less than 30% are alive at five years. Chemoradiotherapy has shown minimal benefit in locoregional recurrence and long-term survival. After surgery, the quality of life is very poor, and patients often have debilitating pain.

Patients should receive education regarding the prognosis, success, and recurrence of disease post-treatment and side effects/complications of treatment; to decide on the further course of the treatment plan.
