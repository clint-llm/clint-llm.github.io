Modern crotalid antivenom Fab, approved by the FDA in 2000, was developed from the serum of sheep inoculated with four species native to the United States: Eastern Diamondback (C. adamanteus), Western Diamondback (C. atrox), Mojave Rattlesnake (C. scutulatus), Cottonmouth (A. piscivorus).

- Hypersensitivity: Type I hypersensitivity is relatively uncommon, with one review showing an incidence of 8%.

- Serum Sickness: Serum sickness has also been reported, with a slightly higher incidence of 13%.

- Pre-treatment does not decrease the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions.
