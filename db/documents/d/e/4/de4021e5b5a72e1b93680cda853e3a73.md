Penile injection and aspiration is a bedside procedure used to treat priapism. Priapism is defined as an erection of extended duration (greater than 4 hours) without sexual activity. There are three types of priapism, ischemic, which involves a low flow of blood into the penis; non-ischemic, or high flow priapism caused by increased blood flow into the penis; and stuttering, which is recurrent episodes of ischemic priapism and can be treated as such.

Causes of ischemic priapism include medications, recreational drug use, blood dyscrasia, malignancy, fat embolism due, intravenous contrast, neurogenic, hormonal, metabolic disease, and toxin-mediated.

The cause of non-ischemic priapism includes trauma, causing unrestricted arterial flow within the corpora.
