The exact etiology of migraine with brainstem aura is not known. Like other types of migraines, environmental factors play a role. The genetic role is suggested, but no definite linkage has been found yet. Common triggers (like in other types of migraine) include strong smells, loud noises, weather changes, excessive sleep, lack of sleep, increased stress, intense physical exertion, oral contraceptives, foods like cheese, alcohol, caffeine, and certain food preservatives like monosodium glutamate (MSG).
