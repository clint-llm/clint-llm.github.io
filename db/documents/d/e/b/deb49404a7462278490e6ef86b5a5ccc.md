When a stimulus such as low blood pressure or low serum sodium triggers the RAAS, first renin is secreted from the renal juxtaglomerular cells, then angiotensinogen is cleaved into angiotensin I. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) from the lungs then converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which in turn stimulates the production of aldosterone.

Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid steroid hormone that modulates activity directly and indirectly in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron which includes the late distal convoluted tubule, the connecting tubule, and the collecting duct system.

Depending on the specific physiologic parameters, aldosterone may:

- increase sodium reabsorption

- increase water retention

- increase potassium excretion

- increase acid (H+) excretion

- increase bicarbonate (HCO3-) excretion and chloride reabsorption

Although predominantly known for its activity in the kidney, aldosterone may act at mineralocorticoid receptors in other tissues as well such as the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory epithelium, myocardium, and vascular smooth muscle.
