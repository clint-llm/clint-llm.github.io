The middle meningeal artery supplies the intracranial blood supply to the vagus nerve. The extracranial blood supply is from the common carotid artery, internal carotid artery, inferior thyroid artery, external carotid artery, a posterior meningeal artery, internal thoracic arteries, bronchial arteries, and esophageal arteries.

The vagal system is involved in regulating the contraction of lymphatic (containing actin) cells.
