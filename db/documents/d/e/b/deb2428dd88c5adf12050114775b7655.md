Primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention all have distinct roles in the management of insulin resistance.

- Primary prevention promotes public education regarding the importance of regular health monitoring. A healthy diet and increased activity level can prevent or ameliorate the onset of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes along with the associated complications. The emphasis on behavior modification and a sustainable lifestyle are key items for long-term weight management

- Secondary prevention in the form of lab screening for insulin resistance, diabetes, and further subspecialist referral to best manage the early intervention for insulin resistance.

- Public acceptance of tertiary prevention (intensive medical intervention and bariatric surgery for weight reduction) can lead to decreased morbidity and mortality associated with the consequent complications of insulin resistance.
