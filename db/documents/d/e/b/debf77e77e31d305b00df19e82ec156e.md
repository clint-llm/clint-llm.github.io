The procedural approach should be decided upon before initiation of the procedure. The 2 commonly utilized techniques are the Seldinger technique, the most common, or the catheter-over-needle technique. The catheter-over-needle technique is basic and can be performed via accessing the artery with a needle that includes an integrated catheter that is easily advanced into the lumen of the vessel following arterial access. Once the artery has been accessed and the catheter placed in the lumen, the needle is completely removed leaving only the catheter in place. The catheter is then properly secured with nylon suture.

The Seldinger technique is performed by accessing the artery with a needle, feeding a guidewire through the lumen of the needle, and finally placing the catheter in the lumen of the artery by feeding it over the guidewire and removing the guidewire leaving only the catheter itself in place. The catheter is then secured with nylon suture. This is the recommended technique for arterial cannulation in an infant or child.

Ultrasound guidance may be utilized to assist in identifying the artery and also to visualize cannulation of the vessel.
