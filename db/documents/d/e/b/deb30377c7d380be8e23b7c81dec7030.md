The pathophysiology of nfvPPA is not clear and is still being investigated. However, there is always some involvement of the dominant inferior frontal lobe (Broca's area), and atrophy of the insular cortex in the dominant hemisphere can also be found.

The high variability of nfvPPA relative to other PPAs is maintained histologically and remains a continued investigation subject. A large number of patients have been found to have someÂ deposition of abnormal tau on post-mortem examination. TDP-43, or Alzheimer pathology, has also been found in a minority of patients.
