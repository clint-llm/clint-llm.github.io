Baker's cysts are encountered most frequently in adults with a history of trauma (e.g., cartilage or meniscus tears, injury to the knee), in association with degenerative/co-existing knee joint disease (e.g., osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, infectious arthritis, pigmented villonodular synovitis, meniscal tears), or asymptomatically as an incidental finding.

Baker's cysts form and can expand as a result of the accumulation and extrusion of synovial fluid that localizes between the semimembranosus and medial head of the gastrocnemius.  In some instances, normal anatomic variants entail physiologic capsular openings or defects in the posterior knee joint capsule that is essentially contiguous with the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa.  Popliteal cysts are located on the medial side of the popliteal fossa just below the crease found at the posterior knee.
