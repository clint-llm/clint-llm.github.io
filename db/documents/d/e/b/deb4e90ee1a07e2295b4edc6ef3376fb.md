Surgical resection is recommended for local disease but should also be considered for advanced disease.

Clinicians can attempt medical treatment before surgery in recurrent or malignant cases.

If the tumor is unresectable, if the patient has metastatic disease, or if he is a poor surgical candidate, diazoxide is an option.

For patients with refractory symptoms and increasing tumor volume, oncologic control with referral to specialty centers is recommended.

For advanced disease, surgical resection could still be an option if most (90% or more) of the tumor is safely resectable or if the liver metastases seem to be resectable.

Some research suggests neoadjuvant therapy involving peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in unresectable or borderline resectable pNET because of survival benefits.
