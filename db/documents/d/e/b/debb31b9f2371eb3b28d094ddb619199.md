**Penetrating Trauma**

A hypovolemic shock from penetrating trauma is one of the most feared consequences because it can result in death if not treated promptly. A patient in hypovolemic shock typically presents with hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and cold skin. Acute blood loss means less circulating volume leading to decreased organ perfusion, dependent on arterial pressure. The most vulnerable organs of decreased perfusion are the kidneys, brain, heart, liver, and colon. In an attempt to maintain adequate oxygenation to the previously mentioned organs, the body implements several processes. All of which the mainstay is the autonomic nervous system. One goal is to maintain cardiac output (CO), defined by heart rate x stroke volume, which is achieved by activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), causing the release of plasma catecholamines, such as vasopressin and norepinephrine, increasing the heart rate and thus CO. Another goal is to increase systemic vascular resistance (SVR); via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Renin is released by juxtaglomerular cells in response to a decrease in systemic blood pressure and a decrease in NaCl delivery to the macula densa. From there, renin subsequently converts to angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and aldosterone. In regards to hypovolemia, angiotensin II acts on blood vessels, causing vasoconstriction and on the hypothalamus to cause the release of the anti-diuretic hormone leading to water reabsorption at the collecting ducts. Additionally, angiotensin II limits baroreceptor reflex bradycardia, further aiding in the maintenance of CO.

**Blunt Trauma**

Blunt trauma is classified as a force striking the body, and its consequences are dependent on the location of the trauma. The most common cause and location of blunt force trauma in adults are abdomens after motor vehicle accidents. Solid-organ blunt abdominal trauma includes most commonly the liver, but also the spleen, and kidneys. Blunt trauma to the liver usually results in venous hemorrhage versus arterial and is managed conservatively. Pathophysiologic effects of hemorrhage are similar to penetrating trauma. Of note, the most common cause of traumatic injury to the spleen is blunt trauma.

Internal hemorrhage is an obvious concern with blunt abdominal trauma, but inflammation accompanied by edema is a common underlying effect. There are four cardinal signs of inflammation mediated by different factors: redness, swelling, pain, and loss of function. In response to the traumatic injury, mast cells are signaled to release histamine and bradykinin. Both of these mediators cause vasodilation and increased blood flow. Bradykinin also sensitizes nerve endings leading to pain. The edema associated with acute inflammation occurs due to endothelial contraction and endothelial damage. The disruption of the endothelial lining of the vessels makes them “leaky,” allowing a shift of fluid from postcapillary venules into the interstitial space.

Neurologic injury can also be sustained by blunt trauma. Epidural hematomas, secondary to skull fractures, are caused by arterial rupture, most commonly the middle meningeal artery. The middle meningeal artery is located behind the pterion, which is thin, making it susceptible to injury. Since arteries are under high pressure, expansion of the hemorrhage occurs quickly versus a subdural hematoma, which is under venous pressure. Expansion of the hemorrhage can eventually lead to an uncal herniation.

**Deceleration Trauma**

Deceleration trauma is an injury caused by a sudden stop in motion. Like the two previously discussed categories of trauma, deceleration trauma also affects different organ systems. Acceleration-deceleration injury to the brain resulting from the motion of the brain hitting one area of the skull and bouncing back, hitting the direct opposite side of the brain on the other side of the skull.
