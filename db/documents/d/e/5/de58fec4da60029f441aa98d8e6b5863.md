The uterus includes both the body and the cervix, with the body being composed of smooth muscle and the cervix predominantly collagen. The cervix undergoes dynamic changes during pregnancy and labor, such as shortening, thinning, and dilating. Mechanical and pharmacological methods of labor induction can be used to make these physiological cervical changes occur.
