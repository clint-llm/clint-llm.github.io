The workup and evaluation of esophageal cysts include imaging/diagnostic procedures guided by history and physical examination findings and specific histopathologic characteristics. Imaging studies such as chest radiographs and barium swallow studies can reveal a mediastinal mass with esophageal compression along with tracheal displacement and narrowing.

Computed tomography (CT) of an esophageal cyst can reveal a fluid-filled cystic structure arising from the esophagus that does not enhance after intravenous administration of contrast material. A benefit of CT includes the ability to rule out a lung and thoracic vertebral pathology along with providing anatomical landmarks if pursuing surgical intervention.

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the modality of choice to evaluate esophageal cysts. EUS can further characterize the echogenicity of the lesion.

The criteria for classifying an esophageal cyst include the following

- The cyst is within or attached to the esophageal wall.

- Two muscle layers cover the cyst.

- The lining is squamous, columnar, cuboidal, pseudostratified, or ciliated epithelium.

The combination of imaging and histopathology contributes to the diagnosis of esophageal cysts.
