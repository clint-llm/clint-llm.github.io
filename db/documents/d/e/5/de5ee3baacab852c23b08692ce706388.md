DeLancey demonstrated that normal pelvic support is provided by the interaction between the levator ani muscle group and connective tissue attachments that stabilize the vagina at varying levels. Any weakness or tears within the connective tissue leads to the varying pathology of pelvic floor defects.

With normal pelvic support, the vagina lies horizontally on top of the levator ani muscles. Damage causes the levator ani muscles to become more vertical in orientation, opening the vagina, and thus shifting support to the connective tissue attachments.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common condition that is multifactorial in etiology.
