The mainstay of management of patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome includes surveillance, prevention of manifestations of the condition, and treatment of complications.

**Surveillance**

Peutz Jeghers patients may develop GI polyposis as early as 10 years old, with the small intestine as the most common site. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate the small intestine with upper endoscopy in addition to colonoscopy beginning in early adolescence.

Due to the increased risk of malignancy in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, surveillance recommendations include the following:

**Upper GI Tract 
**

Upper endoscopy

- Baseline screening beginning at 12 years old

- If polyps found repeat annually

- In absence of polyps, repeat every 2 to 3 years into adulthood

**Colorectal
**

Colonoscopy

- Baseline screening beginning at 12 years old or earlier if reported symptoms

- If polyps found repeat annually

- In absence of polyps, repeat at 1 to 3-year intervals

**Pancreatic
**

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and/or endoscopic ultrasound: Beginning at 25 to 30 years old; Repeat every 1 to 2 years

**Breast
**

Breast examination: 6-month clinical breast examination beginning at age 25

Breast mammogram: Beginning at age 25**Gynecologic**

Papanicolaou smear: Annually

Transvaginal ultrasound: Consider yearly transvaginal ultrasound beginning at the age of 18

**Testicular
**

Consider annual examination and yearly ultrasound beginning at age 10.

**Prevention**

Genetic counseling is recommended for individuals that have a family history of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and are planning to have children

In female patients with Peutz Jeghers, prophylactic mastectomy to manage the increased risk for breast cancer and hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy after childbearing completion or age 35 to prevent gynecologic malignancy could be considered.
