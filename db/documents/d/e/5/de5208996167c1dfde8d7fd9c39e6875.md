It is important to note that while it is the leading primary cardiac tumor, it is a rare tumor with an incidence of less than 0.1%. Typically identified incidentally on transthoracic echocardiogram, papillary fibroelastomas should be evaluated initially by a cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon. PFEs do not typically have symptoms unless they embolize and cause arterial occlusion in the organ bed. If PFEs embolize to the coronary arteries, this will lead to myocardial infarction. If it embolizes to the brain, it may cause a stroke. However, there are no clearly identifiable risk factors for the development of PFE.
