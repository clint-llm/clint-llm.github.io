As with other overuse injuries, limitation of provocative maneuvers such as repetitive loading and traction of the AC joint can prevent worsening of DCO. Young athletes who participate in sports with repetitive overhead movements benefit from cross-training in other activities with less loading of the AC joint. A specifically identified risk factor is high-intensity bench pressing a one-rep max of more than 1.5 times bodyweight.

Low-intensity bench press was not a risk factor in this study. However, the risk of DCO increased with bench pressing frequency (more than once per week), intensity (more than 1.5 times body weight), and duration (more than five years), both individually and with cumulative risk.

Additionally, avoiding over-reliance on push-ups, dips, and straight bar bench pressing for chest and triceps strengthening can help limit AC joint stress. Substitution of a cable crossover, dumbbell decline, incline, and narrow grip bench press can be preventative and risk-mitigating following diagnosis.
