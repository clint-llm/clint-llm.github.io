# Continuing Education Activity

Anesthetic considerations for surgical interventions on the laryngeal structures necessitate the maintenance of ventilation. Jet ventilation is often used, in addition to spontaneous ventilation. Complications from airway management and laser use may arise. This article describes anesthetic management concerns for laryngeal surgery and highlights the importance of communication among the inter-professional team in the care of patients undergoing laryngeal surgery, especially concerning airway management strategies and fire risk mitigation.

**Objectives:**
- Review the components of anesthesia for laryngeal surgery.
- Describe the unique challenges anesthesia providers face during laryngeal surgery.
- Identify the risks for airway and operating room fire and utilize recommended preventative techniques.
- Summarize common indications for anesthesia for laryngeal surgery.

# Introduction

Laryngeal pathology can be related to trauma, infection, malignancy, or, in children, congenital malformation of laryngeal structures.

Four methods have been devised to secure the airway and deliver oxygen to patients undergoing laryngeal surgery: mechanical ventilation, spontaneous ventilation, subglottic jet ventilation, and intermittent apneic anesthesia. Complications can arise from each ventilation strategy. Interdisciplinary planning and communication are key so that necessary adaptations can occur intraoperatively.

# Issues of Concern

**Laryngeal Anatomy**

The laryngeal structures are composed of a cartilaginous skeleton, musculature, as well as a mucosal lining. The larynx functions in phonation, airway maintenance and protection, and the generation of the Valsalva maneuver. The anatomical structures of the larynx include cartilage, vocal folds (or cords), muscles, and innervation.

**Preanesthetic Assessment and Surgical Considerations**

A medical history and focused physical examination should be performed, with a special focus on the airway and medical conditions associated with complications during or following the procedure. In addition, airway assessment, including review of radiologic studies, should be performed with identification of any possible difficulties and risk factors during anesthesia, as patients undergoing head and neck procedures are predisposed to airway difficulties.

During laryngeal surgery, the surgeon and anesthesiologist share the airway. Thus, anesthesia management requires close coordination with the surgeon. A preoperative discussion of airway management device selection, intubation technique(s), ventilation strategy, neuromuscular blockade, fire risk, and table orientation should occur.

**Common Procedures**

Phonosurgery includes procedures intended to treat voice disorders, including hoarseness and changes in laryngeal sound production.

**Laryngoplasty**

Procedures may be performed to improve respiratory or voice function by enlarging the glottic opening or by bringing together the vocal folds. Laryngoplasty may be classified as injection or operative. Injection laryngoplasty is an endoscopic procedure for the treatment of voice disorders or glottic insufficiency. A bulking agent is injected to medialize the vocal folds, thereby improving sound quality. This procedure requires 15-20 minutes of operative time and, as a result, may be performed under local anesthesia, unless the surgical field must be immobilized or if patients are anxious about being awake. Operative laryngoscopy, or thyroplasty, may also be performed without sedation. Medialization may be performed for unilateral vocal cord paralysis, in which a permanent wedge is implanted to medialize the impaired vocal cord. This procedure takes 45-90 minutes, and moderate sedation can be used, as voice testing is often utilized during the operation. Mild postoperative throat discomfort is expected. As a result, opioids are avoided whenever possible for both injection and operative laryngoplasty.

**Laryngeal Cancer Surgery**

Anesthetic planning for laryngeal surgery must provide intraoperative ventilation and oxygenation for the patient. Choice of ventilatory mode depends on the type of laryngeal disease, patient characteristics, and the length of the procedure.

**Ventilation Technique**

The anesthesiologist and surgeon should discuss a plan for intraoperative ventilation based on the surgery planned.

Transnasal humidified rapid-insufflation ventilatory exchange (THRIVE) may be of clinical utility before securing a definitive airway in patients with reduced time to apnea (apneic window) and unfavorable pharyngeal anatomy.

**Endotracheal Intubation**

A cuffed endotracheal tube secures the airway and prevents leakage of anesthetic gas or oxygen but may interfere with visualization and dissection of the laryngeal lesion. Special care must be taken to avoid injuring laryngeal lesions during intubation. The smallest endotracheal tube (ETT) capable of supporting ventilation should be used. In most cases, a 5 or 5.5 mm micro laryngeal tube is adequate, but special attention should be made to air leaks using small diameter ETT. Laser-resistant ETT’s are used for laryngeal laser surgery to reduce the risk of airway fire. Endotracheal tube material should be selected based on the type of laser used for the procedure. Laser-resistant tubes have a larger external diameter due to the resistant coating materials.

**Intraoperative Laser Use**

Most laryngeal surgery is performed with carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers. The most commonly used laser-resistant ETT, the Laser-Flex cuffed ETT, is CO2 and KTP laser resistant and has two cuffs. The second cuff provides a backup seal in the event of damage to the proximal cuff. The cuff position should be rechecked after the patient is positioned for surgery, with special care as the laser-resistant ETTs have no depth markings. Laryngeal laser surgery is indicated to treat stenoses, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, leukoplakia, malignant or benign laryngeal tumors, or polyploid degeneration (i.e., Reinke's edema).

According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Practice Advisory for the Prevention of Operating Room Fires, the ETT cuff should be filled with saline tinted with methylene blue to alert the clinician of an ETT cuff rupture during laser surgery.

The time to ignition of OR fires caused by carbon dioxide lasers can be reduced by replacing nitrogen with helium. Fire risk can be attributed to the pervasive use of incendiary operating tools (diathermy and lasers) and the oxygen-enriched environment.

**Subglottic (transoral-translaryngeal-infraglottic access) Jet Ventilation**

Advances in jet ventilation tube design have facilitated safe anesthesia for laryngeal surgery.

The cricothyroid membrane has no blood vessels and low bleeding risk. Transtracheal ventilation should be administered in the midline. Adverse events are mainly related to the puncture through the cricothyroid membrane, mechanical problems, and low saturation. Carbon dioxide retention may occur, especially in patients with pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or obesity. Pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumothorax are rare complications of HFJV.

# Clinical Significance

Laryngeal surgery presents its unique challenges for anesthesiologists, including coordination among the surgeon and other allied health providers. The airway must be shared between the anesthesiologist and the surgeon, for instance. The treatment of common laryngeal pathology limits neck mobility and increases tissue friability. A thorough history and physical must be performed to evaluate for changes to airway friability. (For example, from radiation.)

The pathology itself (e.g., vocal cord tumor) may provide challenges to airway management and often requires visual assessment preoperatively. Numerous ventilation options exist depending on the length and unique demands of the case and the patient. Additionally, the use of lasers during laryngeal surgery presents a significant fire risk, and this must be mitigated as much as possible.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Coordination between the anesthesiologist, anesthetic providers, and the otolaryngologist is paramount during preparation for laryngeal surgery. Intubation and ventilation should be discussed, as well as extubation.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

As laryngeal surgery is an aerosol-generating procedure, the use of PPE to prevent infection control is paramount. A previous investigation analyzing communication in the pediatric operating theater during airway surgery has shown detrimental effects on communication among OR staff as a result.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring

Communication among nursing, allied health, and interprofessional team members are important. Monitoring any barriers to communication, such as PPE, as well as planning for airway management and patient positioning is integral to effective anesthesia during laryngeal surgery. Communication and monitoring of fire risk during the preoperative time out and throughout the procedure is critical to a successful surgery.
