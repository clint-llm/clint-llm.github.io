Although most hypertrophic and keloids scars are diagnosed clinically, a biopsy may be necessary, especially if one of these lesions continues to grow or change. There are a few entities to keep in mind that may mimic a hypertrophic scar or keloid clinically and/or histologically. These include, but are not limited to: sarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, dermatofibroma, nodular scleroderma, and infectious processes such as a lobomycosis.
