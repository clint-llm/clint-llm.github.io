**Serous Cystadenoma**

Benign serous tumors of the ovary represent 16% of all ovarian epithelial neoplasms and account for two-thirds of benign ovarian epithelial tumors and the majority of serous ovarian tumors. They occur in adults of all ages, with reported mean ages differing from 40 to 60 years.

**Mucinous Cystadenoma**

Benign mucinous cystadenomas account for 80% of ovarian mucinous tumors. Mucinous cystadenomas of the ovary occur mainly in during the third to sixth decades, but they may also occur in younger women.

**Endometrioid Cystadenoma**

Endometrioid epithelial tumors account for 2 to 4% of all ovarian tumors. They usually occur in the fourth and fifth decades.

**Clear Cell Cystadenoma**

Clear cell cystadenoma is very rare with very few cases reported in the literature.

**Seromucinous Cystadenoma**

Seromucinous cystadenoma occurs in adults with a peak in the late reproductive age group.
