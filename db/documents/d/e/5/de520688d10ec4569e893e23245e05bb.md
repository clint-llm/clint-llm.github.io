Kyrle disease is characterized by transdermal elimination of keratotic material with no collagen or elastic fibers. This differentiates Kyrle disease from other acquired perforating disorders that exhibit transdermal elimination of collagen and elastic fibers. These include reactive perforating collagenosis, elastosis perforans serpinginosa, and perforating folliculitis. In addition, there is an overlying keratotic plug in an atrophic-appearing epidermis. A foreign body granulomatous reaction composed of dermal histiocytic and lymphocytic infiltrates may be present. Orthokeratosis, parakeratosis, and abnormal keratinization may also be observed.
