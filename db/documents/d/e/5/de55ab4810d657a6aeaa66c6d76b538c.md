an interprofessional team evaluates the patient with a delayed hypersensitivity disorder. The family doctor monitors the patient in the community and transfers the patient to an allergist, infectious disease specialist, or immunologist when the essential treatment does not help. In some cases, psychological support is needed. Nurses play a critical role in the management of a patient with delayed hypersensitivity disorder. they are involved in patient education, supervising treatment, and relating changes in patient status to the team. Pharmacists review medication choices and doses, monitor compliance, and provide patient education. When there is an emergency, e.g., penicillin allergy reaction the entire professional team including physicians and nurses must be involved in care. [Level 5]
