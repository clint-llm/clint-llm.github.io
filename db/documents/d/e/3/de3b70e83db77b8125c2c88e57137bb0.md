Early detection of the underlying cause of exophthalmos is vital for resolution. Any associated swelling, pain, or erythema will be typically self-limiting after 2 to 3 months, although this may vary from patient to patient. Thyroid-related exophthalmos may take much longer, or may not return to normal, with up to 5% of cases retaining permanent diplopia, and worsening or sustaining permanent visual impairment.
