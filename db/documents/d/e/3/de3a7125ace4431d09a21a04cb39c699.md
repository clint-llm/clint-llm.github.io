One percent of the population has an aortic valve with only two leaflets. This condition is referred to as a bicuspid aortic valve. The bicuspid valve cusps are not symmetrical the majority of the time. Possible complications of a bicuspid aortic valve include aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation, usually due to early calcification. This abnormality is also associated with an increased risk of infection endocarditis. While senile calcification occurs late in life, early calcification due to a bicuspid valve usually presents by age 60 and can present much earlier. Typical treatment begins once the condition is symptomatic and usually involves valve replacement.

The presence of a quadricuspid aortic valve has a very rare percentage of findings, but it can be found during an ultrasound or a more invasive examination such as a transesophageal examination. Generally, this type of cusps leads to valve failure.
