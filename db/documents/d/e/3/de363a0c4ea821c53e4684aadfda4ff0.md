Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is one type of infectious endocarditis (IE). It accounts for 20% of all cases of endocarditis. It is important to achieve an early diagnosis and initiate the treatment as early as possible. This activity provides a review of this disease's etiology, the clinical presentation, and the appropriate management. The early diagnosis and initiation of treatment improves outcome and decreases complications and mortality.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the different types of prosthetic valve endocarditis, and explain the etiology of each type.
- Explain the clinical presentation and physical findings in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis.
- Review the appropriate steps in establishing a diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis and guide in selecting appropriate treatment. 
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies that can benefit patients who present with prosthetic valve endocarditis.
