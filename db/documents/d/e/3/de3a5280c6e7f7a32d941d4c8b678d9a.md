Four-handed dentistry is key to making dental extractions as simple as possible. The dental nurse should be aware of the instruments required to perform an extraction and be able to provide the next appropriate instrument to the dentist.

The administrative team should be aware of why patients may require certain times of day for their booking, such as morning appointments for patients on anticoagulants or with memory impairment.

The wider team should also be aware of the possible complications of dental extractions so they can appropriately triage phone calls or walk-ins from patients and highlight these to the clinician appropriately.
