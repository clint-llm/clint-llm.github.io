Failure to recognize severe symptoms of respiratory failure caused by congenital anomalies can lead to sudden death in infants. This emphasizes the importance of recognition and appropriate workup to diagnose this complex disease.

Pediatric patients with pulmonary artery sling (PAS) and tracheal stenosis can be critically ill. Some patients may need to be intubated pre-operatively.  There are many associated congenital anomalies, including cardiac and airway. Pre-operative workup and post-operative care require multiple disciplines to ensure optimal surgical outcomes.

Patients who have PAS and other associated genetic syndromes are a particularly high-risk subgroup for increased morbidity and mortality. Multidisciplinary care is essential in discussing possible staged procedures for complex cardiac lesions.
