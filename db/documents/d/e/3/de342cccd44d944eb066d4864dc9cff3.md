Adverse effects are mild at therapeutic doses and are mostly limited to gastrointestinal disruptions such as nausea and diarrhea. The serious adverse effects of ciprofloxacin include prolonged QT interval, hyper or hypoglycemia, and photosensitivity.

FDA  boxed warnings include tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy and neuropsychiatric adverse events, and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis. The most common type of tendon rupture involves the Achilles tendon. There have also been reports of tendinopathies in the gluteal, iliopsoas, and triceps tendons**.**The use of steroids and advanced age increased the risk of tendonitis. Upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases leading to collagen degradation is a possible mechanism for tendinopathy.

Aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection have been associated with the use of fluoroquinolones. Prolonged fluoroquinolone therapy and older age are the associated risk factors. Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately if there is a suspicion of aortic dissection.
