A proper knowledge of anatomical landmarks and its variations prior to implant placement is indispensable to ensure a precise surgical procedure and safeguard the patient against iatrogenic complications. The precise evaluation of distinct anatomical factors such as the position of the mandibular canal, maxillary sinus, the width of the cortical plates, the existing bone density, etc. is very important in appropriate implant selection and planning the most appropriate implant position in the existing clinical condition. Important anatomical structures in the maxilla are a nasal floor, nasopalatine canal anteriorly and maxillary sinus posteriorly. Iatrogenic sinus perforation is commonly encountered complication. This problem can be taken care of by selection of short implants and Sinus lift and bone augmentation procedure.

The most important anatomical consideration while placing an implant in the mandibular arch is the location of the inferior alveolar canal which contains inferior alveolar nerve and artery. Injury to these vital structures during implant placement can cause pain, altered sensation, excessive bleeding, etc. Hence it is important to determine the location as well as the configuration of the mandibular canal prior to implant placement
