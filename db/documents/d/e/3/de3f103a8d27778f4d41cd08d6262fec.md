**Safety:**Plastic and lead are commonly used to shield radiation workers from gamma photons and beta radiation. In the setting of beta particle emission, plastic as an initial absorber of beta emission shielding is important. Higher atomic materials such as lead will result in radiative interactions, which can actually increase the radiation exposure dose. However, the use of lead shielding is important in the protection of gamma photon emission and X-rays.
