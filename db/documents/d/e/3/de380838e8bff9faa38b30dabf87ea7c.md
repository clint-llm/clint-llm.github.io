Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the United States. Eighty percent of all strokes are due to occlusion of a vessel secondary to atherothrombosis or embolus. In 1961, Dr. Robert Hollenhorst defined these plaques as emboli caused by plaques of cholesterol. Hollenhorst plaques are yellow and typically located at an arterial bifurcation. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of Hollenhorst plaques and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the risk factors for developing Hollenhorst plaques.
- Summarize the management considerations for patients with Hollenhorst plaques.
- Review the presentation of a patient with Hollenhorst plaques.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance delivery of care for patients affected by Hollenhorst plaques.
