Pressure support ventilation (PSV) is a common ventilator setting for both invasive and non-invasive ventilation. Healthcare workers involved in the care of patients on mechanical ventilation should be familiar with the advantages, disadvantages, monitoring, and complications of PSV. This activity reviews the respiratory mechanics involved in delivering PSV and the indications and techniques for this mode of ventilation. It also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in delivering safe and efficacious spontaneous breathing trials with PSV.

**Objectives:**
- Describe how pressure support ventilation mode delivers breaths to the patient and the factors that determine the tidal volume and minute ventilation in this setting.
- Outline the indications and contraindications for using pressure support ventilation.
- Explain the initial ventilator settings and technique for delivering pressure support ventilation to patients with respiratory failure.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for ensuring the safety of patients on pressure support ventilation and how this relates to performing spontaneous breathing trials.
