Variations in medial meniscus shape are much less common than those found in the lateral meniscus. The medial meniscus is usually a crescent-shaped structure. However, instances of a discoid-shaped medial meniscus exist. This thicker, disc-shaped medial meniscus is an uncommon condition. The meniscal variant is typically unilateral, affecting one knee but can occur bilaterally. Individuals with a discoid medial meniscus often present with medial knee pain. Current recommendations are that symptomatic patients undergo partial meniscectomy and reshaping, while asymptomatic patients should be treated to preserve the meniscus.

The ring-shaped medial meniscus is an even rarer finding. Gines-Cespedosa and Monllau documented a patient presenting with knee locking, pain, and swelling refractory to conservative treatment. During arthroscopy, this patient demonstrated a ring-shaped medial meniscus. The patient was treated with a partial meniscectomy.
