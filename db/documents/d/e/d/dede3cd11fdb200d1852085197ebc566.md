As the mainstay of treatment for fibrosarcoma is surgical, complications are the same as any other surgery and include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues or structures, and even death.Â Adjuvant radiation therapy can further increase potential complications such as local fibrosis or increased risk of wound infection. In cases of high stage fibrosarcomas, chemotherapy may be used. Each chemotherapy agent carries its own risk profile, but doxorubicin, which is the mainstay of treatment, is classically associated with an increased risk of dilated cardiomyopathy.
