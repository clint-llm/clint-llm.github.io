Differential diagnosis includes other optic neuropathies such as:

- Demyelinating optic neuritis

- Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease

- Toxic optic neuropathy

- Compressive optic neuropathy

In addition, maculopathies and nonorganic vision loss should be considered. Clinical history, symptoms, and imagining should be utilized to differentiate LHON from these other optic neuropathies.
