Chemotherapy with one or multiple agents was the standard of care when SPTCL and primary cutaneous gamma delta T-cell lymphoma were thought to be the same disease.  Disparities in prognosis prompted the distinction of these two entities in the 2008 revision of the WHO. No standard treatment approach currently exists for SPTCL. Studies have shown that most cases are successfully treated with systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents such as etoposide, cyclosporine A, methotrexate, chlorambucil, and bexarotene

Conventional doxorubicin-based chemotherapy may be employed when the disease is progressive
