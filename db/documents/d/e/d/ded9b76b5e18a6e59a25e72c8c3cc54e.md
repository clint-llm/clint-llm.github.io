Transient tachypnea of the newborn is a common condition seen in newborn babies. Healthcare workers including intensive care nurses need to know that the cause is due to fluid accumulation in the lungs. The condition is usually managed by an interprofessional team as there are many disorders which can present with similar symptoms. The condition, once diagnosed, is treated conservatively with oxygen, antibiotics, and sometimes with the use of a diuretic. The prognosis for most infants is excellent.
