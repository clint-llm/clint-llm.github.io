Cushing syndrome due to PPNAD must be treatedÂ to control the consequences of cortisol over-secretion. Bilateral adrenalectomy is the most common treatment although, under certain circumstances, ketoconazole or mitotane has been used as anti-cortisol treatment.

- Fine needle aspiration is indicated for patients with thyroid nodules. Patients with lesions suspicious for malignancy should be referred for surgery.

- Few Carney patients with acromegaly have an aggressively growing tumor that will require surgery followed or not with irradiation treatment. Treatment of acromegaly with somatostatin analogs may also be used either as a primary treatment or as an adjuvant to trans-sphenoidal surgery.

- Large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumors (LCCSCTs), especially when bilateral, are benign and require imaging surveillance alone. If measures of tumor markers or imaging features indicate a suspicion for malignancy, then testicle-sparing surgery may be considered for small tumors to allow for histopathologic examination. There are a few reports of pre-pubertal boys with LCCSCT treated with aromatase inhibitors

- Malignant LCCSCTs usually occur in older patients and in those who have the unilateral and unifocal disease. Orchiectomy is the treatment of choice for malignant LCCSCTs.

- Cardiac myxoma: Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for cardiac myxomas. They may recur in affected patients; follow-up monitoring is required.

- Psammomatous melanotic schwannomas are treated with complete surgical resection with tumor-free margins. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be required for malignant tumors

- Genetic testing for mutations in the protein kinase A type I-alpha regulatory subunit (PRKAR1A) is indicated for other potentially affected family members of patients with Carney complex. However, clinical surveillance is advisable for at-risk family members even when a PRKAR1A pathogenic variant is not identified.

- When neither parent of an individual with Carney complex has the pathogenic gene variant or any clinical features of Carney complex, the affected patient has likely a de novo mutation.
