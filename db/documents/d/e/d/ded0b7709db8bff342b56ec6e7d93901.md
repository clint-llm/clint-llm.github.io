The prognosis of various types of an intraocular hemorrhage depends on the location of bleed, amount of bleed, the severity of the condition, rate of clearing of blood, whether the blood is obscuring the visual acuity or not, associated complications along with the hemorrhage (corneal staining, tractional retinal detachment, pre retinal fibrosis, ischemic optic atrophy, neovascular glaucoma)and severity of involvement of the macular region.

Hyphema, if not associated with other vision-threatening complications, is having a relatively good prognosis. More the grade of Hyphema, the higher the chances of glaucoma and the less chance of recovery to normal vision.

According to a study by Sanders et al., blood from the vitreous cavity clears at the rate of 1% per day.

Prognosis of vitreous hemorrhage due to posterior vitreous detachment is good.

Prognosis of vitreous hemorrhage or hyphema due to trauma depends on the associated complications associated with the traumatic insult. Choroidal rupture at the macular region is associated with a bad prognosis.

Terson syndrome, anemic retinopathy, ValsalvaÂ retinopathy have a relatively good prognosis.

Hemorrhage due to wet ARMD, PCV has a relatively bad prognosis as chronic heme collection at the macula leads to damage of the photoreceptor layer and scarring.

Prognosis of retinal vein occlusion depends on the severity of the ischemic stimulus. Ischemic CRVO has the worst prognosis of all types of RVO. The prognosis of Nonischemic BRVO is the best. If retinal vein occlusion is associated with macular ischemia, the prognosis is bad.

Prognosis of retinal hemorrhage secondary to systemic metabolic dysfunction or retinal venous occlusions depends on the degree of resolution of the underlying pathologic condition.

Traumatic retinal hemorrhages usually have a good prognosis if not associated with choroidal rupture involving the macular area.

Subhyaloid hemorrhage if treated early with Nd: YAG hyaloidotomy is associated with a better prognosis.

Prognosis of suprachoroidal hemorrhage, either intraoperative or postoperative, is guarded and depends on preoperative visual acuity and occurrence of retinal detachment along with the suprachoroidal hemorrhage.

Disc hemorrhage is associated with the possibility of glaucoma, and the prognosis of the condition depends on the progression and severity of glaucoma.
