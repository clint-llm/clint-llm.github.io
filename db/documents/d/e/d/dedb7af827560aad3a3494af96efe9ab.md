Depending on the level of compression, inflammation, or trauma, neurapraxia, axonotmesis, or complete neurotmesis can occur.

Neurapraxia results in temporary damage to the myelin sheath but leaves the nerve intact. Recovery is usually complete.

Axonotmesis involves the interruption of the axon and myelin. But the connective tissue is preserved.  Wallerian degeneration occurs. Electromyography (EMG) performed 2 to 4 weeks later shows denervation potentials called fibrillations and positive sharp waves in the involved muscles distal to the injury site.

Axonotmesis is usually the result of a more severe crush or contusion but can also occur when the nerve is stretched (without damage to the epineurium). Through regeneration, the nerves attempt regrowth distally as fast as 2 to 3 mm per day or as slowly as 1.5 mm per day. Regeneration occurs over weeks to years.

Neurotmesis is an injury in which the nerve is completely divided, such as in penetrating trauma. There is no intact myelin, and axons are completely disrupted. Endoneurium tubes and connective tissue components are damaged, disrupted, and/or transected, and the perineurium may be preserved. Recovery has no potential to occur without surgical re-anastomosis.
