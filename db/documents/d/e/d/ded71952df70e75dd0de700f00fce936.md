The obstetrician, maternity nurse, and labor & delivery nurse should all be familiar with Rhesus incompatibility. One of the main principles of the management of Rh incompatibility is the prevention of maternal sensitization. Rh D immunoglobulin (RhIg) has made a significant impact on preventing Rh disease. RhIg consists of anti-Rh D antibodies that target Rh-positive erythrocytes to prevent maternal sensitization. It has reduced the rate of alloimmunization from 16% to less than 1%. Furthermore, RhIg immunoprophylaxis has decreased the prevalence of HDN attributed to anti-D antibodies to less than 1%. An interprofessional team approachÂ will diminish complications from this disorder. [Level 5]
