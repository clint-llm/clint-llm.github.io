Early range of motion and potential strengthening should be planned. The electrodiagnostic study may assist in helping plan as to whether or not the patient will be needed for long-term bracing and or whether or not the weakness is likely to get worse or spread to other motor groups. Early placement into the ankle dorsiflexorÂ brace improves gait mechanics, decreases falls and helps to minimize other secondary musculoskeletal complaints from the altered gait cycle.
