The **hypoglossal nerve (CN XII)**provides motor innervation to all of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue except for the palatoglossus muscle, which is innervated by the**vagus nerve (CN X)**.

Taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is achieved through innervation from the **chorda tympani nerve**, a branch of the**facial nerve (CN VII)**.**lingual nerve**, a branch of the**mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3)**.

On the other hand, taste perception in the posterior third of the tongue is accomplished through innervation from the **glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX)**, which also provides general sensation to the posterior one-third of the tongue.**internal laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve (CN X)**.
