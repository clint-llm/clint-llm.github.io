A clear liquid diet is a specific dietary plan that consists solely of liquids/semi-liquids that are fully clear. Some items that may be permitted include water, ice, fruit juices without pulp, sports drinks, carbonated drinks, gelatin, tea, coffee, clear broths, and clear ice pops. Items can have color as long as they are transparent. Items such as milk and orange juice are not considered clear liquids because they are not fully transparent and may take more effort for the digestive system to break down, whereas grape juice is allowed (it is pigmented but fully transparent). Depending on individual patients' dietary restrictions, selected food items may be allowed, such as honey and clear hard candies. The clear liquid diet assists in maintaining hydration, provides electrolytes and calories, and offers some level of satiety when a full diet is not appropriate but may struggle to provide adequate caloric needs if employed for more than five days.
