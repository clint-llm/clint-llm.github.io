Suboccipital puncture and lateral C1-C2 cervical puncture are procedures that can be associated with many serious complications; one of them is vertebral artery damage. Thus it is imperative to evaluate the indications and perform a thorough anatomical assessment of the patient before the procedure. A collaborative approach is an ideal way to limit the complications of this procedure. Before the procedure, the patient should have the following done:

- Evaluated by the pulmonary and cardiologist to optimize lung and heart function

- Discuss with the neuroradiologist the pertinent anatomy to prevent complications

- Be assisted by the nurse for education about the procedure and intraprocedural assistance

- Seen by the anesthesiologist if sedation is necessary

- Be consulted by the pharmacist for post-op headache management, antiemetics, and the use of blood thinners if needed

An interprofessional team that provides an integrated approach to pre and postprocedure care can help achieve the best possible outcomes. Collaboration shared decision making, and communication is a crucial element for a good result.
