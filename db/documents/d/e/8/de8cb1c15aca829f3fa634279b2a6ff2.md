The decision of whether to treat dAVFs is based on the patient's symptoms, medical comorbidities, and risk of intracranial hypertension or hemorrhage. Lesions that are asymptomatic and low-grade tend toÂ have a benign natural history and are generally managed conservatively with serial monitoring.

Surgical treatment involves the surgical disconnection of the fistula from the cortical venous system. Occasionally, skeletonization of the dural sinus with disconnection of the dural arterial supply, packing of the sinus, or resection of the involved dura is performed. Surgery is usually indicated in cases in which endovascular approaches have failed or can not be performed. In addition, those involving the floor of the anterior cranial fossa are usually treated surgically.

Endovascular surgery using embolic material or coil occlusion can involve transvenous, trans-arterial, direct access, or a combination of techniques to block the abnormal connection in the blood vessels.

Stereotactic radiosurgery achieves excellent rates of obliteration for low-grade lesions but is less effective for higher-grade lesions. Radiosurgery is most often utilized for low-grade (Borden type I) dAVFs with persistent symptoms such as pulsatile tinnitus. It can also be used for dAVFs with unfavorable anatomy for other interventions, patients with significant medical comorbidities, or as salvage therapy for lesions incompletely treated with surgery or endovascular embolization.
