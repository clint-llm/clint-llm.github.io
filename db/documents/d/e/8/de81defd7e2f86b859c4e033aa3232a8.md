Tetanus vaccineÂ is a type of artificial active immunity. This type of immunity produces antibodies when a dead or weakened version of C. tetani is inoculated. Thereby, when there is actual exposure, the immune system will recognize the antigen and will rapidly produce antibodies. Antibodies wane over time, so periodic vaccines will be needed to boost the production of antibodies.
