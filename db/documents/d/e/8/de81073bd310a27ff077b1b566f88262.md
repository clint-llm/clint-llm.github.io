Along with the remainder of the nervous system, the embryologic beginnings of the PFC start at week three within the neural plate. With continued development, the neural plate forms the neural groove which then seals off from the amniotic fluid to form the neural tube. In the fourth week of gestation, the prosencephalon bulges laterally out of the rostral neural tube; this further differentiates into the telencephalon which becomes the cerebral cortex. Like the rest of the central nervous system, the PFC has an initial overgrowth of neurons and their synaptic connections, and extensive pruning of the excess occurs in utero and during early childhood to create adult-like delineated pathways.
