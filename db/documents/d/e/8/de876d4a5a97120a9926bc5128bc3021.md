This article is intended to be a short review of circumcision. As part of the education, the reader must be aware of the evolving view of circumcision. The AAP revised its 1999 policy on circumcision to be more pro-circumcision. This statement has reignited the debate.

The anti-circumcision papers cite many reasons not to undergo the procedure. Bringing female circumcision to the mainstream has placed male circumcision under a similar spotlight. The procedure is described as a painful procedure that is needed to push the male into manhood. This trauma can then lead to sexual difficulties. It has been proposed that the procedure should be delayed until the male can decide for himself.

Healthcare professionals do not all agree with disease prevention benefits. The HIV reduction is most prevalent in decreasing heterosexual transmission in regions with large HIV population, for example in parts of Africa). Thus, this fact needs to be included in the counseling conversation with families who are not from these regions.

HPV transmission can be reduced by circumcision. This point may become obsolete with the increased use of the HPV vaccine.

Providers must be educated about and understand religious doctrines, research findings, and cultural teachings surrounding circumcisions. The data must be provided to each family in an unbiased version. The provider must also be able to relate the data to the unique family situation.
