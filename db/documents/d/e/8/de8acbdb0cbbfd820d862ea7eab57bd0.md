It is essential to ensure that all airway equipment is at the patient's bedside before performing the tube exchange.

In addition to having airway equipment ready, place the patient on continuous pulse oximetry, cardiac monitoring, and capnography, if available, to confirm tube placement.

Identify the tracheostomy tube model and determine its size. Most tracheostomy tubes have three standard components: an outer cannula, an obturator, and an inner cannula

Inspect all equipment for proper function, including the replacement tube cuff for leaks and the obturator for ease of insertion and removal

Anesthesia is generally not required for tube exchange.

Inspect all equipment for proper function, including the replacement tube cuff for leaks and the obturator for ease of insertion and removal. Coat the replacement tracheostomy tube with a water-based lubricant

It is important to ensure that consent is appropriately obtained from the patient prior to the procedure.

The key to preparation is the positioning of the patient.

The bed should be adjusted to an adequate height without any obstruction in the way of the practitioner, such as bed rails or tables. The patient should be supine with the neck in hyperextension over a shoulder roll or pillow so that the tracheal orifice is closer to the surface with the neck structures stretched adequately.

A right-hand dominant practitioner should stand to the right of the patient, and the reverse is recommended for a left-hand dominant person. An assistant should stand on the opposite side, ready to assist before tube change occurs. Usually, the assistant provides suction and helps with securing the tube.

It is good practice for practitioners to rehearse or verbally go through the steps with their assistant prior to the procedure, as this makes sure that they are familiar with the steps and are able to coordinate accordingly with each other.
