Isolated sternal fractures have an excellent prognosis, with an overall mortality rate of 0.7%. Most patients with these solitary injuries recover completely over the average reported ten weeks. Surgical fixation is necessary in rare cases of chronic sternal pain or nonunion. Up to two-thirds of sternal fractures have associated injuries, with mortality ranging from 25% to 45% in these cases.
