The primary indication for facial nerve repair is a Sunderland Class V injury to the main trunk or an extratemporal branch of the facial nerve. When the injury occurs intraoperatively, the severity may be self-evident and primary repair may be undertaken at the time of injury; this approach is preferred. However, some facial nerve injuries are not apparent until after emergence from general anesthesia, either immediately upon awakening or in a delayed fashion. When paralysis is delayed, the nerve is intact; repair or transfer is unnecessary. If, on the other hand, the paralysis is complete and immediately apparent upon awakening but was not identified intraoperatively, it may be prudent to evaluate the severity of the axonal injury 3 to 5 days later via ENoG and proceed with repair or transfer only if testing reveals a greater than 90% reduction in CMAP amplitude compared to the uninjured side. In cases of facial trauma, particularly lacerations, a similar process may be followed to determine candidacy for surgical intervention. Nerve injuries occurring medial to the lateral canthus do not need to be explored or repaired; the nerve branches in that region are small enough that coaptation is very challenging, and there is enough redundancy of the branches that spontaneous recovery is all but assured.

There must be viable distal and proximal segments of the nerve if either primary coaptation or interposition grafting is to be attempted. Facial paralysis due to a very proximal nerve injury, as at the CPA, or central nervous system pathology, such as a cavernous brainstem hemangioma, is better addressed with nerve transfer techniques. When considering nerve repair or transfer, there must be a target muscle expected to remain viable long enough to accept axonal ingrowth weeks to months after the procedure. While muscle typically undergoes atrophy and fibrosis after 12-18 months of denervation, this is not consistently the case. There are anecdotal reports of successful reinnervation years after a facial nerve injury. Generally, the muscle will be viable if the repair or nerve transfer is performed within six months of the injury; nerve transfer will likely be more successful than repair in such cases.

Axons regenerate at approximately 1 mm/day, although many factors may affect this rate, including age, nutritional status, and general health. Therefore, a rough estimate of the time it will take for axons to travel from the repair site to the target muscles can be obtained by measuring the distance from the point of repair or transfer in millimeters.

An algorithm is provided to guide the selection of evaluation and management techniques for patients with facial nerve trauma (see image). In brief:

- If the proximal and distal nerve stumps can be approximated without tension, direct end-to-end coaptation is indicated.

- If the proximal and distal nerve stumps can be approximated within 6 mm of each other without tension, coaptation using a nerve connector is indicated.

- If both stumps are accessible but cannot be approximated without tension, an interposition nerve graft is indicated. Interpositional grafting most commonly utilizes the greater auricular or sural nerve and should ideally only be performed when the duration of paralysis is one year or less.

- If greater than 50% of the diameter of the nerve has been disrupted, as in a drill injury during mastoidectomy, the injured segment should be resected and primary neuorraphy performed when possible; an interposition graft may be used if necessary.
