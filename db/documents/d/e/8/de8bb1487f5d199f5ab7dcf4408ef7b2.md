The patient complains of unilateral pain in the foot and ankle and numbness in the sole. Besides, calcaneal sensory brunches are affected in lesions within or proximal to the tarsal tunnel, presenting sensory loss in the heel. A physical examination may reveal a positive Tinel’s sign over the tibial nerve at the medial malleolus and sensory changes along the plantar surface of the foot. Gastrocnemius normal strength and normal ankle reflex with weakness of the intrinsic foot muscles help localize the lesion.
