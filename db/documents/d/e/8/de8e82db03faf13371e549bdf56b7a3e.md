Patients with medulloblastoma were traditionally stratified into average-risk or high-risk groups based on three primary characteristics: (1) age, (2) extent of residual tumor post-op, and (3) degree of dissemination at the time of diagnosis. Patients who were at least three years old at diagnosis, had, at most, 1.5 cm of postoperative residual disease by MRI, and those who had no extraneural metastases were categorized as average-risk. The rest were high-risk.

This traditional risk stratification discounted the influence of tumor histology on tumor behavior and impact on patient prognosis.Â Recent transcriptional profiling studies derived from microarray data of large numbers of patients with medulloblastoma revealed clusters of patients with similar transcriptomes, proteomes, and cytogenetic signatures involving unique signal transduction pathways. This has led to the currently accepted classification system of medulloblastoma into four primary subgroups: (1) SHH, sonic hedgehog, (2) WNT, wingless; (3) non-SHH/WNT group 3; and (4) non-SHH/WNT group 4.

Using a combination of molecular profiling and histology, the World Health Organization (WHO) presently divides medulloblastoma into five subtypes

- WNT-activated with classic histology

- SHH-activated (wild-type TP53), with classic, desmoplastic/nodular, or large-cell/anaplastic histology

- SHH-activated (mutant TP53), with classic or large-cell/anaplastic histology

- non-WNT/non-SHH, group 3, with classic or large-cell anaplastic histology

- non-WNT/non-SHH, group 4, with classic or large-cell/anaplastic histology
