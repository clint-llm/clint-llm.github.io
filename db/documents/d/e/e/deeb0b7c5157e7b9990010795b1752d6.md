Torsades de Pointes is a type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia characterized on electrocardiogram by oscillatory changes in amplitude of the QRS complexes around the isoelectric line. Torsades de Pointes is associated with QTc prolongation, which is the heart rate adjusted lengthening of the QT interval. The rhythm may terminate spontaneously or may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Torsades de Pointes and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain risk factors for developing Torsades de Pointes.
- Identify Torsades de Pointes on an electrocardiogram. 
- Explain how to manage Torsades de Pointes.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by Torsades de Pointes.
