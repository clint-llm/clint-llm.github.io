Syndactyly is one of the most commonÂ congenital anomalies of the extremities. Syndactyly refers to the soft tissue and/or osseous fusion of adjacent digits in either the upper or lower extremity. This results in the appearance of "webbed" or "super" digits depending on the extent of the anomaly. Syndactyly is described as simple or complex, depending on the presence (complex) or absence (simple) of bony fusion. Complete syndactyly extends to the tip of the digits with the inclusion of the nail folds, while incomplete syndactyly does not extend the full length of the digit. Complicated syndactyly is defined by the presence of interposed accessory phalanges or abnormal bones.
