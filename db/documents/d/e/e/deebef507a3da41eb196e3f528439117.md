Multiple feedback mechanisms in humans regulate GnRH activity and have implications on sexual development, breastfeeding, menstruation, and fertility. Prolactin is a hormone that exhibits inhibitory effects on GnRH, thus inhibiting FSH and LH production by the anterior pituitary. In females, this ovulatory inhibition leads to lactational amenorrhea, which acts as a physiologic contraceptive. In addition to lactation in females, prolactin inhibition of GnRH can result in infertility in males due to decreased spermatogenesis.

Pharmacologically, GnRH agonists are associated with a decrease in uterine fibroma volume and have been used as presurgical treatment.
