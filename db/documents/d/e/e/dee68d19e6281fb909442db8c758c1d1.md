Cervical ectropion isÂ most commonly asymptomatic. In symptomatic cases, females may present with any of the following:

- Vaginal discharge. It is the most common symptom to manifest. The vaginal discharge is non-purulent and maybe white or yellow. The surface area of the mucus-secreting columnar cells is increased; therefore, women with cervical ectropion experience excessive vaginal discharge.

- Postcoital bleeding. It is seen in 5 to 25 percent of women with cervical ectropion. The fine blood vessels in the epithelium are torn very easily during sexual intercourse, leading to postcoital bleeding.

- Intermenstrual bleeding

- Dyspareunia

- Pelvic pain

- Recurrent cervicitis

- Backache

- Micturition disturbances

The everted columnar epithelium appears reddish on speculum examination, arranged in a ring around the external os. The postcoital bleeding and reddish appearance of the cervix on the speculum exam may be confused for the early signs of cervical cancer. Cervical ectropion is not an early sign or a symptom of cervical cancer.

The presentation of symptomatic cervical ectropion and desquamative inflammatory vaginitis may overlap. Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis is chronic vaginitis with vaginal discharge, vulvovaginal discomfort, dyspareunia, erythematous macules on the cervix, on speculum examination. No causal relationship between cervical ectropion and desquamative inflammatory vaginitis has been found.
