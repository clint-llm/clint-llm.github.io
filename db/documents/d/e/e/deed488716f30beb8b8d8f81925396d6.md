On histopathological examination, hyperkeratosis of the nipple and areola exhibits orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, as well as filiform acanthosis, papillomatosis, and keratin plugging. There is also hyperpigmentation and elongated interconnected rete ridges. In the dermis, perivascular lymphocytic infiltration is frequently observed. These findings are nonspecificÂ of hyperkeratosis of the nipple and areola as they may be observed in other dermatoses such as acanthosis nigricans, seborrheic keratosis, and epidermal nevus.

Four reported cases of hyperkeratosis of the nipple and areola exhibited, in addition to the classic histological features, epidermal lymphocytic infiltrates mimicking Pautrier abscesses usually seen in mycosis fungoides. In these patients, no other cutaneous changes ordinarily found in mycosis fungoides could be seen.
