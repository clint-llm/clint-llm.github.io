Prompt diagnosis of priapism allows for the correct treatment. This requires an integrated interprofessional team to communicate effectively and initiate treatment plans in a timely fashion. This will help decrease delay of diagnosis and treatment of priapism, which will improve outcomes and prevent further erectile dysfunction associated with long-standing priapism. With continued erectile function, this decreases further interventions and costs to the healthcare system. Also, knowing when not to perform an intervention decreases the pain and risks to the patient.

An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach to priapism can help achieve the best possible outcomes. Treating priapism in a timely manner using injection and aspiration prevents the progression of erectile dysfunction. Therefore, with timely treatment, further intervention for erectile dysfunction can be prevented, improving patient satisfaction and decreasing the risk to the patient.

Collaboration, shared decision making, and communication are key elements for a good outcome. The interprofessional care provided to the patient must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to planning and evaluation of all joint activities. The earlier signs and symptoms of a complication are identified, the better is the prognosis and outcome of the procedure. [Level 4]
