Myoclonus is defined as rapid, brief, jerky, or shock-like movements involving muscle or group of muscles. Among all hyperkinetic movement disorders, Myoclonus is considered to be the most rapid and brief. When caused by sudden muscle contraction, it is known as "positive myoclonus," while a brief loss of muscular tone results in "negative myoclonus" as in asterixis. Myoclonus is classified in different ways according to its physiology, anatomical site of origin, and etiology. As with most movement disorders, myoclonus can be focal, multifocal, segmental, or generalized, and can be one of the signs in a wide variety of nervous system disorders.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of myoclonus, depending on the underlying etiology.
- Outline the components of proper evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with myoclonus, including any indicated laboratory and/or imaging studies.
- Discuss available treatment and management options for myoclonus, based on underlying etiologies.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by myoclonus.
