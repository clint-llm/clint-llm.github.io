Both serum and heparinized plasma are suitable specimens for measuring cortisol in the blood.

Urinary free cortisol can be measured by immunoassay or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods. These procedures require an extraction step using methylene chloride, and it is customary to monitor the efficiency of the extraction technique by extraction of a urine control with known cortisol concentration.

Immunoassays are the main methods for the estimation of cortisol in clinical laboratories. These immunoassays are competitive immunoassays, where cortisol in the sample competes with labeled cortisol for a limited number of anti-cortisol antibodies.

Chromatographic methods are an alternative to immunoassay for the determination of cortisol. They have the advantage of less interference, but these methods are time-consuming and unsuitable for routine analysis.
