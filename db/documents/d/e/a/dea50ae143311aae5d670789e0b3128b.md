Endometrial polyps refer to overgrowths of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine cavity. Endometrial polyps vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. Polyps may be found as a single lesion or multiple lesions filling the entire endometrial cavity. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of endometrial polyps and explains the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for developing an endometrial polyp.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with endometrial polyps. 
- Describe the typical imaging findings associated with endometrial polyps.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for surgical management of endometrial polyps and improve outcomes.
