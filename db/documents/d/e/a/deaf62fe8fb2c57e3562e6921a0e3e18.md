The tyrosine kinase inhibitors are usually prescribed for malignancies in patients where age is a non-modifiable risk factor. The majority of patients are diagnosed with cancers, such as NSCLC, at an older age. Patients diagnosed withÂ tyrosine kinase inhibitor keratitis are over the age of 60, with no significant difference in gender or ethnicity. However, due to the rarity of this pathology, further studies should be done to determine the precise age at symptom presentation and diagnosis.
