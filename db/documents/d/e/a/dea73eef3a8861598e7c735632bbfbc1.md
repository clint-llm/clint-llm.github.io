The differential diagnosis of popliteal fossa masses includes both arterial and non-arterial pathologies as well as popliteal artery aneurysms. Rare popliteal artery pathology most commonly locatedÂ in the behind the knee includes cystic adventitial disease and the popliteal entrapment syndrome. Both conditions usually present with chronic symptoms of claudication. However, the most common cause of a popliteal fossa mass is the Baker cyst, which is a benign swelling of the semimembranosus, or, more rarely, some other synovial bursa, found behind the knee joint. Orthopedic causes include prepatellar bursitis and meniscal cysts.
