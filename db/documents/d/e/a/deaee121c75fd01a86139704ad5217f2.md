Initial evaluation of the Barton fracture begins with radiographs of the wrist, consisting of at least frontal and lateral views. Oblique views of the wrist oftenÂ are obtained and may assist in the diagnosis. The radial height inclination, ulnar variance, and articular step are measured on an anteroposterior radiograph. Volar tilt, coronal split, and comminution are visible on lateral radiographs. The radius is 23 degrees inclined in the coronal plane and has an 11 degrees tilt in the sagittal plane. The radius height is approximately 11 mm and ulnar variance ranges from -2mm to +2mm. A radiograph of the unaffected side can be used as a benchmark to see how well all values have returned to normal ranges. An important prognostic factor for wrist arthritis and pain-free range of motion is articular congruity of the distal radius.
