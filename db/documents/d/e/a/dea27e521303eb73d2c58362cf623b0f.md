Physical therapists largely implement vestibular rehabilitation exercises, but the overall goal is for patients to return to activities of daily living (ADL); an occupational therapist may also utilize vestibular treatments with proper training.

Should additional ancillary testing be required or in the cases of significant underlying pathologies or surgical interventions, medical professionals, including neurologists, otolaryngologists, specialized vestibular centers, and appropriate surgical teams, would be necessary.
