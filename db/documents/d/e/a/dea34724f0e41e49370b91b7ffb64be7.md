CEA is predominantly metabolized in the liver. Therefore, hepatic and biliary dysfunction can be associated with elevated levels causing false positives. Because of high first-pass hepatic metabolism, significantly elevated levels correspond to either CEA-producing tumors or metastases outside portal venous drainage territory. Tumor differentiation can also affect the CEA levels, with higher CEA levels seen in well-differentiated cancers.
