Central venous catheters (CVC) are frequently used in critical care units, hemodialysis units, and oncology units for the administration of intravenous fluids, medications, blood products, parenteral nutrition, vasoactive medications, hemodialysis, and hemodynamic monitoring. Unfortunately, the presence of indwelling CVCs increases the risk of the formation of thrombi, emboli, and infection than patients with peripheral catheters by 200%.

Central line infections are more common than any other healthcare-related infection and account for 33,000 deaths per year. Additionally, CVC infections are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, length of stay, healthcare costs, diagnostic tests, and antimicrobial use. The development of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) may increase the patientsâ€™ length of stay by up to three weeks for an average additional healthcare cost of $33,000.

Recommendations have been established and published by the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to guide health care providers in the use of evidence-based practices for central line care.
