Differential diagnosis (see the figure of conditions that can cause epiphora) should include the evaluation of acquired lacrimal sac fistulae, which tend to occur after the spontaneous drainage of a lacrimal abscess with a history of trauma, such as a naso-orbito-ethmoidal centrofacial fracture. Other conditions may include anatomical abnormalities of the lacrimal apparatus, such as congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction and mucoceles, which may cause chronic epiphora, mimicking a congenital lacrimal fistula.

Isolated lacrimal fistulae should be differentiated from fistulae in the context of Down syndrome, VACTERL (vertebral defects, anal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula, esophageal atresia, and radial dysplasia) syndrome, and from those arising in clefting syndromes, such as EEC (ectrodactyly–ectodermal dysplasia–cleft syndrome). Another differential diagnosis to consider is the coexistence with CHARGE (coloboma, refractive errors, strabismus, microphthalmia, and ocular movement disorders) syndrome.
