Tendon rupture usually is the result of underlying tendinosis or a weakened tendon. Chronic inflammation, such as patellar tendonitis, leads to a weakened tendon and can increase the likelihood of tendon rupture. Certain medical conditions can lead to an overall weakened tendon and can also predispose an individual to tendon rupture.
