Hypogammaglobulinemia is a disorder caused by low serum immunoglobulin or antibody levels. Immunoglobulins are the main components of the humoral immune system and are able to recognize antigensÂ to trigger a biological response and eradicate the infectious source. Hypogammaglobulinemia is the most common primary immunodeficiency and encompasses a majority of immune-compromised patients.

This condition predisposes children and adults to recurrent infections, allergies, neoplasms, and autoimmunity. Previous clinical findings suggested these disorders develop in childhood, however, this is now increasingly seen in adult medicine.
