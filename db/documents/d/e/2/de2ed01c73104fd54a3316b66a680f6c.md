Surgical site infections may occur for various reasons, including, but not limited to, incorrect antibiotic usage. When considering antibiotic prophylaxis practices, the correct antibiotic dosage, timing of the initial dose, and timing of any applicable redosing are major factors to review to ensure best practices are always followed. If an institution recommends a specific antibiotic in surgery when additional antibiotics are options, monitoring should ensure no surgical site infections occur due to increasing local resistance. One example could be that growing clindamycin resistance has translated to increased surgical site infections in those receiving clindamycin due to a penicillin allergy. That information could lead an institution to switch to vancomycin instead of clindamycin in that patient population. Antibiotic selection should also be reviewed to avoid using antibiotics, resulting in new or worsening resistance patterns identified on the antibiogram. An institution may choose to use cefoxitin instead of ertapenem in colorectal surgeries to avoid excessive usage of the carbapenem class when applicable, especially if the institution has an escalating number of carbapenem-resistant organisms.
