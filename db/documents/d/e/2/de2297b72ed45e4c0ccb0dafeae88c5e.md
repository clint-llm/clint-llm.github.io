Acute otitis media (AOM) is defined as an infection of the middle ear and is the second most common pediatric diagnosis in the emergency department following upper respiratory infections. Although acute otitis media can occur at any age, it is most commonly seen between the ages of 6 to 24 months. Approximately 80% of all children will experience a case of otitis media during their lifetime, and between 80% and 90% of all children will have otitis media with an effusion before school age. This activity reviews the etiology, epidemiology, evaluation, and management of acute otitis media and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe a patient presentation consistent with acute otitis media and the subsequent evaluation that should be performed. 
- Explain when imaging studies should be done for a patient with acute otitis media.
- Outline the treatment strategy for otitis media.
- Employ an interprofessional team approach when caring for patients with acute otitis media.
