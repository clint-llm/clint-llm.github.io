As previously discussed, multiple values of Vd can be calculated depending on the intrinsic drug kinetics (single vs. multiple compartment models) as well as the phase of drug kinetics following drug administration (distribution phase vs steady state vs terminal elimination phase). However, from the clinical perspective, the single most important utility of Vd is **calculating the loading dose of a drug**.

The loading dose is best calculated using the Vd at steady state (Vss) as it is the most representative of the specific drugs pharmacokinetic properties at desired steady-state plasma concentration. Therefore, the loading dose can be calculated using the following equation:

- **Loading dose (mg) = [Cp (mg/L) x Vd (L)] / F**
- Cp represents the desired plasma concentration of drug 
- Vd represents the volume of distribution
- F represents the bioavailability of drug (IV administration = 1)

After administration of a loading dose, additional maintenance doses can be administered to maintain the desired plasma concentration of the drug. Unlike, the loading dose, which is dependent on the drug's Vd, the maintenance dose is dependent on clearance (Cl).

- **Maintenance dose rate (mg/hr) = [Cp (mg/L) x Cl (L/hr)] / F**
- Cp represents the desired plasma concentration of drug 
- Cl represents the clearance rate of drug
- F represents the bioavailability of drug (IV administration = 1)

Key differences between loading doses & maintenance doses include:

- The **loading dose**is contingent on the**volume of distribution**while**maintenance doses**are dependent on**plasma clearance.**

- The **loading dose**is only required for**a few drugs in certain situations**while**maintenance doses**are required for**most drugs**to maintain the steady-state plasma concentration.
- Loading doses are usually indicated in clinical scenarios where a drug needs to reach steady-state rapidly.

- Ex, antiepileptic administration during an active seizure or aspirin loading during a suspected myocardial infarction

- **Loading dose****rarely** needs to be**modified**while**maintenance doses****need to be adapted** depending on **various characteristics of the patient.**
- Because maintenance doses are dependent on drug clearance which is a variable dictated by each individual patient, maintenance doses are often variable as certain patients may take less or more time to clear a drug from the plasma.

- E.g., renal failure patients will take longer to eliminate a drug in the urine. Therefore maintenance dose is corrected based on the patient's renal function. In these cases, the loading dose will remain the same, and the maintenance dose will undergo correction (decrease amount of drug per hour or increased time interval between doses).

Although drugs have inherent properties that govern the Vd, the patients also represent variables that can alter the apparent Vd. Therefore, the apparent Vd of certain drugs **may vary significantly**between patients depending on each patient’s**individual physiology**and/or**pathophysiology**. For example:

- **Pediatric vs. adult dosing**– Body composition changes with aging and therefore, drug distribution will be affected meaning that loading doses will vary between pediatrics and adults.

- **Obesity vs. Normal BMI**–  The loading doses of drugs such as anesthetics may be dosed based on different weight scalars such as total body weight vs. ideal bodyweight depending on the pharmacokinetics of specific drugs to prevent over or underdosing.

- **Conditions affecting plasma protein concentration**– The excess or deficiency of plasma proteins (e.g., albumin) may affect the amount of drug that remains in the plasma and therefore the apparent Vd.

Understanding volume of distribution is important for both physicians and pharmacologist who prescribe and dose medications. Differentiating pharmacologic agents who have high versus low volume of distributions is essential in appropriately dosing medications for patients. While physicians generally dose medications in low complexity cases, patients in the intensive care unit might need their medications dosed by a pharmacist. Understanding and calculating different models of distribution, the factors that can affect the volume of distribution, loading dose, and maintenance doses can mean the difference between life and death. When dosing medication, it is of the utmost importance to promptly consult an interprofessional group of specialists.
