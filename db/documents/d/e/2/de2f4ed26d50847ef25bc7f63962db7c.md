Once bowel obstruction is diagnosed the care is usually interprofessional. Besides a general surgeon, a gastroenterologist, radiologist, oncologist, dietitian, nurse, and physical therapist are usually involved in the management. After treatment, surgical recovery can be long depending on the cause. Patients who have had an ileostomy or colostomy need to be followed by a stoma nurse. A dietitian should be consulted to educate patients with stomas on the type of foods they can eat. Since most patients are frail, physical therapy should be involved to help with functional recovery.  Patients with bowel obstruction as a result of cancer need follow up to ensure that they receive the right treatment.

**Outcomes**

The morbidity and mortality after large bowel obstruction depend on the cause and presence of other comorbidities. The key is time to treat; in most cases, early treatment results in better outcomes. Mortality is significantly higher when there is bowel perforation or necrosis. Mortality rates of 15-30% have been reported in patients with perforation following large bowel obstruction. Recent use of self-expandable metallic stents for malignant bowel obstruction have yielded good short-term results, but long-term survival is not greatly altered.
