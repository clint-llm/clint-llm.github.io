The blood supply to the falciform ligament is variable but is generally supplied by the left inferior phrenic and/or middle hepatic arteries. The left inferior phrenic vein drains the falciform ligament. The superficial lymphatics of the liver drain the lymph from the falciform ligament. Because of its close association with the liver, it is possible to have infections and malignancies spread to the falciform ligament via its blood supply and/or lymphatics. The porta hepatis, which carries the neurovascular bundle containing the common hepatic duct, proper hepatic artery, hepatic portal vein, and autonomic axons into the liver, is located in a fissure on the inferior aspect of the far left side of the right lobe. Because of the proximity of the porta hepatis to the round ligament of the liver, infections or carcinomas in the porta hepatis can travel to the falciform ligament.
