It is often difficult and awkward for many primary care physicians to verbally inquire about their patient's sexual health. This is understandable based on cultural norms and potential embarrassment. We have found the following phraseology to be very acceptable when vocalized in a way that indicates, by intonation, the questioner is expecting that everything will be OK. "How is your sex life? Everything working OK for you?" Men without a sexual problem are likely to respond with a quick "everything's fine" as a response.  If the patient hesitates with his response or indicates that things are "not like they used to be", this should indicate that there is a potential sexual disorder that warrants further inquiries and investigation.

**Psychogenic ED and Mental Health**

It's very helpful to distinguish between obvious psychological and organic causes of ED as well as to verify that the patient actually has erectile dysfunction and not another type of sexual disorder such as premature ejaculation. Careful questioning should be able to determine if the patient has actual, organic erectile rigidity failure or some other sexual problem. Items in the history that point towards a psychological etiology include: sudden onset of the erectile dysfunction (especially if related to a new partner or a major life-changing event), situational ED, normal erections with masturbation or a different partner, the presence of good morning erections and high daily variability in erectile rigidity. Obvious cases of psychogenic ED should be referred to an appropriate mental health professional. Even without obvious psychological issues, involving mental health experts can help deal with associated problems such as reducing performance anxiety, promotion of treatment adherence, improving relationship issues, identifying interpersonal conflicts, and setting realistic expectations for the couple.

It is often difficult and awkward for a physician to recommend a mental health evaluation for a patient, especially at their first visit.  We have found a few ways to explain and justify a mental health consultation that make it easier for the patient to accept the referral:

- A mental health assessment is part of our routine evaluation; we recommend for everyone with ED.

- It's just for a one-time evaluation; an opinion. If no problems are found, that's it.

- It's just like a blood test; if everything is normal, we go on and if not, we deal with it.

- We take vital signs (blood pressure and temperature) at every office visit for the same reason; because problems in these areas are not always obvious, yet if not diagnosed and treated they can cause the patient serious harm.

- Most patients with ED will not have an underlying psychological cause, but just having ED will damage relationships, increase stress, diminish self-esteem, and create anxiety; all of which interferes with a successful outcome.

- Identifying any emotional, anxiety, or relationship issues early means they can be dealt with properly and, if nothing is found, we just go on.

**Blood Testing**

There are no specific tests absolutely required for the initial evaluation of ED, but many physicians will order routine blood testing to include a complete blood count and electrolytes as well as baseline renal and liver function tests, HgbA1c to screen for diabetes mellitus, and a lipid profile. Checking a morning testosterone level is recommended by the 2018 AUA Guidelines on Erectile Dysfunction, but some experts feel it is not absolutely necessary unless there are other symptoms suggestive of hypogonadism, such as loss of sexual desire or testicular atrophy on physical examination.  However, if not measured initially, a morning testosterone level should certainly be checked to rule out hypogonadism if patients fail oral PDE-5 ED therapy.

Other blood tests that may reasonably be requested include LH and prolactin (if hypogonadism is found) and sickle cell in the African/Caribbean patient. Thyroid function (TSH) may also be optionally measured.

Patients with abnormal laboratory testing are referred back to their primary care for further evaluation and treatment.

In our specialty clinic, we routinely order a complete blood count (CBC), a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP which includes liver and renal function), a lipid profile, TSH level, HgbA1c, and a morning testosterone assay on all new patients presenting for evaluation of their ED unless these tests have been recently performed and the results known.

**Shared Decision Making**

The currently recommended approach to the patient with erectile dysfunction, according to the 2018 AUA Guidelines Statement on ED, is by Shared Decision Making, where the physician informs and educates the patient and his partner, using the best available evidence, about the various, appropriate treatment options available to them and whether any further diagnostic testing is reasonable or advisable. A frank discussion about the pros and cons of testing and treatment ultimately leads to an informed patient's choice that corresponds to the couple's values and preferences.

The basis for this approach is that, with the possible exception of psychotherapy for purely psychogenic ED, there is no effective cure for erectile dysfunction, so identification of the underlying cause is only useful for detecting other potential health issues and comorbidities. Given this fact, the focus changes from expensive diagnostic testing, that will not significantly affect the outcome, to facilitating patient treatment selection after a frank and detailed discussion of his reasonable therapeutic options. With this in mind, no other investigations are generally required for patients with ED, although specialized testing may be helpful in selected individuals.

**Further Testing (Optional)**

All of the following tests for patients with ED should be considered optional for selected patients only.

Penile Biothesiometry is a simple office screening test for penile neuropathy using skin vibrational threshold sensitivity. The blunt tip of a vibrating probe is sequentially placed on the right and left shaft as well as the glans. The intensity of the vibrations is varied and the patient is asked to indicate when he just begins to feel the tip vibrating. The minimal intensity of the probe vibrations that the patient can detect would be his threshold vibrational sensitivity which can be compared to normal standards. Five separate readings are done at each site and the results averaged; then compared to normal values based on age.

Nocturnal Tumescence Testing (NPT) is helpful in differentiating psychogenic from organic erectile dysfunction. Testing involves measuring the frequency, tumescence (circumference changes), duration, and maximal rigidty of nocturnal erections. Nocturnal erections require complete functioning of the neurovascular axis and normally occur during REM sleep. A normal functioning male has between 3 and 6 erections a night, with a mean duration greater than 30 minutes, maximal rigidity greater than 70% at both base and tip as well as an increase in circumference of over 3 cm at the base and 2 cm at the tip.

Penile Duplex Doppler Ultrasound measures arterial vascular flow and checks for cavernous veno-occlusive dysfunction (venous leak).

Cavernous veno-occlusive dysfunction (often called venous leak by patients) can also be demonstrated using ultrasound. This finding represents the failure of penile corporal rigidity despite adequate arterial inflow. It is demonstrated by rapid detumescence despite consistently normal peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities (EDV >5 cm/sec).

Dynamic Infusion Cavernosometry and Cavernosography are used for patients in whom a site-specific venous leak is suspected. This is usually for patients who have suffered pelvic/perineal trauma or those who have primary erectile dysfunction (have never been able to achieve an erection). These tests usually precede corrective vascular surgery. Two needles are placed in the penis to simultaneously infuse saline and measure intracavernous pressure. The inability to raise intracavernous pressure to match the mean systolic blood pressure with the saline infusion or the sudden fall in intracavernous pressure after stopping the saline infusion both demonstrate veno-occlusive dysfunction. Cavernosography shows the site of the veno-occlusive dysfunction.

Pudendal arteriography clearly illustrates the arterial vasculature of the penis.

Endothelial Cell Dysfunction can be tested by various means such as the penile nitric oxide release test, peripheral arterial tonometry, and flow-mediated dilation. There are also various serum markers such as C reactive protein, endothelin 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 as well as the presence of endothelial progenitor cells and microparticles.
