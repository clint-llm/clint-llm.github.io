The management of neck trauma can be challenging and sometimes overwhelming, as this anatomical region contains many vital structures. These structures may pose a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma in the emergency department.

**Neck Anatomy**

For descriptive and clinical management purposes**,**the neck is divided into three zones: zones 1, 2, and 3. In penetrating trauma, zone designations have anatomic, diagnostic, and management implications. Since the zone system is helpful in guiding management decisions, it is preferable to employ the zone system when describing traumatic injuries. Understanding the anatomy of the neck, especially the location of important structures, is essential to providing optimal care.

Zone 1: This is the area between the clavicles and the cricoid cartilage. This zone contains vital structures which include the innominate vessels, the origin of the common carotid artery, the subclavian vessels and the vertebral artery, the brachial plexus, the trachea, the esophagus, the apex of the lung, and the thoracic duct. Furthermore, surgical exposure and access can be difficult in this zone, because of the presence of the clavicle and bony structures of the thoracic inlet.

Zone II: This is the area between the cricoid cartilage and the angle of the mandible. The following structures are located here: the carotid and vertebral arteries, the internal jugular veins, the trachea, and the esophagus. This zone has comparatively easy access for clinical examination and surgical exploration. It is the largest zone and the most commonly injured in the neck.

Zone III:  This is the area between the angle of the mandible and the base of the skull. This area contains the distal carotid and vertebral arteries and the pharynx. Since it is very close to the base of the skull, this area is less amenable to physical examination and difficult to explore during surgical evaluation.

Anatomically, the neck is also described in triangles. The sternocleidomastoid muscle separates the neck into two triangles. The anterior triangle contains most of the major anatomic structures of the neck including the larynx, trachea, pharynx, esophagus, and major vascular structures. The posterior triangle contains muscles, the spinal accessory nerve, and the spinal column.
