The etiology of bullying is complex and may depend on multiple issues including individual, social, and family issues. It is important to understanding these hidden causes that increase the risk of bullying.

**Victims**

Although there are many causes of bullying, certain risk factors may attract bullies to their victims.

- Children who are different from their peers

- Children who are weaker (than bullies)

- Children who are socially isolated, less popular, and have few friends

- May have underlying feelings of personal inadequacy

**Bullies**

These children may have the following characteristics:

- Increasingly aggressive behavior and can beÂ easily frustrated

- Tendency to blame others for their issues

- Unable to accept responsibility for their actions

- May be overly competitive and worry about their reputation or popularity

- May have friends who bully others

- May perceive hostile intent in the action of others

- May have a desire for power or dominance

It is not necessary that a bully is stronger or bigger than their victim. The power imbalance can be due to many things including popularity, strength, or cognitive ability. Bullying behavior may be used to gain social status.
