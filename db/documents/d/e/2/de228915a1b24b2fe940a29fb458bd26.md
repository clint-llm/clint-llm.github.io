Hormonal deficiencies, such as low production of TRH or CRH, can cause central hypothyroidism or adrenal insufficiency, respectively. These may result in systemic complications such as heart problems and elevated cholesterol in the case of central hypothyroidism and low blood pressure and electrolyte disturbances in the setting of adrenal insufficiency. In those cases with a small production of GHRH, complications will include weakness, short stature, osteoporosis, and high cholesterol. Pituitary sex hormones and oxytocin deficiencies will produce complications or infertility, erection problems, breastfeeding problems, labor difficulty, osteoporosis, and decreased sexual stimulation and response.

For structural causes of hypothalamic dysfunction, as seen in patients with a brain tumor, the complications associated are elevated intracranial pressure, seizures, blindness, or visual field defects.
