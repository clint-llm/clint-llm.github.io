Diagnosis of acute myocarditis is challenging because of variable presentation and symptomatic overlap with other clinical entities. Acute myocarditis should be particularly suspected in patients with clinical signs and symptoms of the disease in absence of conventional risk factors for coronary artery disease, especially in young patients. A preceding acute febrile illness or viral prodrome or signs and symptoms of connective tissue disease should lead to the suspicion.

The following investigations provide a comprehensive diagnosis and evaluation of acute myocarditis:

1. **Complete blood picture**: leukocytosis or occasionally eosinophilia (in eosinophilic myocarditis).

2. **Inflammatory reactants**: elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin, or interferon levels. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

3. **Cardiac markers**: More than half of patients with biopsy-proven myocarditis have elevated Troponin-I or T levels (good specificity but low sensitivity). An elevated pro-Brain natriuretic peptide may also be found.

4. **EKG**: often shows nonspecific ST changes; however, it may also show sinus tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, or bradyarrhythmia. There may be evidence of intraventricular conduction delay signifying diseased myocardium. Changes may also be suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome. In the presence of pericarditis, there can be diffuse ST elevation.

5. **Chest radiograph**: is neither sensitive nor specific for myocarditis but may show an enlarged heart size, pulmonary vascular congestion, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusion.

6. **Echocardiogram**: This is a readily available bedside investigation tool to assess myocardial function. It assesses the degree of myocardial damage and denotes the presence of valvular heart diseases or intracardiac thrombus. The ventricle dimensions are usually preserved in patients with fulminant myocarditis, whereas the septal thickness is increased. There is normal septal thickness and increased ventricle dimensions in acute myocarditis.

7. **Cardiac magnetic resonance**(CMR): has emerged as a promising tool to evaluate patients with suspected myocarditis. Both T1 and T2 criteria are used in the updated Lake Louis criteria for diagnosing myocarditis.

8. **Coronary angiography**: this is the gold-standard test to rule out the presence of coronary artery disease, particularly if the clinical picture mimics acute coronary syndrome. CT coronary angiography (CTCA) may alternatively be used in patients with the absence of conventional contraindications.

9. **Viral antibody titers:**are elevated at least four-fold in the acute phase. However, antibody testing is infrequently used. The specificity is low and often can result in a delay in diagnosis without any change in management.

10. **Endomyocardial biopsy:**Endomyocardial biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing myocarditis. According to the consensus scientific statement, the class I indication for EMB is evidence of new-onset heart failure with a duration of fewer than two weeks, with preserved ventricle dimensions but compromised hemodynamics. EMB also has a class I indication in patients with new onset heart failure of 2 weeks to 3 months duration, dilated ventricle, evidence of tachyarrhythmia or bradyarrhythmia, and failure to respond to therapy in 1-2 weeks. Other indications include anthracycline toxicity, restrictive cardiomyopathy with no identifiable cause, arrhythmias with no identifiable trigger or cause, etc.
