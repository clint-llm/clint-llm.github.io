The cranial foramina are best categorized according to their anatomical position within the cranial cavity floor. There are three distinct sections of the cranial fossae: anterior, middle, and posterior. Each of these regions contains a network of structures that are essential for day-to-day functioning.

**Anterior fossa**

The anterior fossa is composed of three specific bones: frontal, ethmoid, and lesser wings of the sphenoid. Together, these bones comprise the shallowest recess of the cranium. Specifically, the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone is porous in its structure and allows for the passage of olfactory axons of cranial nerve (CN) I through its many foramina into the nasal mucosa. These axons are responsible for the sense of smell. As scents are detected, information gets relayed from the olfactory axons into the olfactory bulb where the sensory input will transfer along the olfactory tract to the entorhinal and piriform cortex of the brain.

Before focusing on the middle fossa, a transition area between the anterior and middle fossae known as the superior orbital fissure merits examination. While not defined as a strict foramen, its function is similar, and it is included when discussing the cranial foramen. Its shape differs in that it is more oblong and furrowed. A pair of superior orbital fissures are situated bilaterally between the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone superiorly and the greater wing of the sphenoid bone inferiorly, the fissure allows motor innervation to the ocular muscles, sensory innervation to lacrimal glands and portions of the face. Anatomically, the following structures are in order from superior to inferior:

- Lacrimal nerve

- Frontal nerve

- Superior ophthalmic vein

- Trochlear nerve (CN IV)

- Superior division of the oculomotor nerve (CN III)

- Nasociliary nerve

- Inferior division of the oculomotor nerve (CN III)

- Abducens nerve (CN VI)

- Branch of inferior ophthalmic vein

**Middle Fossa**

Similar to the anterior fossa, the middle cranial fossa is also composed of three specific bones: the sphenoid and the paired temporal bones. It is home to neurovascular structures important for supplying sensory innervation the face, the sense of vision, and blood to the cranium.

The sphenoid bone houses the following structures through the various foramen:

- Optic canal-optic nerve (CN II) and ophthalmic artery

- Foramen rotundum-maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V)

- Foramen ovale-mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) and lesser petrosal nerve

- Foramen lacerum-cartilage containing space that allows passage for the greater petrosal nerve

- Foramen spinosum-middle meningeal artery and vein and the meningeal branch of CN V

The temporal bone transmits the internal carotid arteries bilaterally through their respective carotid canals before forming the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) on either side. The MCAs then connect and form the circle of Willis that will supply the brain with blood.

**Posterior fossa**

Like the anterior and middle fossae, the posterior cranial fossa is also composed of three specific bones: the paired temporal bones and the occipital bone. It is the deepest of the fossae and is responsible for several passages that contain neurovascular bundles in each region of the fossa.

The temporal portion of the posterior fossa contains the following structure:

- Internal acoustic meatus-facial nerve (CN VII), vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII), vestibular ganglion, and labyrinthine artery

The occipital portion of the posterior fossa contains the following neurovascular structures:

- Jugular foramen - divided into three portions

- Anterior-inferior petrosal sinus
- Middle-glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), vagus nerve (CN X), the descending portion of the accessory nerve (CN XI)
- Posterior-sigmoid sinus at the junction of the internal jugular vein

- Hypoglossal canal- hypoglossal nerve (CN XII)

- Foramen magnum-the largest of the cranial foramen and contains the following structures:

- Medulla
- Paired vertebral arteries
- Paired anterior spinal arteries
- Paired posterior spinal arteries
- Ascending portion of CN XI
- Dural veins
