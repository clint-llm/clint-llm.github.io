Retrognathia is a term used to describe a mandible that is posterior to and behind where it should be when viewed from a lateral vantage point. Retrognathia should be diagnosed so that associated syndromes can be ruled out. Additionally, diagnosing this condition will allow for appropriate referral for an orthodontic evaluation and surgical correction when warranted. For patients with retrognathia requiring airway management, the choice of modality for managing the airway may be affected. Finally, retrognathia can be linked to obstructive sleep apnea. This activity reviews how to properly evaluate for retrognathia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain how to diagnose retrognathia.
- Review conditions commonly associated with retrognathia.
- Outline how to minimize potential complications of retrognathia. 
- Summarize the importance of communication amongst the interprofessional team members to enhance the care of patients with retrognathia.
