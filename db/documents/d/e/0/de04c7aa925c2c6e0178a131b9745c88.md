CBTs are occasionally discovered during the second or third-trimester ultrasound. Antenatal ultrasound may show intracranial mass, hydrocephalus, polyhydramnios, among other signs. Fetal MRI is increasingly used to confirm findings visualized on ultrasound. Postnatally, common presentations are hydrocephalus, macrocrania, and localizing neurological signs.

In neonates and older children, the clinical presentation depends on the site of tumor involvement. Supratentorial tumors may present with limb weakness, convulsions, and altered level of consciousness. Infratentorial tumors commonly present with signs of raised intracranial pressure (HCP) and imbalance.
