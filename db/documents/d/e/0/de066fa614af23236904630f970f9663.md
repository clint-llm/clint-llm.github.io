Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is a complication of PID. Microorganisms associated with PID are thought to spread through one of three ways:

- Spontaneous ascending infection whereby microbes from the cervix or vagina travel to the endometrium, through the Fallopian tubes, and into the peritoneal cavity. Complications include endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, pelvic peritonitis, and FHCS.

- Lymphatic spread, such as infection of the parametrium from an intrauterine device

- Hematogenous spread, such as with tuberculosis
