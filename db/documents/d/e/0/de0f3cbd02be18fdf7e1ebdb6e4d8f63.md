As such, there are no specific diagnostic tests for acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis. Su and Liu proposed the diagnostic criteria for Sweet syndrome, which are as follows:

Major criteria

- Abrupt onset of typical cutaneous lesions

- Histopathology consistent with Sweet syndrome

Minor criteria

- Preceded by one of the associated infections or vaccinations, accompanied by one of the associated malignancies or drug exposure or pregnancy

- Fever >38 C

- Abnormal laboratory values at presentation (3 out of the 4 required) a. erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)>20mm/hour, b. leukocytes>8000/mm3, c. neutrophils>70%, d. Elevated C reactive protein (CRP)

- Dramatic response to systemic corticosteroids or potassium iodide (KI)

Based on these criteria, the essential investigations include a skin biopsy, complete blood count, ESR, CRP, liver, and renal function tests. Additional tests include thyroid function tests, rheumatoid factor, and antistreptolysin-O antibody titer.

Complete lymph node examination, examination of breasts and pelvic in female and prostate, and testicles in males, sigmoidoscopy, and positron emission tomography (PET) scan comprise the workup to rule out occult malignancy.

Although elevated levels of C-ANCA have been noted, it is no longer considered of any significance.
