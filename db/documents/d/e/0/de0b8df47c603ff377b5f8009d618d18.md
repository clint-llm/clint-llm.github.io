Parasympathetic stimulation on the urinary tract causes relaxation ofÂ internal sphincters of the bladder while contracting the detrusor muscle, allowing urination. Conversely, sympathetic stimulation of the urinary tract contracts the internal sphincters of the bladder while relaxing the detrusor muscle, preventing urination. Ureters receive sympathetic innervation from T10 to L2 and parasympathetic innervation from S2 to S4.

The pelvic region is innervated by the sacral and coccygeal spinal nerves that lie extraperitoneally against the posterolateral wall.es emission, ejaculation, and vasoconstriction.

Emission is the initial phase of ejaculation where the internal urethral sphincter closes while the prostatic urethra is filled with secretions from the seminal vesicles, vas deferens, prostatic, and Cowper's glands.
