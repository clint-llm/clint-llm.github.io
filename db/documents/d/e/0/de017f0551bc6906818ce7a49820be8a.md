**Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)**

OCT is a noninvasive imaging modality that can capture detailed images of the retina and surrounding structures.

- Subretinal and intraretinal fluid

- Serous retinal pigment epithelial detachment (PED) is seen as a homogenously hyporeflective space between the RPE and Bruch’s membrane

- Fibrovascular PED (FVPED), which shows layers of moderate hyperreflectivity between the RPE and Bruch’s membrane separated by hyporeflective clefts

- Hemorrhagic PED, which appears as a large, dome-shaped, hyperreflective lesion between the RPE and Bruch’s membrane with attenuation of deeper structures

- RPE tears manifest as areas of discontinuity in a large PED; the RPE edge may be seen curled under the PED

- Disciform scarring, with subretinal hyperreflective material and loss of the ellipsoid zone

OCT angiography (OCT-A) is a newer technology that creates images of the retinal circulation by obtaining sequential B scans from a single area, and decorrelation signals are generated to show only areas with movement (i.e., flow-through vessels).

**Fluorescein Angiography (FA)**

FA should be considered early in diagnosing wet ARMD to prevent an error in diagnosis. OCT, the most frequent imaging modality used to make retreatment decisions in wet ARMD, is 85% sensitive yet only 48% specific for diagnosing active wet ARMD.

- Classic CNV is characterized by well-demarcated areas of hyperfluorescence present in early phases of imaging with mid and late leakage.

- Occult CNV is characterized by either 1) an FVPED that demonstrates stippled hyperfluorescent dots with pooling, with or without leakage, or 2) late leakage of an undetermined source (LLUS), often presenting as speckled hyperfluorescence with subretinal pooling of dye

- Retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP) is characterized by anastomosis between retinal and choroidal vessels and shows early hyperfluorescence, intraretinal hemorrhage, and vessels diving at right angles from the retina to the area of CNV

- Serous PED can present with early, bright hyperfluorescence that is uniform in appearance and demonstrates little to no leakage

- Hemorrhagic PED is characterized by the blocking of underlying choroidal fluorescence

- Drusenoid PED, with only faint fluorescence and lack of late staining or leakage

- Speckled hyperfluorescence

- Loculated fluid with pooling of fluorescein dye anterior to the area of CNV

- RPE tears manifest as early hyperfluorescence with late staining of the choroid and sclera without leakage

- Disciform scars, which may show leakage and staining or blocking if there is RPE hyperplasia

**Indocyanine Green Angiography (ICGA)**

Indocyanine green is a dye that is useful for imaging the choroidal circulation since it is highly protein-bound and less likely to leak from the fenestrations in choroidal vessels. ICGA is especially helpful in delineating occult CNV, which may manifest as either 1) a hot spot or area of early- to mid-phase hyperfluorescence, 2) a plaque or area of late hyperfluorescence, or 3) an area of poorly-defined fluorescence.
