Patients need to understand the potential perils of hyperkalemia. They can be instructed to limit high potassium foods, and the pharmacist should perform a thorough medication reconciliation to screen for drugs that may contribute to their condition. Home pulse screening should be performed if possible, and the patient must understand the importance of keeping their follow-up appointments and expect to have their potassium levels checked regularly.
