Goniometric measurements can be useful in a variety of clinical scenarios. They range from mapping the spine mobility in cases of ankylosing spondylitis to checking the range of motion of the spine after fusion surgeries for scoliosis. Improvements in the range of motion of the extremity joints can be easily noted with goniometric testing.

TheÂ overall consensus is still unsure whether or not the goniometer is a sufficiently valid and reliable device to know the effectiveness of an intervention.

The reliability of the results obtained from the goniometer might have a bearing on the type of goniometer used. There are also cases where a statistically significant difference is not observed.
