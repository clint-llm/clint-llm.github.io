The IMA arises from the aorta at the L3 level and has three main branches: the left colic, sigmoid and superior rectal. Some variability has been reported in the origin of the three branches. The left colic and sigmoid artery arise independently in 41.2% of patients and share a common trunk in 44.7% of patients. Roughly 5% of patients do not have a left colic branch.

The IMA supplies blood to the distal one-third of the transverse colon, descending colon and proximal two-thirds of the rectum.
