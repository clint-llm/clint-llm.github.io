Volumetric modulated arc therapy radiotherapy has been studied in which radiation is delivered continuously as the treatment gantry rotates around the patient. With this approach, there is a greater spread of low-dose radiation in healthy tissues.

Proton (PT) pencil scanning beam therapy provides unique depth dose characteristics of protons. There is a significant reduction of doses to adjacent critical structures proximal and distal to the target volume in comparison to more traditional treatments. This therapy allows escalation of doses delivered to the tumor and normal tissue, sparing reducing toxicity and improving quality of life. This is possible only if the proton machine employs the pencil scanning beam, which avoids the production of neutrons and reduces the dose delivered to the total body. Proton therapy is recommended in pediatric patients because of the tenfold decrease in radiation dose.
