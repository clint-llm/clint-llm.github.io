Preventing vitamin D toxicity requires the collaborative efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team, including physicians, advanced practice practitioners, clinical nursing staff, and pharmacists. Since vitamin D is commonly prescribed and available over-the-counter, prescribing clinicians need to be mindful of different high-dose formulations and recommended daily requirements to prevent medication errors and adverse outcomes.

Close collaboration among physicians, advanced practice practitioners, clinical nursing staff, and pharmacists is crucial in maintaining accurate patient medication lists. Pharmacists play a vital role in minimizing medication errors when dispensing prescriptions and should communicate with the prescribing clinician if there are concerns about prescription accuracy.

Additionally, all healthcare team members can actively educate patients on the importance of avoiding excessive use of vitamin D and other supplements. In cases where potential vitamin D toxicity is suspected, consulting the local poison control center can provide valuable guidance for appropriate treatment.
