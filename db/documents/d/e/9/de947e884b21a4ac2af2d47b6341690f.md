There are many drugs with a side effect profile that could be exacerbated by hyperbaric oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is frequently used in the treatment of post-radiation injuries, and many of these patients have also undergone chemotherapy as a part of their treatment regimen, raising the concern for potential side effects with hyperbaric oxygen.Â Three important drugs to evaluate:

- **Bleomycin**: Pulmonary toxicity is the reason concurrent use of bleomycin and hyperbaric oxygen therapy is contraindicated. It is considered safe to proceed with hyperbaric oxygen treatment if it has been at least three to four months post bleomycin administration.

- **Doxorubicin**: Cardiac toxicity is the reason concurrent use of doxorubicin and hyperbaric oxygen therapy is contraindicated. It is considered safe to proceed with hyperbaric oxygen treatment if it has been at least three days post doxorubicin administration.

- **Cisplatin**: Impaired wound healing is the reason concurrent use of bleomycin and hyperbaric oxygen therapy is contraindicated. Proceed with treatment in emergent situations and when it has been an extended period from cisplatin administration.
