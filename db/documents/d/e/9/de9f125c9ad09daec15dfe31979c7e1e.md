The most commonly reported complications are related to barotrauma of the ears and/or more rarely the sinuses. There is a concern for oxygen toxicity which is reported very rarely, and no cases of recurrence or resulting sequelae have been reported. Another rare possible complication is barotrauma to parenchymal lung tissue from blebs or emphysematous bullae resulting in pneumothorax, but this also is a very rarely reported complication. One review of complications in 782 patients involving 11,376 HBO2 treatments showed 17% had experienced some ear pain or discomfort, but the barotraumatic injury was verified in only 3.8%of all patients. No barotrauma or teeth or sinuses were identified. Four patients experienced oxygen seizures, but none of these had recurrences or sequelae. Other known complications include a possible worsening of existing cataracts and a temporary change in refractory vision usually a self-limited increase in myopia resolving over several weeks post-treatment. Patients with confinement anxiety (claustrophobia) may require anxiolytic therapy.
