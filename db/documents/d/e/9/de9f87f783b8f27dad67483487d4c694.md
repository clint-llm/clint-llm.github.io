While Grave disease is the most common cause of clinically significant hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, other causes must be considered to determine if treatment is necessary.

- Gestational transient thyrotoxicosis (GTT), also known as transient gestational hyperthyroidism (TGH), is the most common cause of transient hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. It affects 1% to 3% of pregnancies and thus is encountered more frequently than Grave disease in pregnancy.

- Hydatidiform molar pregnancies are a type of gestational trophoblastic disease. Complete molar pregnancies are usually accompanied by incredibly high hCG levels and thus can have increased activation of TSH receptors.

- Single toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter involve autonomous nodules that produce thyroid hormones. These autonomous nodules are usually found in women who are at least 40 years old.

- Subacute thyroiditis, also known as DeQuervain subacute thyroiditis, is a rare cause of thyroid inflammation precipitated by a viral infection, which can cause the release of thyroid hormones.

- There can be mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor that cause resistance to thyroid hormone. This leads to increased TSH levels and a further increase in circulating thyroid hormone and increases fetal exposure to thyroid hormone. Pregnant women with thyroid hormone resistance have an increased risk of spontaneous abortion.

- There are a few rare neoplastic causes of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. Struma ovarii is a type of ovarian teratoma that contains functional thyroid tissue. This can be a rare cause of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy.

- Hyperthyroidism can also be caused by excessive intake of levothyroxine used to treat hypothyroidism.
