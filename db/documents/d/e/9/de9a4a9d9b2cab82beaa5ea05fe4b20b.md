The normal process of emmetropization starts with hyperopia in the infancy of approximately +2 D. During the first two years of life, and there is a rapid decrease in this hyperopia to approximately +1 D. The shift towards emmetropiaÂ continues at a slower rate after three years until around six years of age.

This is related to the rate of growth of the eyeball. In myopic individuals, the axial length increases at a much faster rate. Axial myopia is an increase in axial length and thinning of the sclera that is due to increased collagen degradation and reduced collagen synthesis.

Various environmental factors play a role in the development of myopia, although no clear association has been established yet. Several day-to-day activities, such as decreased outdoor time and increased near work activities, including increased use of electronic devices, play a contributory role in the development of myopia.
