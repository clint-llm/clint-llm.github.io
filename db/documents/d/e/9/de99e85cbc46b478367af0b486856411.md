The facet joint can be identified under image guidance with fluoroscopy or CT.

Once intraarticular access is confirmed, a combination of local anesthetic and steroids may be injected.****Local anesthetics provide immediate pain relief, while steroids provide longer-lasting pain relief****without the need to utilize radiofrequency ablation**.**

It is recommended to only use dexamethasone in the thoracic and cervical region to mitigate the risk of particulate-related embolic events. A previous study evaluating patients with mild, moderate, and severe lumbar facet joint osteoarthritis demonstrated significant improvement in pain scores at 3 months post-treatment with steroids.

It should be noted that intra-articular facet joint injection does not serve as a diagnostic block in preparation for radiofrequency ablation. If radiofrequency ablation of the medial branches innervating the facet joint is desired for longer-lasting relief, the prior test blocks should be done with local anesthesia only (0.25 to 0.5 ml of 2 % lidocaine or 0.5 % bupivacaine) at the level of the medial branches. Each diagnostic test block needs to provide > 80 % analgesia for the duration of the local anesthetic used.
