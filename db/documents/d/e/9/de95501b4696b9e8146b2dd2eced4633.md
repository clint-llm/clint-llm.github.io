The development of the superior oblique muscle is not unique when compared to the other extraocular muscles. Nevertheless, these extraocular muscles are unique when compared to periocular tissues in that these muscles arise from paraxial mesoderm in the prechordal plate, and not neural crest cells like their connective tissue tendons.

The unique pulley action of the superior oblique along the trochlea is due to the specialized development of the muscle. Embryologic studies show that at the early stage of development, the muscle itself, the insertion tendon, and the cartilaginous pulley travel together in a straight line. At around 12 weeks, the tendon then begins to turn around the trochlear cartilage, creating the pulley action.
