The prevalence of diabetes and chronic kidney disease is rising. Both of these are risk factors for acute kidney injury after cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary interventions. Based on current definitions the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy ranges from 2% to 30%. Most cases are completely reversible within two to four weeks. The need for renal replacement therapy is rare at a rate of 1% to 4%, and of these, less than 50% require long-term renal replacement therapy. The incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy is calculated to be more than 2% in the general population. However, in high-risk groups with risk factors for kidney disease, the incidence is as high as 20% to 30%. It is reported that there is a lower risk of contrast-induced nephropathy when low osmolar contrast media is used.

Contrast-induced nephropathy is the third leading cause of iatrogenic acute kidney injury. The commonest cause is hypoperfusion of the kidneys causing either prerenal injury or acute tubular necrosis.

In patients older than 60 years, the incidence of CIN has been reported as 8%-16%. In patients with acute myocardial infarction who undergo coronary intervention, it has been shown that the age of 75 years or more is an independent risk factor for the development of CIN.
