Tendinosis is a frequent cause of elbow pain both in athletes and the general population and is a result of overuse. Medial epicondylitis, commonly known as golferâ€™s elbow or little leaguer's elbow, represents tendinosis of the medial elbow at the origin of the flexor-pronator muscle group. The tendons most commonly involved in medial epicondylitis include the pronator teres and flexor carpi radialis.

The medial epicondyle is on the distal humerus outside of the elbow joint capsule. It serves as the origin of the ulnar collateral ligament, pronator teres, and the common flexor tendon. The common flexor tendon includes the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, flexor digitorum superficialis, and the palmaris longus. It provides stability against both valgus and flexion forces.
