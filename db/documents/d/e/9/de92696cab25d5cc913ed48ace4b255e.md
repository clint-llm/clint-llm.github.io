Cardiomyopathy associated with ATTR amyloidosis (ATTR-CM) is debilitating and has a median survival of only 2 to 6 years.

An interprofessional team is critical for diagnosing, managing symptoms, optimizing nutrition, treating with tafamidis, monitoring cardiac function, and managing the adverse effects of the treatments. Therefore, an integrated interprofessional healthcare team is required, including primary care physicians, cardiologists, neurologists, hematologists, pathologists, radiologists, nursing staff, and pharmacists. Due to non-specific clinical presentation, a high degree of clinical suspicion is necessary from clinicians. The disease is usually suspected based on symptoms, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, cardiac biomarkers, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Suspected cases of cardiac amyloidosis should undergo screening for monoclonal protein to rule out AL amyloidosis (light chain), followed by myocardial scintigraphy or cardiac biopsy as needed.

Consultation with a hematologist is necessary in case of mild or doubtful elevations of serum-free light chains. The involvement of a nuclear medicine expert is essential because scintigraphy by 99mtechnetium compound is the mainstay of an early and non-invasive diagnosis of ATTR-CM. In case of any doubt, endomyocardial biopsy and evaluation by an experienced pathologist remain the gold standard of diagnosis. Genotyping is essential after diagnosis as a TTR variant requires genetic counseling from the family members. Neurological consultation may be necessary if there is suspicion of neurological involvement, particularly in the ATTRv type.

The treating physicians and nursing staff must understand that these patients do not tolerate antihypertensive and heart failure medications. They do not offer any clinical benefit and instead can cause symptomatic hypotension. The nursing staff must give supportive treatment in consultation with the cardiologists until more definitive treatment is initiated. Tafamidis is currently the most expensive cardiovascular medication, with a yearly cost of $225,000. Therefore, clinicians must start it only after explaining the cost and expected benefit to the patient in consultation with the pharmaceutical company and the medical insurer. An integrated multidisciplinary program is required, along with a dedicated pharmacist, to ensure the availability and affordability of tafamidis.

Clinicians can advise all patients on tafamidis therapy of the availability of the Transthyretin Amyloidosis Outcome Survey (THAOS) registry and their voluntary participation.
