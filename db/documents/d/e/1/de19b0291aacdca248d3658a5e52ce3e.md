As previously mentioned, the main complication with local flaps is the loss of nipple projection with an anticipated loss of 45% to 75% projection. Blood supply to the reconstructed NAC is not always reliable in being located near or on prior scars; thus, the outcome may be unpredictable, and certain flap designs cannot be applied. Thus, inherently there is a risk for the flap and/or graft partial or complete failure. Finally, asymmetry and unacceptable cosmetic appearance to the patient are always risks to discuss preoperatively.
