Solitary lesions, which are usually sporadic and not familial, present as slow-growing, painless, round nodular lesions. They are sometimes pedunculated. Solitary lesions usually occur in older populations and do not usually grow larger than one centimeter. They are rarely painful or tender and may have a pinkish or tan coloring with a smooth surface. Small superficial blood vessels may be visualized.

Multiple cylindromas will usually occur in the setting of a familial syndrome and develop much earlier in life. When occurring in multiples, these lesions require excisions for treatment and re-excisions later in life as they often recur. Also, in syndromic patients, the cylindromas may exhibit accelerated growth and reach sizes over 20 centimeters in some cases. As they grow this large, they often will ulcerate and become painful.

Ninety percent of cylindromas occur in the head and neck region. They also can occur on the trunk and extremities, but the palms and soles are spared. A family history of multiple cylindromas should be helpful in aiding the diagnosis. Environmental factors have not been implicated in the development of these lesions.
