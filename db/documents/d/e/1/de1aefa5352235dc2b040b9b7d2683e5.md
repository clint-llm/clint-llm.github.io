Performing the McRobert’s technique requires two personnel positioned at each leg of the patient. The assistants grab and push the maternal feet cephalad — this action results in hyperflexion of the maternal hips and knees onto along with slight hip abduction resulting in the superior displacement of the pubic symphysis by 1-2 cm.  McRobert’s maneuver also results in sacral extension or counter-nutation.  As the sacrum moves posteriorly, the angle created between L5 and the sacral promontory flattens and becomes wider.  As the sacral promontory flattens, the posterior shoulder of the fetus moves posteriorly and inferiorly into the pelvis.  This positional change subsequently allows the anterior shoulder to move from under the pubic symphysis facilitating delivery.  The flattening of the sacral promontory simultaneously enables the force produced by spontaneous uterine contractions and maternal pushing efforts to be more effective.
