**Preoperative Assessment**

Every patient should have a vision examination before surgery. Basic assessment of the tear film, for evidence of lid margin and meibomian disease, is imperative.

When assessing any cosmetic patient, it is important to ask exactly what improvement the patient wishes to see. This can be done with the patient looking into a mirror and, where necessary, with the help of a clinical photograph on a big screen. Younger photographs are reviewed, as are previous surgical procedures. As chemosis is one of the commonest complications of transconjunctival blepharoplasty, the patient should have an examination for evidence of conjunctival solar damage and conjunctivochalasis.

**Sequential Assessment Performance**

**Skin**

The eyelid and surrounding skin are examined for effects of sun exposure, rhytids, laxity, and festoons. The skin turgor and tone undergo assessment, as are any vessels, pigmented lesions, or evidence of chronic edema. A history of use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines is taken on every patient as this predisposes patients to malar edema. Preoperative evidence of malar edema (with or without festoons) is a predictor of almost certain postoperative fluid and swelling in this region. Skin redundancy is assessed by the patient looking up and pinching the skin; then, the patient opens their mouth at the same time, and the pinch test is repeated. These are all subjective tests that have to consider any midfacial ptosis, solar elastosis, globe position, and prior surgery.

**Lower Eyelid Position**

The lower eyelid position should be at or just above the inferior corneal limbus. This position varies racially and depends upon the position of the globe (relative enophthalmos or exophthalmos). The position of the lower eyelid margin in relation to the limbus should be measured and documented as an inferior scleral show in millimeters if the lower eyelid is retracted. Causes of lower eyelid retraction include prior lower eyelid surgery or trauma, thyroid disease, solar elastosis, relative proptosis, and certain cicatrizing diseases like chemical burns, pemphigoid, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

**Tests for Lower Eyelid Laxity**

- The distraction test is performed by pulling the lower eyelid away from the globe with a finger. The distraction of the lid away from the globe increases with age, but a distraction of more than 6 mm is considered abnormal; this can be due to lateral canthal laxity, medial canthal laxity, or lower eyelid tarsal redundancy as may be seen in the floppy eyelid syndrome.

- The snapback test is next performed by pulling the lower eyelid away from the globe and releasing it. The eyelid should "snap" back to the globe without delay. A slow return to the globe or if the patient has to blink to allow the eyelid to oppose the globe, eludes to the presence of lower eyelid laxity. A weak snapback is present if there is facial nerve weakness; if there is orbicularis weakness, there is a cicatricial component to the anterior lamella and also in the presence of lateral and medial canthal laxity. The snapback test is always abnormal in patients with floppy eyelid syndrome.

- The gape test is not well-known, especially in general plastic surgery, and bears discussing. With normal eyelid tone, the lower eyelids move upwards in upgaze, and even with the mouth open, the lid stays snug with the globe. An increase in the scleral show on looking up or opening the mouth is a sign of lower lid laxity or retraction. If the lid stays snug with the eye with upgaze, it is graded "0," which is normal. If the lid moves away from the globe with upgaze, it is a grade "3", and if it only moves away with upgaze and opening the mouth, it is a grade "2". A grade "1" is if the lid only stays away with upgaze, mouth opening, and pulling the lid down and releasing it. This maneuver allows the surgeon to plan the best surgical approach.

- Medial canthal tendon laxity: the movement of the punctum is measured with the lower lid being pulled laterally with a finger. The punctum is used to measure the degree of lateral movement. The normal movement should be 2 to 4 mm. However, movement of the punctum beyond the medial corneal limbus (with the patient looking straight ahead) reveals medial canthal tendon laxity.

- Lateral canthal tendon laxity: similarly, the lateral canthus should move less than 2 mm when pulling the lid medially.

- Punctal eversion and stenosis: this is best noted under biomicroscopic examination. It indicates laxity with or without anterior lamellar cicatrization.

- Every eyelid procedure should have their MRD-1 (the distance between the corneal reflex and upper lid margin, where the normal is 3 to 4 mm) and MRD- 2 (the distance between the corneal reflex and the lower lid margin, where the normal distance is 3 to 5 mm) measured.

**Lateral Canthus**

The lateral canthal tendon insertion is 2 mm above that of the medial canthal tendon. In the presence of lateral canthal laxity, this lateral canthal attachment of the canthal tendon stretches (or detaches in extreme cases), and the lateral canthal position is then at the same position or lower than the medial canthal tendon. The normal distance between the lateral eyelid commissure and the lateral orbital wall is 2 to 3 mm in an adult. Any increase is an indication of stretching or detachment of the lateral canthal tendon; the lateral upper and lower eyelid angle becomes more curved ("C" shaped instead of "V" shaped). The normal lateral canthal position is about 15 degrees above the medial canthal position.

**Fat**

The prominence of the medial, central, and lateral fat pads is noted. The associated nasojugal and malar grooves undergo assessment.

**Midface**

The surface of the cornea is normally at the same position as the most prominent position of the cheek. If the cheek is recessed, it is a negative malar angle. This angle may predispose the patient to postoperative lower eyelid retraction after any of the lower blepharoplasty procedures. The cheek position and it's relation to the cornea should be assessed in every patient. The cheek prominence also varies with age and the degree to which the cheek may need to be lifted to support the lower lid. There may be a limitation to the degree to which a purely transconjunctival blepharoplasty is performable in the presence of a negative malar angle.

**Jowls**

The ophthalmologist or the oculoplastic surgeon may fail to assess the degree to which jowls are present when a patient presents for a lower blepharoplasty. In the presence of prominent jowls, there can be a secondary effect on the skin of the lower and midface, with the resultant downward pull of the lower eyelid. In such patients, care must be taken not to worsen the support normally provided by lower eyelid fat pads as subsequent lower lid retraction will occur.
