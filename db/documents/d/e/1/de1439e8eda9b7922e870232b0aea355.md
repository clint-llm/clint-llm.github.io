La Crosse virus is transmitted subcutaneously through penetration of the skin by a feeding mosquito. Two surface glycoproteins subtypes are involved in the transmission of the virus. The G1 protein mediates the attachment primary to human cells, whereas the G2 protein serves as an attachment to mosquito cells.

The replication of the virus can begin in the adjacent muscle to the site of penetration and therefore result in systemic infection, including viremia in the reticuloendothelial system and chondrocytes. The entrance of the virus through vascular endothelial cells can result in neuro-invasion and subsequent infection of neurons and glia. This is the proposed mechanism of the encephalitis syndrome in La Crosse virus infection. Post-mortem studies of brain tissue in patients with La Crosse encephalitis have shown lesions that demonstrate neurodegeneration with patchy inflammation and vasculitis.

Though there is limited understanding of the exact pathophysiology of the viral encephalitis, reversible cerebral edema, which is postulated to occur as a result of vasogenic edema from the endothelial cell involvement, may potentially play a significant role in the pathogenesis of La Crosse encephalitis.
