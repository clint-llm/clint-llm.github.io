Clinicians should consider Libman-Sacks endocarditis in patients with underlying malignancy, systemic lupus erythematosus, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, who present with a thromboembolic phenomenon. A full assessment with complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and blood cultures are necessary to rule out other etiologies such as infective endocarditis. The diagnosis of LS generally gets delayed as we look for other etiologies of patients presenting illness (thromboembolic event). Trans-esophageal echocardiography is mandatory as it has greater sensitivity and specificity than trans-thoracic echocardiography to evaluate for LS endocarditis. Treatment of LS should focus on the underlying disease (SLE or APS). Anticoagulation merits consideration in patients with a thromboembolic event for secondary prevention. Prognosis is poor as patients usually have recurrent thromboembolic events, cognitive disability, and death. There continues to be a need for further studies in patients with LS endocarditis to define early detection, management strategies, and prognosis.
