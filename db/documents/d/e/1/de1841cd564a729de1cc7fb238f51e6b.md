Young children with sickle cell anemia are at risk for acute splenic sequestration crises. These occur when an excessive amount of blood becomes trapped in the spleen, causing a dangerous drop in the circulating blood volume. This activity outlines the etiology, evaluation, and management of acute splenic sequestration crises and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of splenic sequestration crises. 
- Describe the appropriate history and physical examination of a patient with a splenic sequestration crisis. 
- Summarize the appropriate treatment options available for a patient with a splenic sequestration crisis. 
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes for patients with splenic sequestration crises.
