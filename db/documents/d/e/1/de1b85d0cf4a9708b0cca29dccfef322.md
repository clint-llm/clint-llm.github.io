The first step in evaluating a patient with a suspected CSF leak is to confirm that the fluid in question is CSF. Several tests can differentiate CSF from other fluids, and the most useful ones are listed below.

- Beta-2-transferrin: It is the most specific test as beta-2-transferrin is found only in the CSF (and the vitreous fluid of the eye); therefore, its presence is strongly suggestive of CSF.

- Glucose levels: Normal CSF glucose is 50 to 80 mg/100 mL (or greater than two-thirds of blood sugar level) (except in cases with hypoglycorrhachia like meningitis) compared to <5 mg/100 mL in other secretions like tears and mucus. Though not as sensitive and specific as beta-2-transferrin levels, it still carries a good negative predictive value.

- Halo sign: In traumatic cases of CSF leak, the fluid is blood-tinged and thus, when allowed to drop on linen, gives a central disc of blood and a peripheral ring of clear fluid.

- Reservoir sign: There is copious drainage of fluid in a particular head position, especially when the patient becomes upright after a long period of lying down. It is a non-specific test but can still be suggestive of CSF.

Once there is confirmation that the leaking fluid is CSF only, the next step is to localize the leak site. This can be done with the help of the following modalities.

- CT: Various signs to be looked for in CT scan include skull base fractures and defects, tumors, hydrocephalus, and pneumocephalus.

- CT cisternography: It is the procedure of choice for localization of the leak site. It involves thin-slice computed tomography after 5 to 10 mL of iodinated non-ionic contrast material is administered via lumbar puncture. It is especially helpful in cases where a CT scan shows no bony defects, multiple bony defects (to determine which defect is actively leaking), or if a bony defect is not associated with changes in the adjacent brain parenchyma. The commonest site of CSF rhinorrhea is the junction of the cribriform plate and ethmoid bone.

- MRI: It helps better identify posterior fossa space-occupying lesions and empty sella in cases of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. It is also helpful in cases with intracranial hypotension to demonstrate characteristic signs like sagging of the brain, pachymeningeal enhancement, engorgement of veins, pituitary hyperemia, subdural fluid collections, etc.

- MR cisternography: T1 fat suppression and T2 images before and after intrathecal gadolinium administration has been shown to have greater accuracy than CT cisternography.
