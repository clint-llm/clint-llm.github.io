Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) is a pathology finding, usually found incidentally on biopsy of the breast. ADH is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and therefore classified as "high risk" lesion but not precursor lesion - the distinction being the increased risk of breast cancer can be anywhere in the breasts and not limited to the area of the ADH. Depending on the biopsy type - excisional or core - the treatment and management differ. It is important that practitioners be aware of the subtleties in the diagnosis in order to appropriately provide patient care and avoid both under and over-treatment of atypical ductal hyperplasia.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathology findings typical of atypical ductal hyperplasia.
- Explain the impact of the diagnosis on breast cancer risk.
- Outline the surgical risk modification recommendations based on the diagnosis.
- Outline the medical risk modification recommendations based on the diagnosis.
