Ultrasound is the primary tool used for gestational trophoblastic neoplasm.

As false negative and false positive rates are high with the use of ultrasonography, specifically in the case of partial hydatidiform mole, histological examination is necessary to reach the final diagnosis. As histological examination may not be practicable to be done after every termination, testing the level of hCG 3â€“4 weeks after management to make sure it returned to the normal range is highly recommended.

Post-molar GTN often expresses no symptoms or distinctive findings on ultrasonography. Hence, correlating with the hCG level is necessary to reach the diagnosis. MRI is usually not important in the routine evaluation of GTN, except in cases with atypical presentations, recurrence, or ETT\PSTT conditions.
