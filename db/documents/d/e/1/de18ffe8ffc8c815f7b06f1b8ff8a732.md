Breast-conserving surgery (wide local excision) with radiotherapy or mastectomy, depending on the site and size of the tumor and patient choice, is an adequate treatment modality for invasive lobular carcinomas as for other invasive breast cancers. Nonrandomized studies reported that patient survival and local recurrence rates are similar to those of ductal/no special type carcinoma at 5 years when managed by breast-conserving surgery therapy.
