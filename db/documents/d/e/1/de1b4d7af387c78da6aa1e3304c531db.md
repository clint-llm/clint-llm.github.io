Classically, lumbar spinal stenosis presents as pain exacerbated by prolonged ambulation, standing, and with lumbar extension, and is relieved by forward flexion and rest. Neurogenic claudication is an important feature of lumbar spinal stenosis. Symptoms are typically bilateral, but usually asymmetric. Low back pain, numbness, and tingling are present in a majority of patients. Numbness and tingling in lumbar spinal stenosis typically involve the entire leg and rarely affect only a single nerve root distribution.

A thorough physical examination is necessary for patients with suspected lumbar spinal stenosis. Unilateral radicular pain from foraminal stenosis can be elicited with passive and active lumbar extension, otherwise known as the Kemp sign
