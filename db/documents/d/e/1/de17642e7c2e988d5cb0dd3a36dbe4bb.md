The AC joint is innervated by articular branches of the suprascapular, axillary, and lateral pectoral nerves. These nerves arise from the brachial plexus. Cutaneous innervation to the AC joint is through the sensory branch of the suprascapular nerve. This branch runs superiorly to the supraspinatus muscle towards the AC joint. However, pain arising from the AC joint may be referred to the neck, trapezius, lateral deltoids, and shoulder.
