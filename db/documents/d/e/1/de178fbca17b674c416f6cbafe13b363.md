Lower motor neurons transmit impulses via spinal peripheral nerves or cranial nerves to skeletal muscles. Three distinct types of motor neurons are categorized based on the target they innervate: branchial, visceral, and somatic motor neurons.

**Branchial Motor Neurons**

These motor neurons are located in the brainstem and are responsible for forming the LMNs of the cranial nerve nuclei. They are called "branchial" because they innervate the muscles formed by the branchial (pharyngeal) arch, which includes muscles innervated by cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X.

**Visceral Motor Neurons**

These motor neurons are a component of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and regulate smooth muscles and glands. These nerves can be further broken down into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. Motor neurons of the sympathetic nervous system are present from T1 to L2 segments of the spinal cord. These segments regulate the "fight or flight" response, which can dictate body metabolism, awareness, and energy storage.

**Somatic Motor Neurons**

These motor neurons are the traditional motor neurons located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and directly innervate skeletal muscle. They receive stimuli from the UMNs from the primary motor cortex and relay that information from the spinal cord to their target. Somatic motor neurons can be further divided into alpha, beta, and gamma, depending on the type of muscle fiber they innervate.
