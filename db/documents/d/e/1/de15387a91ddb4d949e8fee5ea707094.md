Over the past decade, nuclear medicine has witnessed significant advances in software, hardware, and novel radiopharmaceutical approvals. This includes SPECT, PET, and hybrid imaging. Many of these advancements have improved the quality of nuclear medicine imaging in children. The field has benefitted from a higher sensitivity and lower radiation exposure in pediatrics.

In children, the acquisition and reconstruction protocols require to be closely monitored. Lower doses may require longer acquisition times. A good balance between dose and imaging time is needed. Motion has to be closely monitored. Strapping, swaddling, and use of varying levels of sedation may be required. Involving the parents and child life experts is essential. Dynamic imaging may be useless if affected by artifacts and cannot be repeated without adding another radiopharmaceutical dose to the patient.

Using the latest software with at least half-time acquisitions and iterative reconstruction techniques is necessary when available. Special expertise is needed to optimize and not hinder quality. Knowledge of all these techniques and how they apply to each patient and what factors may affect them is essential.
