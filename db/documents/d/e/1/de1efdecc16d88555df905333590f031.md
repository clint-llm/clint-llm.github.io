NTG can progress to bilateral blindness in the worst cases, sometimes despite treatment. However, not all patients progress to visual morbidity. On average, progression is slower in NTG than POAG. Those at higher risk of visual field progression are females and those with a history of migraines, presence of optic disc hemorrhages, greater variation in diurnal IOP.
