The optimal temperature of the cardioplegia solution is a topic of debate. Even though WBC has been in use for the past three decades, there is controversy regarding the superiority of WBC over cold crystalloid cardioplegia. The WBC has been shown to improve metabolic recovery of the myocardium. The warm blood cardioplegia induction using normothermic blood cardioplegia solution followed by cold cardioplegia could theoretically provide a period of resuscitation in patients at high risk for ischemia. With this technique, the WBC-induced initial electromechanical arrest decreases the cardiac energy demands, and normothermic cellular reaction favors repayment of oxygen debt, restoration of ATP, restabilization of ionic balance, and the divergence of oxygen to reparative metabolic processes.

Potential advantages of warm blood cardioplegia include:

- Improve myocardial restoration and repair

- Improve oxygen delivery and dissociation

- Decrease intracellular swelling

- Decrease red blood cells (RBC) deformation and rouleaux formation

- Decrease impairment of ATP dependent cellular processes

- Improve membrane stabilization
