Smokeless tobacco keratosis presents as a characteristic white corrugated plaque on the oral mucosa where the tobacco is placed. Early lesions present as a white film that, over time, becomes more keratotic with distinct pouching.

Leukoplakia is defined as a white patch or plaque that cannot be characterized clinically or pathologically as any other disease. These lesions get their color from the thickened keratin or spinous layer.

Erythroplakia is defined as a red patch or plaque that cannot be clinically diagnosed as any other condition. Commonly, these lesions are well-demarcated, erythematous, asymptomatic patches with a velvety texture. At times, lesions may display a combination of erythroplakia and leukoplakia, and the lesions are then termed erytholeukoplakia. While less common than leukoplakia, erythroplakia and erytholeukoplakia have a higher malignant potential, with most biopsied cases exhibiting dysplasia or carcinoma in situ.

Verrucous carcinoma presents as a diffuse, well-demarcated, painless plaque with papillary or verruciform projections. These lesions are typically white but can appear pink depending on the amount of keratin production and the increase in the underlying vasculature. Verrucous carcinomas typically present on the mandibular vestibule, buccal mucosa, gingiva, tongue, and hard palate. When associated with smokeless tobacco use, it typically corresponds to the location of chronic tobacco placement.

Verrucous carcinoma presents as a diffuse, well-demarcated, painless plaque with papillary or verruciform projections. These lesions are typically white but can appear pink depending on the amount of keratin produced and/or the increase in the underlying vasculature. Verrucous carcinomas typically present on the mandibular buccal mucosa (vestibule), gingiva, tongue, and hard palate. When associated with smokeless tobacco use, it typically corresponds to the location of chronic tobacco placement.

Squamous cell carcinoma can have a variety of presentations. Generally, the hallmark presentation is deep ulceration with rolled borders in a high-risk area, such as the posterior-lateral aspect of the tongue or the floor of the mouth.
