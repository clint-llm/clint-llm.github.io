In infancy or early childhood, nevus sebaceus histologically features immature and abnormally formed pilosebaceous units. At this stage of development, epidermal changes may reveal some acanthosis and mild papillomatosis. During puberty, the lesions enlarge clinically as well as microscopically. The sebaceous glands become much more prominent and are located unusually high in the dermis. The number of sebaceous lobules and malformed ducts increases. The hair follicles are typically immature vellus hairs rather than terminal hairs. At this growth phase, the epidermis becomes more papillated and acanthotic. Some lesions may also demonstrate ectopic apocrine glands or eccrine hyperplasia.
