We can categorize the most common complications of hysterectomy into infectious causes, venous thromboembolic disease, injury to the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, bleeding, nerve injury, and vaginal cuff dehiscence.

**Infection**

The most common infections identified after a hysterectomy include vaginal cuff cellulitis, pelvic abscess or infected hematoma, wound infection, and urinary tract infection. The risk of infection increases with operative times that exceed 3 hours, lack of preoperative antibiotics, and patient factors such as comorbid medical conditions, compromised immune status, obesity, and poor nutrition.

**Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)**

Patients undergoing major gynecological surgery have a significant risk of developing deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) when no thromboprophylaxis is given. The incidence of DVT after gynecologic surgery has been found in some studies to be higher in open procedures and in patients with malignant conditions.

**Genitourinary and Gastrointestinal Tract Injuries**

Injury to the genitourinary tract during pelvic surgery, while rare, can lead to a high risk of patient morbidity. Studies have indicated radical hysterectomy as the most common type of pelvic surgery associated with urologic complications.

**Bleeding**

Abdominal hysterectomy is associated with more bleeding than the other routes of hysterectomy, with an average blood loss of 400mL. Studies have shown that estimated blood loss above this caliber is associated with increased risks of major postoperative complications and increased hospital stay.

**Nerve Injury**

Damage of the femoral nerve is the most common cause of neuropathy described after pelvic surgery, and the most common site of injury is at the anterior surface of the psoas muscle from direct compression by a self-retained retractor and at the inguinal canal from indirect stretch injury while the patient is in the prolonged dorsal lithotomy position.

**Vaginal Cuff Dehiscence**

Cuff separation can occur within days of surgery or years later. The separation may be along the entire length or localized to a portion of the vaginal incision and can be of partial- or full-thickness. The most feared complication associated with vaginal cuff dehiscence is the evisceration of intraperitoneal contents through tissue separation. Total abdominal hysterectomy has been associated with a lower risk of vaginal cuff dehiscence compared to laparoscopic procedures.
