Comprehensive ocular examination, including visual acuity, extraocular movements (EOM), and anterior segment evaluation is to be done. Detailed refraction should be done to note down the amount and type of astigmatism.

Dry eye should be ruled out by conducting Schirmer’s test or tear film break-up time.

Pterygium should be evaluated under the following criteria: location, size, vascularity, extent, and area of corneal involvement [chord at limbus and extent of corneal encroachment from limbus is measured using Castroviejo’s calipers] can be carried out by oblique illumination by torchlight and further substantiated by slit-lamp examination. The presence or absence of Stocker’s line is noted.

A pterygium has three parts:

- Cap - At the leading edge, which is distinguished by a halo-like avascular zone

- Head - peripheral to the cap

- Body - the main part of the pterygium communicating with the bulbar conjunctiva

Pterygium may be classified into:

- Progressive: thick, fleshy, vascular, progressively encroaching towards the center of the cornea.

- Atrophic: Thin, attenuated, poor vascularity, stationary
