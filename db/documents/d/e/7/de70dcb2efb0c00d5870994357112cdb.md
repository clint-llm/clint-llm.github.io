Asbestosis is an interstitial lung disease caused by the inhalation of asbestos fibers. Asbestos fibers have been historically chosen for construction, shipping, mining, and aerospace engineering commercial use because of their high electrical and thermal resistance and low cost. This activity describes the evaluation and management of patients with asbestosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of asbestosis.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of asbestosis.
- Review the management options available for asbestosis.
- Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance asbestosis and improve outcomes.
