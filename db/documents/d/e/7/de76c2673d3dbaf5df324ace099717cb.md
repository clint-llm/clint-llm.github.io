Although originally classified as a fungus, Nocardia is a genus of filamentous bacteria that contains over 80 species.Nocardia is ubiquitous in the environment, representing the microflora of water, dust, soil, mud, and decaying vegetation.Nocardia species do not present as normal flora within the eye, Nocardia keratitis must occur secondary to exposure to bacteria in the environment.

For several decades, Nocardia asteroides was the most common species to be isolated from cases of Nocardia keratitis; however, recent advances in PCR and RNA sequencing have demonstrated that other species such as Nocardia arthritidis are more common in certain populations.

Ocular exposure to soil or plant matter was found to be a common historical point in nearly half of all Nocardia keratitis cases.Nocardia keratitis is corneal trauma. In one case series, trauma was the inciting factor in 25% of cases.
