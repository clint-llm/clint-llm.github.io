Again, observation is key, and clinicians should avoid any rush to unhelpful interventions or treatments.

Correct diagnosis is necessary for successful treatment. Patients with psychogenic nonepileptic spells have frequently been misdiagnosed as having epilepsy and have been prescribed multiple medications. Consultation with neurology may be helpful. Admission to a monitoring unit may be in order if the diagnosis is uncertain. Long-term video EEG monitoring is the most important diagnostic test.

Laboratory testing is of limited utility. Serum prolactin levels have long been noted to increase shortly after a generalized epileptic seizure but not after PNES. Prolactin levels peak quickly after events, and though discussed extensively in the literature, they are of limited pragmatic value. A lactic acidosis commonly follows a generalized convulsion. However, a rise in lactate levels is not specific for convulsions of epileptic origin; elevated lactate levels occurred in volunteers simulating generalized seizures.
