Parents’ participation plays a pivotal role in managing echolalia and speech disorders associated with autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Individualized education programs help educate patients/parents about echolalia, comorbid conditions, and prognosis. Management strategies and interventions are recommended. The pediatrician/provider should also share informative websites with the child’s parents for more information and to connect with support groups.
