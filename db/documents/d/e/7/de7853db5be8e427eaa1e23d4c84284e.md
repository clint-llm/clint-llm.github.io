ICVT complications can include venous infarction, hemorrhage, and worsening vasogenic edema. A transtentorial herniation is a complication of ICVT that can lead to death. In cases where transtentorial herniation is suspected, a hemicraniectomy can be lifesaving.

Development of seizures increases in patients who present with seizures, have had seizures in the past, and also present with concomitant supratentorial brain lesions such as focal edema, ischemia, or hemorrhagic infarcts. Severe vision loss is a rare but reported complication.
