Blepharoplasty may be performed in an office-based setting. Though the eyelids are amenable to complete anesthesia with local anesthetic, it is often helpful to give sedation during injection as this is extremely uncomfortable. As with any procedure, the use of intravenous (IV) sedation should be performed in the presence of an anesthesia provider familiar with airway management. Furthermore, if IV sedation is used, an inpatient facility or an operating room certified by the American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities is strongly advised. Furthermore, to ensure the safety of the patient and the best possible outcomes, blepharoplasty should be performed by those with extensive training in the procedure including board-certified plastic surgeons, oculoplastic surgeons, or facial plastic surgeons.
