The lower leg subdivides into four compartments which are the anterior, lateral, superficial posterior and deep posterior compartments. The anterior compartment contains the tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, and fibularis tertius muscles, innervated by the deep peroneal nerve and supplied by the anterior tibial artery. The anterior compartment muscles function as the primary extensors of the ankle (dorsiflexion) and extensors of the toes.

The anterior compartment of the lower limb is susceptible to several pathologies including acute compartment syndrome resulting in foot drop, atherosclerotic plaque buildup of the arteries, and deep vein thrombosis. The anterior compartment is the most common site for acute compartment syndrome and is a medical emergency that requires fasciotomy of the involved compartment.
