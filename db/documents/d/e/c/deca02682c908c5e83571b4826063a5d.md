Orbital cellulitis is an ocular emergency that is best managed by an interprofessional team including pharmacists and nurses. The treatment of orbital cellulitis includes antibiotics and other supportive therapies. An ophthalmologist and otolaryngologist should also be consulted for proper examination and because, in some cases, surgery may be required. Without prompt diagnosis and proper treatment, the infection of the orbit can progress and extend to the adjacent anatomical locations and result in serious complications

The outcomes for simple and early cases is excellent but those with extension of the infection into the cranial cavity have a guarded prognosis.
