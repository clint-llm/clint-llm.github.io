Early detection and prevention of progression of surferâ€™s ear are paramount once exostoses have been detected. Prevention involves patient education for the use of silicone earplugs and/or neoprene hoods to reduce auditory canal cold water exposure. EAE is a progressive disease; however, the risk of progression can be mitigated with consistent preventive measures. Treatment consists of medical management involving regular cleaning of the external auditory canal to remove any entrapped debris. This can help prevent the propagation of complications such as recurrent otitis externa, tympanic membrane rupture, and conductive hearing loss.

Once the exostoses are formed, they are irreversible unless surgical intervention is performed. If there is greater than 80% occlusion and symptoms are severe and persistent despite medical management, a canalplasty by an otolaryngologist may be considered.
