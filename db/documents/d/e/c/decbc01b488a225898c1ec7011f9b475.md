Generally, advanced stage lung cancers are not amenable to local surgical resection. Using the most recent AJCC 8th edition classification, this will include tumors with metastasis to mediastinal lymph nodes and T4 tumors invading mediastinal structures.

Anatomic considerations are the most important when planning surgical intervention forÂ pulmonary sleeve resection (PSR) versus pneumonectomy. Patients should only undergo PSR if this achieved complete excision of the tumor (R0). Residual tumor after resection will place patients to be at risk for locoregional recurrence.

If patients have unfavorable pre-operative testing such as cardiac disease or preoperative pulmonary function test demonstrated poor surgical candidacy, formal major operative lung resection should be discouraged.
