Sickle cell retinopathy is the most common ocular manifestation of sickle cell disease.

Proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR) is the main cause of visual loss in patients with sickle cell disease. It is characterized by neovascularization, which may be active or it may be inactive and fibrotic. The neovascularization is usually confined to the peripheral retina and has been described by Goldberg to be frequently confined to one quadrant. Neovascularization may be complicated by vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment. Goldberg has defined five stages of proliferative sickle retinopathy:

- Stage 1 Peripheral arteriolar occlusion

- Stage 2 Peripheral arteriovenous anastomoses

- Stage 3 Actual retinal neovascularization occurs, with a shape resembling the marine invertebrate, Gorgonia flabellum, hence called sea fan.

- Stage 4 Vitreous hemorrhage

- Stage 5 Retinal detachment, which can be tractional or rhegmatogenous, due to mechanical traction by the fibrovascular membranes.

A characteristic feature of proliferative sickle retinopathy is the phenomenon of auto infarction of sea fans, seen in up to 20% to 60% of cases. It is caused by chronic and repetitive vascular occlusions in the blood vessels of the sea fan. This can lead to spontaneous resolution of the neovascularization without any sequelae.

Individuals suffering from thalassemia major and intermedia can develop two kinds of retinal abnormalities which are pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like retinal abnormalities and non-pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like retinal abnormalities.
