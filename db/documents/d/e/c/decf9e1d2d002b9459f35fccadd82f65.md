Hydrocarbons are a primary energy source in modern society. They are derived mainly from petroleum (kerosene, gas, naphtha) or wood (turpentine, pine oil). They can be found in liquid, gas, or solid form depending on their properties. All hydrocarbons can be toxic, but aromatic (ring-shaped) and halogenated hydrocarbons typically have more severe toxicity.

Toxicity occurs in various ways including through inhalation, ingestion, aspiration, and dermal exposure. Frequently, these exposures occur during attempted recreational use of the substances and sometimes for self-injurious behavior. Three inhalation methods for recreational uses are common. These include “huffing” or breathing through a rag soaked with the inhalant, “bagging,” which means repeatedly inhaling deeply from a bag filled with the hydrocarbon, and “sniffing” or directly inhaling the hydrocarbon through the nostrils. Most commonly abused hydrocarbons are paints, solvents, and gasoline.
