Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizing chemical found in many households and industrial settings. It is generally safe at household concentrations (usually about 3%) but can be dangerous if used inappropriately. Industrial concentrations (usually up to 70%) can cause significant mortality and mortality. The signs and symptoms of toxicity must be identified and promptly treated to improve outcomes. More concentrated hydrogen peroxide solutions, as are often found in industrial strength solutions, cause significant damage with all types of exposures. This activity outlines hydrogen peroxide toxicity and its resultant complications and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients presenting with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the expected course of treatment and prognosis of a patient presenting with suspected hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
- Describe signs and symptoms of hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
- Review necessary workup of a patient presenting with suspected hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
- Identify differential diagnoses of a patient presenting with suspected hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
