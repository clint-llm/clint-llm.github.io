In general, any form of somatic dysfunction that leads to motion loss can be an indication. Specifically, rib (11 or 12) inhalation restriction is related to but is not restricted to the following:

- Sacral pain

- Chest wall pain

- Back pain

- Pelvic pain

- Abdominal pain

In exhalation dysfunction, the physician usually depresses pump-handle ribs anteriorly. The anterior portions of the rib mobilize caudad during expiration and are restricted on inspiration. The physician may also notice the narrowing of the anterior intercostal space beneath the compromised rib. The inferior edge of the posterior rib angle is usually protuberant in these cases. Tenderness may be felt in the:

- Chondrosternal junction

- Costochondral junction

- Posterior rib angles

Meanwhile, bucket-handle ribs are usually depressed laterally in exhalation dysfunction. The rib shafts slightly shift downward during expiration and are limited during inspiration. The physician may also notice constricting of the lateral side of the intercostal space beneath the compromised rib. Tenderness may be felt in the:

- Posterior rib angles

- Intercostal muscles at the mid-axillary line
