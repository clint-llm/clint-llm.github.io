Both the anterior and posterior lateral nasal arteries are distal branches of the external carotid arteries, each measuring approximately 2 mm in diameter, with the anterior artery being slightly larger than the posterior.

The posterior lateral nasal artery is a branch of the sphenopalatine artery, itself a branch of the internal maxillary division of the external carotid artery, that arises along with the posterior septal artery at a bifurcation that occurs just prior to the arteries' entrance into the nasal cavity via the sphenopalatine foramen.
