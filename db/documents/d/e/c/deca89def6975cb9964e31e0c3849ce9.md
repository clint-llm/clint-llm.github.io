Dronabinol dosing can be via either oral pill and oral solution forms, available in doses of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg. In CINV, the patients should take it 1 to 3 hours before starting their chemotherapy session, with a repeat dose available 2 to 4 hours after beginning the session as needed. Nabilone is available in oral pill form, in doses of 1 mg or 2 mg. These doses can be increased or decreased based on practitioner discretion. Patients should receive instruction to take one dose the night before starting their chemotherapy session, one dose twice a day during the entirety of the chemotherapy course, and one dose twice a day after chemotherapy has concluded. CBD is sold legally throughout the United States without a prescription by many private entities that are not FDA regulated; there are no concrete guidelines for dosing. However, doses generally range from 10 mg to 50 mg at a time, taken either as needed or daily.  Products containing significant THC levels are sold legally by medicinal and recreational dispensaries in several states, depending on legal status. Doses for these generally range between 5 mg and 15 mg and are typically taken as needed as opposed to daily due to their psychotropic effects.
