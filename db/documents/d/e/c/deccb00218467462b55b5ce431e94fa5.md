Placental abruption is a relatively rare condition but requires emergent management. The majority of placental abruptions occur before 37-weeks gestation. Placental abruption is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and perinatal mortality. With placental abruption, the woman is at risk for hemorrhage and the need for blood transfusions, hysterectomy, bleeding disorders specifically disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, renal failure, and Sheehan syndrome or postpartum pituitary gland necrosis.

With the availability of blood replacement, maternal death is rare but continues to be higher than the overall maternal mortality rate. Neonatal consequences include preterm birth and low birth weight, perinatal asphyxia, stillbirth, and neonatal death. In many countries, the rate of placental abruption has been increasing, even with improved obstetrical care and monitoring techniques. This suggests a multifactorial etiology that is not well understood.
