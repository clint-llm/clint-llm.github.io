A variety of histochemical and immunohistochemical staining methods can be used to examine KHG in tissue samples.  Several examples are listed below, which at the time of their respective publications, provided greater insight into the structure and function of keratohyalin granules.

Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining is a particularly effective method for examining KHG.  This is in large part due to the hematoxylin stainability of the granules.  The stainability of KHG is thought to be due to the fibrinogen gamma-chain protein found within the granules, which is demonstrably basophilic.**Figure 1**].

Bennett’s reagent is a simple and rapid method of identifying free sulfhydryl groups.

The protein filaggrin, found within KHG, has a relatively high presence of histidine. Antibodies raised against this protein have been used to immunohistochemically visualize keratohyalin granules.
