Dyspnea is a troubling symptom for many patients and those involved in their care. It is common in many advanced diseases and is frequently experienced at the end of life. The American Thoracic Society describes dyspnea as subjective breathing discomfort and sensations in varying intensities that a patient can distinctly qualify. Furthermore, dyspnea originates from multiple physiological, psychological, social, and environmental circumstances, causing secondary physiological and behavioral responses.
