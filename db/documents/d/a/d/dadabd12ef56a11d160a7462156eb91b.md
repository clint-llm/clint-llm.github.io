The scalp consists of five layers, summarized by the mnemonic SCALP:

- S - Skin

- C - SubCutaneous tissue

- A - Aponeurosis and muscle (musculoaponeurotic layer ML).

- L - Loose areolar tissue and subgaleal fascia

- P - Pericranium/Periosteum

In lacerations, separation most commonly occurs at the loose areolar tissue layer. The musculoaponeurotic layer contains the superficial temporal artery as the muscles require copious blood supply for function. Understanding the layers of the scalp and the blood supply is essential to successfully stopping bleeding from lacerations, which can be substantial in many cases.
