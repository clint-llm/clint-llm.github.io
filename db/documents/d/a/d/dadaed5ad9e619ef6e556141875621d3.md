Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a hereditary syndrome characterized by gastrointestinal (GI) polyposis, mucocutaneous pigmented macules, and predisposition to certain cancers. Patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are at an increased risk for developing GI cancers of the colorectal, pancreatic, and gastric systems, in addition to a wide variety of non-GI epithelial malignancies including breast, uterine, cervical, lung, ovarian, and testicular cancers. Among the various malignancies, colorectal is most common with a lifetime risk of 39 percent, and is followed by breast cancer in females with a lifetime risk of 32 to 54 percent. This activity reviews the evaluation, management and surveillance for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the presentation of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.
- Describe the surveillance that should be done routinely in patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.
- Explain the management of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.
- Incorporate a structured interprofessional team approach to provide effective care and appropriate surveillance for patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.
