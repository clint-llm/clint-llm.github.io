Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is supplementing women with hormones lost during the menopausal transition. To relieve the symptoms associated with menopause, conventional HRT includes an estrogen and progesterone component to mimic hormones created by the human ovary. (For male hormone replacement therapy, see our companion StatPearls reference article on "Male Hypogonadism."

Estrogen therapies are numerous, and include those indigenous to the human ovary, for example, estradiol and estriol. Other estrogenic compounds include conjugated equine estrogen (CEE), the most commonly prescribed estrogen in the United States. They are not identical in their effect on the human body but share the same FDA indications, according to the Physicians Desk Reference.

- Treatment of vasomotor symptoms of menopause

- Treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause ( previously known as vaginal and vulvar atrophy)

- Prevention of osteoporosis

A progestogen is a term used to include not only progesterone made by the human ovary but also progesterone-like substances, also known as progestins. A woman who desires HRT and has an intact uterus must have a progestogen with estrogen to protect her uterus from endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy. Estrogen alone will cause the endometrial lining to grow. Progestogens stabilize the lining from proliferating abnormally. It is assumed that if a woman has had a hysterectomy that she no longer needs a progestin. Progesterone, however, is different as it can provide symptom relief from sleep disturbance and mood instability, and increasing evidence support that it offers tissue protection to the breast.

FDA-approved indications for progestogens include:

-  Amenorrhea, either primary or secondary

-  Assisted reproductive technology treatment

-  Endometrial hyperplasia

-  Dysfunctional uterine bleeding
