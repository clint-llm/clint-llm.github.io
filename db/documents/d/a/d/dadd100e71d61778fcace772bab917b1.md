As mentioned already, there is not much data regarding hypnic headaches in general, and there is even less available about the pathophysiology of turtle headaches. There are theories that hypoxia is a cause of the headache based on the premise that the headache occurs when individuals pull the blanket over their heads into an environment with less oxygen. There are several reasons why this may play an essential role in determining the exact pathophysiology behind turtle headaches. High-altitude headache has been well studied and reportedly occurs in almost 80% of individuals who ascend to heights above 3000 meters. Hypoxia has been found to cause cerebral vasodilation, which results in increased capillary pressure and edema, leading towards the symptoms of a headache.
