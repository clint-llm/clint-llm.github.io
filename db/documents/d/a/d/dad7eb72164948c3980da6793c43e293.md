A vessel is considered to be aneurysmal when it enlarges to about one and a half to two times the size of the normal vessel. True femoral artery aneurysms are rare and include dilation of all the layers of the vessel wall. In contrast, femoral artery pseudoaneurysms are more commonly encountered in clinical practice, often after iatrogenic trauma from diagnostic or interventional arterial procedures. This activity describes the causes of femoral artery aneurysms, reviews the indications and contraindications for surgical repair, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients undergoing femoral artery aneurysms repair.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the causes of femoral artery aneurysms.
- Describe the surgical technique involved in performing a femoral artery aneurysm repair. 
- Summarize the complications of surgical repair of femoral artery aneurysms.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of femoral artery aneurysms and improve patient outcomes.
