The diagnosis and management of disseminated cryptococcal disease is with an interprofessional team that includes an infectious disease expert, internist, primary care provider, neurologist, pulmonologist and dermatologist. The majority of these patients are immunosuppressed and thus therapy is often extended for several years. The outlook for these patients is guarded and depends on the cause of immunosuppression, extent and other comorbidity.
