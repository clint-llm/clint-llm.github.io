Fetal growth restriction (FGR) affects about 3% to 7% of all pregnancies.

**Classification**

The severity of FGR is determined by the EFW.

- EFW between 3rd and 9th percentile - moderate FGR

- EFW less than the 3rd percentile - severe FGR

Based on additional fetal biometric parameters, such as head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC), femur length (FL), and biparietal diameter (BD), FGR can be categorized as symmetrical and asymmetrical. In symmetrical FGR, all growth parameters are proportionally reduced, whereas, in asymmetrical FGR, classically, the abdominal circumference is reduced below 10 percentile, while other measurements are relatively preserved and may be within normal limits.

**Symmetrical FGR**

This group constitutes 20% to 30% of all FGR cases. Poor placental function is a well-established cause of FGR. Adverse intrauterine conditions beginning in the early pregnancy (first trimester) that may cause fetal nutrient restriction, such as smoking, cocaine use, chronic hypertension, anemia, and chronic diabetes mellitus, may result in symmetrical FGR. Chromosome anomalies, such as aneuploidy, are a major cause of symmetrical FGR.Toxoplasma gondii, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, Treponema, and others) contracted prenatally are present in 5% to 15% of cases with FGR and form an important group.

**Asymmetrical FGR**

In asymmetrical FGR, which constitutes about 70% to 80% of all FGR cases, the timing of intrauterine insult is at the late second or third trimester of pregnancy. The growth restriction is disproportionate, with relative preservation of head circumference (fetal brain) and reduced abdominal circumference (fetal liver), resulting in an increased brain to the liver ratio (BLR). Preeclampsia is a well-recognized cause of asymmetrical FGR. This condition, identified in about 8% of pregnancies in western countries, generally develops after 20 weeks of gestation and is characterized by hypertension and proteinuria.
