Multivessel disease is defined as significant stenosis (>70%) in two or more major coronary arteries of 2.5 mm diameter or more. This activity helps in understanding the pathophysiology of multivessel coronary artery disease and indications for surgery versus percutaneous interventions. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of multivessel coronary artery disease.
- Outline the process of evaluation of a patient with multivessel disease.
- Review the studies that evaluate a surgical versus interventional approach to multivessel disease.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with multivessel disease.
