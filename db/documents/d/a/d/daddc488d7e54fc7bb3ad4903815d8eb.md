After the skin is marked, the local subcutaneous soft tissues are anesthetized with 1 mL to 3 mL of 1% lidocaine hydrochloride for local anesthesia. A 23-gauge 3.5-inch spinal needle is then used with a stylet in place with an anterior/vertical approach entry through the soft tissues until the femoral head-neck junction cortex is reached. Intermittent fluoroscopy allows for careful centering of the needle hub over the needle tip to ensure a precise perpendicular approach into the joint space. The needle is slightly retracted to avoid immediate termination within the femoral neck hyaline cartilage. The stylet is removed, and a small volume of anesthetic is then injected to ensure low-pressure intra-articular placement and anesthetization of the cortical surface. A test contrast injection with approximately 0.5 mL to 2 mL of contrast ensures that the needle does not terminate within an adjacent bursa and is truly intra-articular. A syringe containing the corticosteroid with or without a connecting tube is then attached to the 23-gauge needle, and the corticosteroid is subsequently injected into the joint.
