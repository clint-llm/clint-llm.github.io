Alcohol and substance abuse is a very complex problem within both the American Indian and Native American populations. One key strategy to reducing alcohol and substance abuse and improving health care outcomes is to develop strong partnerships between interprofessional healthcare team members, tribes, tribal leaders, and academic researchers.

Through this collaboration, alcohol and substance-related health care disparities can be reduced by future research projects and health care initiatives. Another successful strategy healthcare providers can implement the development of preventative and treatment plans that are culturally based and designed specifically for the unique culture of a particular tribe. Finally, an effort to reduce the cultural and social stigma associated with alcohol and substance abuse is vitally important to helping Native Americans, and American Indians feel comfortable seeking treatment and driving optimal outcomes.
