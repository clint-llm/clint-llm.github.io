The basic histopathological findings in vitiligo is a total loss of functioning melanocytes in association with the complete loss of epidermal pigmentation (determined by Fontana-Masson stain or dohydrophenylalanine. Immunohistochemistry for melanocyte-specific markers like Melan-A and HMB-45 and specific electron microscopy can also be used).

In the margins of lesions, perivascular and perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate (CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes) are seen, they have specific melanocytic toxicity. Degenerative changes in melanocytes are also visible like cellular enlargement, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and long dendritic processes filled with melanin granules. Other reported changes include epidermal vacuolization, increase number of Langerhans cells, and basement membrane thickening.
