Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 is due to mutations in the autoimmune regulatory (AIRE) gene,  located in the short arm of chromosome 21. Inheritance of APS-1 is in an autosomal recessive manner.  The AIRE gene codes for a protein named autoimmune regulator. There are over ver 60 recognized different mutations in the AIRE gene, which might explain the variability in presentation and natural course of the disease. Over 95% of patients with APS-1 have one of the two most common mutations, which are arginine substitution at position 257 and 13 base pair deletion in exon 8.
