Silicosis is an occupational pneumoconiosis caused by the inhalation of crystalline silica dust. This disease may present several weeks to years after exposure to silica and is commonly seen in occupations such as mining, glass manufacturing, and foundry work. Patients may present with cough, sharp chest pain and breathing difficulty. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of silicosis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of silicosis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of silicosis.
- Summarize the treatment options for silicosis.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team in educating patients on the causes of silicosis and preventing further exposure.
