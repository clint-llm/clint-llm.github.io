Hibernomas can have variable histopathologic composition depending on their histological subtypes of 1) typical, 2) lipoma-like, 3)myxoid, and 4) spindle cell variants. The typical subtype accounts for 82% of cases.

- Contain a variable percentage of brown fat cells

- Demonstrate granular and multivacuolated cytoplasm of brown fat cells

- Demonstrate eosinophilic and polygonal brown fat cells

- Contain a variable component of univacuolated white fat cells

- May contain spindled cells and/or myxoid stroma

- Have a high concentration of cytochrome pigments

- Lack of high mitotic activity and nuclear atypia

- Cytology demonstrates small multivacuolated brown fat cells

- On cytologic analysis, finely granular cytoplasm and bland round nuclei are typical features
