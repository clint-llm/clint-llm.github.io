Always explain to the patient thatÂ the tests described in this chapter (dye disappearance test, Jones I, Jones II, etc.) are diagnostic and not meant to be therapeutic. This especially applies to the irrigation of the lacrimal system in the clinic where patients may feel that one is "flushing clean the lacrimal system," and thereby correcting the obstruction.

It is wise to explain the steps of the tests being performed so there are no sudden movements by the patient. When dilating the punctum, irrigating the lacrimal system, or probing the canaliculi, topical anesthetic should be used to soak the punctum and conjunctiva with a Q-tip.

The results of the tests should be explained to the patient together with their interpretation and proposed plan to resolve the epiphora.
