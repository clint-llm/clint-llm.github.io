**Diagnostic Procedures**

Flexible fibreoptic endoscopy is the gold-standard for the initial glottic stenosis diagnosis. It can be performed on awake patients, whether they are adults or infants. Microlaryngoscopy under general anesthesia is essential to assess the severity of the glottic stenosis and exclude other airway pathology. The mobility of the arytenoids at the cricoarytenoid joints can be evaluated with palpation. Biopsy of the stenotic area can help determine the cause of the condition and may be therapeutic also.

**Imaging and Other Studies**

Lateral soft tissue neck plain radiographs have limited value, but they can be useful occasionally if a foreign body is suspected. Videofluoroscopy is also a valuable tool to assess swallowing function, which might impact treatment decisions. CT scan of the neck and thorax can demonstrate the severity of the stenosis and the coexistence of any other pulmonary issues. 3D segmentationÂ can be useful for surgical planning.
