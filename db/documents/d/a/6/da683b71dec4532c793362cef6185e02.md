American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) data, collected between 2002 and 2006, showed carbamate poisonings accounted for 14,000 reported exposures and carried a case fatality rate of 10 to 20%.**,**000 cases to the AAPCC, accounting for 14 fatalities.

In developing areas of the world, the lack of industry control of pesticides enables local agricultural practices to freely use highly toxic pesticides, leading to the risk of severe, unintentional work exposures and toxicity after acts of self-harm. In rural Asia, carbamate and organophosphates are often used for intentional self-injurious behaviors and account for an estimated combined 200,000 fatalities per year. Modeling data estimate 1 million to 2 million cases in rural Asia per year and expect 20% to 30% of patients to develop respiratory failure secondary to carbamate and OP intentional exposures. Combined**,**these two classes of insecticides are calculated to require between 1 million and 2 million ventilator days every year and account for a large burden of morbidity, mortality, and medical expenses worldwide.
