The cervical plexus is a complex neurologic structure located within the head and neck. The large portion of the cervical plexus is the communication between the anterior divisions of C1 through C4 nerves. While the plexus itself can be complex, it is essential for practitioners to understand the significant motor and sensory functions of the cervical plexus as this information can provide valuable information when treating a patient with a possibleÂ insult to this area.
