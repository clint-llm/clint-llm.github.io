Most diarrheal illnesses have a favorable prognosis, and those caused by E. coli are no different. E. coliÂ infections resulting in watery diarrhea are generally self-limited, but even when antibiotics are required, the illness is treatable, and patients make a full recovery. Children who develop HUS due to EHEC/STEC are at the most significant risk for morbidity and mortality. Approximately four percent of children who develop EHEC/STEC-induced HUS will die, and another five percent will develop significant long-term sequelae, including end-stage renal disease and stroke.

The prognosis of patients who develop extraintestinal infections caused by E. coli is dependent on comorbid conditions. E. coli itself is not an indicator of poor prognosis. However, patients with extraintestinal infections caused by E. coli (except cystitis) are generally sicker at baseline. For example, E. coli is a common cause of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with ascites, and even when treated, SBP is associated with up to a four percent mortality risk.
