EMPD is an uncommon condition with only a few hundred cases reported in the world medical literature. Precise incidence is unknown. EMPD represents 6.5% of all cutaneous Paget disease and mainly affects patients between 50 to 80 years of age, with a peak age of 65.3 years old. Caucasians and women are more commonly affected, although a male predominance exists in Asia. The vulva is the most frequently involved site, with 65% of EMPD located in this region. EMPD has also been reported in areas with modified apocrine glands, such as the external auditory canal in association with ceruminous carcinoma, and possibly in the eyelid accompanying carcinoma of Moll's glands. Rare sites of involvement include the buttock, glans penis, knee, thigh, abdomen, umbilicus, lower anterior chest, and scalp.

There is an important association between EMPD and another underlying malignancy in at least 10% to 30% of cases, so a thorough investigation to rule out malignancy is critical.
