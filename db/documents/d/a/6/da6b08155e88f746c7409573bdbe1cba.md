RNA viruses can survive and disrupt physiological processes by replicating their genome inside a host cell. There are different kinds of RNA viruses that each have a unique mechanism of replication. Double-stranded RNA viruses, such as retroviruses fuse with host cell membranes and inject their viral contents inside to replicate their genome via reverse transcription. Reverse transcription requires a ribonuclease H and a DNA polymerase with the ability to copy an RNA or a DNA template to synthesis a linear double-stranded DNA from an RNA.

Many neurological diseases such as spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), myotonic dystrophy, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL-2), etc., are attributed to the expansion of non-coding RNA repeats. The repeat expansion generates abnormal hairpin folds to develop in an RNA strand, thus disrupting the normal RNA function. Accumulation of such RNA within the nucleus is termed as RNA toxicity, which can induce splicing defects, nucleolar functional abnormality, cytoplasmic and mRNA transport, and autophagy.
