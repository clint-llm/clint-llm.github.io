Medial epicondyle apophysitis complications can include the common complication of medial epicondyle avulsion fracture and the less common complications of entrapment of the avulsed bone in the elbow joint space, ulnar nerve entrapment, residual ossicles, and persistent pain. Nonunion of an avulsed epicondyle can result in residual bone remaining in the joint space, causing locking of the joint, persistent pain, or entrapment of the ulnar nerve. Each of these complications is an indication for evaluation for surgical management.
