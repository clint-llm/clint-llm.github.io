Any rapid decrease in ambient pressure may be responsible for peripheral facial paralysis. This typically occurs either in an ascent in diving (SCUBA or surface supplied) and in flying. Cases have occurred from ascent in the mountains as well. It is a rare condition and undoubtedly under-reported as it is usually quite transient, lasting from only a few minutes to a few hours. Interestingly, this condition is not reported with helium-breathing mixtures but has been reported during breath-hold diving.
