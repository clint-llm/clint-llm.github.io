Approximately 5% to 10% of the population is affected by coxa saltans, with the majority of patients experiencing painless snapping.Â The prevalence appears to be slightly higher in women than in men. The groups typically affected include those who do repetitive extreme hip motions, including competitive and recreational ballet dancers, weight lifters, soccer players, and runners. Of the competitive ballet dancers, almost 90% reported symptoms of snapping hip syndrome and 80% had bilateral involvement. Ballet movements that provoke snapping include external hip rotation and abduction at or over 90 degrees.
