As alluded to in the previous section, the primary concern with the concept of QoL is a lack of a uniform definition. Compared to measures that are financial or can be otherwise measured quantitatively, such as gross domestic product, QoL remains elusive in an exact means of measurement across world cultures, regions, and demographics. There remains a push by many academic circles to break QoL into smaller components for more accurate and meaningful evaluation. One example is dividing the concept into domains (engaged theory), while the other approach divides QoL into the ideas of personal well-being and life evaluation. This divide remains a widely debated topic in the literature.
