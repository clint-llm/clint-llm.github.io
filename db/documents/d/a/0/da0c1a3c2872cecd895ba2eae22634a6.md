Prognosis can vary widely but appears to be most dependent on treatment. Several randomized, controlled trials have shown that untreated autoimmune hepatitis patients have a 5-year and 10-year survival rate of 50% and 10%, respectively. Sixty percent to 80% of patients will enter remission after the proposed duration of treatment. Approximately 50% of these patients will relapse requiring therapy resumption. Some patients require life-long immunosuppression. Treatment failure occurs in 10% of patients that undergo treatment with prednisone. For those who undergo liver transplantation, approximately a third of patients have a recurrence of autoimmune hepatitis.
