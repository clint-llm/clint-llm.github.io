Von Economo encephalitis involves acute and chronic phases.

Parkinsonism with extrapyramidal signs due to basal ganglia involvement can be seen as an early or late complication. Patients will present stiffness and bradykinesia involving the upper extremities more than the lower. They can also show chorea, myoclonus, torsion spasms, and facial tics, including the tongue and palate.

The chronic phase of encephalitis lethargica can immediately follow the acute phase; however, it usually starts one to five years later. This phase was typified by parkinsonism. Several other symptoms occurred concomitantly, including oculomotor abnormalities, sleep disturbances, psychiatric disorders, and involuntary movements. Psychiatric manifestations consisted of mood changes, euphoria, increased sexual drive, and hallucinations. Post paresis phase had presentations of increased reflexes, including positive Babinski’s signs and spasms for a prolonged time even after the recovery from ocular muscle paralysis and somnolence.
