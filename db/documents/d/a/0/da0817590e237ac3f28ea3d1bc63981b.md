Pulmonary sarcoidosis is often asymptomatic, non-progressive disease and requires no treatment, as a majority of patients undergo spontaneous remission. Close monitoring of symptoms, chest radiograph, and pulmonary function is continued at three to six-month intervals should be considered in asymptomatic patients. For patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis causing worsening symptoms, stage II to III radiographic findings should be considered for oral glucocorticoids at 0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg for 4 to 6 weeks.  If there is no improvement in symptoms, radiographic abnormalities, and pulmonary function tests, steroids may be continued for an additional four to six weeks. Maintainance steroids are not needed; steroid tapering to a dose of 0.25 to 0.5mg/kg (usually 10 to 20 mg) per day should be considered over a period of at least six to eight months. Methotrexate, azathioprine, infliximab, leflunomide, and antimalarial agents may be considered as steroid-sparing agents in patients who are unable to tolerate steroids.

Lung transplant is an option for patients with end-stage lung disease. However, the transplant is also associated with risks and the need to take immunosuppressive therapy for life.
