Basal cell carcinoma can be broken into three main categories: superficial, nodular, and infiltrative. Nodular basal cell carcinoma is the most common subtype and presents as a pink, pearly papule with overlying telangiectasias and rolled borders. It commonly occurs on the head and neck, and it is a slow-growing papule that will often ulcerate and bleed. The latter may mislead male patients to dismiss the neoplasm as a cut while shaving. Superficial basal cell carcinoma presents as a thin, pink plaque, papule, or macule with a pink, pearly border that is most commonly seen on the chest, back, or extremities. Infiltrative basal cell carcinomas include infiltrative, micronodular, and morpheaform subtypes. Morpheaform basal cell carcinoma presents as a firm, scar-like plaque and should be considered in the presentation of a new scar without previous trauma to the area. Infiltrative and micronodular basal cell carcinoma present similarly to nodular basal cell carcinoma as pink, pearly papules with overlying telangiectasias.
