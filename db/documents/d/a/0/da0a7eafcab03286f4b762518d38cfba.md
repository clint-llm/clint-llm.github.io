- Allergy to natalizumab

- History of progressive multi leukoencephalopathy

**Box Warning**

- When used with other immune-modulating drugs, the risk of progressive multi leukoencephalopathy (PML) and an opportunistic infection caused by the (John Cunningham) JC virus increases. There is a boxed warning for this reason, and prescribers should carefully consider the risks versus benefits of using natalizumab for each patient. Immune modulating drugs, including corticosteroids, should be discontinued if possible before using natalizumab.

- It is contraindicated for immunosuppressed individuals. This includes individuals with human immunodeficiency virus, AIDS, leukemia, lymphoma, or those who have had organ transplants.
