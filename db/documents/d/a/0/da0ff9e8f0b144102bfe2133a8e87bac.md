The Subcommittee on Platelet Physiology, part of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), has offered guidance on the diagnosis of GT and other inherited platelet function disorders (IPFD). According to their algorithm, if the patient has clear clinical bleeding abnormalities, preliminary laboratory tests may include a complete blood count (CBC), activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), prothrombin time, and assessments for von Willebrand disease such as von Willebrand Factor (vWF) antigen, ristocetin cofactor activity, and factor VIII coagulant activity. These tests help rule out more common causes of bleeding, and they are generally normal in GT and other IPFD. Further evaluation consists of platelet function studies or next-generation sequencing. Screening mayÂ include a blood smear, light transmission aggregometry (LTA), platelet granule release assessment, and flow cytometry to analyze platelet surface glycoproteins.

LTA, the gold standard test, reveals altered platelet aggregation with agonists other than ristocetin.

Secondary tests may include clot retraction, which is impaired in GT. Molecular genetic tests are included in the ISTH guidance for cases that remain undiagnosed after other laboratory studies. Gene mutations in ITGA2B or ITGB3 are identified in GT.
