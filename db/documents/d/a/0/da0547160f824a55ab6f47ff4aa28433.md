Recognition of calcified plaque is essential during PCI to optimize stent implantation. Calcified plaque is best assessed and characterized by intravascular imaging modalities. Stent under-expansion is a frequent complication of PCI in severely calcified plaque and correlates with high rates of in-stent restenosis. Severe coronary artery calcification frequently warrants lesion preparation to facilitate optimal stent expansion.

After PCI, management involving an interprofessional team that includes the vascular surgeon, the primary care provider, and nurse practitioner, as well as specialty trained nursing and pharmacy, should participate in optimizing patient care following the procedure to enhance patient outcomes. Communication between these professionals will improve the coordination of care. Specialty trained nurses in cardiology, intensive care, and rehabilitation may be involved.

In the aftermath, the primary care physician, nursing, and pharmacy can collaboratively educate the patient on limiting the risk factors for CAD include cessation of smoking, participating in regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining optimal body weight.Â [Level 5]
