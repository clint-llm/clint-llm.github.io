Platelets maintain hemostasis by adhering to the vascular endothelium, aggregating with other platelets, and initiating the coagulation cascade, leading to the production of a fibrin mesh, which effectively prevents significant blood loss. Platelets are also crucial in inflammation, tissue growth, and immune response. These processes are under the mediation of the release of compounds from the alpha and dense granules, which include numerous growth factors as well as IgG and components of the complement system.
