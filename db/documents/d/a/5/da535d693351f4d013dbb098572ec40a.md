Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist, also classified as a class II antiarrhythmic. It exerts its response by competitively blocking beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic stimulation in the heart, which is typically induced by epinephrine and norepinephrine.

Beta-1 receptors are present on cardiac myocytes, including the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. When there is an activation of these receptors, there is an increase in cyclic AMP, which leads to increased intracellular calcium. This process leads to increased contractility of muscle fibers. When there is a blockage of beta-adrenergic receptors, this results in an overall decreased workload of the heart, which leads to subsequent reduced oxygen demand and myocardial remodeling.

Beta-2 receptor activation, on the other hand, leads to increased cyclic AMP that activates protein kinase A, leading to the relaxation of smooth muscle cells in a variety of organs and vessels. Therefore, when beta-2 receptors are blocked, this leads to a small amount of vasoconstriction. This effect can make the use of emergency epinephrine in asthmatics quite problematic, as it blocks the receptors that epinephrine would potentially bind to in the lungs.
