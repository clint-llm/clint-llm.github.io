In Western medicine and law, the move away from paternalism toward a patient-centered, patient autonomy first approach has made vital the communication of risks with patients to enable patients to make informed choices about their care, as reviewed elsewhere. This activity reviews risks associated with the performance of common diagnostic medical imaging exams, examines patient safety standards set by organizations tasked with preserving public safety, describes strategies to minimize patient safety risks from diagnostic medical imaging, and reviews how radiology exam risks can be communicated between healthcare providers and with patients so that the parties involved understand the risks and can make decisions based on the risks and their personal values, and also covers ethical, legal, other policy-based duties that healthcare providers have in disclosing risks patients may incur from medical imaging. Finally, it describes ways that healthcare providers can work in teams to promote patient safety and communication in medical imaging.

**Objectives:**
- Review risks patients face when undergoing CTs, fluoroscopic exams, MRIs, ultrasounds, and contrast-based exams and how to minimize those risks.
- Explain to patients how the risk of ionizing radiation increases their risk of developing cancer.
- Describe patient safety standards and resources on patient safety standards in the United States.
- Outline legal obligations of healthcare providers in the United States for disclosing risks concerning medical imaging exams to patients and ethical concepts from which those legal obligations arise and how the interprofessional approach can achieve these standards.
