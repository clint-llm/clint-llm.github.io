Histologic examination of the well-circumscribed neurilemmoma shows degenerative changes and a variable presentation of compact spindles, referred to as "Antoni A" bodies and microcystic areas with a high concentration of macrophages and collagen fibers, designated as "Antoni B" bodies. Additionally, nuclear palisading around cell bodies is described as Verocay bodies and is strongly suggestive of neurilemmomas. Schwannomas classically stain strongly for S100 protein expression on immunohistochemistry and will have pericellular type IV collagen in abundance. Glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), podoplanin, calretinin, and SOX10 may be present in varying degrees within different subtypes of neurilemmomas.
