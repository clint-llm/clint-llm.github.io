The Achilles tendon is comprised of type I collagen fibers; these fibers are both very strong and very flexible. The tendon is covered in a thin layer of connective tissue known as paratenon, which is rich in elastin and penetrates into the tendon, keeping the collagen bundles together while allowing movement between them.

The difference between tendinosis and tendinitis is that in the former there are degenerative changes in the tendon's structure and the sheath, making it more vulnerable and prone to breaking. At the cellular level, there is no evidence of an acute or recent inflammatory process. In tendinitis, the opposite happens; there is an acute inflammatory process, resulting from acute trauma, excessive use, or lack of training.

One study found that the microenvironment of the Achilles tendon in rats induced the stem cells to differentiate into chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages, which predispose to tendon rupture (tendinosis). After this rupture, an inflammatory cascade appears that increases the expression of proinflammatory cytokine mRNA, matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and necrosis factor tumor alpha (TNF-a).

However, the chronic inflammation induces neovascularization that promotes the rupture of the tendon, increasing disability and complexity in management.
