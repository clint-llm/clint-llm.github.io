The role and utility of endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) in the work-up of cardiovascular diseases remains controversial and the practice varies widely in different centers. EMB is a diagnostic modality used to evaluate various cardiac diseases in which non-invasive testing is usually not able to formulate a clinical diagnosis. This activity describes the background, indications, complications, and the technique required to perform an endomyocardial biopsy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients that undergo this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications and contraindications of endomyocardial biopsy.
- Describe the equipment and technique in regards to endomyocardial biopsy.
- Review the potential complications of endomyocardial biopsy.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the care of patients that undergo endomyocardial biopsy.
