Renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are the most prevalent benign renal tumor.

Angiomyolipomas are sometimes mistakenly referred to as hamartomas. While both are benign, the difference is that an angiomyolipoma is a true tumor, while a hamartoma is defined as a disorganized collection of normal local tissue and cells that are usually the result of a trauma, infection, infarction, obstruction, or hemorrhage. Although first described by Grawitz, angiomyolipomas are distinct from Grawitz tumors which are malignant renal cell carcinomas and hypernephromas.

Imaging plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of renal angiomyolipomas.

The fundamental diagnostic criterion of classic angiomyolipoma is detecting a large amount of adipose tissue on radiological imaging.

The management of angiomyolipomas is generally based on the clinical manifestations, tumor size, number, growth pattern, and malignant potential.
