A temporoparietal fascia flap is a work-horse option in the armamentarium of the reconstructive surgeon. TPFF transfer is a low-risk option for reconstructing local (craniofacial) and distal soft tissue defects. It has found popularity in head and neck reconstruction as a pedicled flap but may be harvested as a free flap for extremity reconstruction. The outcomes can be very satisfactory in the hands of an experienced and knowledgeable surgeon. Additionally, there is very little donor site morbidity, with most patients and surgeons not noticing any decreased soft tissue mass within the temporal fossa.
