Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a metastrongyloid nematode that is one of the most common pathogens to cause eosinophilic meningitis. Commonly referred to as the “rat lungworm,” it is transmitted by both rats (definite hosts), snails, and slugs (intermediate hosts) among some other transport hosts (see below). The parasite is most prevalent in the Asia-Pacific regions; however, outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported outside of the endemic areas. To date, nine species have been identified, but A. cantonensis and A. costaricensis remain the most important human pathogens.
