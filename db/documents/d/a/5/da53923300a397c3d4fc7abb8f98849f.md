Soluble guanylate cyclase is a heterodimeric protein with an alpha and beta subunit. It is a hemoprotein, meaning NO binds to soluble guanylateÂ cyclase heme, and this binding activates the enzyme.

Membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase contains an extracellular domain which binds to hormones such as ANP and BNP, a transmembrane domain, kinase homology domain, hinge region, and guanylyl cyclase domain, which converts GTP to cGMP

Membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase has seven different isozymes GC-A through GC-G. GC-A mediates ANP and BNP and controls blood pressure, along with regulating cellular growth in the brain and kidney, angiogenesis, liver regeneration, and lipolysis in adipose tissue. GC-B stimulates proliferation of chondrocytes by cGMP activation of protein kinase 2 at the growth plate.

GC-A is also called NPR-A and expresses throughout the cardiovascular system, in vascular smooth muscle, vascular endothelium, and heart, as well as the kidney. GC-B, also called NPR-B, is also highly expressed in vascular endothelium and smooth muscle, though its presence in cardiac tissue predominantly localize to the non-myocyte population and mostly in fibroblasts.
