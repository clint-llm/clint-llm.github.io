Dorsal penile nerve blocks are an effective clinical tool. They provide a rapid onset of anesthesia, allowing treatment of penile conditions in both the elective and emergency settings. When used judiciously, they can prevent the need for a general anesthetic and for patients to be promptly treated in the emergency department. Nurse practitioners or primary care providers who wish to perform a dorsal penile nerve block should be familiar with the anatomy of the penis to avoid complications.

A meta-analysis provides level I evidence that dorsal penile nerve block is more effective in providing analgesia than a eutectic mixture of local anesthetic (EMLA) block with a small incidence of failure (4% to 8%) or hematoma (5%).
