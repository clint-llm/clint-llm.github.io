Complications may include:

- Bleeding at the biopsy site

- Hematoma

- Infection

Pressure dressings and ice may minimize the development of bleeding or hematomas. A suture is often needed for hemostasis, particularly after a punch biopsy greater than 3mm to 4 mm. Uncontaminated procedures have a less than 5% infection rate. Prophylactic antibiotics can be considered if the patient is at high risk.

Rarely do patients experience a hypersensitivity reaction or a vasovagal response. If a vasovagal reaction occurs, place the patient in a Trendelenburg position or place the patient flat and elevate the legs.
