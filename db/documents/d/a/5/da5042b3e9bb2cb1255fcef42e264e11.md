Adrenal cortical hyperplasia is among the differential diagnosis of the adrenal incidentaloma. Following the exclusion of the exogenous corticosteroid intake, the stepwise laboratory and imaging investigations are highly recommended. Nodular adrenal cortical hyperplasia occurs in a couple of subtypes, including primary pigmented nodular adrenal disease (PPNAD) or ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (AIMAH), which are both common in terms of a low level of ACTH, and elevated level of cortisol. Abdominal imaging, including CTscan and MRI, might elucidate characteristic findings relevant to the diagnosis. Definite curative treatment could be assumed via bilateral surgical resection of both glands and lifelong hormone replacement.
