Following fixation of radius and ulna shaft fractures, the patient should be placed into a splint that immobilizes the elbow and forearm on the affected extremity. The fingers and thumb should be left free to encourage a range of motion and prevent stiffness. Typically, the patient can begin range of motion exercises of the elbow and forearm 5 to 7 days post-surgery. The patient should be routinely followed postoperatively until the soft tissues have healed and the bone union has been confirmed radiographically. This usually occurs around 2 to 3 months post-surgery. Once the bone union has been confirmed, the patient can resume most activities using the affected limb.
