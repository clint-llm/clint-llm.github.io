Due to its diverse definitions, sexual assault statistical analysis varies widely by source. However, there is documentation that the lifetime prevalence of assault is roughly 3% in men and ranges from 13 to 39% in women. These longitudinal studies may neglect under-represented and often high-risk populations such as incarcerated, pediatric, elderly, or disabled patients.

**Physical Trauma**

Roughly 66% of sexual assault victims report physical trauma, with physical findings due to force manifesting more often than genital trauma. Injuries range from defensive marks to penetrating trauma and can be hidden by hair or clothing.

**Emotional Trauma**

There are significant implications of sexual assault on mental health. Nearly 46% of women that experienced sexual assault during their adulthood qualified for a diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, which manifests as recurring thoughts or emotions concerning the event, hyperarousal state, and chronic substance abuse.

Even without the initial self-blame, a referral to a therapist or other trained personnel is often necessary. Depression, anxiety, shame, guilt, intimacy-related complaints can all be concerns of victims following sexual assault. Some victims may struggle with processing the event; thus, they may require written documentation to serve as a reminder about the completed assessment and resources available for survivors of sexual assault.
