Normally, suspensory ligaments and fixation of the colon will prevent the interposition of the colon between the liver and diaphragm. Variations in this anatomy lead to the pathological interposition of the colon seen in Chilaiditi syndrome. These variations can include the absence, laxity, or elongation of the suspensory ligaments of the transverse colon or falciform ligament. Other factors that can predispose one to develop Chilaiditi syndrome include congenital malpositions, functional disorders such as chronic constipation caused by colonic elongation and redundancy, gaseous distension of the colon, small liver due to cirrhosis or hepatectomy, ascites due to increased intraabdominal pressure, substantial weight loss in obese patients and abnormally high diaphragm or diaphragmatic paralysis (which can present in conditions such as diaphragmatic muscular degeneration or phrenic nerve injury), a chronic obstructive lung disease that causes enlargement of the lower thoracic cavity, and multiple pregnancies. Intellectual disability and schizophrenia are also associated with anatomic variations that result in the Chilaiditi sign. A couple of cases describe iatrogenically induced Chilaiditi syndrome from bariatric surgery, enteral feeding tube insertion, and colonoscopy.
