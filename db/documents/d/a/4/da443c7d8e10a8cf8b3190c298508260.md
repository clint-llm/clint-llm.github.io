The possible complications of these procedures include edema, pain, infection, flap necrosis, scarring, bleeding/hematoma, and hypertrophic scar or keloid. Fairly specific to transposition flaps is the trapdoor effect in which there is a "pincushion" appearance (elevation of part of the flap above surrounding skin). This phenomenon can be aggravated byÂ insufficient tissue undermining, an oversized flap, excess subcutaneous fat in the flap, or insufficient flap contact with the wound base. Trapdoor deformities are more likely to occur when the flap is superiorly based, and the lymphatic drainage pathways are interrupted at the dependent aspect of the flap due to an incision.
