Diagnosis of KMP requires laboratory evaluation and identification of an underlying vascular tumor. Laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood count, coagulation panel, and PTT and PTT. Thrombocytopenia may be severe. Coagulation studies will reveal a prolonged PT and PTT, hypofibrinogenemia, and increased D-dimer.

When identifying the underlying, cutaneous lesion, physical examination may be sufficient. If a visceral tumor is suspected, further imaging such as MRI may be useful in establishing both the presence of the tumor and its local extent. MRI may show significant gadolinium enhancement with dermal and subcutaneous thickening.
