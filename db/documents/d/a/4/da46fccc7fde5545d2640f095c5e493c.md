Patients often describe vertigo as the sensation of motion that occurs in the absence of motion or an altered sensation of motion that occurs with normal motion. In vertigo associated with vestibular migraines, the sensation is often described as "to-and-fro". Vestibular migraines are not always accompanied by concurrent headaches, so an in-depth history and multi-specialty evaluation are pivotal to make the correct diagnosis. This activity describes the pathophysiology, etiology, presentation, and management of vestibular migraines and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of vestibular migraine.
- Review the presentation of vestibular migraine.
- Summarize the treatment options for vestibular migraines.
- Explain the importance of enhancing care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by vestibular migraine.
