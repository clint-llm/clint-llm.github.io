Risks associated with any injection include:

- Infection at the site of the injection

- Increased inflammation and pain at the site of the injection

- Bleeding and/or bruising

- Injury to blood vessels or nerves

- Allergic reaction to the local anesthetic or other medications used during the procedure.

An accidental intravascular injection of phenol may cause tinnitus and flushing. Partial nerve destruction may cause neuritis of a somatic nerve with subsequent regeneration and dysesthesia or hyperesthesia (procedure failure).

Systemic side effects (e.g., due intravascular injection of a local anesthetic) include nausea and vomiting, leg numbness which usually lasts a few hours, as well as serious side effects such as central nervous system (CNS) stimulation with seizures, and cardiovascular and/or CNS depression until cardiac arrest and coma.
