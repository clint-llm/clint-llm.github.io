Healthy intact bone is resistant to infection. The bone becomes susceptible to disease with the introduction of a large inoculum of bacteria, from trauma, ischemia, or the presence of foreign bodies because bone sites to which microorganisms can bind are exposed.Staphylococcus aureus adhere to the bone by expressing receptors, called adhesins, for some components of the bone matrix, including laminin, collagen, fibronectin, and bone sialoglycoprotein. S. aureus expresses a collagen-binding adhesin, which permits its attachment to bone cartilage while the fibronectin-binding adhesin's role in attachment of bacteria to surgically implanted devices in bone was recently discovered.S. aureus can survive intracellularly after being internalized by cultured osteoblasts. Some bacteria create a protective biofilm coating around themselves and underlying surfaces. This characteristic of some bacteria to adhere to the bone and surgically implanted devices following which they express phenotypic resistance to antibiotic therapy and their ability to survive intracellularly may explain the persistence of bone infections and high failure rates of shorter courses of antimicrobial treatment.
