The landmark PICARD (Program to improve care in acute renal disease) study conducted in five United States medical institutions included a cohort of 618 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with AKI. The reported etiology of 50% of those patients with acute renal failure was found to be acute tubular necrosis from ischemic causes, and the other 25% were nephrotoxic acute tubular necrosis leading to renal failure. A Spanish multicenter study in 13 tertiary care hospitals in Madrid found the most frequent cause of AKI was acute tubular necrosis in 45% of the hospitalized patients.
