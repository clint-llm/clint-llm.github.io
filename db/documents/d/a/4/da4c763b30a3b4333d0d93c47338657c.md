Most commonly, technetium-99m causes rash, angioedema, fever, and anaphylaxis due to hypersensitivity reactions. Patients may also experience a transient increase in blood pressure, seizures, arrhythmias, and syncope. When used in abdominal imaging, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur. Patients may experience transient arthritis if the joint is affected.

Severe hypersensitivity type reactions may occur shortly following the administration of Technetium-99m. The administering nurse or physician should have corticosteroids and antihistamines at the ready in the event complications do arise.

Adverse effects can be uniquely associated with either Tc-99m or the radiopharmaceutical it is tagged do. Tc99m MDP is more likely to manifest an adverse reaction as a skin rash.
