Temporal bone fractures are uncommon but may involve many important structures and cause various diagnostic and therapeutic issues. A large amount of force is required to fracture the temporal bone, so patients often present with other concomitant injuries. Unlike fractures in other head and neck regions, the management of temporal bone fractures is focused on addressing functional deficits rather than reduction and fixation. Since the temporal bone is non-weight bearing, cosmetic sequelae are rare secondary to this trauma. However, deficits from facial nerve injury can be devastating to patients from not only a functional perspective but also a cosmetic standpoint. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of facial nerve injuries associated with temporal bone fractures and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing patients with these injuries.

**Objectives:**
- Discuss the pathophysiology of temporal bone trauma and how it can affect the facial nerve and other important structures.
- Outline the evaluation process, including history and physical examination procedures, needed to effectively evaluate facial nerve damage secondary to temporal bone trauma.
- Review the treatment options available in temporal bone fracture-associated facial nerve injury cases.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in prompt diagnosis of temporal bone trauma with facial paralysis and to improve patient outcomes in the short and long term.
