Work up of hypocalcemia can be thought of in the following parts:

- Confirming the hypocalcemia: The first part of the evaluation should focus on confirming the hypocalcemia and require checking a serum albumin level to correct the total calcium or directly measure the ionized calcium level (where available).To correct hypoalbuminemia, add 0.8 mg/dl to the total serum calcium for each 1 g/dl decrease in albumin below 4 g/dl.

- An EKG should be obtained to look for QTc prolongation, which, if present, is a risk factor for Torsades de pointes.

- Etiology of hypocalcemia: Once hypocalcemia is confirmed, further testing should be done to determine the cause of hypocalcemia. That entails checking electrolytes such as serum magnesium and phosphorus levels, intact PTH, and vitamin D levels. Some causes are obvious, as in patients post thyroidectomy or parathyroidectomy. Other biomarkers may be obtained as indicated by history and physical exam, e.g., serum lipase in suspected pancreatitis.

- Imaging the bones may reveal osteomalacia, rickets, or even metastatic disease.
