Rotator cuff tendonitis is an inflammation of the tendons that make up the rotator cuff, i.e., supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. This condition is often seen along with shoulder impingement and can present acutely following an injury or as a result of chronic, repetitive overuse activities. This is best evaluated using radiographs (Grashey view) and managed using physical therapy, medical and surgical interventions. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of this condition and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with rotator cuff tendonitis. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of rotator cuff tendinitis, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the diagnostic approach to evaluating rotator cuff tendon injuries.
- Review the key differentials for rotator cuff tendon injuries.
- Outline treatment and management options for patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by rotator cuff tendonitis.
