Usually, a pulse examination post-intervention should be documented and compared with pre-intervention. An ultrasound study should be performed one hour after treatment to demonstrate successful closure of the sac. In addition, a clinic appointment one-week post-intervention should be scheduled to evaluate for skin necrosis, pulse status as well as sac closure with a hand-held ultrasound probe.
