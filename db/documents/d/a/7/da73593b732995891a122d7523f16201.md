For a general pediatrician who manages health surveillance of patients, it is imperative to be knowledgeable about the signs and symptoms of neurocutaneous syndromes. Once a clinician suspects a patient might have a neurocutaneous syndrome, it becomes vital for the general practitioner to coordinate the surveillance of these patients' health; this means assuring that the patient will have the appropriate follow up with an interprofessional team, including neurologists, developmental pediatricians, surgeons, ophthalmologists, audiologists, dermatologist and more. It is also essential to have appropriate cognitive function surveillance and to assure that the patients will receive all the educational services available and needed for them to have the best outcome in their education and development.
