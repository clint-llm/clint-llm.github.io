The electronic fetal monitor (called the cardiotocogram in the United Kingdom and other countries) is the equipment used for the prenatal nonstress test. The modern equipment records fetal heart rate pattern, contractions, fetal cardiac activity, maternal blood pressure and heart rate on a graph. It has a Doppler transducer for fetal heart rate monitoring and a pressure transducer for monitoring of uterine contractions and fetal movement. The transducers are placed on the pregnant abdomen using belts. The equipment is portable and can be placed in small rooms in the office setting and the hospital as needed. Computerized storage and interpretation of FHR records are obtainable with conventional monitors. Computerized cardiotocography provides a more detailed analysis of the fetal heart rate pattern but has not proved superior to the conventional nonstress test.
