Some complications of kwashiorkor include:

- Hepatomegaly (from the fatty liver)

- Cardiovascular system collapse/hypovolemic shock

- Urinary tract infections

- Abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract including atrophy of the pancreas with subsequent glucose intolerance, atrophy of the mucosa of the small intestine, lactase deficiency, ileus, bacterial overgrowth, which can lead to bacterial septicemia and death.

- Loss of immune function, antioxidant function, subsequent infections, septic shock, and death.

- Endocrinopathies where insulin levels are decreased; growth hormone is increased, but insulin-like growth factor levels are reduced. This leads to insulin intolerance

- Metabolic disturbances and hypothermia

- Impaired cellular functions, including endothelial dysfunction

- Electrolyte abnormalities are commonplace
