Teriparatide is a well-tolerated drug. Short-term side effects reported by patients include nausea, headache, dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension.Â  Alterations of calcium metabolism are common, with hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria being the two most frequent side effects.

The most concerning adverse effect of teriparatide therapy is the risk of skeletal carcinogenicity, most notably osteosarcoma. Researchers detected the carcinogenic effect in Fisher rats subjected to the treatment of relatively high doses ranging from 5 to 75 mcg/kg/day for a 2-yr period. It is considered to be minimal and nonsignificant in humans because of several lines of evidence: differences between rat and human skeletal physiologies, the fact that two years represent almost 90% of the rats' lifespan while representing only 2 to 3 % of that of humans and the doses used are three to 58-fold the prescribed human dose, the detection of only 3 cases of osteosarcoma with unproven causality in over 1 million patients treated with teriparatide, and an ongoing post-marketing surveillance study of teriparatide use in humans showing no incident risk of osteosarcoma at 8-year interim analysis.
