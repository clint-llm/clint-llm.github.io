Current recommendations recommend that troponin testing should be available in all hospitals 24/7 with a turnaround time of 60 minutes.

In addition to its application as a diagnostic marker for MI, elevated levels of troponin also have prognostic significance; high levels suggest an elevated risk for adverse cardiac events. Further, data show that increasing levels of troponin and creatinine are strong predictors of worsening of congestive heart failure.
