The lesions either appear at birth or shortly afterward. They initially present as a solitary smooth, yellow, well-circumscribed plaque with an oval or linear configuration. When multiple, lesions often arise along the lines of Blaschko. Nevus sebaceus is typically asymptomatic. In the scalp, they are classically associated with overlying partial or total alopecia. At puberty, nevus sebaceus becomes more prominent. It takes on a verrucous or mamillated appearance secondary to the hormonal changes of the child. This evolution mirrors the histologic differentiation of normal sebaceous glands of the skin. The patient or their parents may present to the dermatology clinic for evaluation and potential removal due to its clinical appearance.

Although additional extracutaneous findings would be exceedingly rare, a complete physical should be conducted looking for features such as a coloboma, corneal clouding, strabismus, spinal curvature, hip dislocation, or limb deformities. Consultation with an ophthalmologist or orthopedist should be requested; if any of these extracutaneous findings are present, a neurologist should also be consulted as the neurologic sequelae (such as seizures) may not be evident on physical examination.
