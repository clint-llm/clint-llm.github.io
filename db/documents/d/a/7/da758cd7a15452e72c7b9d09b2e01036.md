Trauma patients with blunt or penetrating injuries to the chest, abdomen, and pelvis have an increased risk of a renal injury, and so it is important to be on high alert during history taking in these patients for possible renal injury. It is also important to recognize the patient with preexisting renal anatomic abnormalities as they can have a significant renal injury with minor trauma, emphasizing the importance of an adequate history intake in these patients.

These patients need a careful examination of their chest, abdomen, flank, and genitourinary regions. Renal injury should be highly suspected in the patient with tenderness, pain, palpable mass or ecchymosis in their flank, abdomen or back.
