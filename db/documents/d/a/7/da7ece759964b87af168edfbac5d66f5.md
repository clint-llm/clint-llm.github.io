Performance of IVUS assessment of a vessel can be with either a manual or automatic pullback. Automated pullback allows for length measurements by producing a longitudinal profile, which is useful for the determination of the appropriate stent length that should be selected. Stent diameter selection the identification of and then measuring the proximal and distal references. Following stent implantation, IVUS can assess the minimal stent area (MSA), a prognostic indicator closely associated with the likelihood of future events related to the stent.
