An internist, an emergency physician, a pulmonary specialist, specialized nurses, respiratory therapists, and physician assistants all need to play their part in the management of patients with emphysema. A pulmonary specialist's help is to be sought in the following cases:

- When the diagnosis is uncertain

- Persistent symptoms despite initial medical therapy

- Frequent exacerbations despite medical management

- ATTD is diagnosed

- Atypical presentation

- Alarming features (hemoptysis, weight loss, night sweats)

- Coexistence of asthma and COPD

- Other comorbid illnesses
