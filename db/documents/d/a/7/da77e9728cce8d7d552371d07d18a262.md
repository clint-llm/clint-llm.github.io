Differential diagnoses of AVF include other conditions that result in hyperdynamic circulation, such as tachycardia, increased cardiac output, and decreased peripheral resistance.

- **Arteriovenous malformation:**These are congenital lesions from the failure of fetal vascular differentiation. High flow or complex AVMs are more likely to have high resistance, similar to a capillary bed, and, therefore, are more likely to be asymptomatic.

- **Hemangioma:**Hemangiomas, also known as vascular tumors, may have similar symptoms to AVFs. However, these tend to present with overt bleeding. Hemangiomas have been found to have mitotic activity and can rapidly involute.

- **Pseudoaneurysm:******These may present as a pulsatile mass associated with a vascular access procedure. Pseudoaneurysms, as well as true aneurysms, may have a thrill due to significant turbulence through the area. Doppler US can differentiate these from a fistula.

- **Malignancy:**Malignant masses can require significant blood flow and present as a previously unnoticed pulsatile mass if closer to a larger vessel. Doppler US and/or multiphasic imaging can help to differentiate these.

- **Cyst****/Abscess****/Hematoma:**These are typically identified as simple hypodense lesions on the duplex US and will not demonstrate flow.
