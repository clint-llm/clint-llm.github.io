Acute inflammation is an immediate, adaptive response with limited specificity caused by several noxious stimuli, such as infection and tissue damage (tissue necrosis). The controlled inflammatory response is generally beneficial, and this can be seen clearly in providing protection against infectious organisms, including mycobacterium tuberculosis, protozoa, fungi, and other parasites. However, it can become detrimental if not regulated, such as seen in septic shock.

The process will initiate in the presence of inducers, which can be infectious organisms or non-infectious stimuli such as foreign bodies and signals from necrotic cells or damaged tissues. This will, in turn, activate the sensors, which are specialized molecules. The sensors will then stimulate the mediators, which are endogenous chemicals that can induce pain, activate or inhibit inflammation and tissue repair, and can activate the effectors, which are the tissues and cells.
