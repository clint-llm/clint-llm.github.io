Lidocaine is a local anesthetic drug that produces transient loss of sensory, motor, and autonomic function when the drug is injected or applied in proximity to neural tissue. It is the most common local anesthetic and is used in almost all medical specialties. It also is commonly used as an antiarrhythmic agent to depress ventricular arrhythmias. Applied either by injection, inhalation, or as a topical agent to provide anesthesia, lidocaine has a good safety margin before reaching toxic blood levels. Since it can be applied in various forms to the same patients, however, care must be taken to keep track of the total dose given to minimize its systemic toxicity. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management/prevention of lidocaine toxicity and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the toxicokinetics of lidocaine toxicity when it is used by its various methods of administration.
- Summarize the presenting signs and symptoms and expected examination findings in the evaluation of a patient with lidocaine toxicity.
- Review treatment and management strategies available for lidocaine toxicity.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and collaboration to employ better identification, screening, and treatment of lidocaine toxicity and improve patient outcomes.
