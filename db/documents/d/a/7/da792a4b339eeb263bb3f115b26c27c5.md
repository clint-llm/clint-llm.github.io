Bombesin receptors (BBR) are G-protein-coupled receptors. These receptors classify into three different types.

- Neuromedin-B receptor ([NMB] also known as bombesin receptor 1 [BRS1, BB1, BBR-1])

- Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor ([GRPR] also known as bombesin receptor 2 [BRS1, BB2, BBR-2]).

- GRPR is expressed in the pancreas and at lower levels in the colon, breast, prostate, and skin.
- Bombesin binding sites in the pancreas have a higher affinity for GRP and bombesin than compared to its other analog neuromedin B. This compares to the bombesin binding sites in the esophagus, which have a higher affinity to neuromedin B and bombesin than compared to GRP; this suggests that although bombesin has mammalian analogs, their true functions are not identical. The GRP-preferring binding sites were called "BB2" while the NMB-preferring binding sites were called "BB1". GRP has a higher affinity for BBR-2 than for BBR-1, making it a promising target for directed cancer therapies.

- Orphan receptor ([OR], also known as bombesin receptor 3 [BRS3, BB3, or BBR-3]).
- The bombesin receptor-3 (BBR-3): The synthetic Bn peptide analog can be radiolabeled and used for binding studies in human tissues because it has a high affinity for human BRS-3.

Bombesin has no known antagonist capability (i.e., receptor blocking effects). The area of the bombesin molecule that controls essential physiological activity also determines the affinity of the peptide toward its receptors. That is, the difference in potency amongst various derivatives and analogs of bombesin correlates with the variety in their receptor affinities. Of the segments and analogs of bombesin examined, none have been observed to occupy the bombesin receptor without causing a full biological response. Therefore, there remain no bombesin-related peptides that operate as a bombesin receptor antagonist.

As a stimulatory peptide, bombesin's effects do have variable potency in their impacts. The essential physiological effect of bombesin-related peptides is attributed to the carboxy-terminal portion of the molecule.
