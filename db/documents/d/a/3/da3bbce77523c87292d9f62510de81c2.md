Upper extremity injuries are usually treated in non-operative modalities such as medications, splints, injection, physical therapy. The surgical consideration of the muscles of the upper limb depends on the underlying condition.

The surgical purpose in upper limb dysfunction due to brain injury is to decrease muscle spasticity, correct joint contractures, as well as enhance the appearance, and function of the extremity. Some of the approaches to increase or decrease the muscle tone imply the peripheral nerve surgery or lengthening hyperactive muscles.

In patients with spinal cord injuries some of the surgical techniques are aimed to restore elbow rectification, and grasp of the upper limb.

Some injuries where fractures and destruction of soft tissues (skin and muscles) are present, a multidisciplinary approach is required in which the orthopedic surgeons work with plastic surgeons to treat open fractures of the extremities, osteomyelitis, or unstable scars correctly.
