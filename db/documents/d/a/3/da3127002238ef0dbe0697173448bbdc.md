There are no specific physical findings or medical history associated with hypocitraturia. However, patients taking acetazolamide or topiramate are at risk, as well as patients with a history of nephrocalcinosis or kidney stones, especially if composed of calcium phosphate. Other risk factors to be noted from the medical history would be gastric bypass surgery (especially the Roux-en-Y type), irritable bowel syndrome, chronic diarrhea, prior intestinal surgery, gout, a personal or family history of nephrolithiasis, and prior kidney stone surgeries. Previous 24-hour urine tests for nephrolithiasis prophylaxis and chemical stone composition analyses of prior renal calculi will also be helpful.
