The pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia can be classified as two types: (1) Typical agents such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Group A Streptococci, anaerobes, and gram-negative organisms and (2) Atypical agents such as Legionella, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and C. psittaci. Influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other respiratory viruses have become increasingly detected as pathogens based on molecular detection methods. Worldwide, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae are the leading causes of acute bacterial pneumonia. The most common pathogens identified in the most recent population-based active surveillance in the United States were human rhinovirus, influenza virus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
