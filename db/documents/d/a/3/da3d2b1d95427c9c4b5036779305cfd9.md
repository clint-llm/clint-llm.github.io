Over 40 species of ticks have been associated with tick paralysis. In North America, most cases are associated with Dermacentor species. Dermacentor variabilis, the American dog tick, and Dermacentor andersoni, the Rocky Mountain wood tick, are the most common species associated with tick paralysis. Other ticks such as Amblyomma americanum, the Lone Star tick, and Ixodes scapularis, the black-legged tick, are also associated with this disease. In Australia, Ixodes holocyclus, the scrub tick, is most commonly implicated. AÂ salivary neurotoxin only produced by an engorged female tick during feeding induces paralysis. Clinical presentation varies depending on the species of tick.
