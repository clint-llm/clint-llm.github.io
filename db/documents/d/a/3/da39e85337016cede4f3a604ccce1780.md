Complications from LSD intoxication can arise in a few places. One such place is the environment in which the patient ingested the substance. If the scene was not safe, and the patient caused accidental harm to themselvesÂ or others, this can lead to a myriad of complications, such as trauma.

Persistent psychotic symptoms can manifest in those who ingest large doses of LSD. Patients often refer to their "trips" as life-altering experiences, and those who experience particularly profound departures from reality may have a difficult time adjusting long after the drug's effects have worn off.

Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder is a potential complication of hallucinogen intoxication. It is a diagnosis defined in DSM-5 as a disorder in which patients not currently intoxicated by a hallucinogenic agent experience perceptual symptoms that first manifested during prior hallucinogenic experiences. These symptoms must result in clinically significant distress and impair normal social and occupational functions. Clinicians must also not attribute them to another medical condition or psychiatric diagnosis. Reports have shown these symptoms to include mainly visual disturbances, such as geometric hallucinations, halos surrounding objects, alterations in motion-perception, floaters, and flashbacks to images seen during the prior drug experience.

Autonomic complications arise when there is a failure to treat symptoms of hypertension, hypotension, arrhythmias, and hyperthermia.
