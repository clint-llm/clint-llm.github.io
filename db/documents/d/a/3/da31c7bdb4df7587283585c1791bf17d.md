Allergic contact dermatitis can present on physical exam as acute or chronic. Acute ACD characteristically presents as an erythematous, eczematous, or vesicular dermatitis. Although ACD may present with a localized, well-demarcated skin eruption most commonly on the hands or face, it can also be more widespread. For example, rinse-off products such as shampoo or body wash may come into contact with many parts of the body, leading to a more diffuse presentation.
