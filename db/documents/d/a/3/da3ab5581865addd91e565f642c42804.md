Internal jugular vein thrombosis occurs when a thrombus develops in the lumen of the internal jugular vein (IJV). Hereditary and acquired risk factors for thrombosis include intravenous drug use, factor V Leiden mutation, malignancy, hormone replacement therapy, immobilization, trauma, pregnancy, and central line cannulation. One way that interprofessional team members can decrease the incidence of this disorder is by limiting the use of internal jugular vein cannulation both in frequency and duration. Central lines should be removed when no longer needed and when possible, alternative sites should be used for venous access. This activity reviews the etiology, evaluation, and management of IJV thrombosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, treating and preventing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the risk factors for internal jugular vein thrombosis.
- Describe the imaging studies used to evaluate internal jugular vein thrombosis.
- Summarize the management considerations for internal jugular vein thrombosis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve the outcomes of patients with internal jugular vein thrombosis thrombosis.
