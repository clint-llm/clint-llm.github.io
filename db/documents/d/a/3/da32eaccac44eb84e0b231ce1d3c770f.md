Nurses and care coordinators are fundamental members of the breast imaging team, as they help ensure follow-up care for patients. As in all areas of medicine, access to care can be limited for many reasons and poses a significant threat to screening mammography. Patients with urgent or critical mammography results should be tracked, and follow-up care should not just be recommended but ensured. Care coordinators and nursing staff may communicate key results, verify follow-up appointments, and provide adequate care is received.
