The physical exam may reveal a deformity of the distal forearm, but the direction of angulation- dorsal (Colles) or volar (Smith) is difficult to discern on visualization. Also, present on the exam are swelling, pain, and decreased ROM. One of Smithâ€™s first diagnostic criteria was a deformed wrist with swelling visible on the volar side and the prominence of the ulna along the dorsum of the wrist.

Evaluation of the extremity's neurovascular status is imperative. A compromise would necessitate immediate attempts at closed reduction. Up to 15% of these fractures may show symptoms of acute carpal tunnel syndrome (ACTS) from compression to the median nerve.
