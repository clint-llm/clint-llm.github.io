Hoffa pad impingement syndrome, also known as Hoffa disease, fat pad impingement, and infrapatellar fat pad (IFP) syndrome, is painful impingement of the IFP between the patella and distal femoral condyle. The diseased fat pad is characterized by inflammation, swelling, hypertrophy, and fibrosis, most often caused by trauma or prior surgery. IFP pathology is often successfully treated nonoperatively with physical therapy. If refractory to conservative management, partial arthroscopic resection of the IFP has shown favorable results. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of Hoffa pad impingement syndrome and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomy of the infrapatellar fat pad.
- Describe the clinical examination findings and imaging of Hoffa pad impingement syndrome.
- Outline the nonoperative treatment for Hoffa pad impingement syndrome.
- Explain the operative management of Hoffa pad impingement syndrome.
