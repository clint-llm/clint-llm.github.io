Women who have spontaneous coronary artery dissection and who would like to become pregnant should receive preconception counseling as SCAD tends to recur and can present with severe complications during pregnancy. Isometric exercise, high-intensity endurance activities, and exercise involving a prolonged Valsalva maneuver should be avoided after SCAD.

Due to its potential association with female sex hormones, exposure to exogenous progesterone, estrogen, or their derivatives in the form of contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy should be avoided.
