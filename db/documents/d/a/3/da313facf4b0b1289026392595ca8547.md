Several complications may result from eclampsia. The patient may require intubation after a seizure due to a decreased level of consciousness. When the patient does require intubation, blood pressure management is crucial as laryngoscopy causes a hypertensive response and may result in intracranial hemorrhage. Patients with preeclampsia are also at risk for respiratory failure in the form of acute respiratory distress syndrome, as well as pulmonary edema. In addition, women may experience renal failure and liver failure with severe forms of preeclampsia.
