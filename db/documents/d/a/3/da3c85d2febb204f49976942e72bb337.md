Chromoblastomycosis is a rare fungal infection and is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an infectious disease consultant, surgeon, emergency department physician, wound care nurse, and an internist. Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic granulomatous infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused by several different dematiaceous fungi (brown pigment-producing), resulting in the formation of slow-growing, warty plaques, cauliflower-like lesions which may ulcerate.

The diagnosis does require clinical suspicion. The prognosis depends on the size of the lesions and the immune status of the patient. The clinician can excise single small lesions followed by antifungal therapy. If surgery is not feasible, oral antifungals alone are an alternative approach.
