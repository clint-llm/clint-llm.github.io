The physis, or growth plate, is a weak part of cartilage present in the developing bone. The physis closes in children at varying ages.

Physeal injuries are common among children and comprise 15% to 30% of all bony injuries. Salter-Harris fractures are described exclusively in children and do not occur in the well-developed bones of adults.

In general, upper-extremity injuries are more common than lower-extremity injuries.

Of the five most common Salter-Harris fracture types, type II is the most common (75%), followed by types III (10%), IV (10%), type I (5%), and lastly, type V, which is very rare and typically diagnosed retrospectively.

Males are more likely to be affected because they have an increased tendency to engage in high-risk activities. Girls are affected at a younger age (11 to 12 years) than boys (12 to 14 years).
