Patients with trichodysplasia spinulosa present with a papular, follicular facial rash with spiny keratosis, referred to as “spicules,” and non-scarring alopecia of the eyebrows. The lesions are often asymptomatic but may be somewhat pruritic. As lesions coalesce and the skin thickens, facial features can become distorted and cause a leonine facial appearance. Papules may be flesh-colored, erythematous, or hyperpigmented. The central face is most frequently affected, but other areas such as the ears, trunk, and arms may also be involved.

Immunosuppression is a critical historical component, whether it is due to medications, organ transplant, cancer, or HIV. Most reported cases involve patients with solid organ transplants on anti-rejection medications or patients being treated for hematolymphoid malignancy.
