Antibiotic Stewardship guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) mainly focus on the following:

- Incorporate direct interaction and feedback to the prescriber to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial use

- Restrict formulary antimicrobial use by requiring specialized authorizations

- Develop institution-specific clinical pathways based on local microbiology and resistance patterns

- Streamlining and de-escalate therapy to eliminate redundant combination therapy

- Ensure dose optimization based site of infection, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic characteristics

- Develop clinical pathways advising providers about appropriate parenteral to oral conversions
