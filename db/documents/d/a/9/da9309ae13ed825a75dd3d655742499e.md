FSS also called genetic short stature (GSS) is considered a normal variant of growth (along with CDGP). It is believed to be caused by small contributions of multiple genes (polygenic inheritance) although this has not been firmly established. FSS may also be caused by maternal constraint or short stature of the mother.

When short stature that runs in families is very severe, namely, less than three standard deviations below the mean for age, gender, and study population, then monogenic defects should be strongly considered and investigated.
