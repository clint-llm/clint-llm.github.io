The external carotid artery is the vessel that perfuses the structures in the face and neck. The external carotid artery adequately perfumes the head, face, and neck through several arterial branches. One of the branches formed is the superior thyroid artery. After the superior thyroid artery branches from the external carotid artery. It descends towards the thyroid gland. As the superior thyroid artery makes its way to the thyroid gland, it will perfuse the structures with which it comes in contact. One of the structures that the superior thyroid artery passes is the sternohyoid muscle. The sternohyoid muscle will receive its arterial blood supply from the superior thyroid artery.

The lymphatic drainage of the sternohyoid muscles divides into two separate paths since its a paired muscle. The right sternohyoid muscle will drain lymph fluid into the supraclavicular or cervical lymph nodes while the left sternohyoid muscle drains its lymph into the left supraclavicular or cervical lymph nodes. The right supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes will then drain the lymph into the right lymphatic duct. The left supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes will drain the lymph into the thoracic duct. Both the right lymphatic duct and the thoracic duct will drain the lymph back into the central circulation.
