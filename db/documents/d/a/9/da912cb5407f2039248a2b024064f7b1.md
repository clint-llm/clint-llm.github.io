On a cellular level, aging is believed to result from a variety of factors related to cellular senescence. The overarching notion is that human cells can only replicate a finite number of times before they become senescent. Previous research has shown that telomeres on the DNA strand gradually shorten as a cell divides.

The mechanism by which this occurs can be summarized by understanding that the telomeres appear to serve a chromosome-protective role. As the telomere length decreases, so too are the protective qualities of the proteins, which are normally at the distal ends of the telomere and allow DNA repair enzymes to recognize telomeres amongst sites of DNA damage. As a result, the loss of telomere length and concomitant loss of these protective proteins exposes the ends of the chromosomes to damage by DNA repair enzymes.

This process is compounded by DNA repair complex-mediated activation of transcription factor p53, which, in conjunction with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, can result in subsequent senescence of cells and, ultimately, cessation of their metabolic and replicative functions.
