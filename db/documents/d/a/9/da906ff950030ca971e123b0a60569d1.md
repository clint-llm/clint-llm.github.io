All patients diagnosed with HIV-2 should have a complete medical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation similar to that of a patient infected with HIV-1. The goal of an initial evaluation is to confirm the diagnosis of HIV-2, screen for and identify any opportunistic infections, provide patients with education and support, and discuss the benefits of antiretroviral therapy. Because of the natural history of undiagnosed HIV-2, clinicians should be aware that patients may present at older ages, represent a different demographic, or have non-traditional risk factors upon diagnosis. Thus, a low threshold should be maintained in sending HIV-2 testing, particularly in patients with epidemiologic risk.

Those with HIV-2 often present with similar clinical symptoms as those with HIV-1, including developing an acute retroviral syndrome or opportunistic infection. All opportunistic infections have been seen in patients with HIV-2, including oral candidiasis, Pneumocystis pneumonia, cytomegalovirus, Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, disseminated mycobacterial infection, toxoplasmosis, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, among others.

Evaluation for co-infection and concurrent opportunistic infection should be methodical and follow the guidelines outlined for HIV-1 infection.

In a study of HIV-2 from The Gambia, the most common AIDS-defining feature at presentation was generalized wasting and pulmonary TB, although these findings may not be globally generalizable. Few studies have compared the frequency of OIs in patients with HIV-1 to those with HIV-2, but some evidence suggests that encephalitis may occur more frequently in those with HIV-2. It remains unclear if this may be related to longer survival times or differences in neurotropism between HIV-1 and HIV-2.
