The true incidence of caffeine withdrawal syndrome is unknown. It has been reported that in North America, 80% to 90% of all adults use caffeine regularly. The mean daily intake in the United States (US) is 280 mg, which is equal to about one or two mugs of coffee or three to five soft drinks. The major sources of caffeine in the US are coffee, tea, and soft drinks. So-called energy drinks are also gaining popularity in recent years. A total intake of no more than 400 mg per day is the accepted safe level; this would typically be four cups of coffee, ten cans of cola, or two energy drinks. There is a wide variation in the caffeine content of beverages.
