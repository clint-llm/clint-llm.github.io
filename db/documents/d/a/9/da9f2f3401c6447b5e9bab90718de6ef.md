While air transport of patients is necessary in many cases, such transport is not without risks due to decreased pressure at higher altitudes. In particular, common concerns are barotrauma to the inner ear, pulmonary effects including worsening of pneumothorax, and tracheal necrosis, and further respiratory injury due to effects on ET tube cuffs. Air transport personnel are advised to be aware of flight physiological effects, risk factors, and to manage and monitor patients carefully to avoid adverse medical consequences.
