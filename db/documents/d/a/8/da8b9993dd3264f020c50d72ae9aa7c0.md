The thoracodorsal nerve, a branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (C6 to C8 with C7 predominant), provides innervation to the latissimus dorsi. The nerve will travel in the neurovascular bundleÂ with the thoracodorsal artery and its associated veins. The branching of the artery and nerve are closely related.
