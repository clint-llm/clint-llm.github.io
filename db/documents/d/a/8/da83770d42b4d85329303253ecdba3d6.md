There are no absolute contraindications for cleft palate repair. Relative contraindications include any medical conditions that preclude using general anesthesia (cardiac conditions, severe illness, etc.). Some patients with airway conditions or syndromes may need to be addressed before the palatoplasty, such as patients with retrognathia, Pierre Robin sequence, etc.
