Due to limited clinical experience with remdesivir, robust clinical data evaluating the adverse drug reactions and possible drug-drug interactions is limited. Considering that remdesivir is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450), there is a potential for drug-drug interaction.

RDV is extensively metabolized in the liver by carboxylesterase 1 and primarily eliminated in urine as the nucleoside metabolite GS-441524 based on the results of human mass balance studies.

Published data evaluating the safety of remdesivir in pediatric patients (<12 years of age) and pregnant or breastfeeding womenÂ are limited. Compassionate use of remdesivir was well tolerated and demonstrated the highest rates of recovery and shortest median time to recovery in pregnant and postpartum women with severe COVID-19.

The pharmacokinetics of remdesivir have not undergone assessment in patients >65 years of age. Nevertheless, given the limited data regarding the safety profile of remdesivir, clinicians should closely monitor for any acute changes in the clinical status of drug-drug reactions. Consideration should be made to check laboratory monitoring before and after the initiation of remdesivir in adults and pediatric patients hospitalized with suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection.
