Phyllodes tumors occur predominantly in middle-aged women (average age at presentation, 40 to 50 years) about 15 to 20 years later than fibroadenomas.

Phyllodes tumor occurs mainly in women, although there are reports of some cases in men.

Data analysis from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) data registry from 2000 to 2004 reported that 500 women are diagnosed with malignant phyllodes tumors in the US annually.
