As mentioned earlier, the stomach protects itself from the digestive properties of pepsin by creating an adherent layer of bicarbonate-rich mucus lining. As such, pepsin should always remain in the stomach and should never regurgitate back to the upper tracts. As long as the lower esophageal sphincter functions accurately, pepsin resides withing the stomach and the duodenum, and the esophagus lining remains intact. However, a weak esophageal sphincter allows pepsin to reach not only the esophagus but also the upper airways. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) are two disease processes characterized by weak esophageal sphincters.

The salivary pepsin test is a non-invasive, low-cost test that can detect the presence of pepsin in saliva, as the name implies. It has shown some promise as a usefulÂ diagnostic tool for LPR. However, further research should assess the sensitivity, specificity, and clinical utility of the test. On the contrary, the results are not that encouraging with GERD, and the test is no longer as helpful as previously thought.
