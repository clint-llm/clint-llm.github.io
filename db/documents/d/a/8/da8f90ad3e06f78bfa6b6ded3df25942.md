With the head and eyes facing straight ahead, the eyes are said to be in primary gaze. From this position, an action from an extraocular muscle produces a secondary or tertiary action. Although the globe can be moved about 50 degrees from the primary position, usually during normal eye movement, only 15 degrees of extraocular muscle movement occurs before head movement begins.

The annulus of Zinn, which spans the superior orbital fissure, consists of superior and inferior tendons and is the common site of origin of the rectus muscles. The superior tendon is involved with the entire superior rectus muscle and portions of the medial and lateral rectus muscles. The inferior tendon is involved with the inferior rectus muscle and portions of the medial and lateral rectus muscles.

The primary action of the inferior rectus muscle is to depress the eye, causing the cornea and pupil to move inferiorly. The inferior rectus originates from the annulus of Zinn and courses anteriorly and laterally along the orbital floor, making an angle of 23 degrees with the visual axis. This angle causes the secondary and tertiary actions of the inferior rectus muscle to be adduction and extorsion (excycloduction).

Each extraocular muscle has a functional insertion point, which is at the closest point where the muscle first contacts the globe. This point forms a tangential line from the globe to the muscle origin, known as the arc of contact. The inferior rectus inserts in the vertical meridian, approximately 6.5 mm from the limbus.
