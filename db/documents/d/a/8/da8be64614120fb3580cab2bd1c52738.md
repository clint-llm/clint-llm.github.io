Alternobaric facial paresis, facial baroparesis, baroparesis facialis, or alternobaric facial nerve palsy is a neurapraxia of the seventh cranial nerve due to pressure effects. The pressure in the middle ear can cause compression of the facial (seventh cranial) nerve against the tympanic promontory (cochlear promontory). This activity describes the evaluation and management of patients affected by alternobaric facial paresis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of alternobaric facial paresis.
- Identify the exam findings typically seen in patients with alternobaric facial paresis.
- Summarize the treatment of
alternobaric facial paresis.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by alternobaric facial paresis.
