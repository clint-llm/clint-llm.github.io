The majority of cystic hygromas present in pediatric patients, as adult presentations are considered exceedingly rare. A thorough history from either the patient or a collateral history from the infant’s carer, including a review of systems, is essential to narrowing down the provider’s differential diagnosis.

The patient will commonly present with a large, diffuse, and painless lump. When taking the history, the provider should establish when the lump was first noticed. If the onset was at the time of birth or before the age of 2, this would be in keeping with cystic hygroma. As aforementioned, they can present in adults albeit rare. It is important to enquire about any underlying diseases the individual may have that may predispose the patient to cystic hygromas, such as any underlying chromosomal abnormalities. A thorough review of symptoms should be done to rule out any symptoms of infection, such as fever, rigors, or feeling generally unwell.

Symptoms will depend on the anatomical location of the lump. Depending on their size and site, the patient may present with pain, hoarseness, dysphagia, or shortness of breath. These symptoms can occur following compression of major structures within the neck, such as the larynx, trachea, esophagus, or great vessels.

As mentioned previously, cystic hygromas are most commonly found in the posterior triangle of the neck, although they may occur at any anatomical site. On examination, cystic hygromas are soft, fluctuate, and freely mobile, and they transilluminate well.

They can vary in size, ranging from 1-30cm in diameter.
