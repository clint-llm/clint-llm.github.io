In patients presenting with central ataxia, it is important to rule out more common etiologies, namely, space-occupying lesions and vascular insults affecting the cerebellum. It is also important to differentiate paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration from other neurological disorders than can present in a similar way. These can be classified into:

- Demyelinating disorders, such as multiple sclerosis

- Autoimmune disorders such as glutamic-acid-decarboxylase-associated cerebellar degeneration, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Behcet disease

- Atypical central nervous system infections: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

- Metabolic disorders: vitamin B12 deficiency, alcohol-related Wernicke encephalopathy, celiac disease
