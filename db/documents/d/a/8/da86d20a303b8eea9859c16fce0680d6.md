Reports suggest that adverse reactions occur in up to 10% of patients.

**Most Common Adverse Effects**

- CNS: Drowsiness, insomnia, dizziness, headache (dose dependant)

- Dermatologic: Diaphoresis

- Gastrointestinal (GI): Nausea, vomiting, xerostomia, constipation, diarrhea

- Sexual: Ejaculation disorder (dose dependant)

**Less Common Adverse Effects**

- Cardiovascular: Myocardial infarction, prolonged QT interval, Torsades de pointes

- Hematologic: Hemorrhage, abnormal

- Neurologic: Cerebrovascular accident

- Psychiatric: Suicidal ideation, suicide, induction of mania

- Other: Serotonin syndrome

A rare adverse effect is a hyponatremia resulting from SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion). Citalopram has been shown to induce hyponatremia in case reports involving elderly patients. In addition to advanced age, other factors such as female gender, concurrent diuretic use, low body weight, and recent pneumonia may increase the likelihood of hyponatremia.

There are suggestions that there is a direct correlation between dose and symptom severity for the following adverse effects: impotence, fatigue, somnolence, insomnia, sweating, and yawning.

**Abrupt Discontinuation of antidepressant (Discontinuation Syndrome)**

Discontinuation syndrome is common in patients who suddenly stop antidepressant therapy. The most common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, light-headedness, dizziness, diminished appetite, sweating, chills, tremors, fatigue, somnolence, and sleep disturbances.  Less common symptoms include electric shock-like sensations, cardiac arrhythmias, myalgia, arthralgia, and balance difficulties. Due to these side effects, gradual tapering of the antidepressant over several weeks to several months (based on the treatment duration) is strongly recommended. The half-life of drugs and duration of the therapy should factor in these decisions, as antidepressants with a shorter half-life may need to be tapered more conservatively.

****Black Box Warning****

Citalopram hydrobromide has correlated with suicidality and worsening depression, especially in children, adolescents, and young adults (younger than 24 years old). Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thinking compared to placebo in children, adolescents, and young adults. The advantages and disadvantages of using citalopram hydrobromide or any other antidepressant in these populations depend on the patient's condition and the clinician's judgment.

Patients of any age who start antidepressant therapy should be monitored and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual behavior changes. Citalopram hydrobromide does not have approval for use in pediatric patients.

Increased risk of suicidal ideation and treatment-emergent suicidal ideation (TESI) is a concern in younger patients at the onset of therapy. However, an analysis of 17 controlled clinical trials involving 5000 patients treated with either citalopram, a tricyclic antidepressant, another SSRI, or a placebo indicated that the group receiving citalopram had the lowest incidence of suicide. In addition, family and twin studies provide evidence of a genetic influence on suicidal behavior, and some postulate that genetic influences may play a role in TESI.

**Drug-Drug Interactions**

Citalopram has significant drug interactions and clinicians should monitor patients closely who are on medicines with potential for drug interactions. Limit the dose of citalopram to maximum 20 mg per day if patient is using bupropion, omeprazole, esomeprazole, cimetidine, fexinidazole, fluconazole, voriconazole fluoxetine, and fluvoxamine.
