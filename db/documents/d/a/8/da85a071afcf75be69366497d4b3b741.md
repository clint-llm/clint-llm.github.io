Evaluation of patients with suspected hemineglect syndrome consists of complete neurological examination, lab evaluation, and imaging studies.

Any of the following bedside methods can provide a neurological examination of these patients:

1) Cancellation Test: This is a visual stimulation test in which patients view a piece of paper having scattered lines all over, and they are asked to cross or circle all the lines. In the end, the patient will only cross lines on the non-neglected side, leaving behind the affected side.

2) Line Bisection Test (LBT): A long line is drawn on the paper, and the patient is asked to mark the center of the line. Instead of the center, the patient will direct the line more towards the right side, ignoring the left side of the line. The performance time of the line bisection test has a significant association with hemispatial neglect prognosis.

3) Drawing/Copying Test: Ask the patient either to draw something from his memory or to copy the given task.

4) Multitasking/Double-Simultaneous stimulation: The presence and severity of contralesional neglect and extinction can be overlooked depending on standard single testing procedures such as LBT, copying, etc. because patients can easily compensate for their deficits.

5) Reading Test: A person with spatial neglect will read only the right side, which is the non-neglected side, while ignoring the left side, e.g., ask the patient to read "460225", the patient will read-only "225".

Lab investigations can help to exclude other causes of dementia, depression, and stroke include vitamin-B12 level, homocysteine level, Thyroid function tests (TSH, T3, T4), complete blood counts (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c).

Structural brain abnormalities like acute ischemic stroke, brain tumor, subdural hematoma, must be evaluated with computed tomography (CT) head or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. CT head is readily available and is the first-line test in an emergency. A brain MRI is more sensitive and can provide more details of the etiology and is necessary when available, especially when the CT head is non-diagnostic.

CT angiography or MR angiography is useful when cerebral aneurysms or vascular malformations are suspected. Conventional angiography has a higher sensitivity but is more invasive must be used on a case by case basis.
