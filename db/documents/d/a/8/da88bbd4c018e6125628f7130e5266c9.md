Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions can potentially occur with abacavir. Patients who possess the HLA-B*5701 allele also carry a higher risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir; however, hypersensitivity reactions have occurred in those who do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele. All patients should receive screening for the HLA-B*5701 allele.
