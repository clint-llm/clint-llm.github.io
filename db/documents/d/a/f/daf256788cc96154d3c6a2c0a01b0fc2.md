Medullary sponge kidney has no known cause. Most cases are sporadic. Some cases are thought to run in families, but there is no known specific genetic cause and it is not generally considered inheritable although about five percent of the cases are hereditary and autosomal dominant.

The incidence is similar among racial and ethnic groups.

There is an association between medullary sponge kidney and hemihyperplasia, previously known as hemihypertrophy, which is a disorder where one side of the body grows significantly more than the other side.

Some cases of medullary sponge kidney have mutations in the gene for glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and receptor tyrosine kinase (RET).
