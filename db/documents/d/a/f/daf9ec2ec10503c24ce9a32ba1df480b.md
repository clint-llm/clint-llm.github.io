Arthritis means inflammation of the joint. Symptoms of arthritis include pain, swelling, redness, stiffness, and loss of motion of the involved joint. Wrist arthritis can affect multiple functions of daily life and hence acknowledging its causes, seeking a proper diagnosis, and finding effective long-term treatments are necessary to avoid disability.

Although the wrist is not a weight-bearing joint, it has a significant function in day-to-day activities, which predisposes it to trauma and arthritis. About one in seven people in this country have wrist arthritis (13.6%). Wrist arthritis is sometimes ignored or mishandled. Increasing interprofessional team members' knowledge of this entity will result in better management and improved outcomes for patients affected by this condition.
