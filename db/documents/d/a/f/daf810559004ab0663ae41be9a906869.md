Psoriasis is a common skin disease that affects about 2% of the US population. The most common form is plaque-type. Ixekizumab is FDA-indicated for the adult treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. These adult patients are also candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Safety and effectiveness have been determined in pediatric patients. Psoriasis will be briefly discussed to become familiar with ixekizumab's mechanism of action and its therapeutic use. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients prescribed ixekizumab for psoriasis.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of ixekizumab.
- Review the therapeutic uses of ixekizumab.
- Explain the potential side effects of ixekizumab.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance patient care when dosing and monitoring ixekizumab treatment for psoriasis.
