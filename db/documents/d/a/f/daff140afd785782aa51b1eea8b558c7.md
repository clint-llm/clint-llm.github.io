Common complications associated with surgical fixation include delayed union, nonunion, failure of hardware, and infection. Nonunion is a complication of operative and nonoperative management. Culp et al. advised against the use of closed treatment for periprosthetic distal femur fractures. Twenty (20%) of patients were found to have a nonunion, and twenty-three percent (23%) presented with symptomatic malunion. Merkell's study found that thirty-five (35%) of patients that elected nonoperative management required revision arthroplasty because of nonunion.
