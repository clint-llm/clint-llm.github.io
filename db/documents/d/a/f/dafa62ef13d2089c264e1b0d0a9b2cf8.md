Berry (saccular) aneurysms are the most common type of intracranial aneurysm, representing 90% of cerebral aneurysms. Generally speaking, there is a ballooning arising from a weakened area in the wall of a blood vessel in the brain. Depending on the size of the aneurysm, their symptomatology ranges from asymptomatic to intracerebral hemorrhage (subarachnoid) in the most extreme cases. Berry aneurysm is an older terminology that has mostly been replaced by saccular aneurysm. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and management of berry aneurysms by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of berry aneurysms and the emergencies associated with them.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of berry aneurysms. 
- Review the management options available for berry aneurysms. 
- Describe which advances are being made in various fields to improve the diagnostic accuracy of berry aneurysms in the future.
