Physicians requesting any component for transfusion should always consider platelet a scarce resource and only request it when absolutely necessary. Special request such as irradiation, leukoreduction, or plasma depletion of platelets could be discussed with the transfusion specialist as these modifications of platelet has specific indications and also burdens the transfusion services. Regular audits on blood usage can help improve patient outcomes. Regular continuing medical education for technical and nursing staff on safe transfusion can improve transfusion services and the care a patient receives. Always keep in mind that with every transfusion, there is an additional potential risk to the patient.

A hemovigilance network in every country or region keeps a record of all adverse events and can be used as a source of information for improving guidelines and transfusion policy in a given region. Hence the importance of implementing a strong hemovigilance system that is lacking in many countries or regions.

Guidelines for platelet transfusion have been formulated based on randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis; one such guideline is provided by the British journal of hematology. These guidelines should be implemented in our clinical practice to enhance patient care.
