Disseminated intravascular coagulation can be defined is a widespread hypercoagulable state that can lead to both microvascular and macrovascular clotting and compromised blood flow, ultimately resulting in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Commonly, life-threatening illnesses accompany disseminated intravascular coagulation. Treatment centers on identifying and treating the underlying cause. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation and highlights the importance of an interprofessional approach to caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of disseminated intravascular coagulation. 

- Describe the clinical manifestations of disseminated intravascular coagulation. 
- Explain management considerations for disseminated intravascular coagulation. 
- Explain the importance of utilizing an interprofessional team to manage patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation.
