The management of intracranial subdural empyema is complex. Most cases need emergent management and treatment to avoid complications and unfavorable prognosis. It requires an interprofessional team that includes a neurosurgeon, infectious disease specialist, critical care intensivist, neurologist, and physiatrist. Pharmacists review antibiotic and antiseizure medications to check for interactions and contraindications. Emergency, critical care, and neuroscience nurses provide care and update the interprofessional team on changes in patient status. A good level of suspicion is needed to avoid delaying treatment. Once the patient resolves the infection, many require long-term antiepileptic medications and physical therapy for further recovery. Inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation may be needed for physical, occupational, or speech therapy.
