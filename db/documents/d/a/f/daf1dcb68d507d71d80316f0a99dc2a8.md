While the long thoracic nerve typically arises from the anterior rami of the C5, C6, and C7 roots of the brachial plexus, the nerve also receives supply from C8 in approximately 10% of the population. Documentation exists for an aberrant connection between the long thoracic nerve and dorsal scapular nerve. It has also known thatÂ the long thoracic nerve, which is typically formed by the three ventral rami of C5, C6, and C7 cervical nerves, was comprised mainly by C6 and C7. There are documented instances where the C5 component of the long thoracic nerve was absent, but a communicating branch from C6 was assumed to carry fibers from C5.

Moreover, typically the long thoracic nerve is formed by the joining of C5, C6, and C7 components in the axillary region. However, there has been documentation of the union of these components of the long thoracic nerve occurring above the axillary region posterior to the clavicle. This physiological variant increases susceptibility to nerve injury during clavicular fractures and in the treatment of thoracic outlet syndrome.
