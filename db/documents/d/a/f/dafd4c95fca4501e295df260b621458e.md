Patients, in general, benefit greatly from adequate information provided to them by healthcare workers, especially regarding a condition they may have. As with other medical conditions, information on clubbing should be given to patients, and they should be encouraged to ask questions to prompt further their insight into their situation. When acceptable, patients should receive reassurance especially if the cause of their clubbing is not due to the underlyingÂ pathology.
