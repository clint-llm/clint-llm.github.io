Axial chromatic aberration is an optical phenomenon in which different colors (based on the respective dispersion properties and wavelengths) are focused at different distances due to imperfection of the optical device or refracting surface. The duochrome test thus greatly relies on chromatic aberration and the ability of an individual to perceive the various dispersion properties of light correctly.

Correctly recognizing the individual dispersion properties of light can be hampered in certain conditions, including acquired or congenital dyschromatopsia, rod-cone diseases, brunescent cataracts, and achromatopsia, and patients recovering from corneal transplants.

When testing patients showing better monovision than binocular vision, it is essential to consider Fechner’s Paradox.
