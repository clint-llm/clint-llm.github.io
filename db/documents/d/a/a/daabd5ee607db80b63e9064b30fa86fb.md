Urinary retention is the inability to void urine voluntarily. It is a common problem around the world and can occur acutely or chronically. Acute retention most commonly occurs in men and can be a urologic emergency. Acute urinary retention in men most commonly occurs secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia.
