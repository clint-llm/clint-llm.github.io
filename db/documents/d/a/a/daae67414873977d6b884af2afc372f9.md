Because causes of adenoiditis include various clinical entities, such as recurrent bacterial infections, allergies, andÂ GERD, treatment of adenoiditis and its complications may require the care of multiple clinicians and specialists, including family clinicians, ENT practitioners, pediatricians, and infectious disease specialists. These specialists should collaborate closely with nurses and pharmacists as an interprofessional team to optimize patient outcomes. Identifying and addressing the underlying etiology is essential, or the adenoiditis may never fully resolve and progress to further complications. Healthcare team members should pay close attention to the signs and symptoms of OSA, as this is one of the most serious complications of adenoid disease. [Level 5]
