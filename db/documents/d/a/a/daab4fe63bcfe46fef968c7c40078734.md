Proper knowledge of the posterior vertebral arch and laminae anatomy is imperative to understanding the principles of laminectomy.

The laminae belong to the posterior vertebral arch, extended medially from the base of the spinous process to the junction between the superior and inferior facet joints, acting as a stabilization structure of the spine in association with the facet joint and also as a spinal cord and nerve root protective layer. The laminae's general anatomy consists of a superior and inferior border, an anterior surface in contact with the medullary canal, and a posterior surface that serves as erector spinae muscles attachment. The shape and thickness of the laminae vary according to the anatomical region. Laminar height tends to decrease from C2 to C4 and then increases towards a peak at T8. From T9 to L4 tends to decrease in height and increase in length having at L5 the lowest lumbar height; on the other hand, from cervical to lumbar, laminae width decreases progressively up to the narrowest at T4 in the thoracic region and then increases steadily to reach the widest at L5.

Regarding the thickness, it increases from the cervical to lumbar regions.

A better understanding of the laminae anatomy in different spinal regions may improve surgery success and avoid iatrogenic complications such as nerve root or spinal cord injury.
