Splenic infarcts are a rare cause of abdominal pain. The patients often present to the emergency department physician, primary care provider, nurse practitioner or the internist. The pathology is easily identified with imaging studies but its management requires an interprofessional team.

Treatment of splenic infarct is based primarily on the underlying causative disease state. Splenic infarct in the non-infectious setting may be treated with analgesics, hydration, anti-emetics and other means of supportive care. In the case of traumatic splenic injury, abnormal vasculature or hemodynamic instability, the surgical evaluation may be required.  Dangerous complications of splenic infarct include pseudocyst formation, abscess, hemorrhage, splenic rupture, and aneurysm. In some instances, the infarcted splenic tissue may become infected and lead to abscess formation. Infarcted tissue may also undergo a hemorrhagic transformation. These complications warrant emergent surgical consultation.

In patients undergoing surgery, it is important to ensure that the patient does get vaccinated against encapsulated organisms. For traumatic cases, the outlook is excellent but in patients with sickle cell disease or a chronic hematolgocial disorder, repeated episodes may occur.
