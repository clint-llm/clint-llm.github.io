When a patient complains of a lesion on the outer lid margin, consider cilium incarnatum externumÂ as a possibility by examining the area around the roots of the lashes with the biomicroscope (see illustration).

If a patient presents with superficial keratopathy, conjunctival injection, a foreign body sensation, or conjunctival injection, look at the eyelid margin and the sulcus behind the eyelid margin carefully and with high magnification, looking for the tip of a lash that may be presenting itself and causing the irritation. Sometimes, only a small pigmented spot may be seen. At other times, the lash is obvious as it has grown over time (see illustration).
