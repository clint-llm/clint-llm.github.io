There are several proposed mechanisms for the cause of SLAP tears. In the acute traumatic setting, a fall onto an extended and abducted arm leads to a compressive and superior directed force from the humeral head into the superior labrum.

In various patient populations, internal impingement is also a culprit of SLAP tears. The cocking phase of throwing can place direct posterosuperior impingement on the superior labrum. Repetitive overhead motion may also lead to the attenuation of static stabilizers, resulting in altered biomechanics of the dynamic stabilizers. This can lead to instability and, ultimately, impingement of the superior labrum with degenerative tearing.
