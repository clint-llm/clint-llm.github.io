**Medical History**

- Ophthalmic history of surgery, trauma, recurrent inflammation, acute angle-closure glaucoma, hyperopia, or long-standing cataract.

- Systemic medical history of diabetes mellitus, connective tissue disease leading to uveitis (such as rheumatoid arthritis, spondylitis).

- Use of medications (see above) that may precipitate angle closure in susceptible patients.

- Family history of angle-closure glaucoma.

**Clinical Signs**

- Visual acuity may be normal.

- Elevated intraocular pressure, usually above 21 mmHg.

- Peripheral anterior synechiae of various degrees on gonioscopy.

- Optic nerve head damage.
