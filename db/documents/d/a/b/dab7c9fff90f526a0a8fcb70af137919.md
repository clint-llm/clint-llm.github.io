The personnel required for cystoscopy depends on if it is being performed in the office or the operating room. A simple office cystoscopy requires minimal personnel as there is no anesthesia. It is beneficial to have a nurse as an assistant, especially if doing procedures that can be performed more smoothly with an extra set of hands. For example, if performing a cystoscopy to remove an indwelling ureteral stent, it can be beneficial for the surgeon to operate the cystoscope and have his/her assistant operate the flexible grasper. This is not necessary, however. When performing cystoscopy in the operating room, it is necessary to have anesthesia staff as well as circulating nurses and possibly scrub techs for assistance.
