Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn was first described by Dr. Louis K. Diamond in 1932 when he wrote about erythroblastosis fetalis in the newborn based on peripheral smears.

Rh incompatibility varies by race, ethnicity, and risk factors. The Rh-negative blood type is most predominant in white races (15%) compared to African Americans (5% to 8%) or Asians and Native Americans (1% to 2%). AmongÂ white women, an Rh-negative woman has an 85% chance of mating with an Rh-positive man.

As little as 0.1 mL of fetal blood entering maternal circulation is sufficient to cause alloimmunization.
