The exact pathogenesis of malakoplakia is not well defined. It has been demonstrated that the bactericidal capacity of macrophages is defective in malakoplakia. It is thought to be due to deficiencies in beta-glucuronidase and intracellular cGMP resulting in inadequate microtubular function and phagolysosomal activity, leading to the accumulation of partially digested bacteria in macrophages.
