Aristotle envisioned ethics as a means for the improvement of human life in concert with the practice of medicine. He pointed out that without having a standard for knowing what the right reason is, a person cannot master ethics, just as a student of medicine cannot master medicine if the student can only say that the right treatment to administer is one that someone else told the student to administer but can name no standard other than this.

Medical ethics remains an evolving field. Its application using a system of principles with varying hierarchies is relatively recent. The first code of medical ethics was not written until after the inventions of antiseptic technique and the stethoscope and around the same time as the invention of general anesthetics. In 1980, the AMA reduced its code of ethics from its original four chapters extending for 20 pages to seven minimally elaborated principles. By this time, state legislatures and hospitals had taken over doctors' political agendas that were a significant part of the original concern of the AMA. Not yet had ethicists' reactions to the civil rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s and the medical technology revolution of the last half of the 20th century taken effect at the level of the AMA. In 1998, for the 150th anniversary of the original code, the AMA re-expanded the code to nine chapters over 150 pages. In 2016 the AMA further expanded the code to eleven chapters spanning over 200 pages.

Article IV of the 1980 AMA Code added the language of "patient rights:"

"A physician shall respect the rights of patients, of colleagues, and of other health professionals."

The 2016 code expanded patient rights to a whole page. Patient rights are still not a national uniform doctrine

Medical ethics continues to expand in terms of authorship and scope. By 2017, twelve journals indexed in PubMed that are devoted to medical ethics had reached a citation index factor of at least 1.0, such as The American Journal of Bioethics, BMC Medical Ethics, Journal of Medical Ethics, Bioethics, and The Hastings Center Report.

Primary research and review articles continue to discuss new concepts in the ethics of issues such as:

- Use of medical technology

- Medical treatment of populations

- Human reproduction

- Mental health

- Organ donation

- Surrogate decision making

- Suicide and assisted death

- Limits in the extent of services of critical care medicine.

And as with Henry Beecher's reports in 1966

The field of medical ethics will continue to impact the fields of law (with new medical ethics-based laws passing yearly across the states) and science. In turn, these fields will continue to impact medical ethics. HCPs must not lose sight of changes that have occurred recently and that are yet occurring in order to practice medicine according to modern principles of medical ethics.
