Twin births account for approximately 3 percent of live births in the United States. Barring pregnancies that result from assisted reproductive technology, dizygotic twins are far more common than monozygotic twins and account for 70 percent of all twin gestations. Twin gestation in itself is not an adequate obstetric diagnosis. The definition of placental chronicity is essential, as monochorionic twin gestations have unique associated risks that require surveillance. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of twin births and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients and families.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the incidence of monozygotic versus dizygotic twins in the United States. 
- Describe the contrasting physiology of monozygotic and dizygotic twins. 
- Review the risks associated with monochorionic pregnancies. 
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the management of twin pregnancies.
