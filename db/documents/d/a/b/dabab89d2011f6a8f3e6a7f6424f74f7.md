The pituitary hormones are special chemical messengers that are produced by the pituitary gland, also known as "the master gland of the body." The hormones are peptides or glycoproteins in nature and play a vital role in regulating the functions of other endocrine glands. The anterior pituitary hormones are produced by five different endocrine cell types (somatotropes, gonadotropes, lactotrophs, corticotropes, and thyrotropes) and include growth hormone (GH), prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The release of these hormones is under the regulation of inhibitory or stimulatory signals from the hypothalamus. The posterior pituitary hormones are the nano peptide and oligo-peptide vasopressin and oxytocin, respectively, which regulate water retention and uterine contraction.
