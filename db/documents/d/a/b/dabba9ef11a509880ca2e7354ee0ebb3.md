As required by the America Art Therapy Association (AATA), art therapists must obtain the minimum of a master's degree toÂ satisfy entry-level qualifications. Advanced graduate studies include establishing foundations in psychology and creative arts. Certified personnel must also complete a rigorous hourly requirement of supervised practicum and clinical internship. After having met the educational requirements, board certification and licensing (depending on the state of practice) can be obtained through the Art Therapy Credentials Board.
