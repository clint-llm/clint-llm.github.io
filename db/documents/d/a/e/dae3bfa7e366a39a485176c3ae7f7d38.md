Hydrocodone is a full opioid agonist that interacts with the mu-receptors and, to a lesser extent, with delta receptors in the body.

Acetaminophen's mechanism of action of analgesia is not fully understood. The hypothesis has been that it results from COX inhibition and activation of descending serotonergic inhibitory pathways in the CNS. Antipyretic effects occur via inhibition of the hypothalamic heat-regulating center. Acetaminophen is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Plasma protein binding of acetaminophen is about 10 to 25%. The plasma half-life ranges from 1 to 3 hours; however, it may increase due to liver damage following overdose. Approximately 85% of the drug is eliminated in the urine within 24 hours of administration.
