The pathogenesis of typhoid fever depends upon a number of factors, including infectious species, virulence, host's immunity, and infectious dose. The larger the infectious dose, the shorter the incubation period, and the higher the attack rate. Typhoid fever is more severe in debilitated and immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV (mainly paratyphi), those on glucocorticoid therapy, and those with altered phagocyte function (i.e., patients with malaria and sickle cell anemia). Salmonella is an acid-sensitive bacteria except for a few resistant strains, so typically it is destroyed in the stomach by gastric acid unless a large dose is ingested.Salmonella occurs even with smaller doses. Food and beverages also act as buffers against gastric acid that facilitates bacteria reaching the small gut.

The virulence of Salmonella is determined by typhoid toxin, Vi antigen (polysaccharide capsule), liposaccharide O antigen, and flagellar H antigen. Strains positive for Vi antigen have an attack rate twice that of Vi negative strains, even for the same dose of micro-organisms. One of the main differences between Salmonella typhi and non-typhoidal salmonella (NTS) is the presence of Vi antigen in Salmonella typhi but absent in NTS. The main role of the Vi antigen is to act as an antiphagocytic agent preventing the action of macrophages, thus shielding the O antigen from antibodies that confer the serum resistance. The flagellar H antigen provides bacterial mobility and adherence upon the gut wall mucosa. Invasion of the gut wall is assisted by flagella, and the type III secretion system is capable of transferring bacterial protein into enterocytes and M cells (specialized epithelial cells that serve as antigen-presenting cells in gut mucosa or lymphoid tissue) or by direct penetration of mucosa. Bacteria attached to M cells are absorbed by pinched off cytoplasm containing bacteria and extruded into the luminal space. In this process, M cells are damaged, and the basal lamina is exposed. It provides easy access to pathogens for the invasion, which worsens the condition.Salmonella; so, patients with abnormal CFTR protein are resistant to typhoid.Salmonella also produces a molecule that stimulates the epithelial release of chemoattractant eicosanoid, which sequesters neutrophils into the lumen and potentiates mucosal damage.

Bacteria induce proliferation of Payer patches via recruitment of lymphocytes and mononuclear cells and induce necrosis and eventually, ulceration that complicates the symptoms. Pathogens reach the reticuloendothelial system via both lymphatic system and bloodstream, including other multiple organs, most commonly gallbladder in almost all cases. The early bacteremic phase (24 hours to 72 hours) is asymptomatic and transient as these bacteria are phagocytosed by macrophages and monocytes in the reticuloendothelial system called primary bacteremia. The capacity of pathogens to grow in these immune cells makes them characteristic, and intracellular multiplication of bacteria in the reticuloendothelial system enforces them to re-enter the bloodstream causing continuous bacteremia for several days and weeks known as secondary bacteremia. Secondary bacteremia is the phase in which disease symptoms manifest.
