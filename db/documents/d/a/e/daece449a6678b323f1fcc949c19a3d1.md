Hypertelorism is thought to be caused by an alteration in embryological facial development during weeks 4-8 of development. The frontonasal prominence is the embryological precursor of the forehead and nose, and during normal development of the frontonasal prominence, there is lateral movement of the orbits followed by medial migration. If there is an arrest in the normal development of the frontonasal prominence, the primitive brain fills the space preventing the normal medial migration of the orbits and arresting them in a lateral position.

Frank encephalocele and other masses in the frontonasal prominence can produce an obvious and extreme form of hypertelorism. Additional proposed mechanisms of hypertelorism include early ossification of the lesser wings of the sphenoid bone, preventing medial movement of the orbits and fixing them in the fetal position, and craniosynostosis syndromes where there is premature closure of cranial sutures preventing normal orbital migration and development.
