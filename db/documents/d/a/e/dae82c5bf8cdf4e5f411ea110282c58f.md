Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are abnormal connections between an artery and a vein.

The anatomy of the fistula depends on the location in the body. AVFs for hemodialysis are typically created in the extremities and the upper extremity is generally preferred over the lower extremity by vascular surgeons. The cephalic and basilic veins are often used for the surgical creation of an AVF. The radial artery at the volar wrist and the brachial artery at the antecubital fossa and medial upper arm are typical anatomical locations for fistula creation, although the radio-cephalic AVF is the preferred initial access for hemodialysis.

Two types of lower extremity surgical AVFs for hemodialysis have been described in the literature. The superficial femoral vein or popliteal vein can be mobilized from the knee to anastomose with the superficial femoral artery; this is called an SFV transposition. The saphenous vein can be used to create a loop AVF on the anterior thigh, anastomosed with the common femoral artery.

Although no type of congenital AV fistula is common, reported locations for congenital AVFs include pulmonary, aortocaval, dural, carotid-cavernous, coronary, and hepatic.

AVFs as a result of iatrogenic injury are typically a result of surgical procedures, invasive line placement, or needle biopsy. The literature demonstrates multiple reports of iatrogenic injury resulting years after surgical procedures.
