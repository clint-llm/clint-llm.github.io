Treatment involves discontinuing the offending agent and providing supportive care such as topical ceramides and prevention of secondary infection with proper skin hygiene. Additional supportive treatments include topical corticosteroids, antipyretics, and antihistamines.

Treatments reported for some inpatient cases include systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine, acitretin, dapsone, infliximab, and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG).

For patients with a history of AGEP, empiric avoidance of the suspected trigger and appropriate documentation of an adverse drug reaction history in the patientâ€™s medical record is appropriate.
