There are no absolute contraindications to the procedure of IVF. However, it should not be performed in women who have a significant risk of morbidity and mortality of pregnancy if IVF were successful. Some examples of these high-risk conditions include but are not limited to Marfan syndrome, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3 or 4 heart failure, Eisenmenger syndrome, severe valvular stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, or coarctation of the aorta. For women with these significant medical issues who desire a biological child, they can undergo IVF with oocyte aspiration, fertilization with their partnerâ€™s sperm, but the embryos will be transferred to a gestational carrier.
