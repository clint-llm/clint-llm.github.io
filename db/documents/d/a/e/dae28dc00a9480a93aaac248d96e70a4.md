BS is a non-sight-threatening disease, and its complications affect mainly the periocular anatomy. The recurrent episodes of eyelid swelling can lead to:

- Dermatochalasis with periocular fat atrophy in some cases, and fat prolapse in others

- Thin, wrinkled, atrophic, and discolored skin

- Upper lid ptosis, with normal levator function (suggesting ptosis secondary to aponeurotic dehiscence)

- Lateral (and occasionally medial) canthal disinsertion, with rounded deformity of the canthal angle and shortening of the horizontal palpebral fissure (acquired blepharophimosis)

- Pseudoepicanthal fold

- Lacrimal gland prolapse

- Lower lid laxity and malposition

- Secondary ocular surface irritation
