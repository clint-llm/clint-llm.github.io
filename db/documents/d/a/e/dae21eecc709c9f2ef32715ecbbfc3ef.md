Treatment of chest wall tumors can be a clinical and surgical challenge. Surgical resection is the standard of care for benign tumors. The management of malignant tumors involves more of an interprofessional approach for optimizing functional outcomes. Wide tumor excision with negative margins is a critical predictor of local recurrence rates. It is also imperative that following resection, there is chest wall stabilization to avoid a negative impact on respiratory function.
