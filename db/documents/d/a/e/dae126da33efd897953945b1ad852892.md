**Abducens Nerve**

In the developing pons, the nucleus of CN VI is identifiable as a group of cells in approximately 20 weeks of gestation. The growth of the nucleus comprising motor neurons and interneurons increases exponentially between 20 and 43 weeks of gestation.

**Facial Nerve**

During the fourth week of gestation, the chorda tympani nerve arises rostrally from the facial nerve and travels ventrally to the first pharyngeal pouch. By the end of week 5, the motor nucleus of CN VII, developing from the second pharyngeal arch, can be identified in the area of the metencephalon, which will later develop into the pons. Between 5 and 6 weeks, the geniculate ganglion and the intermediate nerve begin to develop. The intermediate nerve can be identified as a separate nerve approximately in 7 weeks of gestation. After projecting dorsomedially towards the abducens nucleus, the facial nerve fibers ascend approximately two millimeters to loop over the abducens nucleus. The facial nerve fibers subsequently travel between the facial nucleus and the spinal trigeminal nucleus of cranial nerve 5.

The onset of myelination of the motor roots of CN VI and VII are observable as early as 17 weeks of gestation.
