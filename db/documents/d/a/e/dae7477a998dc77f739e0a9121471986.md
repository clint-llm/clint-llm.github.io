The primary method of avoiding or mitigating frontal sinus fractures is consistent wear of helmets during sporting activities involving rapid movement (cycling, driving, skiing, skateboarding, etc.), rapid projectile travel (baseball, cricket, softball, etc.), and full body contact (American football, ice hockey, lacrosse). Helmets should also be worn during activities involving heavy machinery or working in dangerous environments (construction workers, industrial factory workers, soldiers, etc.). Additionally, avoidance of environments and/or activities with the potential to produce head injuries if a helmet is unavailable is critical.
