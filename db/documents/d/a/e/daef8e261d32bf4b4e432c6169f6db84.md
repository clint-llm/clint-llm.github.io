Mastectomy may be performed using sharp dissection with a scalpel or scissor technique. Another alternative is to use an energy device such as electrocautery or one of the various ultrasonic devices for the dissection of the breast from the superficial tissues and to release the posterior attachments from the chest wall. Standard general surgery equipment, including retractors and suction, is often utilized. At the discretion of the surgeon, a temporary, closed suction drain (i.e., Jackson Pratt drain) may be placed in the wound bed to decrease the rate of seroma formation. Absorbable suture is the most common choice for closure of the mastectomy defect and incision.

Axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy is commonly an option for staging purposes at the time of definitive breast surgery. Most surgeons employ a dual tracer technique, which typically involves the use of technetium sulfur colloid, which is injected into the breast preoperatively by the nuclear medicine department of radiology. Intraoperatively many surgeons will inject a vital blue dye, such as methylene blue or isosulfan blue, into the breast to aid in the identification of axillary sentinel lymph nodes. A gamma probe is required to detect any nuclear tracer uptake in the axilla and to guide dissection and exploration in this region for biopsy.
