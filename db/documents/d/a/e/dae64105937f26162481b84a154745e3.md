If the clinician suspects protein-losing enteropathy in any patient consultation with a gastroenterologist should be done as the first step to start the work up.

If a heart condition is the primary cause of PLE, then the patient should be referred to a cardiologist for optimization of heart failure and other cardiac causes. If the workup reveals malignancy, then referral to oncologist should be made.
