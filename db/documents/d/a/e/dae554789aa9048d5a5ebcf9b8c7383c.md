For type A and B Niemann-Pick disease (NPD), there is no cure. Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment. Physicians try to keep low blood lipids levels with statins, and liver functions are monitored. If thrombocytopenia leads to bleeding episodes, transfusion of blood products may be required. For patients with ILD, oxygen is provided. Organ transplant has also been tried but with limited success. Enzyme replacement therapies and gene therapies are undergoing trials and may become the mainstay of treatment in the future.

For type C disease, supportive care is also the mainstay of treatment. Physical therapy is provided for neurological symptoms. Pain is managed with analgesics. Miglustat is a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor and helps in Niemann-Pick disease and Gaucher disease by decreasing glucocerebroside production. It is approved in Europe, Canada, and Japan but is not yet approved in the United States.
