RNAP is a highly abundant enzyme which catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds linking nucleotides together, subsequently producing linear chain. The growing RNA chain is extended by one nucleotide at a time in the 5’ to 3’ direction using nucleoside triphosphates (ATP, CTP, UTP, and GTP) as substrates. Estimates are that about 20 nucleotides undergo synthesis for each gene with over a thousand transcripts formed in an hour from one gene. Unlike DNA polymerase, RNAP has increased infidelity. One mistake is made every 10,000 nucleotides while DNA polymerase makes one mistake every 10,000,000 nucleotides. Despite lower accuracy, RNAP does have a proofreading mechanism. RNAP can back up, excise the misincorporated ribonucleotide, and insert the proper ribonucleotide.
