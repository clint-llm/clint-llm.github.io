The temporoparietal fascia is a very reliable flap with a good blood supply. However, any injury to the blood supply can easily lead to flap necrosis. In patients with burns, head trauma, or prior surgery to the scalp or skull, the blood supply may suffer compromise - hence its use as a flap is not recommended. One of the ways to assess the blood supply is with the use of Doppler.
