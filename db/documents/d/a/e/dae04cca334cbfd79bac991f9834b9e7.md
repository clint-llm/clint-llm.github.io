There are multiple forms of debriefing when it comes to content.  Promoting Excellence and Reflective Learning in Simulation (PEARLS); Team-Guided team self-correction, Advocacy-Inquiry, and Systemic-constructivist (TeamGAINS); Defusing, discovering, and deepening (3D); Gather, Analyze, and Summarize (GAS) are just some of the forms that debriefing can take and are described elsewhere.

Regardless of the content, debriefing is rooted in providing learners with a psychologically safe environment.  Learners and faculty should have a shared mental model with and an underlying assumption that everyone wants to learn and improve upon their current foundation of knowledge.
