Imaging studies:

CT scan with contrast of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is currently the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of pseudomyxoma peritonei. Typical CT appearance is ‘scalloping’ of the surface of the liver and spleen caused by loculated accumulations of mucin, which distinguishes mucin from fluid ascites. The mucinous material is similar in density to water. There are also islands of higher attenuation due to scattered solid elements and calcification within mucinous material. However, the primary appendiceal lesion might be absent or hard to identify on imaging. Compared to CT, gadolinium-enhanced MRI is more sensitive in localizing the tumor, and in assessing the small bowel as well as the hepatoduodenal ligament. PET/CT scan might be helpful in more aggressive variants by detecting extra-abdominal disease.

Circulating tumor markers:

Tumor markers are found to have prognostic value and are useful for follow up of patients after treatment. CEA and CA 19.9 are found to have a high level in PMP with an appendiceal origin. CA 125 is also found to be high but with ovarian involvement.

Histopathology:

The final diagnosis relies on histopathological examination of the biopsy and surgical specimen through laparoscopy or laparotomy, especially when the clinical and radiological manifestations are not specific. Percutaneous image-guided biopsies are of limited value since the resultant material may be acellular mucin.
