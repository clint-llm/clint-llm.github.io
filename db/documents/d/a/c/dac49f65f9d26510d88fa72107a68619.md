Children with infantile spasms experience brief jerking spells of flexion, extension, or combination of flexion-extension of the head, neck, arms, legs, and trunk that usually last a few seconds or less. These spasms often occur in clusters and clusters often occur during sleep-wake transitions. Spasms also are seen more frequently during waking hours than during sleep. Patients return to a baseline mental state within seconds after the spasm. Some children may appear scared or upset by the clusters of spasm activity. Evidence of developmental delay or regression may be apparent on history and physical exam, although patients who come to medical attention shortly after the onset of spasms may still be developmentally normal. Otherwise, a physical exam is often unremarkable, although a careful skin exam is necessary to screen for possible underlying genetic disorders such as neurocutaneous disorders known to cause infantile spasms. Tuberous sclerosis is one such neurocutaneous disorder that is often associated with infantile spasms.
