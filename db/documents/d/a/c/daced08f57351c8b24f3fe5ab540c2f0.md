Membranous nephropathy (MN) has to be differentiated from other nephrotic syndromes, which may also present with massive proteinuria. Some nephritic syndromes can have similar etiology and immune complex components like MN. The following glomerular diseases are the main differentials for MN:

- Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis

- Minimal change disease

- Diabetic nephropathy

- IgA nephropathy

- Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
