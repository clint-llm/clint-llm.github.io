The quadratus lumborum (QL) muscle resides in the deep and posterior, lateral, and inferior areas of the spine, involving the iliac crest, the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, and the 12th rib. The muscular organization is complex, and it is difficult to identify precisely the actions that occur through the contraction of fibers. It is an integral part of the thoracolumbar fascia. There is still no certainty that an abnormality of QL is the primary source of back pain. The QL could potentially act as a crossroad of the forces exerted by the neighboring muscles, influencing the vectors of the different tensions produced. Thanks to its strategic position and the entropic scheme of its fibers, QL is a significant means of access for anesthesia during surgery on the back, lower limbs, or abdominal area. The article reviews the latest anatomical and clinical information on the quadratus lumborum.
