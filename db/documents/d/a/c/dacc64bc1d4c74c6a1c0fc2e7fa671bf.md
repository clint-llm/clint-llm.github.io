**Plain radiography:**

Plain radiography is used for initial evaluation. Plain x-rays allow the identification of the cartilaginous nature and the aggressiveness of the lesion

- Lytic lesions in 50% of the cases

- Intralesional calcifications: in about 70% of the cases (popcorn calcification or rings and arcs calcification)

- Endosteal scalloping

- Permeative appearance or moth-eaten appearance in high-grade chondrosarcomas

- Cortical remodeling, thickening, and periosteal reaction

**Computed tomography scan:**

Computed tomography scan can reveal the following findings

- Matrix calcification in 94% of the cases

- Endosteal scalloping

- A cortical breach in about 90% of long bone chondrosarcoma

- Heterogenous contrast enhancement

**Magnetic resonance imaging:**

In typical forms, MRI demonstrates a lobulated lesion with a high-signal intensity on T2 and a low or intermediate signal on T1-weighted images

**Tissue biopsy:**

Tissue biopsy is essential to diagnose chondrosarcoma and differentiate it from other malignant or benign bone tumors. Biopsy should be taken from the most aggressive portion of cancer as determined by imaging.
