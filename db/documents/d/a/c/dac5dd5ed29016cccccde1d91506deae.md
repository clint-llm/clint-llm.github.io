Enhanced and abnormal automaticity has been described as the primary pathophysiologic mechanism underlying congenital junctional ectopic tachycardia. This is why this arrhythmia is refractory to intravenous adenosine and direct current cardioversion. It does not involve AV nodal reentry, which differentiates it from AV nodal reentry supraventricular tachycardias. Multiple gene deletions have been proposed as the underlying genetic abnormality, which includes angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion and troponin-I interacting kinase.
