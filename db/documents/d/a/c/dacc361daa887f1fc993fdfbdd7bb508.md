Treatment strategies for HCM are based upon observational data and clinical experience since no large randomized trials have been performed. Pharmacological therapy is the first-line approach to symptomatic HCH. The best initial medications include negative inotropic agents, including beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil), and disopyramide.

- Diuretics can be given in patients without LVOT obstruction and refractory heart failure symptoms presenting with volume overload. Volume depletion decreases stroke volume and worsens the LVOT gradient. This can lead to hypotension, lightheadedness, and syncope.

- Nonpharmacologic therapies include surgical myomectomy and alcohol septal ablation (if NYHA III/IV class persist despite optimal medical therapy or syncope related to hemodynamic compromise from LVOT obstruction, an LVOT gradient >50mmHg).

- Alcohol septal ablation reduces LVOT obstruction, improves symptoms, increases exercise capacity, and may improve long-term survival.

Surgical therapeutic options include the following:

- A heart transplant is not the first treatment option and usually recommended only in patients who have failed all medical and surgical treatments.

- Left ventricular myomectomy

- Mitral valve replacement

- Permanent pacemaker implantation

- Placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator is an option in patients with ventricular fibrillation who do not want lifelong medical therapy.
