Naso-orbito-ethmoid complex fractures seldom occur in isolation, without injury to other parts of the face or body. Other groups of facial fractures that can occur in isolation or alongside NOE complex fractures include:

- Zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures may occur with NOE fractures or independently. They are associated with a forceful lateral blow to the mid-lower face.

- LeFort fractures are defined as the separation of the midface from the skull base and graded on a scale of 1 to 3, with one being the least severe and most common and 3 representing the bony separation of the face from the rest of the skull. LeFort fractures, by definition, must involve the pterygoid plates of the sphenoid bone, as these connect the skull base to the midface. Type 3 LeFort fractures also must include an NOE complex fracture, without which the facial skeleton could not be separated from the cranial vault.

- Orbital floor fractures, also known as blowout fractures, in which a blow to the eye causes a fracture to propagate through the thin bone separating the maxillary sinus from the orbit, and occasionally the lamina papyracea of the medial wall of the orbit as well. In some cases, extraocular muscle or orbital fat herniates through the defect, causing diplopia and ophthalmoplegia.

- Pan-facial fractures - these are fractures involving the upper, middle, and lower regions of the face.
