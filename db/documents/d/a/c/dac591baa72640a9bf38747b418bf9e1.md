Common additional characteristics in patients with extrinsic restriction will include an increased BMI, spine deviation, or have a history of neuromuscular disease.

Clinical features and prognosis vary among the diseases. For instance, IPF involves a progressive decline in lung function that leads to eventual respiratory failure. As a consequence, the condition has a poor prognosis with a median survival of 3 to 5 years after diagnosis.
