Androgen insensitivity syndrome arises from loss-of-function mutations in the coding sequence of the androgen receptors (AR). This X-linked genetic mutation of the androgen receptor gene results in the dysfunction of androgen receptors and hormone resistance. These mutations lead to a loss in virilization or infertility in 46XY males in individuals with functional testes and adequate testosterone production. CAIS and PAIS encompass variability in phenotypic expression; however, both these conditions have similar genetic, endocrine, and pathophysiologic mechanisms.
