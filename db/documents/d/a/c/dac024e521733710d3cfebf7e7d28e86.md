Deleterious germline mutations in IL36RN have been reported in familial and sporadic generalized pustular psoriasis in populations from the UK, Germany, Tunisia, Malaysia, China, and Japan. Mutations differ between populations, with evidence of a founder effect; in Europeans the most common mutation in IL36RN results in the substitution p.Ser113Leu, and is present in 0.03% of the healthy European population. Generalized pustular psoriasis patients with IL36RN mutations also are more likely to have the early-onset disease and a systemic inflammatory response.

IL36RN encodes the IL-36 receptor antagonist (IL36-Ra), which is expressed primarily in the skin and is the antagonist of three pro-inflammatory cytokines of the IL-1 family (IL-36 alpha, beta, and gamma). These cytokines activate signaling pathways, such as NF-kB and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and are interrelated by Th17 cytokines and TNF-alpha. IL-36 cytokines also are overexpressed in the skin of plaque psoriasis, consistent with the concept that abnormal IL-36 signaling has a significant role in establishing cutaneous inflammation but presumably by a different mechanism than in generalized pustular psoriasis. There are occasional reports of mutations in CARD14, particularly in those with coexistent plaque psoriasis.
