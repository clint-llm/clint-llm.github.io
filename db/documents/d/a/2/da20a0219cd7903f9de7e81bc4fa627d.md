Naproxen is readily available OTC and widely used for pain relief for many different types of patients. Some of these patients take medications or have medical comorbidities that place them at a significantly higher risk of serious adverse events. Yet, they are unaware of the risk and may think that naproxen's availability OTC means its use is safe for everyone. It is essential for all interprofessional healthcare team members who work in a primary care setting to routinely ask their patients whether they are taking OTC medications and educate them about the potential risks and benefits of NSAIDs, particularly related to their specific medical histories and conditions. It is also crucial for specialist healthcare providers to communicate with primary care providers, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists when starting medication or to treat a patient for a condition in which NSAID therapy is not advised or contraindicated. Providers should also educate their patients about their medical condition and how it affects their ability to take a widely available OTC medication. These interprofessional team activities will increase therapeutic effectiveness and help prevent unwanted adverse effects. [Level 5]
