Post-Lyme disease syndrome and chronic Lyme disease are areas of uncertainty due to fluctuating definitions and lack of research on incidence, prevalence, and pathogenesis. Post-Lyme disease syndrome is tentatively defined by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) as “a term to describe patients who have had well-documented Lyme disease and who remain symptomatic for many months to years after completion of appropriate antibiotic therapy.” IDSA’s recommendations have inclusion criteria to elucidate this syndrome further. These criteria include the onset of any of the following symptoms within 6 months of definitively diagnosed Lyme disease and persistence of symptoms for 6 months after completion of appropriate antibiotic therapy:

- Fatigue

- Widespread musculoskeletal pain

- Complaints of cognitive difficulties

Chronic Lyme disease is a term inclusive of post-Lyme disease syndrome and other clinical symptoms for which there is no convincing biologic evidence in relationship to B. burgdorferi infection. These patients may have persistent pain, neurocognitive symptoms, and/or fatigue with or without evidence (clinical or serologic) of previous Lyme disease. Experts do not recommend any prolonged or repeated antibiotic courses for chronic Lyme disease or post-Lyme disease syndrome as evidence is lacking that doing so has any therapeutic advantages.
