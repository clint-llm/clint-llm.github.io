The lordotic curvature of the lumbar spine causes an outward bowing of the vertebral column in the lower (L4 - L5) spinal area towards the abdominal-pelvic cavity. The uterus is located intra-abdominally at the same L4 – L5 vertebral level.  Juxtaposed between the lumbar spine and the uterus is the inferior vena cava. While gravity works to keep the uterus and enclosed fetus outward and off of the inferior vena cava and lumbar spine when the mother is upright or sitting, that is not the case when in the supine position. Once in the supine position, gravity allows the uterus to rest posteriorly onto the lordotic spine, potentially compressing the inferior vena cava under its weight. As a result of this compression, the blood flow returning from the extremities may be impeded drastically, resulting in maternal hypotension.

The description of the supine hypotensive syndrome was originated in 1953 by Howard et al
