Although stabilization can be performed at most facilities, definitive treatment or long-term care is usually restricted to larger, or child-specific, centers. Beginning preparations by contacting the necessary physicians should be completed early in resuscitation. Depending on availability, ECMO/ECPR should be considered early during the code for in-hospital arrests. This has not been verified in out-of-hospital arrests, however, if clinical judgment or discussion with a specialist suggests a possible benefit, and procedural criteria are met, this option cannot be excluded from your algorithm.

While age is usually correlated with improved outcomes post-resuscitation, post-arrest brain injury remains a cause for significant morbidity and mortality even in young populations. Therefore, EEGs and seizure prophylaxis are recommended for patients at risk after ROSC. Patients that have unknown causes of death should undergo an autopsy with a possible subsequent genetic analysis.Â Although not required, this should be emphasized to the family as being important in order to be proactive in preventing further family deaths if the cause is determined to be genetic.
