Fractures of the tarsal navicular bone are most commonly the result of either traumatic injury or undue stress, with the latter having a higher incidence in younger individuals and athletes. Even though midfoot fractures are relatively uncommon injuries, tarsal navicular stress fractures represent up to one-third of all stress fractures.

The navicular is a wedge-shaped bone articulating with the talus, calcaneus, the three cuneiform bones, and the cuboid.

Posteriorly, the navicular has a biconcave surface which articulates with the head of the talus.

The dorsal aspect of the navicular receives vascular supply by the medial tarsal branches of the dorsalis pedis artery, along with branches of the lateral tarsal artery

The tarsal navicular is an essential component of the Chopart joint, which itself consists of the talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints.
