Chlamydia psittaci is an obligate intracellular bacterium. Besides poultry (turkeys and ducks), pet birds including parrots, cockatiels, macaws, and parakeets are the main culprits. C. psittaci can also be found in non-avian domestic animals, such as cattle, sheep, swine, horses, goats, cats, and wildlife, but cases of clinical disease and transmission to humans have not been proven.
