Most of the cavernous sinus is formed before birth. It first emerges as a collection of small venous canals consisting of only an endothelial layer. Throughout gestation, these canals gradually expand to form larger structures. In fact, after 13 weeks of gestation, the cavernous sinus appears as a faint cluster of small vessels, whereas after 27 weeks of gestation, the inferior venous pathways suddenly increase in size.
