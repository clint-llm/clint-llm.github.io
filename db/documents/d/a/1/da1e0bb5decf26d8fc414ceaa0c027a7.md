If a Bezold's abscess is present or suspected, practitioners should use intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics. Once antibiotic therapy is initiated, a contrast-enhanced CT scan should be obtained. Naturally, cultures are important, particularly with a diabetic or immunocompromised patient since the bacteriology in these cases may be different. If a fluid collection is identified on CT, surgical drainage is indicated via a trans-cervical approach. If this fluid collection exists concurrently with a coalescent mastoiditis, a post-auricular incision is made, and a simple, complete mastoidectomy should be performed in addition to the drainage of the deep neck portion of the abscess. This may require separate incisions to avoid damage to the greater auricular nerve, the facial nerve, and the accessory nerve, though a single incision can also be used if meticulous technique is employed in the dissection. The objective is to remove as much osteitic bone and granulation tissue present in the mastoid bone as possible. If there is concurrent suppurative OM, a tympanostomy tube (grommet) should be placed concurrently. In rare cases, a Bezold's abscess may appear in children before there is a complete development of the mastoid air cell system. In these patients, the practitioner must pay particular attention to the position of the facial nerve. Therefore, they should not make a standard post-auricular incision since the facial nerve may be more superficial than anticipated. In this case, a post-auricular superior linear incision is made to drain the purulent material and carefully debride as much granulation tissue as possible and a tympanostomy tube placed. At the same time, the neck abscess should be thoroughly drained. Broad-spectrum antibiotics with good cerebrospinal fluid penetration should be continued until culture results are obtainedÂ to prevent further extension of the inflammatory process to adjacent vascular structures.
