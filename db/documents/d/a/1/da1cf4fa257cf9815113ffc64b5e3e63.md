In most cases, a clinical diagnosis can be made based on the history and examination findings. As needed, dermoscopy and biopsy can be used to confirm the diagnosis and imaging may be warranted to assess the depth and extent of a lesion.

The dermoscopic examination can be helpful in distinguishing superficial lymphangioma from other cutaneous lesions. Two distinct dermoscopic patterns have been described: yellow lacunae surrounded by pale septa without the inclusion of blood and yellow to pink lacunae alternating with dark-red or bluish lacunae, representing the inclusion of blood. A more recently described dermoscopic finding is a “hypopyon-like” feature which consists of a color transition from dark to light in some lacunae. This occurs due to sedimentation of blood that separates cellular components to the bottom and serum to the upper part of the lacunae.
