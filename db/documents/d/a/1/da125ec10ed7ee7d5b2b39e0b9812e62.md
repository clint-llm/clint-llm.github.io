The stomach depends largely on the RGEA and right gastric arteries for its blood supply; therefore, surgeons need to minimize iatrogenic damage that could compromise these vessels during surgery. However, it merits noting that there is plentiful collateral blood supply to the stomach. Thus damage to gastric vasculature creates more of a risk of bleeding than ischemia. Gastrointestinal ischemia stemming from a compromised GEA mainly occurs at gastric walls near the anastomoses between the RGEA and LGEA on the anterior and posterior greater curvature of the stomach. The LGEA is sometimes vulnerable during surgical mobilization of the colonic splenic flexure. The early RGEA is not easily accessible surgically because of its location posterior to the duodenum and is not as vulnerable in most surgeries.
