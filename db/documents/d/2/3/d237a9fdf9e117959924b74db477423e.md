With premature infants that are high risk for pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE), they must be monitored closely in NICU. These infants need a strong interprofessional team to coordinate the care among pediatricians, pulmonologists, intensivists, and surgeons. CPAP and synthetic surfactants are currently the latest management for the prevention of PIE in patients with respiratory distress syndrome. Patients must be monitored closely by pediatricians and pulmonologist after recovery for any long-term effects. With appropriate communication, the management of these critical patients can be done on time.
