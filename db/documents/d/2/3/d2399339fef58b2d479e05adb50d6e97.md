Mycobacterium Kansasii is a slow-growing acid-fast bacillus. It grows best at 32 degrees Celcius, but can be cultured at 37 degrees. Its in-vitro and chemical characteristics are similar to those of M. marinum and M. szulgai . It produces mature colonies in greater then 7 days. Like other mycobacteria in the family, M. kansasii is strictly a gram-positive, non-motile and non-spore-forming organism. Colony morphology ranges from flat to raised and smooth to rough. When grown in the dark M. kansasii colonies are at first non-pigmented but turn yellow after exposure to light due to deposition of beta-carotene crystals.M. tuberculosis, M. kansasii appears longer and broader and are often beaded or cross-barred in appearance when stained with Ziehl Neelsen or Kinyoun stain.M. kansasii belongs to the group photochromogens. Biochemical characteristics include Catalase positive, nitrate reduction, tween hydrolysis, and urea hydrolysis. Identification using traditional methods could take as long as two months.

Although M. Kansasii was long thought to be homogenous species, genetic studies have shown that there are at least seven subtypes, with subtype one being most frequently isolated in human infections.

M. kansasii is widely prevalent in the environment but has seldom been isolated from soil. Some documented sources include city tap water, swimming pools, fish tanks, fish bites, brackish water, and seawater.
