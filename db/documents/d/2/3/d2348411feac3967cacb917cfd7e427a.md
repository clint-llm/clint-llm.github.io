**Healthcare Team**

Uterine artery embolization is usually performed by an interventional radiologist, but the gynecologist and obstetrician should also be able to help educate the patient about pros and cons of this technique compared to surgical and/or medical treatments that the gynecologist or other primary care physician can offer.  The patient should be informed that infertility may result and that subsequent pregnancy may be complicated (such as by premature birth).

**Outcomes Summary**

Most randomized (Level I, see above section) and non-randomized series report high odds of clinical success and subsequent pregnancy success for UAE, although UAE is not necessarily always superior to surgical techniques.  UAE is best suited for women who prefer a minimally invasive procedure to surgery or other methods of treatment and are willing to accept the risks of UAE.
