Imaging forms a critical component of the diagnostic evaluation of OVAs and plays a crucial role in treatment planning. The advent of interventional radiology has strongly influenced the management and yielded favorable outcomes. The use of modern technology has also obviated the need for carrying out a biopsy (for diagnostic purposes) of every suspected lesion.

**Hemangioma**

Evaluating whether the hemangioma is congenital or infantile is of paramount importance to determine the course of management. Investigations are needed to exclude the differential diagnosis of vascular rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and other childhood malignancies. Vascular arterial flow can be highlighted on Color Doppler Ultrasonography (USG). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals a lesion that is slightly hypointense to extraocular muscles on T1-weighted (T1W) sequence, markedly enhances on contrast with multiple flow voids, and appears hyperintense on T2-weighted (T2W) MRI. Involution-related and proliferative changes can be demonstrated on MR imaging.

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) MRI has recently gained popularity due to its ability to differentiate benign from malignant lesions qualitatively and quantitatively by means of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. In the case of IH, a bright ADC map reveals enhanced diffusion with higher ADC values, as opposed to RMS, which shows restricted diffusion on the ADC map with lower values of the diffusion coefficient.

**Vascular Malformations**

**Cavernous Venous Malformation (CVM)**

USG (A and B – scan) is a useful, non-invasive imaging tool, especially for initial evaluation. A regular, round-shaped lesion with high internal reflectivity and moderate attenuation of echoes is characteristic of CVM. On CT scan, CVM appears as a well-circumscribed, hyperdense, homogenous, intraconal lesion, seen as a discrete mass that does not directly adhere to the extra-ocular muscles and optic nerve and may occasionally erode the bone. Rarely CVM can encroach the orbital apex, resembling the typical pear shape. Phleboliths, which are pathognomonic of VMs, caused due to chronic inflammation in long-standing cases, may be seen as hyperdense, calcified areas within the mass. On Contrast-Enhancement, only minimal to mild contrast enhancement is seen in the early arterial phase followed by diffuse enhancement during the late venous phase. This is because the blood flow within the lesion is independent of the orbital vasculature and is predominantly stagnant. CT – Angiography depicts a nodular pattern of contrast enhancement in the initial phase, owing to small vessels within the lesion. However, radiation-associated ocular complications, mainly lens-related, limit its use as a routine procedure. CVM shows hypointense or isointense signals on T1-weighted (T1W) MRI sequences and heterogeneous hyperintensity on T2-weighted (T2W) MRI due to intervening areas of thrombosis devoid of hyperintense signals.

Dynamic investigations, such as Valsalva-augmented MRI, reveal no significant changes in the features. MR Angiography (MRA) is a non-invasive technique that assists in direct static visualization of the orbital vasculature and provides little knowledge about the blood flow characteristics indirectly. Dynamic assessment can be achieved using 3-Dimensional time-of-flight and phase contrast MRA. It is usually utilized to assess venous flow as a high-flow arterial component causes phase-related artifacts. Although 3D phase-contrast MRA demonstrates the flow characteristics better, it is far more susceptible to motion artifacts than 2-dimensional MRA owing to a longer acquisition time.

Thus, to overcome the above challenge, time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics (TRICKS) was introduced in 2003-04, where rapid acquisition of dynamic images of contrast flow could be accomplished with excellent temporal and spatial resolution. TRICKS MRA is a non-invasive, sensitive procedure for the dynamic assessment of venous and arterial flow. Besides diagnosis, it also aids in surgical planning and subsequent monitoring. CVM shows negligible and markedly delayed blushing, representing capsular enhancement, on TRICKS.

CVMs appear relatively hyperintense on DWI with ADC values between 1.23 x 10 mm/s and 1.39 x 10 mm/s. This should be differentiated from lymphoma, which shows restriction of diffusion and hence, the low signal intensity with ADC values ranging from 0.44 x 10mm/s to 0.92 x 10 mm/s.

**Venous and Lymphatic Malformations**

MRI is the investigation of choice for evaluating and guiding the treatment of vascular malformations. Imaging characteristics mainly depend upon the internal composition of the lesion of interest.

Distensible venous malformations (OVM Type – 2, previously known as “varix”) appear isointense on T1W MRI and hyperintense on T2W MRI. They show vivid enhancement on gadolinium contrast injection. It has been seen that high ADC values of greater than 2.8 mm/s on DWI MRI are 100% sensitive and specific for Type – 2 OVM.

Lymphatic malformations comprise micro or macro cysts, often depicting fluid-fluid levels on imaging. Only the solid component, represented by the intercystic septae, will enhance on contrast, thus showing an irregular patchy appearance on imaging. MRI is more effective than CT in demonstrating recent and old bleed and the nature of fluid within the cyst. As opposed to venous malformations, direct contrast injection into these lesions doesn’t demonstrate any outflow. Combined malformations may exhibit an anterior lymphatic component and a deep-seated, distensible venous component.

If, in a child, the lesion extends beyond the eyelids, it is important to evaluate the cheek and the roof of the mouth to rule out co-existing anomalies in these areas. CTA or CE-MRI may be performed to exemplify the extra-orbital components with a special focus on the cheek region and pterygopalatine fossa. If the superior orbital fissure is enlarged, it is vital to look for co-existing vascular anomalies of the brain and skull.

**A-V Malformations (AVMs)**

Outpatient evaluation of a CCF should include intra-ocular pressure assessment, exophthalmometry, pneumotonometry, and color doppler ultrasonography. A difference in ocular pulse amplitude (OPA) of more than 1.6mm between the eyes is 100% sensitive and 93% specific for CCFs.

On standard (CT and MRI) scanning, AVMs are identified by the presence of cavernous sinus enlargement with lateral wall convexity, dilated superior ophthalmic vein, and increase in extraocular muscle thickness. The presence of multiple flow voids signals, which correspond to the high flow vessels, is the characteristic feature on MRI. The TRICKS sequences help in delineating the arterial as well as the venous components as a function of time. AVMs appear irregularly tortuous and show vivid contrast enhancement with or without intracranial involvement. Aneurysms usually found at the origin of the ophthalmic artery and rarely, at the intra-orbital location, can also be detected on imaging.

Digital subtraction angiography, where contrast is directly injected into the feeder vessels followed by digital image acquisition, is the gold standard modality for evaluating AVMs. It effectively maps the entire vasculature by delineating the draining venous component and arterial feeder vessels. DSA is both diagnostic as well as therapeutic. Non-invasive neuroimaging modalities, including CT angiography and MR angiography, are found to be highly sensitive for CCFs. High-flow fistulas demonstrate rapid sinus filling with minimal to the absent filling of intracranial vessels, whereas low-flow dural fistulas show delayed slow filling with the intact filling of the intracranial vasculature. Demonstration of nidus on angiography almost always ascertains the diagnosis of an arterio-venous malformation and is typically absent in cases of AV fistula.
