The double-chambered right ventricle was first described in the 19th century. It is now considered a distinctive anatomic entity; wherein there is a muscular obstruction below the infundibulum dividing the right ventricle into a low-pressure infundibulum and a high-pressure apical portion. This activity describes the clinical presentation of the double-chambered right ventricle and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiology of double-chambered right ventricle.
- Identify the clinical features of a patient with a double-chambered right ventricle.
- Describe the diagnosis and management options available for a double-chambered right ventricle.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the delivery of care for patients with double-chambered right ventricle and improve outcomes.
