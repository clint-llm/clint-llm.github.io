There is no widely accepted treated for neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis; supportive care is recommended. In general, neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is a self-limiting disease and does not require therapy. In most cases, the lesions resolve spontaneously within a month. The use of corticosteroids, topical and systemic, is debatable. Nonetheless, it is well-recognized that steroids should be used with caution in neutropenic patients. Symptomatic management of fever and, or, pain is strongly recommended. Colchicine has been used successfully to treat otherwise healthy, neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis patients.

Many patients experience recurrent neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis with subsequent courses of chemotherapy; if the patient’s neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is associated with a specific chemotherapeutic agent, one case report recommends using dapsone 100 mg daily, for 48 hours, before drug rechallenge.
