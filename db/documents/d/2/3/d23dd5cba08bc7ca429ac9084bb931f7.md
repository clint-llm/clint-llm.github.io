There are a few different forms of normal hemoglobin in human blood. The percent prevalence of each hemoglobin type depends on the stage of development.

During pregnancy, the fetus primarily produces fetal hemoglobin (HbF). HbF comprises two a and two gamma-globin subunits. HbF has a stronger oxygen affinity than HbA, allowing oxygen to flow from maternal to fetal circulation through the placenta. Production of HbF drops significantly after birth, reaches low, near-adult levels by two years, and ultimately makes up 2 to 3% of hemoglobin in adults.

HbA, the most common adult form of hemoglobin, comprises two alpha and two beta-globin subunits. Inversely to HbF, HbA production explodes after birth and ultimately makes up 95-98% of hemoglobin in adults.

HbA2 is a less common adult form of hemoglobin. It comprises two alpha and two delta-globin subunits and makes up 1 to 3% of hemoglobin in adults.
