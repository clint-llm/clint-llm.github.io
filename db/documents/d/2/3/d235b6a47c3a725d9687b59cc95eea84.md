Serum or heparinized plasma may be the sample type for most commercially available assays; whole blood is used for some point-of-care methods.

The binding of heparin to cTnI may reduce immunoreactivity, depending on the heparin concentration in sample collection tubes (e.g., heparin at a concentration of 90 U/mL is reported to cause a decrease of approximately 20% in cTnI concentration).

Results may be confounded if there is poor preanalytical handling of troponin specimens, such as incomplete sample mixing at the time of specimen collection, insufficient sample centrifugation and separation of red cells from serum or plasma, presence of fibrin due to incomplete serum separation, and so forth.
