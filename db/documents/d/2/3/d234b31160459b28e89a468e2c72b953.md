Furrow degeneration (FD) is a rare pathology consisting of circumferential non-progressive corneal thinning leading to an evenly distributed tensile strength across the cornea. The article will focus on the epidemiology, theorized pathophysiology, and clinical presentation of FD. It will highlight the role of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiology of furrow degeneration.
- Outline the theorized pathophysiology of furrow degeneration.
- Explain how to differentiate furrow degeneration from other corneal thinning pathologies based on history and physical.
- Describe the prognosis of furrow degeneration.
