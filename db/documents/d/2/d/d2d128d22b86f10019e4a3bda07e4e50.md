The most common short-term complications from a Segond fracture are ongoing pain and stiffness. If the patient undergoes an ACL reconstruction, additional short to mid-term complications exist associated with the surgical procedure. Generally, however, ACL reconstruction is considered a safe procedure, with a 0.75% risk of a wound complication. Although thromboprophylaxis for ACL reconstruction is felt to be unnecessary, one paper has quoted deep vein thrombosis levels at 0.30% and pulmonary embolism levels at 0.18%.
