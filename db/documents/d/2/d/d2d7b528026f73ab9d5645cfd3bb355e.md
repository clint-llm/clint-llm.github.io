Myocarditis typically causes nonspecific changes in the EKG but can include diffuse ST-segment elevations that are typically concave (as opposed to convex morphology in STEMI). Lyme carditis, giant cell myocarditis, and cardiac sarcoidosis often present with AV blocks or bundle branch blocks. Patients with a prolonged QRS duration have a greater risk of cardiac transplant or death in the setting of clinically suspected myocarditis.

Myocarditis may cause elevation of cardiac biomarkers like troponin T or troponin I, but this is more sensitive than specific.

An echocardiogram may or may not reveal an impairment of ventricular function, with or without global or regional wall motion abnormalities. Both acute and chronic myocarditis can present with an increase in the size of the ventricular chambers; acute myocarditis can have a normal-to-thickened myocardium whereas chronic myocarditis more commonly correlates with thinning and scarring of the ventricular walls. However, it can morphologically resemble any of the three cardiomyopathies (dilated, restrictive, or hypertrophic).

Microbial diagnosis of myocarditis requires respective serologies. A patient with acute myocarditis will have IgM immunoglobulins whereas chronic microbial myocarditis will show IgG antibodies. Adding viral PCR for DNA or RNA on the EMB specimen may improve the diagnostic yield.

Studies have linked several autoantibodies with myocarditis; some target cardiac and muscle-specific antigens like anti-heart antibodies (AHA), anti-intercalated disk antibodies (AIDA), and anti-sarcolemmal antibodies (ASA).

Nuclear imaging with Gallium-67 scintigraphy, Thallium-201 scan, or 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography have poor specificity but can help detect sarcoidosis in its acute phase and also be useful in monitoring the progression of the disease.

Cardiac MRI (CMR) has developed as a promising mode of non-invasive diagnosis of myocarditis. In patients with clinically suspected myocarditis, the Lake Louise criteria help determine if the CMR findings are consistent with myocarditis.

- Increase in global or regional myocardial signal intensity in T2-weighted images, suggestive of myocardial edema

- Early gadolinium enhancement of the myocardium suggestive of hyperemia and capillary leakage (markers of inflammation), and an increased ratio of signal intensity between myocardium and skeletal muscles in T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced images

- At least one focal lesion of late gadolinium enhancement (in inversion recovery-prepared gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images) is suggestive of myocyte injury and/or scar due to myocarditis; this must be in the non-ischemic regional distribution (sub-epicardium or mid-wall, rather than the sub-endocardium which is involved in myocardial infarction)

If high clinical suspicion exists for myocarditis with recent onset of symptoms, but the CMR does not meet the Lake Louise criteria, then the CMR must be repeated in 1-2 weeks.

Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is the only means of a definitive diagnosis of myocarditis and must fulfill the histologic and immunohistochemical criteria discussed before. Since it is an invasive procedure with significant morbidity, it is not feasible in every patient. The European Society of Cardiology proposes that EMB should be performed in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis after ruling out ischemia with coronary angiography.

The patient has clinically suspected myocarditis if he has one or more "clinical presentations" with one or more "diagnostic criteria"; or if he/she is asymptomatic, he/she must meet 2 or more "diagnostic criteria" from different categories.

- Acute chest pain (which can be pericarditic or pseudo-ischemic)

- New onset/ acute worsening (<3 months)

- Chronic (>3 months) heart failure (with dyspnea and/or fatigue with or without the left and/or right heart failure signs)

- Arrhythmias (palpitations, syncope, other unexplained arrhythmia symptoms, or aborted sudden cardiac death)

- Unexplained cardiogenic shock

Diagnostic criteria include:

- Newly abnormal 12-lead EKG, Holter or stress testing

- Elevated myocytolysis markers like Troponin T or Troponin I,

- New and otherwise unexplained functional and structural abnormalities on cardiac imaging (echocardiography, angiography, or MRI)

- Tissue characterization by CMR (including edema and/or late gadolinium enhancement of myocarditis pattern).

All patients raising clinical suspicion of myocarditis should be admitted to the hospital for observation. Patients must have a 12-lead EKG testing and a transthoracic echocardiogram and should be considered for coronary angiography to rule out ischemic heart disease. If the patient is clinically stable, a cardiac MRI may precede EMB for further characterization; but if the patient has a life-threatening presentation, he/she must undergo an EMB without delay.
