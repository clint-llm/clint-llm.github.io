Most commonly, diaphragm injuries are seen on the left side, as the right diaphragm is well-protected by the liver. Diaphragmatic rupture secondary to blunt injury traumas may manifest many years after the initial event with herniation of abdominal viscera into the pleural cavity. A defect in the diaphragm would thus lead to inadequate ventilation, and herniation of abdominal organs into the chest cavity can further lead to tracheal deviation and worsening respiratory functions. In veryÂ late cases, gradual herniation of abdominal organs can lead to obstruction, strangulation, and eventual rupture of the viscera. Less commonly seen are hemothorax and hydrothorax, themselves a result of leakage of abdominal fluid and ascites through the diaphragmatic defect.
