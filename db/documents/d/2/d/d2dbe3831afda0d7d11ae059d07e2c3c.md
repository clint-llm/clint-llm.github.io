The therapeutic value of diagnosing viscerosomatic reflexes is a distinctive component of the field of medicine known as osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM). Correspondingly, the use of manual therapies to correct somatic dysfunction is one of its mainstays. An osteopathic structural exam is essential in the evaluation and treatment of any patient and includes an observation of the skin, layer-by-layer palpation, regional range of motion testing of the vertebral column, and segmental regional range of motion testing (i.e., of the extremities).

Diagnosis of somatic dysfunction follows a deliberate survey of the paravertebral musculature and soft tissues to identify TART changes that reflect underlying visceral (“viscerosomatic”) or somatic (“somato-somatic”) irritation. TART changes are thus direct sequelae of segmental facilitation, as will be explained in-depth in later sections. Osteopathic manipulative techniques (OMT) are then used to treat somatic dysfunction. Given their implication in the pathogenesis of somatic dysfunction, it is crucial to understand the physiology, and inherent pathophysiology, of viscerosomatic reflexes.
