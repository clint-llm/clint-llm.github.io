Heart failure is a condition in which the heart loses its ability to pump blood efficiently to the rest of the body. Right heart failure is most commonly a result of left ventricular failure via volume and pressure overload. Clinically, patients will present with signs and symptoms of chest discomfort, breathlessness, palpitations, and body swelling. This condition is evaluated using non-invasive techniques such as echocardiography, nuclear angiography, MRI, 64-slice CT, as well as invasive hemodynamic measurements. Management is aimed at increasing right ventricular contractility, reducing right ventricular afterload and optimizing volume status. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of right heart failure and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of a patient with right heart failure.
- Describe the workup of a patient with right heart failure.
- Identify the treatment options for right heart failure.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to recognize the clinical signs of heart failure and evaluate it using non-invasive and invasive measures which will enhance the delivery of care for the affected patients.
