Orchitis diagnosis is usually from history and physical findings. Laboratory tests are generally not helpful, but urethral swabs and urine samples may be obtained for routine examination and cultures to rule out urinary tract infection and diagnose sexually transmitted infections as the source.

When assessing patients with acute testicular or scrotal pain, it is imperative to rule out testicular torsion.Â For such patients, color Doppler ultrasonography of the scrotum is the first choice of investigation.

Ultrasonography findings in patients with mumps orchitis usually subside by the seventh day.
