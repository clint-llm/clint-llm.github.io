History and clinical examination determine the diagnosis, and no supplemental imaging is needed unless there are extenuating circumstances. CT imaging or ultrasound may be useful in the face of possible bowel obstruction; however, they are not required for surgical intervention

Inguinal hernias typically are asymptomatic until a bump or swelling of the groin is noted. Some patients may report pain when straining or during heavy lifting. Pain and discomfort are mostly associated with larger hernias usually requiring manual compression for reduction or lying supine with manual compression. Bilateral examination of the groin may reveal a mass that is either reducible or irreducible. An examination should be done supine, as well as, standing, with coughing and straining to identify small reducible hernias. The practitioner palpates the external ring by invaginating the scrotum with an index finger to a point lateral and superior to the pubic tubercle. Coughing or straining during this examination is critical to the palpation of protruding tissue to diagnose a hernia.

A gray-zone or debate regarding the contralateral inguinal exploration and hernia repair exists among the surgeons, especially pediatric surgeons. Contralateral exploration can be performed in children with raised intraabdominal pressure due to increased peritoneal fluid such as children with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, those undergoing peritoneal dialysis, etc.
