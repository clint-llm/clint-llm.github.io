The etiology of conversion disorder can be multifactorial. A vast majority of patients that present with FNSD/CD have an identifiable stressor. However, the absence of a stressor does not exclude the presence of FNSD/CD. It may be noted that a causal relationship between psychological distress and the occurrence of conversion is difficult to establish.

According to recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies exploring a brain-based cognitive model for CD, there appears to be a disconnect between the neuronal networks of the anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex, which points to theÂ psychodynamic dissociation hypothesis.

Psychosocial stressors, including neglect, and physical or sexual abuse, are also implicated in the manifestation of CD. For example, dissociative phenomena and motor symptoms that are common in patients with PTSD are also seen in CD.
