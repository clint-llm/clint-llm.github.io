The analysis of sputum is essential for discovering the reasons leading to different airway and lung diseases. The accurate diagnosis is directly related to the strategy that the physician uses to treat the patients. For infectious diseases, a lab technician first tries to find out the pathogens, and then they test different drugs that can be used for the treatment. For the suspected lung cancers and certain non-cancerous lung conditions, the lab will inspect whether abnormal cells exist in the sputum specimens or not.
