Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute-onset illness characterized by fever, hypotension, sunburn-like rash, and end-organ damage. TSS was classically associated with high absorbency tampon use in menstruating women until eventually, these were taken off the market. Since that time, it has become important to also consider non-menstrual cases. The incidence of TSS is estimated to be around 0.8 to 3.4 per 100,000 in the United States. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of toxic shock syndrome and discusses the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology and pathophysiology of toxic shock syndrome. 
- Review the history and exam findings of toxic shock syndrome.
- Describe the management of toxic shock syndrome. 
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with toxic shock syndrome.
