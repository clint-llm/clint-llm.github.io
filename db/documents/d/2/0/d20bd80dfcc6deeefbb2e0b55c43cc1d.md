Paget Schroetter syndrome (PSS) is effort-induced thrombosis of the axillary and subclavian veins associated with compression of the subclavian vein at the thoracic outlet. It is the venous variant of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), the syndrome of symptoms associated with compression of the subclavian vein, subclavian artery, or brachial plexus as they pass through the thoracic outlet. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Paget Schroetter syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Paget Schroetter syndrome.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with Paget Schroetter syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment options for a patient with Paget Schroetter syndrome.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by Paget Schroetter syndrome.
