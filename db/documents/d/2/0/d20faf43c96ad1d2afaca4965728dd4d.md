A careful evaluation may allow timely diagnosis and management of IBD and its EIMs. It requires a thorough history and physical examination followed by appropriate laboratory tests and diagnostic imaging/procedures. Commonly used laboratory tests include stool studies and blood tests. Diagnostic and imaging procedures include X-ray, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, capsule endoscopy, flexible colonoscopy, and sigmoidoscopy.
