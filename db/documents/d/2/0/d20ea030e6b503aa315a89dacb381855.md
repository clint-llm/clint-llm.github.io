Most vaccines carry a small risk of B-symptoms following administration, including fever, fatigue, and myalgias

More serious complications are possible, though extremely rare. Anaphylaxis may occur in response to a vaccine or one of its ingredients.

Another very rare complication of vaccination is Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition affecting the peripheral nervous system. The mechanism by which vaccination causes Guillain-Barre is not known. Symptoms include ascending paresthesias and paralysis, with potential paralysis of respiratory muscles possible.
