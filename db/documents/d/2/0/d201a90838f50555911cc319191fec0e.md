**History**

The patient gives a history of residence or travel to a filarial endemic region. History of medications and foods should be asked to rule out other causes of pulmonary eosinophilia. Loeffler syndrome is precipitated by infections, food, or medications.

Characteristic symptoms of tropical pulmonary eosinophiliaÂ include:

- Dry cough, which is paroxysmal and nocturnal

- Cough associated with dyspnea

- Systemic manifestations such as fever, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss

- Peripheral blood eosinophilia greater than 3,000/mm3

- Extrapulmonary manifestations like lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly may be seen in a few cases.

**Physical Findings**

- Chest auscultation may reveal wheezing and crepitations.

- Organomegaly on abdominal palpation in a few cases

- Enlarged lymph nodes
