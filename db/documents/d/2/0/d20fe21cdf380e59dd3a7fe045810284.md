Infantile hemangioma is the most prevalent benign tumor of infancy, with an estimated incidence between 4 and 5 percent. Large facial segmental hemangioma is associated with PHACES syndrome, which is an acronym for posterior fossa malformations, hemangioma of the cervicofacial region, arterial anomalies, cardiac anomalies, eye anomalies, and sternal or abdominal clefting or ectopia cordis. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of PHACES syndrome and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline PHACES syndrome. 
- Explain when PHACES syndrome should be included on differential diagnosis.
- Review the management of PHACES syndrome.
- Describe the need for a well-integrated, interprofessional team approach to monitor development and identify any complications for patients with PHACES syndrome.
