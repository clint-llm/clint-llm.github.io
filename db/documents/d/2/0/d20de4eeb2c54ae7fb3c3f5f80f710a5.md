Acrokeratoelastoidosis typically presents in children and adolescents, usually before the 2nd and 3rd decades of life, although reports do exist of onset in adulthood.**[Figure 1(A)]**. Papular acrokeratosis, a synonym for acrokeratoelastoidosis stems from such characteristic morphology and location of lesions. Involvement of the dorsa of hands/feet is characteristic**[Figure 1(B)]**, qualifying the lesion as 'inverse' papular acrokeratosis.

Typically, except for cosmetic disfigurement, the lesions are asymptomatic in most of the cases. Mild itching, hyperhidrosis, and aquagenic palmoplantar keratoderma constitute uncommon presentations/associations.

In most cases, the lesions stabilize after a few weeks to months of onset although there are anecdotal reports of rapid progression of lesions during pregnancy.
