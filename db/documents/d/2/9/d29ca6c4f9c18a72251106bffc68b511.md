The gracilis is a long, thin muscle located in the medial compartment of the thigh. It originates from the medial aspect of the ischiopubic ramus. It is also related (along with the adductor brevis muscle) to the inferior pubic ligament, a band connecting the inferior parts of the pubic rami.

The muscle fiber bundles of the gracilis have a spiral arrangement, which inserts onto the anterior aspect of the gracilis tendon obliquely, making it a spiral unipennate muscle.

Crossing both the hip and knee joints, the gracilis muscle performs hip adduction, hip flexion, hip internal rotation, knee flexion, and internal knee rotation.
