Understanding the anatomy of the arm and the human body as a whole assists physicians in identifying the location of pathology during patient encounters. Identifying weakness or atrophy with anatomical knowledge in mind can assist in locating where and, more importantly, why the problem is occurring. Also, knowing what normal anatomy looks like allows physicians to determine abnormalities in structure. Whether it be emergency room physicians reviewing an x-ray or orthopedic surgeons using intraoperative imaging to determine proper realignment of a fracture, knowledge of anatomy is of the utmost importance in medicine.
