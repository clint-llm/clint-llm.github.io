The scenario of recurrent late decelerations can be precarious as they can become hazardous if not promptly evaluated.  Evaluating the entire fetal heart tracing and maternal status is essential. Consideration is necessary to the degree of variability and presence, or absence of accelerations, and the underlying cause of the deceleration must be addressed immediately.  If the late decelerations are recurrent with minimal or no variability and have not improved with intrauterine resuscitative measures, then expeditious steps must be taken towards delivering the fetus.
