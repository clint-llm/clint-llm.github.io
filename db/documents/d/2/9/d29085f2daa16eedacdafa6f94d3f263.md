Injuries to the femoral shaft are typically quite obvious and quickly diagnosed with imaging. It is essential to identify associated bony fractures of the pelvis, proximal or distal femur, and tibia as this will change the treatment. In the context of bisphosphonate use, it is vital to look for hypertrophied lateral cortices bilaterally and identify signs of impending fracture. Patients may present altered or unresponsive and unable to provide an accurate history and physical, resulting in a delay in diagnosis.
