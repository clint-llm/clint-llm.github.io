Acute and chronic leukemias are heterogeneous hematologic diseases with complex diagnostic and therapeutic implications requiring an interprofessional healthcare team. The involvement of healthcare professionals from across specialties and disciplines - clinicians, nurses, specialists (especially hematologists and oncologists), nurses, pharmacists, nutritionists, etc. - is needed to achieve effective management, mitigate adverse events, and ensure their quality of life.

The patient's initial encounter will often be with their family clinician, who runs initial bloodwork and other tests, but specialist input is an absolute necessity if there are any indications that leukemia is the diagnosis. Specialists will primarily guide the therapy regimen, but nursing will play a pivotal role in assisting in the evaluation, coordinating activities between specialists, and providing patient counseling. A specialized oncology pharmacist is a valuable asset to the team. Their consultation can help guide chemotherapy, appropriate dosing medication reconciliation, and medication counseling for patients, especially regarding adverse events. All interprofessional team members must maintain meticulous records on all interactions and interventions with the patient; this is part of communicating all patient data to the rest of the team. Everyone involved in care must keep other team members informed of any changes in the patient's condition as appropriate and include the patient in all care decisions, answering questions and offering counsel. Patient-centered communication and shared decision-making are integral to successful patient outcomes in the interprofessional team model.
