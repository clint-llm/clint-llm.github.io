Physicians should always be concerned about prevention of cholesteatomas. Persistent eustachian tube dysfunction can cause retraction pockets. Tympanostomy tube placement early may eliminate negative middle ear pressure, reduce the risk of retraction pocket formation, and halt the initiation of cholesteatoma formation. Another important consideration is the disposition of cholesteatoma patients. Many of these patients have experienced symptoms over several months before being seen by a healthcare provider, and they may be delayed several more months before seeing an otolaryngologist. Ensuring close follow up is crucial as patients that have delayed interventionsÂ often have worse outcomes.
