Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a metastrongyloid nematode that is one of the most common pathogens to cause eosinophilic meningitis. Commonly referred to as the "rat lungworm," it is transmitted by both rats (definite hosts), snails, and slugs (intermediate hosts) among some other transport hosts. The parasite is most prevalent in the Asia-Pacific regions; however, outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported outside of the endemic areas. To date, nine species have been identified, but A. cantonensis and A. costaricensis remain the most important human pathogens. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the life cycle of Angiostrongylus cantonensis with respect to human infection.
- Summarize the diagnosis of angiostrongyliasis as a cause of eosinophilic meningitis.
- Describe the treatment approach of patients suffering from angiostrongyliasis.
- Review interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and delivery for patients with angiostrongyliasis.
