The placenta has several metabolic functions that are vital for the healthy growth of a fetus. The placenta can make its own glycogen and cholesterol from momâ€™s glucose and fatty acids, respectively. The glycogen gets stored as energy for the fetus, and the cholesterol is used to make hormones such as progesterone, estrogen, and glucocorticoids. It also synthesizes peptide hormones such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and human placental lactogen (hPL), growth hormone (GH), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), placental growth factor (PIGF), and cytokines.
