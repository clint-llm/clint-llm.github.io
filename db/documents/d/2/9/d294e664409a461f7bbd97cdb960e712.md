Gastric lymphoma is rare, but the incidence of the disease is increasing. It accounts for up to 40% of extranodal lymphomas but only 3% to 5% of gastric neoplasms. The risk of gastric lymphoma increases with advancing age. A significant increase in incidence occurs after 40, with a peak incidence in the sixth decade of life. Males are 2-3 times more likely to develop primary gastric lymphoma than females.
