**Drug Interactions**

Anthracyclines are major substrates of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Caution is necessary when using them concurrently with inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, as this will reduce anthracycline clearance and increase the chances of cardiotoxicity and other adverse effects. Notable interactions exist with taxanes (except docetaxel) and trastuzumab.
