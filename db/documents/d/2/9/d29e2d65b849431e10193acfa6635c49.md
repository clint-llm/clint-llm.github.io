In addition to educating urologists and urogynecologists on this condition, various proposals for screening guidelines for PPSM have been proposed, and all generally agree on baseline testing at the initiation of the drug, annual testing thereafter, and collaborative decision-making about drug discontinuation when patients have a cumulative dose of greater than 1500 g. At each screening appointment with the ophthalmologist, various imaging modalities should be used, including NIR, FAF, and OCT-A, if possible.
