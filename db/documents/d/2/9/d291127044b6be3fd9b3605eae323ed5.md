The best management of VGS is prevention. Maintaining a healthy weight, taking your medications as prescribed, exercising, and cessation of tobacco use is key to avoiding another procedure or surgical operation. When VGS of the coronary vessels is diagnosed, there are two primary treatment options. Redo open surgery is a significant undertaking with a high degree of morbidity and mortality or PCI. PCI uses a catheter-based system through an artery in your arm or leg to place a stent in the coronary vessels and increase their blood flow. Careful precautions are taken to prevent distal embolization of plaques during PCI stenting. VGS of the peripheral arterial system is similar. Endovascular reperfusion methods are preferred with the use of a stent or balloon to open an occluded vessel and restore blood flow. If endovascular techniques fail or are impossible, an open surgical approach may be required. Unfortunately, some patients are not candidates for endovascular or open approaches, and these patients will be treated with medications alone that thin the blood to restore blood flow.
