Back pain is a very common problem seen in many primary care offices and ERs. Usually, back pain is musculoskeletal, caused by turning, twisting, pulling, or lifting incorrectly. Many times these patients are amenable to some hands-on treatment as opposed to taking medication. Osteopathic physicians have received training in these special hands-on procedures, which can help with back pain. These include counter strain, kneading, and stretching techniques, muscle energy, and HVLA.

Many factors account for which procedure the practitioner chooses, but it is most often based on provider comfort and preference, as well as if the patient is willing and able to receive treatment. Thoracic HVLA is an important method of OMT in the osteopathic physician's toolkit as it can serve to treat musculoskeletal ailments while concurrently allowing for a reduction in the number of NSAIDs or other pain medication that a patient may be taking.
