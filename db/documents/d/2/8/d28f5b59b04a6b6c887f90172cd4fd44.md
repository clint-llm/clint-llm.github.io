Hearing loss in children can significantly impact development and quality of life. Screening guidelines are in place to assist providers, with the recommendation to screen all newborns for hearing loss by at least one month of age, followed by diagnostic audiologic testing by 3 months of age, and appropriate intervention by 6 months of age. There are a variety of ways to evaluate a patient with potential hearing loss, from audiologic tests to laboratory and imaging tests. This activity reviews the components frequently utilized in audiologic testing, discusses the indications for laboratory and imaging modalities, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with known or suspected hearing loss.

**Objectives:**
- Review the screening indications for hearing loss in children.
- Outline treatment considerations for pediatric patients with hearing loss.
- Summarize the most effective testing methods for children of different ages with suspected hearing loss.
- Describe the pathophysiology of hearing and how the pathway can be disrupted in patients with hearing loss.
