The indications for central venous access are broad and are often situational. In no particular order, they include:

- Multiple infusions may be incompatible with peripheral intravenous access, such as vasopressors, total parenteral nutrition, chemotherapy, and other acidic medications to peripheral veins.

- Inability to obtain venous access in emergent situations.

- The initiation of extracorporeal therapies, such as hemodialysis, plasmapheresis, and continuous renal replacement therapy.

- Hemodynamic monitoring, including central venous pressures.

- For venous interventions, including inferior vena cava filter placement, thrombolytic therapy, transvenous cardiac pacing, and intra-venous stenting.
