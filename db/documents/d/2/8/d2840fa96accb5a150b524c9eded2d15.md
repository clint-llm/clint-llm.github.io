No antidote for toxicity is available, only 20% dialyzable; however, this is variable based on hemodialysis filter. Avoid potentially toxic prolonged peak concentrations above 35 mcg/mL.

**Drug Interactions**

Clindamycin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline can inactivate amikacin and other aminoglycosides.

High-ceiling diuretics like furosemide increase ototoxicity and have the potential to increase the concentration of amikacin, therebyÂ worsening the ototoxicity.

Other medications that can increase amikacin concentrations in the blood include NSAIDs (especially indomethacin) and quinidine.
