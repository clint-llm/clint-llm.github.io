The diagnosis of a stye (hordeolum) and chalazion requires only a history and physical exam. No diagnostic tests are required or useful in their diagnosis. Colonization with noninvasive bacteria is common, and bacterial cultures of discharge from the area usually do not correlate with clinical improvement nor aid in treatment. The clinical presentation of an acute chalazion and an internal hordeolum may be challenging to differentiate, but fortunately, management is the same.
