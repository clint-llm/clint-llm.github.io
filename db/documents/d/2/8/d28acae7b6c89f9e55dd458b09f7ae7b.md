There is no specific treatment for shellfish allergies but preventing contaminated fish from entering the food supply can prove to be very useful.

Following treatment, patients should receive instructions to avoid the offending agent or food. For example, patients who have an allergic reaction triggered by crab should avoid other crustaceans. Despite avoidance, consideration of a prescription for an epinephrine auto-injector may be wise due to the potential for anaphylactic reactions and cross-reactivity.
