The fingertip is a crucial part of the hand, and any injury can compromise function, as well as aesthetics. an interprofessional approach to fingertip injuries is essential to limit the morbidity. Since most patients with fingertip injuries present to the emergency department, the triage nurse should be aware of the importance of early referral of the patient to a hand surgeon, in case reimplantation is considered. While most injuries can be managed in the emergency department, some may require a referral to the plastic or orthopedic surgeon. The key is to preserve as much of the finger as possible. Once the injury is repaired, most patients require some type of finger rehabilitation to regain function, strength, and sensation. Patients should be educated on ways to protect the finger during the healing process, which can be several weeks or months.
