Appendectomy is among the most commonly performed surgical procedures.

Appendicitis is called the first American surgical disease, and appendectomy holds a prominent and storied position in surgical history. Charles McBurney published his report on the surgical management of appendicitis in 1895. He described the potential consequences of undrained purulent appendicitis, the disadvantages of the classical midline laparotomy, and exploratory needle puncture. Finally, he described a novel surgical approach and exposure, introducing consecutive lateral incisions through the external oblique aponeurosis, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis muscles rather than midline laparotomy.

Appendectomy was the first laparotomy performed with a source control approach to eradicate an infectious threat.

Despite a significant change in managing acute appendicitis with primary antibiotic therapy, the primary option for treating acute appendicitis remains a surgical approach. A large, randomized trial of antibiotic therapy for the primary management of acute appendicitis showed that while antibiotic therapy might have comparable results with appendectomy in the short term, 1 of 4 participants in the antibiotic therapy arm required appendectomy within one year.
