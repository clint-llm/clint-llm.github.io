Herpangina most frequently occurs in the pediatric population in patients younger than 10 years of age. Children are often infected via exposure at childcare centers or schools. Adolescents and adults are less frequently affected. Newborns, immunocompromised, and pregnant patients can develop more severe disease. Neither gender is more commonly infected. In the United States, most infections occur during the summer and fall months in temperate climates but may occur all year round in tropical climates. Cases of herpangina have been reported worldwide, and the most recent fatal outbreak was reported in Japan in 2007.
