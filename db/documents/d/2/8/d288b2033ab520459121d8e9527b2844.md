The prognosis for generalized tonic-clonic seizures is dependent on the cause of the seizure and risk factors for the patient.Â On average, the risk of recurrent seizures is about 40% based on observational studies. The risk of recurrent seizure is highest during the period immediately after the initial seizure and decreases with increasing time from the event. Studies have shown that seizure risk reduction of approximately 30% to 60% after initiating treatment with medications. Three factors consistently shown to have increased risk of seizure recurrence are the number of seizures, neurological disorder, and an abnormal electroencephalogram.
