Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common type of primary headaches. It is also sometimes referred to as muscle contraction headache, stress headache, or psychomyogenic headache. TTH occurs repetitively and can categorize into episodic TTH (with frequent and infrequent subtypes) and chronic TTH. The differentiating factor for these is the frequency of headache episodes.

TTH is differentiated from other primary and secondary headaches using the definition and diagnostic criteria from the International Headache Society (IHS). The duration of TTH episodes may vary from 30 minutes to 7 days. TTH may have a bilateral location with a band-like quality. Headache is usually mild to moderate in intensity and does not worsen with minor exertional activity (such as walking). Detailed IHS criteria for TTH appear in the evaluation section.
