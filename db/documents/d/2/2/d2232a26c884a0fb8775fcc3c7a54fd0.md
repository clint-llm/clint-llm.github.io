Hyperbaric dives follow specific proven dive protocols depending on the condition being treated. Dives last around two hours daily with two 10-minute oxygen breaks to prevent oxygen seizures. They usually go to a pressure of 2.4 ATM at 100% oxygen. A typical dive routine lasts for 33 sessions but can be extended if need be.
