Malnutrition is an important complication of diabetic gastroparesis that often needs management with jejunostomy, parenteral nutrition, or surgery. Wide glycemic fluctuations can occur in diabetic gastroparesis, and this can lead to complications such as hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Nausea and vomiting can lead to aspiration pneumonia.
