Enoxaparin has a similar adverse effect profile as heparin. Because of the reduced effectiveness of the antidote (e.g., protamine), bleeding complications can be severe and life-threatening. Following are the important adverse drug reactions of enoxaparin.

- Bleeding: the most common adverse effect

- Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia

- Injection site bleeding or pain

- Nausea, confusion, headache

- Hypoaldosteronism

- Gastrointestinal bleeding

- Rectal sheath hematoma

- Osteoporosis

- Hepatotoxicity: transaminitis with the hepatocellular injury pattern (unlikely to cause clinically apparent liver injury)

- Bullous hemorrhagic dermatitis
