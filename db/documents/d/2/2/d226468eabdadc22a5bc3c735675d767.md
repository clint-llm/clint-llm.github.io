The diagnosis of drug-induced gingival overgrowth is made by clinical examination and the patient's past medical history.

- A periodontal examination is necessary to evaluate for the presence of periodontal disease.

- Full mouth periapical radiographs and orthopantomography are required before beginning any treatment to rule out periodontal disease.

- Complete blood count (CBC) is indicated in patients with gingival enlargement if there is a presence of profuse gingival bleeding, even if it is drug-induced, to rule out anemia and leukemia.

- Tissue biopsy should be carried out in case the presentation of the disease is unusual.

- Histopathological examination of persisting overgrowths is mandatory to evaluate malignant changes

- Candidiasis and other infections may be ruled out by taking a culture.
