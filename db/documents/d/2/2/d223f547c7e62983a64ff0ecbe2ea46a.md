A detailed history of the injury, thorough physical examination, and imaging can aid in diagnosing pulmonary contusion.

The imaging techniques include radiography of the chest, computer tomography (CT) scans, and ultrasound.

A chest X-ray is the most commonly used imaging technique for diagnosis. Its interpretation may be difficult as lung anatomical boundaries do not limit pulmonary contusions.

An ultrasound is a vital bedside imaging tool readily available for evaluating trauma patients in the supine position in the emergency department for diagnosis of pulmonary contusion and pneumothorax.

A chest CT scan is a more sensitive imaging technique in diagnosing pulmonary contusion. A higher resolution of CT scans can detect contusion immediately after trauma.
