Baclofen is FDA-approved and primarily used as an antispasmodic agent and muscle relaxant. It is utilized as an adjunct in treating painful muscle spasticity, clonus, and rigidity caused by spinal-cord related diseases such as multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, or spinal cord injury. It is most often administered as an oral medication, but in severe or chronic cases, and can also be delivered centrally using an implantable intrathecal pump. Chronic use of baclofen can result in withdrawal when abruptly discontinued. Baclofen overdose or withdrawal can be life-threatening. This review summarizes the clinical toxicity of baclofen, baclofen withdrawal, and acute management principles.
