The menstrual cycle is a series of coordinated hormonal changes controlling the ovaries and endometrium that stimulate the growth of a follicle to release an egg and prepare the endometrium for implantation if fertilization should occur. Conversely, if the egg released is not fertilized, menstruation occurs due to the shedding of the functional layer of the endometrium. The basic requirements for normal menstrual function include four anatomically and functionally distinct structural components: the genital outflow tract, including the uterus, the ovaries, the pituitary gland, and the hypothalamus. If any of the components are non-functional, bleeding cannot occur.
