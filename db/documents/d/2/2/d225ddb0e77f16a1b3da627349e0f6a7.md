The mean age of neurogenic bladder patients is 62.5 (standard deviation of 19.6.)

In the United States, a neurogenic bladder is found in 40% to 90% of persons with multiple sclerosis (with detrusor hyperreflexia in 50% to 90% of cases), 37% to 72% in patients with Parkinson disease, and 15% of all stroke patients.

Research shows that 70% to 84% of patients with spinal cord injuries have neurogenic bladder dysfunction at some point in their lives.

The worldwide yearly incidence of spinal cord injuries resulting in neurogenic bladder dysfunction has been estimated at between 12 to more than 65 cases/million population.

About 1427 babies are born in the United States with spina bifida; roughly one out of 2758 live births.
