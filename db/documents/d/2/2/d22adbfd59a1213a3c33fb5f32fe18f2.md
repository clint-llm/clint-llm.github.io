Epilepsia partialis continua (EPC) is a rare condition involving recurrent and sometimes intractable focal onset seizures associated with retained awareness. EPC seizures can occur over hours, days, or even years. The disease can manifest in a variety of ways, a few of which include myoclonic epilepsy, localized myoclonus, Jacksonian epilepsy, or sensorimotor clonic seizures. The localized nature of the seizures along with preserved consciousness and postictal confusion and weakness (Todd paralysis) are characteristic of the disorder but not pathognomonic. Treatment is centered on a combination of anti-epileptics coupled with identification and resolution of the underlying cause. This activity reviews when epilepsia partialis continua should be considered, how to properly evaluate for it, and the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the causes of epilepsia partialis continua.
- Review features that should prompt consideration of epilepsia partialis continua on differential diagnosis. 
- Explain the etiology-dependent management of epilepsia partialis continua.
- Summarize the role of collaboration amongst interprofessional team members to improve care coordination and minimize oversight, leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment and better outcomes for patients with epilepsia partialis continua.
