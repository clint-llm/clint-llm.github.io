Bumetanide has United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for managing various edematous conditions secondary to cardiac failure with or without ascites, or hepatic/renal disease, including nephrotic syndrome.

Bumetanide may be used alone or in conjunction with other antihypertensive agents in treating hypertension, although this is not an FDA-approved indication. Treating acute hypercalcemia is also an off-label indication for the drug.

Recent studies show seizures and behavioral problems in patients with tuberous sclerosis may be treated by agents that enhance GABA-anergic transmission by influencing chloride regulation.
