Selegiline may cause a hypertensive crisis, a severe elevation of blood pressure when the patient consumes the medication concurrently with food, drink, or supplements rich in tyramine.

Other dangerous adverse effects include sudden sleep episodes, orthostatic hypotension, arrhythmias, mental status alteration, hallucinations, extrapyramidal symptoms, dyskinesia, and serotonin syndrome.

Common adverse effects of selegilineÂ xerostomia and constipation are predominantly due to the drug's anticholinergic effects. Other commonly reported adverse reactions are headaches, dizziness, insomnia, and nausea.

Abrupt cessation of selegiline is not advisable because of the risk of antidepressant and antiparkinsonian discontinuation syndromes.

Adverse effects specific to the form of administration exist. For the transdermal route, a black box warning for the antidepressant use of selegiline cautions antidepressants in pediatric and young adult populations due to an increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Selegiline is not FDA-approved for bipolar depression as it may precipitate a manic episode. Transdermal use commonly causes skin irritation at the site of application. The ODT form can cause buccal mucosa irritation.
