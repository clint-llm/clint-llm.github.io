The following staging data is from the 2017 AHA/ACC updated guidelines for the management of mitral regurgitation

Grade A:

- At risk of mitral regurgitation (i.e., infective endocarditis, MVP)

- Normal valve leaflets, chords, and annulus in patients with coronary disease or cardiomyopathy

- Hemodynamics: No MR jet or small central jet area less than 20% LA on doppler, small vena contracta less than 0.30 centimeters (cm)

- Cardiac findings: normal or mildly dilated left ventricular size with fixed (infarction) or inducible (ischemia) abnormalities of regional wall motion, primary myocardial disease with LV dilation and systolic dysfunction

- Symptoms resulting from coronary ischemia or heart failure (HF) may be present that respond to revascularization and appropriate medical therapy

Grade B:

- Progressive mitral regurgitation

- Regional wall motion abnormalities demonstrating mild tethering of mitral leaflet and annular dilation with slight loss of central coaptation of the mitral leaflets

- Hemodynamics: effective regurgitant orifice (ERO) less than 0.40 cm^2, regurgitant volume below 60 mL, Regurgitant fraction under 50%

- Cardiac findings: Regional wall motion abnormalities with reduced LV systolic function, LV dilation, and systolic dysfunction due to primary myocardial disease

- Symptoms as described in Grade A

Grade C:

- Asymptomatic severe mitral regurgitation

- Regional wall motion abnormalities and/or LV dilation that show severe tethering of mitral leaflet, annular dilation with significant loss of central coaptation of the mitral leaflets

- Hemodynamics: ERO greater than or equal to 0.40 cm^2, regurgitant volume greater than or equal to 60 mL, regurgitant fraction under 50%

- Cardiac findings as described in grade B

- Symptoms as described in grade A

Grade D:

- Symptomatic severe mitral regurgitation

- Regional wall motion abnormalities and/or LV dilation that show severe tethering of mitral leaflet, and annular dilation with significant loss of central coaptation of the mitral leaflets

- Hemodynamics: ERO greater than or equal to 0.40 cm^2, regurgitant volume greater than or equal to 60 mL, regurgitant fraction greater than or equal to 50%

- Cardiac findings as described in grade B

- HF symptoms due to mitral regurgitation persist even after revascularization and optimization of medical therapy, decreased exercise tolerance, exertional dyspnea
