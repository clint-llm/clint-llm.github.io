With sudden blockage of blood supply, the common symptoms are sudden back pain that can quickly lead to numbness/weakness or pain that radiates along the nerves branching from the affected area.

Symptomatic treatment and physical therapy are recommended unless a clot or stenosis is identified, in which case surgery is recommended.

There are three major syndromes due to blockage of the spinal arteries.

- Acute central cord syndrome is the most common type of spinal cord injury. Its predominant etiology is cervical spine hyperextension trauma (often seen in MVA) that compresses the spinal cord. It mainly results in symptoms identical to cervical radiculopathy with the added effects of bladder dysfunction and severe paralysis in extreme cases; further confirmation is obtainable through a spurlings test, MRI, or CT scan note such diagnoses should be made urgently to figure out the significance of the blockage.

- Anterior spinal syndrome, in brief, is the most common clinical presentation of a spinal cord infarction. Consistent with its functional neuroanatomy, an anterior infarct/blockage typically presents as loss of motor function and hypotension with relative sparing of proprioception and vibratory sense below the lesion level.

- Posterior cord syndrome will affect the dorsal columns as that is supplied normally by the posterior spinal cords. The patient will most often experience ipsilateral loss of vibration and conscious proprioception; in severe cases, complete loss of sensation is found in the dermatomes corresponding with the levels underneath the level affected even when they are not directly related to the infarction.

Venous infarctions are rare but rapidly progress with near-certain fatality within 36 hours.
