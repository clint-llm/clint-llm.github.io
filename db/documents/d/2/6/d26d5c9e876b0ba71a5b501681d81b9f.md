- Be sure to recognize and address psychosocial conditions that are often associated with alopecia totalis. Referral to a support group may be helpful.

- Patients often prefer to try some treatment even though the overall complete recovery rate is only 8.5%. A discussion of realistic goals is helpful.

- Thyroid testing (such as a TSH with reflex to free T4) is the most important screening laboratory test. Other tests sometimes ordered with alopecia, in general, include a CBC, vitamin and mineral levels, RPR, plasma testosterone, DHEA-S, and ANA.

- Telogen effluvium can resemble alopecia totalis, but it has a more sudden onset and is self-limited. Also, there is no history of localized alopecia focalis.
