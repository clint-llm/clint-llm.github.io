Microsporidia are an unusually large group of unique, eukaryotic, obligate, intracellular parasites that biologists have studied for more than 150 years. Microsporidia are well-adapted pathogens and important agricultural parasites that infect honeybees, silkworms, and other insects. The organism is also a parasite for fish, rodents, rabbits, primates, and humans. This activity reviews with emphases on its pathophysiology and presentation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the recommended management of
microsporidia. 
- Outline the typical presentation for a patient with microsporidia. 
- Review the pathophysiology of microsporidia. 
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with microsporidia.
