Treatment and management of a patient with an Austin Flint murmur are the same as other patients with severe aortic regurgitation regardless of whether an Austin Flint murmur is present. Medical management consists of treating hypertension with afterload reducing agents such as dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers.
