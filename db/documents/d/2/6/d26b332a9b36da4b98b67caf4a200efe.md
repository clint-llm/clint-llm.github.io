Because tobacco use is determined by self-report, monitoring is also personal.Â  A nurse can encourage and refer or teach cessation classes; but ultimately the responsibility for cessation relies with the individual. Attitudes toward tobacco use are increasingly becoming negative as laws restricting public use of tobacco are enacted and advertising tobacco products has been restricted; however, tobacco use is still considered a personal choice, followed by an addiction to nicotine that is difficult to stop.
