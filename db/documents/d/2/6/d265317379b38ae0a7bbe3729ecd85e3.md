Epiphrenic diverticula can present in numerous ways, as mentioned earlier. Because of this fact, the differential diagnosis can be vast. Symptoms of dysphagia and regurgitation can be present in other esophageal diverticula, such as Zenker and traction diverticula. A barium esophagram will help to differentiate these diverticula depending on their anatomical location. These symptoms are also present in many esophageal motility disorders, which may or may not be the underlying cause of the diverticulum. Performing manometric studies will help to determine the type of management. Other differentials to consider are acid reflux, hiatal hernia, benign tumors, and esophageal cancer, all of which can be differentiated based on the standard work-up that includes esophagogram, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and manometry.
