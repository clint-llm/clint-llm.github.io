Despite public health efforts, typhoid fever is still a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Intersectoral coordination by other non-medical organizations and authorities in sanitation management, public healthcare awareness, and nutritional programs boost both the control and prevention of disease. Travelers to endemic areas should be advised to seek vaccination and to practice good food hygiene. A concerning trend is the emergence of extremely drug-resistant Salmonella typhi. Clinicians must encourage early care to establish the diagnosis and the correct antibiotic treatment that focuses on the appropriate choice of drug with adequate dosing and treatment duration to ensure patients face minimal complications. In times of outbreaks in endemic areas, coordinated public health campaigns swiftly administering vaccine and addressing sanitation concerns can decrease the burden of typhoid fever illness.
