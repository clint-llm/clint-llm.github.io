Timely presentation and managing exotropia are vital to preserving binocular vision and stereopsis. Detailed evaluation can help identify the type of exotropia and plan management accordingly. Conservative management in the form of orthoptic exercises, fusion exercises, and minus therapy has shown to improve alignment and help delay the need for surgical intervention.

Parents need to be made aware of the condition to make an early diagnosis, and appropriate management is started. Among patients requiring surgical intervention, it is essential to educate them properly about the type and nature of surgery. They should be clearly explained about the cosmetic nature of the procedures and expected associations like pain, redness, lid edema in the immediate postoperative period.

Changes in lid fissure size residual squint in large angles should also be discussed with the patients. Those undergoing adjustable sutures should be explained pre-operatively about the need for adjustment and making the knots permanent to avoid confusion in the postoperative period. It is also essential to describe chances of immediate diplopia in the postoperative period the need for common optical correction and orthoptic exercises, with regular follow-ups. Patient with sensory exotropia needs to be explained clearly about chances of recurrence over the years due to poor visual acuity in the exotropic eye.
