Patients with Kleine–Levin syndrome will present with recurrent hypersomnia that is sudden in onset. Sleep duration during these episodes can range from 12 to 24 hours a day. Prodrome can include a sudden overwhelming sense of lethargy.

Frank hypersomnia is noted in the first episodes, while heavy fatigue characterizes later episodes.

Seventy-five percent of patients had an alteration in their eating behaviors during episodes of KLS, with the majority experiencing megaphagia, preferring sweets. The increased food intake can include 6 to 8 meals a day and result in a  7 to 30 lb (3.2 to 13.6 kg) weight gain.

Compulsive behaviors and actions can also occur and have included inappropriate and compulsive singing, rocking one's body, chewing one's lips, and compulsive writing on the walls. Afflicted patients can endorse a sensation of derealization with feelings of detachment and strangeness.
