Direct compression of the pudendal nerve is often visible to the surgeon at the time of decompressive surgery. While repetitive actions such as sitting and cycling are primarily responsible, nerve compression may be congenital or the result of scarring after pelvic surgeries. Sports enthusiasts who regularly have significant and repetitive falls, such as skiers and snowboarders, may develop similar pelvic scarring due to frequent pelvic bruising and hematoma formation.
