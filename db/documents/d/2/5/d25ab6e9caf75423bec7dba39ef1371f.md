The Florida Board of Nursing is a regulatory body that ensures individuals are qualified to practice nursing in the State of Florida in several vital ways; i.e., licenses, disciplines, educates, monitors, and rehabilitates. Nurses are held to a minimal standard to ensure safe, competent care delivered to all patients in a variety of healthcare settings. Failure to maintain this minimum practice standard will result in forfeiture of licensure and result in the inability to practice nursing in the state. The Nurse Practice Act, enacted by the Florida Legislature, provides a framework for providing safe, professional nursing care and offers a layer of protection to the individuals seeking such care. Board rules must follow the laws enacted by the legislature and adopted in the Nurse Practice Act. This activity helps nursing professionals to become familiar with the Florida state nursing practice act set forth by law.
