Correction of hypotension is the primary concern through volume expansion with an intravenous infusion of normal saline. Excessive hypotension has been rarely seen in hypertensive patients but is a possible consequence of captopril use in salt/volume depleted persons. ACE inhibitors have rarely shown an association with a syndrome that begins with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and sometimes death.
