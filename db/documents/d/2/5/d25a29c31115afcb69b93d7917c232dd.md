# Continuing Education Activity

Glimepiride is a medication used in the management and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is in the sulfonylurea class of drugs. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, and contraindications for glimepiride as a valuable agent in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus. This activity will also highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., dosing, pharmacodynamics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for interprofessional healthcare team members managing patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of glimepiride.
- Describe the possible adverse effects of glimepiride.
- Review appropriate monitoring methods for patients on glimepiride, including management of complications of treatment.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team and patients to improve patient outcomes when receiving glimepiride therapy.

# Indications

Glimepiride is a second-generation sulfonylurea that received FDA approval in 1995 to use for the improvement of glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Glimepiride is sometimes referred to as a third-generation sulfonylurea as it has a better safety profile and has a prolonged duration of action of up to 24 hours.

# Mechanism of Action

Glimepiride is an insulin secretagogue and, like other sulfonylureas, is only effective in patients with residual pancreatic beta-cell activity. They act at ATP-dependent potassium channels on the cell membrane of pancreatic beta cells, causing iatrogenic depolarization by preventing potassium from exiting the cell. The depolarization activates voltage-dependent calcium channels on the cell membrane, leading to a rise in intracellular calcium and subsequent exocytosis of insulin into the bloodstream.

# Administration

The standard initial dose of glimepiride is between 1 and 2 mg once daily, taken orally before the patient's first meal. Patients who are prone to hypoglycemia should be started at 1 mg once daily and titrated slowly to an appropriate dose. Following initial therapy, the standard maintenance dosage is at 1 to 4 mg once daily; however, this can be gradually titrated up to 8 mg once daily, depending on the patient's blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels. It is important to note that current guidelines do not have a fixed dosage regimen for glimepiride, and the dose requires adjustment according to the patient's blood glucose levels and hemoglobin A1c.

When used for combination therapy with metformin, the clinician should attempt to identify the minimum effective dose of each drug as the risk of hypoglycemia increases with the use of metformin with glimepiride.

# Adverse Effects

Glimepiride, like other sulfonylureas, has multiple adverse effects, the most deadly and notorious being its metabolic effects. As glimepiride increases endogenous insulin secretion, this can lead to hypoglycemia. In patients with long-standing diabetes mellitus, hypoglycemic unawareness can manifest where the autonomic symptoms of hypoglycemia are not experienced by the patient, leading to neuroglycopenia symptoms and potential hypoglycemic coma. This situation is particularly dangerous in drivers or those involved in skilled tasks, especially if other hypoglycemic agents are in concomitant use. Weight gain is another significant side effect of sulfonylureas such as glimepiride, which can interfere with management as weight loss is often a major target in the treatment of diabetes. Other adverse effects include vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, erythema multiforme, and exfoliative dermatitis.

# Contraindications

Contraindications for glimepiride include the following patient groups and conditions:

- Diabetic ketoacidosis

- Type I diabetes mellitus

- Hypersensitivity to glimepiride

# Monitoring

Monitoring methods for glimepiride include frequent self-glucose monitoring and hemoglobin A1c monitoring every 3 to 6 months. In those with renal pathology, monitoring of glomerular filtration rate may be recommended as glimepiride is primarily excreted via the kidneys.

# Toxicity

In cases of overdose of sulfonylureas such as glimepiride, hypoglycemia can occur. It is essential to recognize the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, which can fall into the following two categories:

- Autonomic symptoms such as tremor, palpitations, nausea, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and anxiety

- Neuroglycopenic symptoms such as confusion, fatigue, headache, drowsiness, coma, and seizures.

Rapid recognition and reversal of hypoglycemia are essential in improving prognosis in those that have overdosed on glimepiride.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Managing type 2 diabetes mellitus involves an interprofessional healthcare team approach involving various healthcare team members, including but not limited to the endocrinologist, family/primary care clinician (MDs, DOs, PAs, NPs), diabetes specialist nurse, podiatrist, and pharmacist. Its management involves the utilization of drugs that control blood glucose, which include glimepiride. Glimepiride is a second-line, FDA-approved drug to be used either in combination with metformin or as a monotherapy. Sulfonylureas augment and increase insulin release from the pancreas and, although effective, poses a threat to patient safety if used inappropriately. Sufficient communication is essential in delivering optimal care to patients, including providing information in aspects such as time and frequency of administration and associated sick day rules. Through a coordinated interprofessional team effort, diabetes management, including the use of glimepiride, can achieve better patient outcomes and limit the potential for therapeutic failure or adverse events.
