Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease is a rare renal disorder caused by variable mutations in different genes. As discussed previously, at least five different gene mutations have been observed to result in this group of disorders. An autosomal dominant inheritance pattern inherits this disorder. MUC1 gene encodes a mucin-1 protein, UMOD gene encodes uromodulin protein (previously known as Tamm-Horsfall protein), HNF1B gene encodes hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 beta, REN gene encodes renin, and SEC61A1 gene encodes translocon subunit SEC61A.
