The lacrimal drainage structures form during the fifth week of gestation as a crease between the frontons and maxillary processes, known as the nasolacrimal groove or naso-optic fissure 10**.**A cord of ectodermal tissues separates from the surface and enters this groove. This tissue eventually canalizes and forms the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct. This process of canalization usually begins by week 8 and is completed by birth. Tears are produced by the main and accessory lacrimal glands and drain medially into the puncta, then flow through the canaliculi to the lacrimal sac, and then through the nasolacrimal duct into the nose. Incomplete canalization is the most common cause of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) and occurs at the distal end resulting in an imperforate membrane at the valve of Hasner.
