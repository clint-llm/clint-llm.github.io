The dentate nucleus is the largest deep cerebellar cluster of neurons; it has a dentated – serrated – edge. Efferent fibers of the dentate nucleus are involved in the modulation of motor neurons and neurons involved in conscious thought and visuospatial function. Disruption of the dentate nucleus is typically associated with cerebellar ataxia.
