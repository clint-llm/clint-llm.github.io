Understanding stages of weight loss is vital for both healthcare providers and patients themselves. It can be easy to become frustrated throughout the process and fail to reach one's goals, particularly through a weight loss plateau period. Unfortunately, research has no clear indication of how long this period can last, ranging from weeks to even months.

Many challenges can occur during this process, including hormonal changes and psychological impact. Interprofessional teams, including a physician, a dietitian, and a psychologist, can be very beneficial to understand the process better and educate patients through their journey. Although it may be recognized that these specialists may be able to assist, research has shown that this does not occur often enough. A study was conducted showing challenges in interprofessional availability, the number of referrals, role perception, and messaging.

Studies have shown that an interprofessional approach can be effective in weight loss. However, there is no "one-size-fits-all" approach.
