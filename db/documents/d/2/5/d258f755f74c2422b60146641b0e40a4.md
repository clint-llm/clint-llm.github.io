All patients with EE should be admitted to the hospital, and close monitoring of systemic and ocular parameters is mandated in these cases. Patients requiring intravitreal injections should be evaluated daily for improvement in clinical picture and need for further injections. In case of worsening EE, the surgeon's discretion makes a decision for pars plana vitrectomy. Post vitrectomy, the patient should be started on topical steroids prednisolone 1% or dexamethasone 0.1% in tapering doses 8/7/6/5/4/3/2/1 every week, 5% homatropine two times per day,  topical 0.5% timolol two times per day, and oral antibiotics and anti-inflammatory.  The patient should be followed up closely to assess the clinical picture and rule out any complications.
