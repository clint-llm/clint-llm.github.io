VEEV is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA alphavirus in the Togaviridae family.

There are six subtypes (I-VI) and many antigenic variants within each subtype. The epizootic strains IAB and IC are responsible for causing encephalitis in equines and humans. These subtypes of VEE are highly pathogenic and can spread quickly through equine populations. Horses are the key reservoir species and amplification hosts for epizootic viral strains.

The enzootic strains (ID, IE, subtypes II-VI) are usually avirulent in horses and produce mild or no equine illness. However, these strains may still cause significant disease in humans. Enzootic strains are typically found circulating in rodents. Spillover from these enzootic transmission cycles between rodents and mosquitos may lead to human epidemics. There appears to be no clinical difference in disease caused by epizootic and enzootic strains of VEEV in humans.
