Nurses are vital to the functionality of the health care system and play a crucial role in assisting the patient and the family to not only achieve but also to maintain functional well-being.

**Definition of Nursing**

The definition of nursing involves many aspects that include but are not limited to providing quality, safe patient care, protecting the patient and family, and creating an avenue for optimizing resources for all individuals. These principles build health equality for the patient, the family, and the community based on established evidence-based practice.

**Nurse-Client Relationship**

The nurse-client relationship is rooted in trust and advocacy. Because of that trust and advocacy, multiple survey groups, including a 2018 study by Figuera et al., have noted that nurses are rated as one of the most trusted professions. Milton also noted in a 2018 report that nursing is frequently referred to as the most trusted profession. These high caregiving standards do not come without challenges for the nursing profession.
