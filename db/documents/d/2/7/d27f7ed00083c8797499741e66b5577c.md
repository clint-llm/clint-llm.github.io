It is critically important to distinguish cerebral salt wasting (CSW) from the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) as the treatments are opposite. Evaluation for cerebral salt wasting begins with a basic metabolic panel (BMP) to identify the hyponatremia (serum sodium less than 135 meq/L). Urine studies are commonly checked for urine sodium and osmolality. Urine sodium is typically elevated above 40 meq/L. Urine osmolality is elevated above 100 mosmol/kg. The patient must also have signs or symptoms of hypovolemia such as hypotension, decreased central venous pressure, lack of skin turgor, or elevated hematocrit.

Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic of hormone (SIADH) will have a similar laboratory picture as cerebral salt wasting with hyponatremia and increased urine sodium. However, with SIADH, the patient is euvolemic to hypervolemic from the retained free water as compared to the hypovolemic picture of cerebral salt wasting.

Other potential causes of hyponatremia should also be sought including polydipsia, renal disease, use of diuretics, heart failure, hypothyroidism, heart failure, malignancies, hormone deficiency, and pseudohyponatremia. Many times cerebral salt wasting becomes a diagnosis of exclusion after labs reveal serum hyponatremia with increased urine sodium levels.
