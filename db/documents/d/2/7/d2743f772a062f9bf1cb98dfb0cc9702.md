Patau syndrome requires an interprofessional team approach. Parents of patients diagnosed with this devastating disease should be provided with education and support regarding all of the possible complications the infant may be born with. For the delivery, the team would include maternal-fetal medicine specialists, neonatologists, neonatal intensive care nurses, and respiratory therapists. If aggressive medical therapy is to be pursued, otolaryngologists, cardiologists, neurologists, urologists, and orthopedic surgeons would need to collaborate for the best possible outcomes. Physical and occupational therapists may be needed as well as speech therapists and audiologists. As the psychological toll on the families of patients with Patau syndrome is extensive, mental health specialists should be utilized as soon as the diagnosis is made.
