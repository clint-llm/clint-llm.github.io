Image acquisition is performed using the gamma camera in the left anterior oblique, anterior, and lateral views, as described above. Images acquired will show the blood pool in the ventricles at various points in the cardiac cycle. These blood pool changes over segments of the cardiac cycle can be used to assess the left ventricle EF and the diastolic function of the heart. As the blood is tagged with a tracer, it will appear bright on the image, while areas where no blood is pooling, such as the heart walls, will appear dark. With a determination of left ventricle EF, providers can make appropriate decisions on patient care, including whether to initiate potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy or not.
