Point-of-Care Testing (POCT) is clinical laboratory testing conducted close to the site of patient care where care or treatment is provided.

Traditional laboratory testing typically involves a multiple-step process that includes collecting samples from the patient at the bedside or the clinic, transporting them to a centralized laboratory (often located far away), and then subjecting the samples to several processing steps.

The concept of on-site or near-patient testing for blood analysis was initially explored in England during the 1950s and was referred to as "near-patient testing."

Technological advances, including the miniaturization of electronics and improved instrumentation, haveÂ facilitated the development of increasingly smaller and more accurate POCT devices.

The following features of POCT are ubiquitous:

- POCT should be simple to use.

- Reagents and consumables should have durable resistance during storage and use.

- POCT results should align with established laboratory methods.

- POCT should ensure safety during testing.

Various guidelines, such as the ASSURED Guidelines by the World Health Organization (WHO), exist for specific subsets of POCT, such as sexually transmitted infections (STI).

The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry (NACB) has developed evidence-based guidelines for POCT, providing grading and recommendations to optimize the use of POCT based on scientific research and clinical evidence.

POCT guidelines generally emphasize the rapid results and cost-effectiveness of POCT, along with the importance of high sensitivities and specificities to support informed clinical decision-making.
