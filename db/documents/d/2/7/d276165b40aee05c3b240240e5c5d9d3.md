Treatment of primary coronary lesions varies with type:

- **Saphenous vein graft stenosis**- Saphenous venous grafts have accelerated rates of degenerationÂ when compared to native coronary arteries.

- **Bifurcation lesions**- Many studies have shown the superiority of DES over BMS. DES specifically have demonstrated decreased rates of restenosis.

- **Chronic total occlusions (CTO)**- These lesions continue to be the most challenging lesions to treat. It is uncertain what the optimal approach is to address these lesions. The DECISION-CTO trial showed noninferiority of medical therapy compared to medical therapy with PCI concerning death, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and the need for repeat revascularization.

- **Left Main Coronary Artery (LMCA) stenosis-**These critical lesions have high mortality given that the LMCA supplies the majority of the myocardium. In individuals with stable angina, CABG has been the standard of care in these individuals with unprotected LMCA stenosis. The 2013 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines did highlight the role of PCI in individuals with a low (less than 22) Syntax score.
