There are a number of microneedling devices employed in medical and aesthetic offices. The most commonly used instruments, however, are fixed, needle rollers and electronically-powered pens with disposable tips.

The size of the needles should be selected appropriately based on both the treatment indication as well as the treatment location. For treatment of scars, for instance, longer needle lengths of 1.5-2.0mm may be used. For treatment of aging skin and rhytides, however, smaller needle lengths of 0.5-1.0mm are generally recommended.

Other variations in microneedling devices include:

- Fractional radiofrequency microneedling

- Home-care rollers (needles of about 0.1 mm in length) are used for transcutaneous delivery of anti-aging agents

- Devices combining microneedlingÂ and vacuum-assisted infusion

- LED microneedling rollers
