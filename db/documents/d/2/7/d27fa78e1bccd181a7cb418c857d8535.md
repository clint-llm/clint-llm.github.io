Many diseases and conditions list pain as a component of their presentation; as a result, pain management is of great importance to clinicians and patients alike. Acetaminophen (APAP - also known as paracetamol in many countries) is a non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic agent used to treat pain and fever. It is used as a single agent for mild to moderate pain and combined with an opioid analgesic for severe pain. This activity outlines the use, dosing, indications, contraindications, toxicity, and toxicity management of acetaminophen and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients who take acetaminophen.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for acetaminophen use.
- Describe the potential toxicity of acetaminophen.
- Explain how to monitor for acetaminophen toxicity. 
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination so that acetaminophen therapy is optimized as a useful tool to improve patient outcomes in pain management.
