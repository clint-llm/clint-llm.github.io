Primary cutaneous lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of T- and B-cell neoplastic entities impacting millions of individuals worldwide annually. In 2018, the World Health Organization updated the diagnostic criteria for the various subtypes of this group of tumors to assist dermatologists and pathologists in classifying them. Cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (CBCLs) are often distinguished clinically by their indolent behavior. Prominent dermal B cell infiltrates are often present, which is remarkable because B cell collections are not typically found in normal skin and are rarely observed in reactive conditions or other types of CL. The following activity outlines the evaluation of these tumors and highlights many pathologic underpinnings when managing patients with primary cutaneous lymphomas.

**Objectives:**
- Identify all subtypes of cutaneous T- and B-cell lymphomas according to updated World Health Organization guidelines.
- Summarize general histopathologic features of cutaneous T- and B-cell lymphomas.
- Outline immunophenotypic and molecular findings of cutaneous lymphomas.
- Review pertinent clinicopathologic findings associated with different cutaneous T- and B-cell lymphomas.
