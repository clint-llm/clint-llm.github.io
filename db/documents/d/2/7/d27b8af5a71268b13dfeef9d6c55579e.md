Dyspnea, also called shortness of breath, is a patient's perceived difficulty to breathe. Sensations and intensity can vary and are subjective. It is a prevalent symptom impacting millions of people. It may be the primary manifestation of respiratory, cardiac, neuromuscular, psychogenic, or systemic illnesses, or a combination of these. Dyspnea on exertion is a similar sensation; however, this shortness of breath is present with exercise and improves with rest. This activity reviews the etiology, evaluation, and management of exertional dyspnea and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with exertional dyspnea.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the various potential etiologies of dyspnea on exertion.
- Describe the pathophysiology of dyspnea on exertion in cases where it represents a physiological problem.
- Summarize the management of patients with dyspnea on exertion based on the etiology.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in prompt diagnosis of exertional dyspnea and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
