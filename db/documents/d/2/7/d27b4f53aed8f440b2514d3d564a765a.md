Rhytidectomies, even less invasive varieties such as SMAS plication facelifts, are among the more extensive cosmetic procedures performed within the head and neck and require a skilled team to ensure successful outcomes. The operating surgeon must carefully evaluate individual patients' candidacy preoperatively and counsel them to generate reasonable expectations that will maximize both patient and surgeon satisfaction with the results of the procedure. Some patients may not be suitable surgical candidates, and other non-invasive procedures, such as skin resurfacing or injectable treatments, may be more appropriate.

A thorough discussion of the complication risks before surgery is essential. Ensuring patients have access to nurses throughout the perioperative period to answer questions and provide guidance regarding self-care will smooth the recovery process. A medical photographer for pre- and postoperative photo-documentation is also important, and many patients will benefit from visiting an aesthetician after recovery is complete. While most facelift complications are uncommon and not life-threatening, an interprofessional operating room team experienced in rhytidectomy will facilitate the procedures and minimize complications.
