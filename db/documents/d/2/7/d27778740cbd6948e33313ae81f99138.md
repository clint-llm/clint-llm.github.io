Minimal change disease (MCD) is one of the most common causes of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children. In the past, MCD was given the labels "nil disease" or "lipoid nephrosis."In adults, MCD closely resembles. Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) under light microscopy. However, electron microscopy demonstrates abnormalities in podocyte or glomerular epithelial cells in both MCD and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).

**Objectives:**
