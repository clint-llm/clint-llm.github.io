Due to its low molecular weight, myoglobin is released quickly following muscle injury; it is the earliest marker of myocardial infarction and rhabdomyolysis.

Myoglobinuria in adults is most often encountered in cases of alcohol and drug abuse or trauma; muscle necrosis with subsequent myoglobin release also commonly occurs due to prolonged immobilization or pressure from the weight of the body.

Contrastingly, rhabdomyolysis or myoglobinuria in children is often associated with viral myositis, trauma, excessive muscular exertion, drug overdose, seizures, connective tissueÂ disease, or metabolic disorders.

The incidence of myoglobinuria in the United States varies depending on the incidence of traumas or natural disasters. An increased incidence of viral myositis, such as that caused by a regional epidemic, may cause a temporary increase in the incidence of rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria.
