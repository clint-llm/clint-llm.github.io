About 25% of patients with NF develop complications like plexiform neurofibromas, spinal neurofibromas, malignancies like neurofibrosarcoma and embryonic childhood tumors, scoliosis, aqueductal stenosis, pheochromocytoma, vascular dysplasia, congenital bone defects, tumors of the central nervous system, learning disabilities, attention deficits, and behavioral problems.

Ophthalmological complications are optic gliomas, plexiform neurofibromas, and congenital glaucomas. The overall risk of malignancy in patients with NF1 is 5% to 15% greater when compared to the general population.********Plexiform neurofibromas are a frequent complication of NF1 and may lead to the site of development of malignant nerve sheath tumors. The most commonly affected regions are the paraspinal, sacral plexus, sciatic notch, and perirectal regions. Optic nerve gliomas can result in vision loss and even morbidity in young children. Symptomatic gliomas usually manifest before 6 yrs of age with loss of visual acuity or proptosis. Diagnosis of this entity will be challenging in preverbal children, and hence screening in early childhood is crucial to early detection and intervention.
