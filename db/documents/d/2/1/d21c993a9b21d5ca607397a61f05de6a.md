Absent STS activity in the epidermis causes retention hyperkeratosis. STS hydrolyzes steroid sulfates to their unconjugated (unsulfated) forms and participates in the regulation of barrier permeability and desquamation. The absence of STS activity results in the accumulation of cholesterol sulfate in the stratum corneum, leading to corneocyte cohesion, hyperkeratosis, and impaired skin permeability. A deficiency or absence of STS may be associated with asymptomatic corneal opacities and rarely cryptorchidism. Abnormalities in neurologic and cognitive development and/or anosmia have been described when the deletion encompasses more than one gene (contiguous gene syndrome).
