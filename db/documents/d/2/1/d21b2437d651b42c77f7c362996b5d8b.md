Absolute contraindications to the triple arthrodesis include the presence of an active infection, acute Charcot arthropathy, arterial insufficiency, and others. Acute Charcot arthropathy can be determined via physical exam with possible bounding pedal pulses, increased lower extremity temperature, localized edema, and loss of protective sensation. Additionally, a positive history of neuropathy, radiographs showing disorganized osteolysis and lab markers such as increased ESR increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. Relative contraindications include uncontrolled comorbidities, presence of ankle arthritis, lack of trial of conservative therapy, and others. As with any procedure, careful patient selection and management of post-operative goals must take place to achieve an optimal outcome.
