Given the non-specific presentations of acute hepatic porphyrias and their relatively low occurrence, patients may initially be suspected to have other, unrelated conditions. The major considerations in the differential diagnosis are other causes of abdominal pain; other causes of neuropathy, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or seizures; other causes of liver disease/abnormal liver function tests; and other porphyrias. Like acute hepatic porphyrias, these conditions can also present with nonspecific symptoms. For example, the polyneuropathy of acute porphyria may be misidentified as Guillain-Barr√© syndrome. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings can resemble those in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which points to the potentially substantial effects of acute porphyria on the central nervous system.
