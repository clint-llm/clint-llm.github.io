As stated previously, the etiology for hypokalemia is evident from the patient’s history. On the rare occasion that the etiology is uncertain, then diagnostic evaluation should ensue. Diagnostic evaluation involves assessment of urinary potassium excretion and assessment of acid-base status. Assessment of urinary potassium excretion can help distinguish renal losses from other causes of hypokalemia. Measurement of potassium excretion is ideally done via a 24-hour urine collection.  Excretion of more than 30 mEq of potassium per day indicates inappropriate renal potassium loss. Alternative methods for measurement include a spot urine potassium concentration or urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio. A urine potassium concentration of greater than 15 mmol/L or a ratio greater than 13 mEq/mmol of creatinine, respectively, also indicates inappropriate renal potassium loss. After determining the presence or lack of renal potassium wasting, assessment of acid-base status should then be determined. The existence of metabolic acidosis or alkalosis with or without renal potassium wasting can further narrow the differential diagnosis. Aside from diagnostic evaluation, assessment of serum magnesium level, muscle strength, and electrocardiographic changes is warranted as the latter two would warrant immediate intervention.
