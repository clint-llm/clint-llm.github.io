Zinc is a trace mineral, second only to iron in its concentration in the body. Adult humans contain 2 to 3 grams of zinc, but it is difficult to measure an individual's zinc status, particularly during acute illness.

While severe zinc deficiency is a rare occurrence in developed nations, mild or moderate deficiency may be common. Severe zinc deficiencies are most common in the developing world. Zinc deficiency is the fifth leading cause of loss of healthy life years in developing countries.

Zinc deficiency results in rapid and marked atrophy of the thymus, lymphopenia, and reduced primary and secondary antibody responses.

Zinc transporters, such as ZIP4, have been shown to have an essential role in cancer development and proliferation.

In sepsis patients, zinc gets redistributed from the serum into the liver, and several studies point to a correlation between zinc and sepsis outcomes.
