Once the virus infects the host, there is an incubation period of 2 to 21 days. From the onset of symptoms, death can occur very quickly, often within six days.

On a molecular level, the presence of the virus in the blood causes the direct release of cytokines, which activates acute phase reactants causing cell damage. The hemorrhagic aspect is more complex and involves disruption of the coagulation cascade through platelet aggregation, which sequesters platelets causing increased clots and clotting simultaneously, respectively.

The virus replicates after it penetrates the host cell membrane by binding with glycoproteins spikes and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the virus releases its nucleocapsid into the host cell cytoplasm, where it replicates. Transcription and translation of the viral RNA into viral proteins is initiated by VP30 activating the start gene. Phosphorylation of VP30 by transcribed viral proteins turns of VP30, in this, VP30 seems to be a regulatory protein, and pharmaceutical research is underway to specifically target VP30.
