Complications from the testing process are very rare.  Because testing requires obtaining a blood sample, complications are usually related to pain and bruising at the site of needle insertion and on extremely rare occasions, infection.  In the case of an intravenous blood sample, thrombophlebitis may occur as may persistent bleeding at the site, though these are extremely uncommon.
