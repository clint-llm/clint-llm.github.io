The following table summarizes the investigative approaches for IRIS based on the suspected micro-organism.

**Micro-organism suspected as the source of IRIS:**

**Investigations:**

Mycobacterium tuberculosis









- Chest X-ray might show new infiltrates or cavitary lesions, or new pleural effusion.

- Elevated inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C- reactive protein (CRP).

- Fine needle aspiration of tender lymphadenopathy reveal abscess, but usually are "cold abscesses" that do not grow any mycobacteria or bacilli in AFB staining.

- Tuberculin test might initially be negative but later can become positive.

Mycobacterium avium complex





- Fine needle aspiration of enlarged and tender lymph nodes can reveal well-formed granulomas with relatively few visible organisms.

Cryptococcus neoformans







-  X rays might show new cavitation disease in case of pre-existing cryptococcal lung infection.

-  In the case of CNS disease (meningoencephalitis), lumbar puncture before initiation of anti-fungal agents typically reveal elevated opening pressures, elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) WBC count with lymphocytic predominance, and an elevated CSF protein with normal glucose level.

Pneumocystis jirovecii







- Chest X-ray usually shows bilateral interstitial infiltrates.

- Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage can be used for fluorescent antibody testing or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm the diagnosis.

- Other laboratory findings can be elevated LDH and Beta-D-glucan, both of which are nonspecific for Pneumocystis infections.

Cytomegalovirus







- In the case of immune recovery uveitis (IRU), a fundoscopic examination can reveal a severe inflammatory of the retina along with necrosis.

JC virus





- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can reveal white matter lesions generally without mass effect.

-  Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid using PCR for JCV DNA.

-  Brain biopsy with PCR

Herpes zoster





- Clinically diagnosed with skin lesions in a dermatomal distribution.

Hepatitis B and C viruses















- After recovery of immune function, serological tests for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C virus can reveal one or more of the following:

1. Increased titer of protective antibodies (e.g., hepatitis B core antibody and hepatitis B e antibodies).

2. Seroconversion from a previous negative antibody test to a positive test (e.g., detection of HCV antibody).

3. And/or clearance of viral antigen (e.g., undetectable HCV viral load in PCR).

- A liver biopsy can reveal necrosis and inflammation with predominant CD8+ T cells.



Kaposi sarcoma



Clinical diagnosis is based on skin and mucosal manifestations of lesions.

**Approaches to prevent IRIS in HIV patients:**

- Presence of latent or subacute infections with high antigen burden has been associated with the onset and severity of the IRIS. Thus, screening for latent infections, e.g., TB screening with PPD test/Interferon-gamma test, cryptococcal antigen screening for latent cryptococcal infections, should be done in every patient before starting the HAART.

- Patients who are at high risk of having severe IRIS, e.g., HIV patients with a known Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, can be started on steroids empirically before or during the initiation of HAART to minimize the risk and severity of IRIS.
