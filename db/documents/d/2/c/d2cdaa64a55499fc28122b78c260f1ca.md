This activity reviews the Jackson cross cylinder as an instrument of refraction. It also describes the condition of astigmatism, its causes, and optical principles. The procedures and techniques involved in refining the cylinder powers and axes during refraction using the Jackson cross cylinder are considered. The conoid-of-Sturm and its importance to subjective refraction are also explained. This activity highlights the Jackson crossed-cylinder and touches on the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with astigmatism.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the history of the Jackson cross cylinder.
- Explain the optical principle of the conoid of Sturm.
- Identify the different types of astigmatism.
- Review the process of refining the cylinders obtained in refraction using the Jackon cross cylinder.
