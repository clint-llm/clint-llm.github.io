There are multiple ways for the urinary tract to become colonized or infected with bacteria. Typical patients who often colonize the urine are those older than 65 years of age or who have one of the following: chronic indwelling urinary catheters, neurogenic bladders, or a urinary stoma. Postmenopausal women may be at higher risk for colonization due to a loss of an acidic vaginal pH. Some individuals can begin colonizing with bacteria within 48 hours of urinary catheter placement. Common bacteria and fungi colonizers include Escherichia coli, Enterococcus species, and Candida species. Colonized patients may be asymptomatic, but some patients will become symptomatic due to an infection that must be treated. Women are more likely than men to develop UTIs as a result of their anatomy. E. coli is the most common pathogen associated with UTIs.
