The most common indication for placement of a nasogastric tube is to decompress the stomach in the setting of distal obstruction. Small bowel obstruction from adhesions or hernias, ileus, obstructing neoplasms, volvulus, intussusception, and many other causes may block the normal passage of bodily fluids such as salivary, gastric, hepatobiliary, and enteric secretions.

Less commonly, nasogastric tubes can be placed to administer medications or nutrition in patients who have a functional gastrointestinal tract but are unable to tolerate oral intake. This is most common in patients who have suffered a stroke or other malady, which has left them unable to swallow effectively.

NG tubes have been used for various reasons in patients with GI bleeding. In the past, NG lavage was thought to help control GI bleeding. However, recent studies have shown that this is not helpful.
