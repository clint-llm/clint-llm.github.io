The anterior iliac crest region and greater trochanter of the femur have, in most patients, minimal overlying fatty tissue. Thus these areas are more susceptible to injury from direct trauma.

The primary etiology is a direct blow to the iliac crest or greater trochanter during contact sports.Â American football and hockey are the most common sports that result in these injuries.
