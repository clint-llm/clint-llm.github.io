As above, patients with valvular disease should be evaluated at a minimum with a history and physical, chest x-ray, and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with both 2-D and doppler capabilities. Adjunctive modalities such as a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), computed tomography angiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and cardiac catheterization may be employed based on clinical suspicion.
