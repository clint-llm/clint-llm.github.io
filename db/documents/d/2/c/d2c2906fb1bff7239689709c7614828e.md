Autologous fat grafting intended for facial rejuvenation restores volume to the face and can also revitalize skin by improving tone and texture. While fat grafting is primarily used for elective cosmetic purposes, it is also an important minimally-invasive modality employed for several reconstructive indications.

The age-related changes in the face that can be addressed with autologous fat grafting include:

- Forehead hollowing

- Deep rhytides, particularly forehead and glabellar

- Temporal hollowing

- Supraorbital hollowing

- Increased vertical length of the lower lid

- Tear trough deformity and/or deep nasojugal groove

- Malar bags

- Nasolabial folds

- Marionette lines

- Jowls or poor jawline contour

- Thin lips

- Retruded chin

Besides treating the aging face, autologous fat grafting helps address several other problems and can be performed alone or in conjunction with facial rejuvenation.

- Nasal contour irregularities

- Scars

- Burns

- Radiation dermatitis

- Human immunodeficiency virus-associated lipodystrophy

- Facial deformities (congenital, acquired, or traumatic)

- Facial asymmetry

- Flap augmentation
