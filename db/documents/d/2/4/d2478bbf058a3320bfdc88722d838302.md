The remarkable clinical improvement usually noted after plasma exchange strongly supports the idea that autoantibodies cause this condition. Although the combination of CASPR2 and LGI1 antibodies could explain many aspects of the clinical phenotype, the entire clinical picture is not wholly defined by antibodies against CASPR2 and LGI1 alone. It is possible that some antibodies directed against other VGKC-complex proteins exist which would help to explain the multifocal localization of the phenotype.

Further studies to precisely determine all such antibodies besides anti CASPR2, LGI1, and Contactin2, their triggers, their binding sites, and their molecular targets are needed. Whether serum antibodies affect CNS directly or indirectly via altering some neurohormones is also not clear and requires further investigation. Indeed it is an autoimmune phenomenon, however, what triggers the autoimmune phenomenon is unclear in most cases. The possibility of other serum factors besides autoantibodies or a primary occult malignancy manifesting its paraneoplastic features prematurely also are not eliminated.
