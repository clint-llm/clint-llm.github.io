For cardiovascular disease, modifiable risk factor prevention is important, which includes the following:

- Hypertension

- Hyperlipidemia

- Overweight and obesity

- Glucose intolerance and diabetes

- Smoking tobacco use.

Non-modifiable risk factors include male sex, certain races (Asian, African American), increased age, and family history of early CVD. After CVD is identified, the management involves a multifactorial approach to reducing the risk of further complications and mortality.

For diabetes, the most important preventative aspect is identifying the population at increased risk of developing diabetes based on weight, family history, presence of pre-diabetes, typical symptoms, and history of gestational diabetes. Early and frequent screening remains the most important factor for diabetes management. It is important to remember that 90% of adults (18+) with newly diagnosed diabetes are either overweight or obese.
