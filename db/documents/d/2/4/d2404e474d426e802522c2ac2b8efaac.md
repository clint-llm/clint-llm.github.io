Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a procedure that originated as an innovative treatment for achalasia. It targets the inner circular layers of smooth muscle responsible for lower esophageal sphincter (LES) contraction. A submucosal tunnel is first created to reach the inner circular muscle bundles. This layer then gets removed, and the outer longitudinal muscle bundles are preserved. The surgery has now expanded to include gastric POEM (G-POEM) and rectal endoscopic myotomy, which surgeons use to treat gastroparesis and Hirschsprung disease, respectively.
