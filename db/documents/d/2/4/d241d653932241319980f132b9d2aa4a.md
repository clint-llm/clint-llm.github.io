Erector spinae plane block is a relatively novel approach to pain management for a variety of surgical procedures, as well as for acute and chronic pain. It is performed as a single injection block, or a catheter is placed for continued relief, and the procedure is most often performed with ultrasound guidance. As the erector spinae plane block is a relatively new procedure, the vast majority of information about the block is from case reports and anecdotal experience. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, potential complications, personnel required, and technique to perform the block in a clinical setting while highlighting the role of an interprofessional team in managing the care of patients who will receive or who have received this block.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for erector spinae plane block.
- Describe the patient anatomy and technique for an erector spinae plane block.
- Outline the potential complications of an erector spinae plane block.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team when preparing for and performing an erector spinae plane block to enhance patient safety and satisfaction.
