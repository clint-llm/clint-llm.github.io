The limb buds exit from the ventrolateral surface of the body wall. The gems contain the mesenchyme of somatopleural, covered by an apical ectodermal crest. The cells of the hypomere (ventral part of the myotome of a somite) migrate from the somite inside the buds to form the muscle cells. The connective tissue of the limbs derives from the mesenchyme of the somatopleural. This happens around the fifth week of gestation. The gems rotate about 90 degrees medially, along with a longitudinal axis. This movement of the knee area will be located in the front portion.
