The foramen spinosum is a small circular foramen present posterolateral to the foramen ovale in the greater wing of the sphenoid. The greater wing of the sphenoid is a bony projection arising from both sides of the sphenoid body forming a part of the floor of the middle cranial fossa. Jakob Benignus Winslow coined the term foramen spinosum because of the foramen's location in the spinous process of the greater wing of the sphenoid.
