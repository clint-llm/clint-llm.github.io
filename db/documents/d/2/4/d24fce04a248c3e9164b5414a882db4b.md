The TIMI risk score was found to be predictive of the severity of the vascular disease, making it a powerful tool to predict the potential blood vessels of coronary circulation that could be involved.

A sub-study of PRISM-PLUS compared TIMI risk scores to findings on coronary angiography. The study found that patients who had a risk score of 5 to 7 were significantly more likely to have severe culprit stenosis, multivessel disease, left main coronary artery disease, or visible thrombus compared to those who were in the low-risk score category.

Studies have also noted that of the seven factors that contribute to the TIMI risk score, history of coronary artery disease, age greater than or equal to 65, and deviations in ST-segment on initial EKG’s were more strongly associated with adverse cardiac events as compared to the other factors.

Recent studies have also shown that the amplitude of ST-segment elevation or depression and the degree of cardiac biomarker elevation (troponin T/I) can both be independent factors that could point toward initiating early invasive cardiac procedures.
