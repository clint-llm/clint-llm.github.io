The pathophysiology of the prerenal disease is multifold. To understand the causes, it is crucial to know the concept that renal perfusion and GFR have a direct correlation. Whenever there is hypotension or poor systemic perfusion, baroreceptors in arteries and receptors in the heart recognize these changes. In response, they increase the sympathetic tone. The decreased perfusion sensed by the afferent arterioles leads to an increase in renin secretion and antidiuretic hormone secretion. The afferent arteriole can maintain adequate perfusion until the systolic blood pressure drops below 80 mmHg.

Renin is a protein enzyme released by the juxtaglomerular cells that are present in the afferent arteriolar wall, which works by converting angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2. Angiotensin 2 then increases aldosterone synthesis, causes vasoconstriction, and sympathetic nervous system stimulation. Additionally, when there is a mild to moderate decrease in cardiac output, angiotensin 2 works on the efferent arteriole to maintain the filtration fraction. If under these circumstances, the intravascular volume or cardiac output decreases further, then an additional increase in angiotensin 2 will cause constriction of the afferent arteriole and a subsequent decrease in GFR.

The combined effect of these processes preserves blood flow to the heart and brain, but in turn, it leads to vasoconstriction of the renal, splanchnic, and mucocutaneous circulations. The renal vasoconstriction, as mentioned earlier, leads to a decrease in GFR. In contrast, if these compensatory mechanisms are ineffective in certain patients, the persistent decline in cardiac output, or arterial pressures will also lead to a decrease in GFR. Renal perfusion can also be compromised in conditions that lead to edema/anasarca. In this case, renal perfusion decreases as splanchnic and cardiac dysfunction lead to venous pooling of blood.
