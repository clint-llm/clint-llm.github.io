The bicuspid aortic valve is commonly encountered in clinical practice by the primary care provider, internist, and nurse practitioner. The key is to refer the patient to the cardiologist to determine the severity of the valve disorder, the presence of symptoms, and the age of the patient. The treatment options in children include balloon valvoplasty or observation. In adults, the only treatment for symptomatic patients is valve replacement. The prognosis for most patients after valve replacement is good. After valvoplasty, recurrence of symptoms is common.
