Both radiographs and MRI aid in the diagnosis of osteitis pubis. In the early stage, plain radiographsÂ might appear normal.

MRI has become the imaging modality of choice.

In patients diagnosed with cam-type FAI with symptoms greater than 3 months, Akgun et al. demonstrated a 45.56% prevalence of osteitis pubis on MRI findings compared to 5.86% in control subjects.
