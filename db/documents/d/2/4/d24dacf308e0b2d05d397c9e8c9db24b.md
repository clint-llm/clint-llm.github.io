Chronic pain of the wrist can range from posttraumatic to degenerative causes for which the non-operative treatments are preferred, but when despite this approach the pain becomes disabling and the function of the wrist is compromised or deteriorated a surgical managed could be considered. Some surgical options include arthroscopic wrist procedures, arthrodesis, denervation. Arthrodesis, which is a fusion of two adjacent bones to immobilize a joint, and resection are considered salvage procedures

An alternative to those salvage procedures is wrist denervation, its concept is not new but the application of this technique has had several modifications and this looks like a promising procedure for palliative care
