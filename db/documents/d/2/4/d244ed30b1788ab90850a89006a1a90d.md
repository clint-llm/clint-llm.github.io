Prerenal kidney failureÂ is a preventable, and reversible disease entity, which should receive prompt recognition with early intervention. Prevention starts from the outpatient and continues into hospital-based care as well. The underlying cause of prerenal kidney failure is hypovolemia or poor perfusion. Care must be taken to understand patients who are at high risk. Providers should also be aware of the medications, which pose the highest risk for nephrotoxicity. Whenever unsure, physicians should consult a pharmacist to see how specific drug interactions can affect renal function. Also, dose adjustment of current medications should be made in conjunction with a pharmacist.

In patients with undifferentiated AKI, or in those whose prerenal AKI is worsening, prompt referral to a nephrologist may be warranted. In the inpatient setting, once prerenal AKI is diagnosed, the treating physician must try to identify the underlying cause of the injury. During admission, nurses play a vital role in measurements of daily weights and accurate assessments of urine output. Physicians should work closely with their nurses and stress the importance of these assessments.

Furthermore, if CT imaging is required, CT technicians and radiologists should question the utility and need for contrast based studies as this may potentiate AKI. Patients who had moderate to severe AKI during an admission should be referred to and followed by a nephrologist. Likewise, even those who had mild AKI should have a close outpatient follow up with their primary care physician to monitor their kidney function routinely. Close monitoring can aid in the prevention of chronic kidney disease, or even progression to end-stage renal disease.
