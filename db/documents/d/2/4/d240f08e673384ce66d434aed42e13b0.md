Microphthalmia with cyst itself is associated with a poorer prognosis in comparison to other types of microphthalmia. The various prognosticating factors associated with an unfavorable prognosis include:

- Absence of visual potential confirmed on electrodiagnostic tests

- Severe disease

- Poor orbital volume

- Late age at presentation

- Avoidable cyst excision in < 7 years of age. Unless indicated, a cyst in a child of < 7 years should be left untouched owing to its contribution to orbital growth.

- Early lid surgery and socket reconstruction (pre-pubertal)

- Enucleation/Evisceration without orbital implants

- Discontinuation of expanders in early childhood/ Refusal to maintain the prosthesis

- Inability to maintain socket and prosthetic hygiene

- Infrequent follow-up visits
