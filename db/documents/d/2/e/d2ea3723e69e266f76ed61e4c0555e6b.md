Research ethics is a foundational principle of modern medical research across all disciplines. The overarching body, the IRB, is intentionally comprised of experts across a range of disciplines that can include ethicists, social workers, physicians, nurses, other scientific researchers, counselors and mental health professionals, and advocates for vulnerable subjects. There is also often a legal expert either on the panel, or available to it, to discuss any questions regarding the legality or ramifications of studies.
