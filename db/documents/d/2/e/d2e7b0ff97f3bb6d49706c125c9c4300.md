Gastric lymphoma arises from the formation of aberrant lymphoid tissue in the stomach. In the vast majority of cases, antigen stimulation by H. pylori recruits B-cells and T-cells to the gastric mucosa giving way to chronic inflammation. Malignant transformation into a low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma happens in the minority of patients with chronic H. pylori gastritis. High-grade gastric MALT lymphomas commonly consist of monoclonal B-cells that progress independently of the presence of H. pylori. Diagnosing and treating low-grade gastric lymphomas is key to preventing progression to high-grade lymphomas that have higher rates of complications, lower rates of regression, lower disease-free survival, and lower overall survival.
