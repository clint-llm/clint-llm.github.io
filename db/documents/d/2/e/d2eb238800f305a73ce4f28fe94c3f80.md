Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a disease spectrum that not only affects female fertility but also contributes to morbidity and mortality associated with the long-term withdrawal of estrogen. This disease spectrum has previously been referred to as premature ovarian failure. However, this terminology has fallen out of favor as the degree of ovarian impairment may fluctuate over time.
