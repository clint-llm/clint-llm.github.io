Microdeletion of 22q11.2 is the most common microdeletion syndrome, affecting approximately 0.1% of fetuses.

The prevalence of 22q11.2 microdeletion may be more common than supported in literature due to several factors. Firstly, not every patient with this microdeletion presents with several craniofacial abnormalities and hence does notÂ undergo genetic testing. African-American children, for example, may not have the craniofacial abnormalities characteristic of DGS in other races. Secondly, access to healthcare, specifically genetic testing, is not available to every individual that might have the microdeletion, regardless of the severity of craniofacial dysmorphism. Further population studies are therefore needed to fully understand the extent and spectrum of 22q11.2 microdeletions in different populations.
