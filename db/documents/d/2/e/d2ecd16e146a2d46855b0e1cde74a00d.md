The interprofessional team members caring for the patient need to work together to ensure the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy. The patient may require training on how to correctly self-administer and store their medications. The physician, nurse, or pharmacist can perform this education, and in fact, it may serve the patient well to hear it from multiple providers to optimize therapy and minimize toxicity.

Importantly, the interprofessional team needs to monitor for signs of drug efficacy and toxicity, which are affected by the drug's pharmacokinetic parameters, e.g., half-life. The pharmacist should verify the dosing, perform a drug interaction check, and follow the plasma concentrations of medication if clinically warranted, e.g., gentamicin. Nursing can monitor adverse events and make preliminary assessments of treatment effectiveness on subsequent visits, as well as verifying patient medication adherence.

Both nurses and pharmacists need to have an open communication line with the prescribing physician so they can report or discuss any concerns regarding drug therapy or the patient's drug regimen in general. This type of interprofessional communication is necessary to optimize patient outcomes with minimal adverse events.
