The brachiocephalic veins are formed by the confluence of the subclavian vein and internal jugular vein, on the right and left, respectively. The brachiocephalic veins, as well as the vena cava, are valveless vessels. Due to the anatomic position of the superior vena cava on the right of the middle mediastinum, the left brachiocephalic vein is generally longer than the right, allowing for it to bypass the aortic arch. The right brachiocephalic vein measures typically 2 to 3 cm, while the left measures approximately 6 cm.

The right vein has relationships with:

- The cartilage of the first rib,

- The infrahyoid muscles (sternothyroid),

- The phrenic nerve and cranial nerve vagus or X

- Parietal pleura

- Brachiocephalic arterial trunk

The left brachiocephalic vein courses inferior from the area of the clavicle, at an oblique angle, generally passing anterior to the aortic arch.

The left vein has relations with:

- The medial epiphysis of the clavicle

- The infrahyoid muscles (sternothyroid and sternohyoid)

- Retrosternal fat

The primary function of the brachiocephalic veins is to aid in carrying deoxygenated blood from the systemic circulation back to the right side of the heart and eventually to the pulmonary circuit for oxygenation.

The vein consists of several layers:

- An outer layer or adventitia, composed of connective tissue

- The middle layer or tunica media, made up of smooth muscle cells

- The tunica intima or inner layer, with endothelial cells
