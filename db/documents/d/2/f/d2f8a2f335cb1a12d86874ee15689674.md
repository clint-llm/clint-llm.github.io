Crystalloid fluids are a subset of intravenous solutions that are frequently used in the clinical setting. Crystalloid fluids are the first choice for fluid resuscitation in the presence of hypovolemia, hemorrhage, sepsis, and dehydration. Other clinical applications include acting as a solution for intravenous medication delivery, delivering maintenance fluid in patients with limited or no enteral nutrition, blood pressure management, and increasing diuresis to avoid nephrotoxic drug or toxin-mediated end-organ damage.

While normal saline (0.9% NaCl solution) is the most frequently used crystalloid fluid, many other formulations can provide improved clinical outcomes in specific patient populations.

Other commercially available crystalloid fluids include:

- Lactated Ringer's/Hartman's solution (lactate buffered solution)

- Acetate buffered solution

- Acetate and lactate buffered solution

- Acetate and gluconate buffered solution

- 0.45% NaCl (hypotonic solution)

- 3% NaCl (hypertonic solution)

- 5% Dextrose in water

- 10% Dextrose in water
