The exact etiology of SSc is not completely understood, and both genetic and environmental factors are thought to contribute to the development of SSc.

**Genetic Factors**

SSc has been associated with familial clustering

**Environmental Factors**

Several environmental triggers have been associated with the subsequent development of SSc. These include infectious agents such as Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and parvovirus B19. Exposure to silica dust has been associated with SSc
