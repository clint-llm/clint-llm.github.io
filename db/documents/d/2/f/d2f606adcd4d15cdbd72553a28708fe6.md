Hydrazine and its derivatives have numerous industrial, military, and medical applications.

Because hydrazines possess strong reducing properties, they are commonly used as a starting or intermediate reactant during the production of foaming or blowing agents for plastic production, agricultural products (plant-growth regulators, herbicides, fungicides, insecticides), and polymers.

Naturally occurring hydrazines are rare and can be found as mycotoxins in the Gyromitra and Agaricus species of mushrooms. The Gyromitra mushrooms contain the toxin gyromitrin (n-methyl-N-formyl hydrazone) and undergo hydrolysis to the principal toxic compound monomethylhydrazine (MMH), which is responsible for seizures in severe poisoning. Small amounts of hydrazine have been reported in tobacco; however, there have been no documented toxicities from human exposures.
