The major function of the levator ani muscle is supporting and raising the pelvic visceral structures. It also helps in proper sexual functioning, defecation, urination, and allowing various structures to pass through it. It is composed of three parts puborectalis, pubococcygeus, and the iliococcygeus muscle.

**Origin, Course, and Insertion**

Arcus tendinous fascia pelvis covers the medical aspect of the obturator internus muscle, the posterior part of this thickened fibrous fascia forms the arcus tendineus levator ani, which is the origin of the iliococcygeus part of the levator ani muscle. The muscle passes backward and downwards the midline, the posterior fibers insert into the coccyx, and the anterior fibers into the anococcygeal raphe or body.

Puborectalis originates from the inferior part of the pubic symphysis and the superior fascial layer of the urogenital diaphragm. It then courses backward and forms a sling around the rectum, and meets the fibers from the opposite muscle at the midline.

Pubococcygeus originates from the posterior aspect of the inferior rami of the pubis and anterior part of the obturator fascia. It passes back towards the midline and inset into the anococcygeal raphe. It has variation depending on the gender, where it inserts to either the vagina as pubovaginalis muscle in females or the prostate as puboprostaticus muscle in males.

**Structure and Function**

The puborectalis muscle forms a sling around the lower rectum when it meets the fibers from the opposite side. It acts in association with the internal and external anal sphincter in the process of defecation.

The pubococcygeus muscle controls the flow of urine and also helps reduce urinary incontinence, where a weaker pubococcygeus muscle is seen in a higher number of urinary incontinence patients, especially in gravid and post-gravid women. The pubovaginalis muscle in females and the male counterpart, levator prostatae (also called puboprostaticus), form the medial part of the pubococcygeus and function to support the vagina in females and prostate in males, respectively. It aids in ejaculation in males and assists childbirth in the proper positioning of the fetus's head, and provides core stability.

Iliococcygeus forms the midline raphe after it meets the fibers from the opposite side, which is continuous with the anococcygeal ligament and provides a secure anchoring point for the pelvic floor.

Collective as the levator ani muscle, it gives structural support to abdominopelvic visceral organs, helps maintain intraabdominal pressure, assists during respiration, and aids in defecation and urination.****

The levator ani muscle helps to manage mechanical pressures during movement; it is important for the distribution of loads during walking and the movements of the trunk and limbs.

During breathing, the muscle is under the control of the upper breathing centers; during inhalation, it releases, while during exhalation, it contracts.

A 2012 study showed that the levator ani muscle is in direct connection with the gluteus maximus muscle via a connective tissue bridge at the level of the ischioanal fossa.
