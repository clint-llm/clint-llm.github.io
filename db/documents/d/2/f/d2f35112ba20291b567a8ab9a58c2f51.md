Organ transplantation has emerged as an established treatment option for patients with end-stage disease processes such as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), acute and chronic decompensated liver disease, end-stage cardiac and pulmonary diseases, diseases of the pancreas, intestines, hematological conditions, etc. The number of transplantations performed worldwide has steadily increased in the past three decades. The advent of newer immunosuppressive regimens and improved nutrition has significantly increased the survival rates among transplant recipients. Simultaneously, short and long-term complications of transplantation are increasingly recognized.

One such complication is the development of post-transplantation osteoporosis and fractures, both of which are associated with increased mortality and morbidity and decreased quality of life in transplant recipients.
