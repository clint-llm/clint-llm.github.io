There are four stages of endometriosis described by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. The stages are minimal, mild, moderate, and severe. Staging is completed surgically, most commonly via laparoscopy.

- Stage I (minimal): Small solitary lesions without significant adhesions

- Stage II (mild): Superficial lesions less than 5 cm, without significant adhesions

- Stage III (moderate): Multiple deep implants, small endometriomas unilaterally or bilaterally on the ovaries, and thin adhesions

- Stage IV (severe): Multiple deep implants, large endometriomas unilaterally or bilaterally on the ovaries, thick adhesions

As can be seen by these descriptions, if an endometrioma is present, the patient is already a stage 3 or 4. Most patients are found to have stage 1 or 2 endometriosis. However, staging does not always coincide with the severity of symptoms.
