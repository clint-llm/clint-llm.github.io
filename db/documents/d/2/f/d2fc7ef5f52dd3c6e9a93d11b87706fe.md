Plasma renin levels can be an important diagnostic test in distinguishing those with hypertension caused by hyperaldosteronism. In patients with primary hyperaldosteronism, such as in those with Conn syndrome, renin levels will be low, and aldosterone levels elevated. In contrast, in patients with secondary hyperaldosteronism, such as in congestive heart failure, both renin and aldosterone levels will increase.
