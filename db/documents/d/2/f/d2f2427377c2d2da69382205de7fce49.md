In many countries, including the US, asthma kills one out of every 100,000 persons. The worse the lung function, the higher the mortality. In addition, mortality has also been linked to poor management and lack of medication compliance, especially in young people. Other factors that increase the risk of death include smoking and use of illicit drugs.

Asthma also results in millions of school and workdays lost. In the US alone, close to 2 million asthmatics seek regular care in the emergency department, which also increases the costs of healthcare.

Even though asthma is a reversible disorder, poor lifestyle and lack of management can lead to airway remodeling that leads to chronic symptoms, which are disabling.

The disorder has no cure, and thus life long monitoring is necessary. For best outcomes, an interprofessional approach is recommended.

**Evidence-based Medicine**

Many guidelines have been published for the diagnosis and management of asthma, but the most critical feature is patient education. The nurses are the last professionals to see the patient before discharge from the emergency department or the floors. Similarly, since most asthmatics are treated as outpatients, pharmacists encounter them regularly. Evidence shows that teaching patients about this disorder and the importance of compliance are critical for good outcomes. The patient should be taught about monitoring techniques, inhaler use, and modifying the environment. A social worker should be involved in the care to ensure that the patient has adequate home support and facilities.

Many evidence-based asthma plans are available for the management of asthma and should be handed out to patients. Finally, nurses also play a vital role in school-based asthma education programs that can help improve self-esteem, knowledge, and self-management behaviors.

Management of asthma requires an interprofessional approach. Nurses work with the clinician in providing patient and family education regarding avoiding triggers, regular use of medications and being prepared with rescue inhalers. The pharmacist should assist with the appropriate use of inhalers and encouraging daily medication administration. The pharmacist should carefully examine the current medications and make sure the patient is not taking any medications that may trigger an attack, working with the prescriber to modify the treatment. an interprofessional approach will result in the best outcomes.

**Outcomes**

Despite great awareness of the disease, asthma still results in high morbidity and even mortality. There are universal guidelines on managing the disorder, but patient compliance with medications remains a big problem. Hence, all healthcare workers have a responsibility to encourage medication compliance and close follow up with the primary care physician.
