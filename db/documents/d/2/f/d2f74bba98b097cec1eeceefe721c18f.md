Early clinical suspicion, diagnosis, and surgical management of a double aortic arch can prevent long-term respiratory complications.

An interprofessional team comprising of a cardiologist, cardiothoracic surgeon, pediatrician, respiratory physician, anesthetist, intensive care nurse, therapist, and geneticist normally engages in the care of the patient with a double aortic arch. Other healthcare professionals should be involved when additionalÂ conditions mandating specialist input co-exist.

Early postoperative extubation and adequate postoperative pain management strategies aid in improving patient satisfaction and reducing the length of hospital stay.
