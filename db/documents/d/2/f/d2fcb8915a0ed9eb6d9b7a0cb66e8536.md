Chagas disease is one of the neglected tropical diseases outlined by the World Health Organization. If left untreated, it can lead to significant morbidity and mortality.

An interprofessional team can enhance the care of patients with Chagas disease. Primary care and emergency department personnel need to have a high level of suspicion for those at risk for the disease. Pharmacists review prescribed medications and counsel patients and their families about the importance of compliance and potential side effect. A board-certified infectious disease pharmacist may also help with agent selection and help guide the treatment plan. Nurses are involved in the initial evaluation, facilitate communication among the interdisciplinary team, and provide patient information. These interprofessional measures can lead to improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]
