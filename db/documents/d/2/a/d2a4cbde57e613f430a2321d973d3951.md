Important healthcare team members for patients with esophageal motility disorders include primary care providers, gastroenterologists, manometry nurses/techs, and surgeons. PCPs must help us in identifying patients that may be potentially suffering from dysphagia. Nurses and techs are trained to perform motility testing. Gastroenterologists and esophageal surgeons can interpret the results of testing and treat as an interprofessional team, depending on the outcome.
