In the event of the rupture of the fetal membranes, the nurse should assess the color of the amniotic fluid. Amniotic fluid should be clear, or straw tinged with small vernix particles in the fluid.

Traditionally, during labor, if meconium-stained amniotic fluid is encountered, an intrapartum suctioning of airways was done.

If the infant is vigorous with good muscle tone and respiratory efforts, furtherÂ newborn care could be provided in the delivery room.

If the infant is not vigorous with poor neurological tone, insufficient breathing efforts, and bradycardia (heart rate <100 beats/minute), routine postnatal suctioning of the airways was widely practiced in the past to decrease the possibility of development of meconium aspiration syndrome.
