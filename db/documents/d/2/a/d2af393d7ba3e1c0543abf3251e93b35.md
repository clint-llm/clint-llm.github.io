Many complications may arise from intercostal neuralgia.  As outlined previously, one major complication of acute intercostal neuralgia is a negative effect on respiratory mechanics.

Epidural analgesia entails the risk of spinal cord injury, inadvertent dural puncture, sympathectomy, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, infection, and bleeding, to name a few.  Regional interventional techniques have many risks, including, but not limited to, damage to nerves or surrounding structures and local anesthetic toxicity.  All pharmacological treatments have well-known side effects and possible reactions with other medications.

Opioids notoriously represent unique risks of addiction, respiratory depression, and diversion.  All of these complications mark challenges in the care for patients with intercostal neuralgia.
