Human T-lymphotropic virus-1 is an enveloped single-stranded RNA retrovirus. Its genomic organization is typical of the Retroviridae family; it has two long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences with the gag, pol, and env genes. HTLV-1 has an additional identifying region pX, which encodes for several regulatory proteins, one of which is Tax. This Tax protein is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of HTLV-1.

HTLV-1 infection occurs primarily and most efficiently via the transmission of infected lymphocytes (though free viral particles have been demonstrated to infect dendritic cells).

A second characteristic feature of HTLV-1 is its high genetic stability, which is ensured by its mode of replication.

HTLV-1 is able to regulate its own transcription and, therefore, transiently expresses gene products that may contribute to evasion of the host immune control.
