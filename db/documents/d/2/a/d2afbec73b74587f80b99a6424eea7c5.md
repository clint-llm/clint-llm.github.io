Healthcare workers including the nurse practitioner who deal with patients with syncope and arrhythmias should be familiar with the implantable loop recorder. Unlike the traditional holter monitor, the implantable loop recorder is far more efficient and reliable at identifying abnormal rhythms. However, they should be considered only after a thorough history and physical examination are performed. Family history and medication use should also be discussed with the patient. Initial imaging should include ECG and echocardiogram which may reveal structural heart disease. Other testing such as a stress test or a tilt table test, may be beneficial if indicated. If the patient continues to have symptoms and all workup is unrevealing, then electrophysiology testing and an implantable loop recorder is the best approach in select patients.
