Orthostatic hypotension can be caused by both neurogenic and non-neurogenic etiologies and can also be related to medications. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is characterized by autonomic instability secondary to neuropathic disease, neurodegenerative disease, or aging. Neuropathic conditions include diabetes, cholinergic receptor autoantibodies, and familial dysautonomia. Neurodegenerative diseases include Parkinson disease, multiple-system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. Non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is most commonly due to volume depletion. One must also consider medication-induced orthostatic hypotension, particularly in the case of polypharmacy in the elderly.

Orthostatic hypotension occurs with an abnormal or delayed response to shifts in the body's fluid balance on standing. This causes an exaggerated drop in systolic blood pressure (more than or equal to 20 mmHg) and/or diastolic blood pressure (more than or equal to 10 mm Hg) on standing. There can be two types of responses:

- "Classic" orthostatic hypotension - within three minutes of standing

- "Delayed" orthostatic hypotension - after three minutes.

Most studies have investigated classic orthostatic hypotension, and less is known about the delayed type.

Following is the list of causes of orthostatic hypotension:

**Neurogenic Causes**

- Neurodegenerative diseases - Parkinson disease, Parkinson-plus syndromes

- Peripheral neuropathy - Diabetes, vitamin B12 deficiency, amyloidosis, renal failure, autoimmune, rheumatological, and paraneoplastic conditions

**Non-neurogenic Causes**

- Volume depletion - Anemia, dehydration, hemorrhage, hyperglycemia

- Cardiovascular diseases - Aortic stenosis, hypertension, atherosclerosis, heart failure, vascular stiffening, or arrhythmias

- Other - Adrenal insufficiency, physical deconditioning, aging

**Either Mechanism**

- Medications - alpha-blockers, antihypertensives, diuretics, nitrates, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, beta-blockers

- Alcohol consumption

- Short term: diuretic effect, impairment of vasoconstriction
- Long term or chronic: neurotoxic effects

- Idiopathic

Medications may cause orthostatic hypotension as an adverse effect. Individual susceptibility, comorbidities, age, and polypharmacy define whether patients develop orthostatic hypotension.
