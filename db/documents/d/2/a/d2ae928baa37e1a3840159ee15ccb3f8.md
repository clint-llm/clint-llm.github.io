Laboratory evaluation is usually not required to diagnose this syndrome. If the clinical examination and parents reported symptoms are not concerning epilepsy, clinicians should try a nonpharmacologic treatment and then pharmacologic treatment as needed. If symptoms improve, there is no need for further diagnostic tests. If symptoms are refractory to the non-pharmacologic or pharmacologic treatments, then a referral to a gastroenterologist is pertinent for further evaluation, such as continuous esophageal pH monitoring and other advanced studies. When the clinical picture is not clear for Sandifer syndrome, the clinician should tailor the diagnostic tools according to the physical exam and parental symptom report. In some cases, EEG will provide valuable clinical information to rule in or out seizure disorders. Metabolic conditions, infectious etiologies, and other congenital neuromuscular problems should be in the differential.

The evaluation of iron deficiency anemia with CBC and iron studies and referral to surgery in the assessment of hiatal hernia should be a part of the management of Sandifer syndrome.
