Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and premature rupture of membranes (PROM), amniotic fluid discrepancy caused by an anomaly in one twin, selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR), and twin anemia polycythemia sequence (TAPS) are in the differential diagnosis for TTTS. Before making the diagnosis of TTTS, it is important to determine whether the mother has experienced a rupture of membranes by asking about any leakage of fluid with or without contractions. sIUGR is defined by one twin displaying an estimated weight of < 10% based upon gestational age.

Growth differences can occur as part of TTTS or separately from it. TAPS can occur in MCDA twins and occurs both spontaneously (1% to 5%) or as a complication of fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (16%). Ultrasound findings prenatally include doppler abnormalities in the MCA flow of both the donor and recipient twin, which indicate anemia in the donor and polycythemia in the recipient.
