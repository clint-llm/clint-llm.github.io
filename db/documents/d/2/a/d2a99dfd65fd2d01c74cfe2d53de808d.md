Aligning the treatment plan with goals of care, optimizing symptom management, maximizing the patient's level of comfort, facilitating safe discharge planning, and helping with the transition of care for concerned family members are at the heart of palliative medicine. However, DDIs are an unfortunate type of adverse drug event that becomes more frequent in later stages of diseases as patients begin to experience progressive organ function decline and increased symptoms, thus requiring polytherapy and increasing doses of analgesics. Ultimately, the type of pain, choice of drug, optimal dose, and route to achieve appropriate symptom control for each patient will depend on the prescriber's clinical judgment and will vary considerably based on individual patient response.
