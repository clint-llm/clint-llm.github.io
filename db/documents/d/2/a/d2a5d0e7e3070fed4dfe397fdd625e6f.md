Pharyngeal pouches form in distinct positions along the anteroposterior axis of the developing embryo. Assorted extracellular matrix proteins are involved in the formation and stabilization of pharyngeal pouches. Pouch formation is governed by regions of endoderm containing high amounts of actin fibers, directing pouch expansion towards ectoderm.

Adaptor proteins stimulate signal transduction pathways within the endoderm, driving protein complex formation. A subtype of adaptor proteins from the Ripply family of genes, Ripply3, is critical for pouch formation.

Mutations in the Ripply3 gene result in loss of flexural strength of the epithelial sheet, producing defects in adhesion contacts between the two extracellular matrices.
