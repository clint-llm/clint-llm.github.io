If prompt treatment is not initiated for an infected animal bite, complications may occur. In the worst cases, systemic illness (bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis) may develop. Local complications include abscess formation, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and tenosynovitis. These local complications occur most commonly in injuries to the hand.
