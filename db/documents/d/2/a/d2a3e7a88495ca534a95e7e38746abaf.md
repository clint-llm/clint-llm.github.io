The exact incidence and prevalence of neurapraxia are not clearly defined as it is usually combined with other types of PNI. The incidence of traumatic nerve injuries is approximately 350,000/year.

During the Iraq and Afghanistan war conflicts, 45% of the nerve injuries were due to neurapraxia of the ulnar, common peroneal, and tibial nerves.

The most common cause of PNI is vehicular accidents (46.4%), which affected mostly young men.

PNI has a prevalence ranging between 13 to 23 per 100,000 persons per year.
