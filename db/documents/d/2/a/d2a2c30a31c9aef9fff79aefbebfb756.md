In patients with uveitis with a drop in vision and a clinical suspicion of macular edema, the diagnosis is confirmed by performing optical coherence tomography (OCT) and on fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA). These modalities are also helpful in diagnosing subclinical macular edema.

OCT can reveal the presence of cystic spaces in the outer plexiform layer at the fovea, diffuse retinal thickening, cystic spaces involving all retinal layers, and subfoveal subretinal fluid. One should look at the features of tractional components like the presence of epiretinal membrane and vitreous traction. Underlying choroiditis or surrounding chorioretinitis may also be evident in OCT. This serves as the confirmatory test and gold standard for UME and also helps in the follow up of patients on treatment for resolution or recurrence.

FFA: There can be dilatation of perifoveal capillaries leading to subsequent pooling of dye in the cystoid spaces at the foveola, arranged in petaloid patterns due to the radial arrangement of cells in the outer plexiform layer. Some cases may reveal diffuse leakage of choriocapillaris at the fovea. Enlargement of the foveal avascular zone due to ischemia will affect the vision. There may be dye leakage at the optic disc due to active inflammation. Surrounding signs of active or inactive vasculitis, chorioretinitis, and areas of capillary nonperfusion and neovascularization are also noted.
