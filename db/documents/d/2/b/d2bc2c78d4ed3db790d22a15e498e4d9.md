On microscopy, the neoplastic cells show abundant cytoplasm containing numerous mitochondria. Cells are commonly polygonal and fusiform with clear cytoplasm and a centrally located round nucleus. The "clear-cell" appearance represents intracellular glycogen accumulation, as demonstrated by the periodic acid-Schiff stain. Pigmented and unpigmented melanosomes, scattered multinucleated giant cells, and areas of focal necrosis are also commonly present.

CCSST commonly show highly infiltrative cells, haphazardly organized into compact nests and fascicles that dissect along with dense fibrous connective tissue.

Immunohistochemistry shows antigens commonly associated with melanin synthesis, including HMB-45 and S100 within the cytoplasm and nucleus. It may also show positivity for CD99, Melan-A, neuron-specific enolase, and vimentin.

Cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen, desmin, and smooth muscle actin are usually negative.
