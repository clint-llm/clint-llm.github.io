**Surgical Approach**

Minimally-invasive adrenalectomy via retroperitoneal or transperitoneal approach is the gold standard for pheochromocytoma resection. A minimally invasive approach is preferred, as it leads to lower postoperative pain scores, earlier ambulation, and faster recovery. This approach has shown a lowered incidence of postoperative thromboembolic complications, reduced hospital stays, and is cost-effective

**Anesthesia Management**

Patients should be pre-medicated with anti-anxiety medication like midazolam. An arterial line is preferred before induction as induction may result in hemodynamic lability. General anesthesia alone or with an epidural is used for PCC resection. Epidural may be considered if open surgery is planned to provide adequate pain management in the postoperative period. Good IV access with two peripheral lines is necessary. Intra-operative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)/Pulmonary artery catheter may be considered in patients with severe cardiomyopathy to guide fluid management/inotrope administration or to assess ventricular function.

Central venous access for vasopressor/inotrope administration may be placed in patients with poor LV function. Propofol is the most commonly used agent for the induction of anesthesia if the patient has good LV function. Patients with cardiomyopathy would need cardio-stable slow induction with divided doses of propofol or etomidate or narcotic-based induction. Ketamine should be avoided because of its sympathomimetic properties. Smooth induction of anesthesia with an optimal depth of anesthesia is the main goal to avoid hypertensive response during laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation.

Laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation often cause hypertension and tachycardia, which could be exaggerated in patients with PCC due to the release of catecholamines. Severe hypertension and tachycardia may result in arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia. The elevation in blood pressure and heart rate associated with laryngoscopy and intubation can be prevented or minimized by ensuring adequate depth of anesthesia.

Sevoflurane is the most commonly used inhalational agent for the maintenance of anesthesia for PCC resection as it lacks the arrhythmogenic potential and has a favorable hemodynamic profile compared with other inhalational agents. Desflurane can result in tachycardia and hypertension, especially when concentration is increased rapidly. Sympathomimetic drugs (ketamine, ephedrine) and drugs causing histamine release (atracurium, morphine) should be avoided. Metoclopramide is contra-indicated as it can induce hypertensive crisis and can also cause adrenergic myocarditis with cardiogenic shock in patients with PCC.

It may be mediated by metoclopramide inhibiting dopaminergic suppression of presynaptic norepinephrine release. It has also been found to directly stimulate the release of catecholamines in PCC.

**Intra-operative Hemodynamic Management**

Peritoneal insufflation during laparoscopic resection and tumor manipulation during surgery can cause an abrupt release of catecholamine, resulting in severe hypertension and tachycardia. This hypertensive crisis may result in myocardial ischemia or stroke

Short and rapidly acting vasodilators like nitroprusside, nitroglycerine, or calcium channel blockers like nifedipine and clevidipine are commonly used to control hypertension. Catecholamine excess can also result in life-threatening coronary artery vasospasm. Calcium channel blockers are beneficial in controlling vasospasm. Clevidipine is a newer dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist used intravenously to reduce blood pressure. Intravenous clevidipine has a rapid onset and short duration of action and can be easily titrated for predictable blood pressure control. Phentolamine can be used to rapidly control hypertensive episodes. It is a short-acting non-selective alpha-1 and alpha-2 antagonist with a duration of action of 10 to 15 minutes.

In a patient with PCC, beta-blocker should only be considered after α-blocker administration. Or else, unopposed catecholamine-induced α-agonism can trigger an acute hypertensive crisis and significantly raise afterload and myocardial oxygen demand. Labetalol is not preferred due to its β-adrenergic antagonism, which can provoke unpredictable, unopposed α-receptor agonism from circulating catecholamines resulting in hypertensive crisis.

Intravenous labetalol has an α:β receptor antagonism ratio of 1:7. Thus, it has a preference for β-receptor and the potential for worsening hypertension. Labetalol may result in persistent hypotension and bradycardia following the removal of the tumor. If pre-operative α-antagonism has been instituted, beta-blocker like esmolol or metoprolol may be titrated to control heart rate.

Esmolol is a short-acting, competitive antagonist of beta-1-adrenergic receptors

The depth of anesthesia can also be changed to optimize hemodynamic response. After the ligation of the blood vessel of the tumor, a precipitous drop in blood pressure may occur. This is usually due to the sudden drop in endogenous catecholamine levels in the setting of chronic downregulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors in patients with PCC. Fluid bolus with vasoconstrictors like phenylephrine and noradrenaline are used to maintain blood pressure. In refractory hypotension, vasopressin infusion ( 0.01 to 0.03 units/minute) has been used to maintain blood pressure

Vasopressin is particularly effective in managing hypotension in pheochromocytoma as vasopressin has no action on peripheral adrenergic receptors for its effect. When all these vasoactive agents are not adequately effective, methylene blue may be tried. Methylene blue inhibits nitric oxide synthase and guanylate cyclase and has been found effective in managing refractory vasoplegic patients
