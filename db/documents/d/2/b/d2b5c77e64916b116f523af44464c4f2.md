The facies, upper extremities, and spine are examined, looking for abnormal appearance or multiple congenital anomalies, indicating a genetic syndrome. Most of the children who were born with unilateral congenital femoral deficiency usually have no family history. Even though a clinician should enquire about the family history, any associated known congenital abnormalities, exposure to drugs, radiation, or any infectious disease during the early antenatal period.

A genetic consultation should be obtained if any syndromic association is found. Nowadays, many cases of congenital femoral deficiency can be identified during ultrasonography in routine antenatal check-ups by measuring the femur lengths. The predicted limb length discrepancy can be estimated using the multiplier method at birth and even at maturity in such scenarios.

While examining the child, clinicians should not only focus on the lower limbs as an area of interest; instead, they should examine the child as a whole starting from the facies and try to find out any possible associated bony deformities. In addition, a detailed examination of the hip, knee, and ankle should be done to assess the range of motion and contractures around respective joints. For example, characteristic findings in the hip examination include increased external rotation/external rotation deformity, flexion deformity, and limited abduction at the hip, along with the shortening of the femur.
