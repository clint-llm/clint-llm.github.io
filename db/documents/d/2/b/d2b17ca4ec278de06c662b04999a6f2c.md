There are several factors favoring a good functional outcome:

- Younger age

- Distal injury in the nerve (shorter distance to the muscle, and a more discrete separation of motor and sensory fascicles that can be matched).

- End-to-end repair

- Early repair

The return of function following nerve repair is best for patients less than 20 to 25 years of age, and the extent of recovery decreases significantly with increasing patient age.

Peripheral nerve injuries can lead to long sick-leave periods, long-term disability, and in 30% of the cases to a permanent disability pension.
