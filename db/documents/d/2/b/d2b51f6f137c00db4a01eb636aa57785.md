Due to the relative rarity of the disease, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact prevalence in the population. Estimates have ranged from 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 60,000.

The disease is usually diagnosed a few months after birth. Symptoms are usually first noted after the introduction of fructose-containing foods in the diet. In untreated patients, liver and kidney disease may cause significant morbidity. However, if proper dietary measures are taken, the life expectancy is normal.

Heterozygotes do not show any symptoms; however, there are reports of hyperuricemia in heterozygote carriers of the disease, predisposing them to gout.
