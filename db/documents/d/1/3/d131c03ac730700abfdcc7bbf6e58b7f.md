Monitoring for any oral antidiabetic agent includes fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) every 3 to 6 months.

Clinicians should monitor renal function via GFR initially and periodically. Patients with a GFR of 60 to 45 ml/min/1.732 are monitored every 3 to 6 months. Patients with a GFR of less than 45 ml/min/1.732 should have monitoring everyÂ three months. Monitoring renal function is needed to aid in the prevention of lactic acidosis, especially in the elderly.

Vitamin B12 deficiency can sometimes occur with long-term metformin use. Therefore, the ADA recommends frequently checking this level, particularly in patients with anemia or peripheral neuropathy.

Patients on concomitant drugs, which can cause an increased risk of lactic acidosis, should be monitored frequently.
