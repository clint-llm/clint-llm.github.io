Brucellosis is a common zoonotic disease that is transmitted to humans from ruminants. While the disease is on the decline, epidemiological surveillance is vital to detect any outbreak or local emergence in humans or animals. Expert evidence indicates that brucellosis is best managed by an interprofessional team of health care providers that includes an epidemiologist, an infectious disease consultant, internists, a pharmacist, and a nurse.

Because the disease is acquired from wildlife, it is vital to educate the patient and family on avoidance of exposure. Since brucellosis can present with the involvement of almost any organ system, high suspicion should be maintained. The medical laboratory is essential to help make the diagnosis of the disease. Once the infection is treated, the pharmacist should ensure that the patient remains compliant with drug therapy. In addition, if there is any evidence of recurrence, the patient should be referred to an internist for serological studies. Countless studies show that an interprofessional approach to brucellosis results in a complete cure within 4-6 months, with excellentÂ outcomes.
