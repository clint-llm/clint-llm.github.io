According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), unintentional injuries were the leading cause of death in people from birth through 44 years of age in the United States. With the prevalence rates of injuries being so high, a simple and standardized assessment tool to identify injury severity is critical for clinicians. There are various metrics to evaluate the severity of a patient’s injuries. ISS, NISS, and TRISS have retrospectively measured indexes, whereas TS and RTS have their basis on patient characteristics at the time of initial evaluation.
