The overall incidence and prevalence of chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) in biopsies of renal allograft tissues depends on the timing and the indication of such graft biopsies. In protocol biopsies, in the first year post-transplantation, it has been reported that the prevalence can be as high as 94% (grade I) and up to 100% after ten years.

In the United States, mortality in patients on chronic hemodialysis is significantly higher in winter months than in the summer. It is unknown whether a seasonal difference exists, however, for mortality or graft failure among kidney transplant recipients. One report showed that there was a significant annual variation of deaths due to graft failures.
