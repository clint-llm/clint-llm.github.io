Whenever pulsus alternans is suspected, the appropriate cardiac workup should be completed, including laboratory work, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram. Objective laboratory findings include elevated pro-BNP and pulmonary vascular congestion on chest X-ray. Electrocardiogram will often show normal sinus rhythm or sinus tachycardia.

Timing of events and the series of occurrences are important details one should pay attention to. Rarely, there can be a discrepancy between the electrical and mechanical activities of the heart, and echocardiography is an important tool to identify such inconsistency. Furthermore, there may be a discrepancy between the efficiency of the heart and the mechanical activation of the heart, the production of cardiac output, and in such cases, echocardiography can play a crucial role in diagnosing such a condition. Combining information from 2D and tissue Doppler evaluation of contractility, ECG tracing, and spectral tracing across the left ventricular outflow tract can provide an assessment of the mechanical activation of the heart, electrical activation of the heart muscle, and the resulting “success” of these efforts in producing cardiac output.
