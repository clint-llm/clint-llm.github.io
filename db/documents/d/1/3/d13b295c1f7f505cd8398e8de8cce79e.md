ECG interpretation and identification of pathology on electrocardiograms should be an integral part of monitoring any patient placed on telemetry or who presents with signs and symptoms of abnormal cardiac function. The healthcare team, including physicians, nurses, and technicians, should be able to quickly recognize common abnormal ECG patterns and intervene or notify a healthcare member, such as a cardiologist, that can treat the pathology found on the electrocardiogram rhythm.

Early identification by nursing staff to alert clinicians of an abnormal rhythm or electrical conduction defect on ECG can lead to rapid management and decreased morbidity and mortality of patients. It is in the patients' best interest for all healthcare team members to have the ability and confidence to point out P wave abnormalities and PR segment prolongations or heart blocks.
