There are four fundamental categories of fascia:

**Superficial Fascia**

- A thin layer of loose connective tissue directly beneath the skin

**Deep Fascia**

- Surrounds individual muscles and forms fascial compartments

- Is categorized as axial or appendicular fascia based on location within the body

**Parietal Fascia**

- Layers of connective tissue lining the walls of body cavities which lie outside the parietal layer of the serosa

**Visceral Fascia**

- Supports organs in their cavities and encloses them in layers of connective tissue
