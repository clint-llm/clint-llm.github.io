In 2012 a survey suggested that in the United States, approximately 1 out of 11 people suffered from renal stones, which are considerably higher than the numbers recorded in a previous study done 13 years ago. The same survey revealed that men had been affected more than women (10.6% men and 7.1% of women), but the percentage of women with stone has been increasing in recent decades.

Calcium stones comprise about 80% of all kidney stone diseases, with calcium oxalate being the far more predominant one (approximately 75%).

The estimated overall incidence of secondary hyperoxaluria appears to be increasing over time. Typical rates of hyperoxaluria are from 25% to 45% of all recurrent calcium stone formers.

There does appear to be a protective effect from female sex hormones on oxalate excretion, while testosterone has a detrimental effect.

Greater bodyweight does appear to increase urinary oxalate, but there are conflicting data as to whether this is relatively proportionate or if men actually excrete more oxalate and uric acid than women of similar size.

Whites have higher rates of nephrolithiasis and hyperoxaluria than Blacks. Urinary oxalate excretion has been found to be higher in Whites after a controlled, high oxalate meal than in Blacks. The reason for this is unclear but is thought to be due to genetic factors, with Whites having a higher rate of intestinal oxalate absorption than Blacks.

Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is quite rare, and while usually diagnosed in the pediatric age group, it is often diagnosed very late into the course of the disease, usually only after the development of nephrocalcinosis or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 is the most common form of primary hyperoxaluria. The prevalence of the disease ranges from 1 to 3 per one million population in the US, with an approximate incidence rate of approximately 1 in 100,000 live births per year in Europe. Higher rates are reported from inbred populations. Primary hyperoxaluria is responsible for <1% of the pediatric ESRD population in registries from the USA, UK, and Japan.
