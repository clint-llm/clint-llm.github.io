The differential diagnosis for FUO is broad but can be grouped into the following four categories based on etiology: infections, neoplasms, connective tissue disease, and miscellaneous.

Infection accounts for about a third of cases of FUO. The most common infections causing FUO are:

- Miliary tuberculosis (TB)

- Brucellosis

- Q fever

- Intraabdominal, pelvic, intranephric, and perinephric abscesses

- Typhoid/enteric fever

- Actinomycosis

- Amebiasis

- Atypical mycobacterial infection

- Blastomycosis

- Brain abscess

- Campylobacter infections

- Cholangitis

- Cholelithiasis

- Chagas disease

- Candidiasis

- Dengue fever

- Diabetic ulcers

- Empyema thoracis

- Empyema gallbladder

- Toxoplasmosis

- Giardiasis

- Hepatitis A-E

- Liver abscess

- Lung abscess

- Leptospirosis

- Leishmaniasis

- Libman-sacks endocarditis

- Cat scratch disease (CSD)

- Malaria

- Mycoplasma

- Mucormycosis

- SARS COVID 19

- Pelvic inflammatory disease

- HIV

- Cytomegalovirus

- Epstein-Barr virus

- Extrapulmonary (renal, central nervous system) TB

Note that in the HIV population 75% of cases of FUO are infectious but rarely due to HIV itself.

Another third of FUO cases is due to rheumatologic and inflammatory disorders, such as:

- Adult Still disease

- Giant cell/temporal arteritis

- Periarteritis nodosa

- Microscopic polyangiitis

- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

- Takayasu arteritis

- Kikuchi disease

- Sarcoidosis

- Felty syndrome

- Gaucher disease

- Polyarticular gout

- Pseudogout

- Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)

- Behcet disease

- Marshall syndrome

Neoplasms and malignancies account for up to 18% of FUO etiologies. The most common neoplasms associated with FUO are:

- Lymphoma

- Renal cell carcinoma

- Acute myeloid leukemia

- Myeloproliferative disorders

- Atrial myxoma

- Multiple myeloma

- Colon carcinoma

- Pancreatic carcinoma

- Hepatoma

- CNC metastasis

- Liver metastasis

- Systemic mastocytosis

The remainder of FUO etiologies is classified as miscellaneous. These include:

- Drug-induced fevers

- Liver cirrhosis

- Subacute thyroiditis

- Crohn disease

- Deep vein thrombosis

- Pulmonary embolus

- Hematomas

- Familial Mediterranean fever

- Hypothalamic dysfunction

- Hypertriglyceridemia (type V)

- Fictitious fever
