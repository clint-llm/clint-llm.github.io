The lateral meniscus is one of two semilunar fibrocartilaginous structures in the knee joint that act as shock absorbers, enhance joint stability, and aid in the distribution of synovial fluid. Together with the medial meniscus, the lateral meniscus provides a concave surface for the convex femoral condyles to articulate superior to the relatively flat tibial plateaus.
