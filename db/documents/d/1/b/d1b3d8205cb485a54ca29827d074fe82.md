Minoxidil (also called 2,4-pyrimidinediamine, 6-(1-piperidinyl)-, 3-oxide) was first designed as a potent peripheral vasodilator agent for the treatment of severe refractory hypertension in the 1970s. Due to its serious side effects, oral minoxidil was reserved for cases of severe hypertension that were reluctant to maximum doses of three antihypertensive agents. Also, about one-fifth of patients under oral minoxidil treatment developed hypertrichosis. In 1987, a topical form was developed to treat androgenic alopecia, initially for males and subsequently for females. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and adverse effects of minoxidil and highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing patients with hair loss.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of minoxidil.
- Describe the adverse effects of minoxidil.
- Review the contraindications of minoxidil.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the safe use of minoxidil for alopecia and improve outcomes.
