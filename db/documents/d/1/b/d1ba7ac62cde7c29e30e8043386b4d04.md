Non-atherosclerotic spontaneous coronary artery dissection arises from a tear in the tunica intima of the blood vessel, with blood entering and separating the layers of the arterial wall. A false lumen is eventually created in the medial layer which is filled with intramural hematoma. The increasing pressure of the false lumen by an enlarging hematoma causes external compression of the true coronary lumen resulting in restricted coronary blood flow and eventually leading to coronary insufficiency. This should be differentiated from atherosclerotic dissections, which result from plaque rupture or erosions allowing blood to enter the intimal space and from iatrogenic dissections that occur during coronary procedures.
