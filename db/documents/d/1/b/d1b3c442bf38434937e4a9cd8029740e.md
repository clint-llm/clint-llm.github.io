Respiratory failure is a life-threatening condition responsible for around 30% of in-hospital mortality. The definitive treatment for respiratory failure is mechanical intubation and ventilation. However, this process is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

NPPV has been shown to reduce intubation in COPD, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and pneumonia and reduce the need for reintubation in hypercapnic respiratory failure following extubation. However, NPPV is a time-consuming procedure requiring high resource utilization and should only be performed under a clinician and support staff with proficiency in its use.

**Clinical Pearls**

- Start treatment as early as possible

- When arterial pH is less than 7.35 and elevated PaCO2, it indicates the presence of acute or acute on chronic hypercapnia respiratory failure, which require admission to ICU

- In acute on chronic hypercapnia respiratory failure, the first goal is to correct arterial pH

- In chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure with arterial PaCO2more than 51 mmHg, the use of high-intensity pressure support is indicated. It should be targeted to correct CO2 toward normal or at least reduced by 20% from initial levels.

- When OSA is suspected, the EPAP  should be adjusted empirically (use the 10% rule of actual body weight) if no PAP titration was performed.
