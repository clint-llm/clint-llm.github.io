The specific gravity of plasma is 1.022 to 1.026 compared to the specific gravity of blood which is 1.052 to 1.061. Plasma forms 55%, and red blood cells form 45% of the total blood. Four major products derived from the plasma which can be used are fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), plasma frozen within 24 hours of phlebotomy (FP24), cryoprecipitate-poor plasma (CPP), and thawed plasma. FP24, CPP, and thawed plasma contain varying amounts of clotting factors.
