It is often found in immunocompetent individuals. It affects men and women equally. Acute retinal necrosis tends to occur in older patient populations as VZV immunity wanes. HSV-induced retinitis typically affects younger patients, who have a history of herpetic encephalitis. Acute retinal necrosis can also occur in immunocompetent patients, who become suppressed via corticosteroids, noncorticosteroid immunosuppressants, and chemotherapeutics. It is also seen in AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and other immunocompromised patients. HLA-Aw33, HLA-B44, and HLA-DRw6 have been associated with acute retinal necrosis in the Japanese population. It has also been seen with the American Caucasian populations that have HLA-DQw7, HLA-Bw62, and HLA-DR4.
