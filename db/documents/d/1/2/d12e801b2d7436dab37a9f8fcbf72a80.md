On histopathologic analysis, pleomorphic adenomas demonstrate proliferation of both epithelial and myoepithelial structures, arranged to form spindle and glandular/ductal structures with lumens. Surrounding this is a pseudocapsule of normal tissue, which may include areas of microscopic penetration of tumor cells.

Dacryops is seen microscopically as a dilated lacrimal gland cyst lined by normal glandular epithelial cells.

Benign lymphoid hyperplasia is a dense stroma of lymphocytes and macrophages without undifferentiated malignant cells. There are reactive lymphoid follicles similar to normal lymph nodes, with only mitotic cells isolated to the germinal centers.
