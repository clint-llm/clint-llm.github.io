While the sural nerve innervates the posterolateral calf and dorsolateral foot, it is least represented in the scientific literature of the five major nerves in the ankle. An electronic PubMed search utilizing keywords “sural nerve” and “regional anesthesia” only yielded six references. Perhaps, this observation may be due to the omission of the sural nerve block in certain foot surgeries as it only provides a small contribution to the forefoot. A study by Coe and colleagues performed 30 ankle blocks that excluded the sural nerve and reported that patients undergoing surgery medial to the third toe reported excellent anesthesia in all cases.

While both ultrasound-guided and traditional landmark-based approaches are utilized, one prospective randomized study by Redborg and colleagues investigated the efficacy of sural nerve block comparing both approaches. They reported that ultrasound guidance using the lesser saphenous vein as a reference point resulted in a more complete and longer lasting block compared to a traditional landmark approach.

Finally, some discrepancy exists in the literature regarding the amount of local anesthetic that is adequate to obtain a successful sural nerve block. Among the first studies describing this technique, McCutcheon only used 1 to 2 mL of local anesthetic.
