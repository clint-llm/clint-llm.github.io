The anatomy of the pancreas and nearby structures are of particular importance for understanding gallstone pancreatitis and surgical contraindications to pancreatic cancer.

The common bile duct enters the pancreas and merges with the main pancreatic duct, just prior to the ampulla of Vater, where they both empty into the second part of the duodenum through the major duodenal papilla.

The anatomy of both the pancreas and surrounding structures is critical for understanding the surgical indications and contraindications for pancreatic cancer. The head of the pancreas resides in the “C-loop” of the duodenum, with the uncinate process curling back and behind the superior mesenteric artery and vein.
