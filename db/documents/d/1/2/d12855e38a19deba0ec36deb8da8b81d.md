**Treating Hyperglycemia in Diabetes**

Diabetes is either the result of impaired insulin production or decreased insulin sensitivity. In addition to stimulating glucose uptake from the bloodstream, insulin is also a potent inhibitor of gluconeogenesis. Without adequate insulin production or the ability to respond to insulin properly, gluconeogenesis occurs at an unusually rapid rate, exacerbating hyperglycemia in the diabetic patient.

Metformin, the first-line agent for the management of type 2 diabetes, has been shown to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis through a variety of mechanisms. Metformin activates AMPK, which in turn inhibits hepatic lipogenesis and increases insulin sensitivity. AMPK activation also leads to increased cAMP breakdown, further inhibiting gluconeogenesis.

Metformin also appears to directly inhibit glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, leading to an increase in NADH levels.lactate dehydrogenase reaction will favor the formation of lactate over the formation of pyruvate, and lactate will begin to accumulate. Gluconeogenesis is inhibited without the oxidation of lactate to pyruvate.

At high doses, metformin also inhibits complex I of the electron transport chain, impairing ATP production necessary for highly endergonic processes (like gluconeogenesis) to take place.

**Hypoglycemia as a Result of Ethanol Consumption**

Ethanol cannot be eliminated from the human body without changes. To excrete ethanol, it must first be oxidized to form acetaldehyde by the liver enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, which utilizes NAD+ as an electron acceptor. Next, acetaldehyde must be further oxidized to form acetate (a molecule readily excreted by the body). This reaction, catalyzed by aldehyde dehydrogenase, also requires NAD+ as an electron acceptor. Thus, the metabolism of ethanol results in a significant accumulation of NADH.

If concentrations of NADH are high enough, the lactate dehydrogenase reaction will favor the formation of lactate over the formation of pyruvate, and lactate will begin to accumulate. Without the oxidation of lactate to pyruvate, gluconeogenesis is inhibited. As a consequence, heavy ethanol consumption can lead to both lactic acidosis and hypoglycemia.

**Hypoglycemia in the Preterm Infant**

Preterm infants are at a particularly high risk of developing hypoglycemia. Neonates of low birth weight have limited glycogen and fat stores, but also express gluconeogenic enzymes at sub-optimal levels. As such, preterm infants can deplete their energy stores quickly without mounting a proper counter-regulatory response.
