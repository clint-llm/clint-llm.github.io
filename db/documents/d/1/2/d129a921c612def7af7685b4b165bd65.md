When using busulfan, toxicity concerns are mostly associated with hepatic venous-occlusive disease, acute graft-versus-host disease, and chronic graft-versus-host disease. Most research indicates that maintaining the AUC between 78Â to 101 mg*h/L significantly increases the event-free survival for patients.

Treatment for hepatic venous-occlusive disease (also known as hepatic sinusoidal occlusive syndrome) includes defibrotide. Defibrotide is an antiplatelet agent and antithrombotic agent. Research has shown that 25 mg/kg/day of defibrotide IV for 21 days has been effective in treating hepatic venous-occlusive disease.
