Complications from baclofen toxicity are often secondary to severe CNS and respiratory depression. Anoxic brain injury, aspiration pneumonia, pressure ulcers, rhabdomyolysis, and hypothermia may be seen in patients with prolonged periods without medical intervention. Rhabdomyolysis may alsoÂ occur in patients with severe spasticity associated with baclofen withdrawal.
