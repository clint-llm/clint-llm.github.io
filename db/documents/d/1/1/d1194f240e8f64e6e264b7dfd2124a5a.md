A primary care clinician or emergency medical clinician may sometimes be the first to encounter a patient presenting with symptoms of NCS. Considering the differential diagnoses, complications, and different treatment strategies, it is crucial to consult promptly with an interprofessional team of specialists to improve outcomes. This may include an adult or pediatric urologist, nephrologist, obstetrician, gynecologist, interventional cardiologist, interventional radiologist, vascular surgeon, general surgeon, or transplant surgeon. Radiologists are essential to interpreting imaging modalities, including CT or MRI, to determine the cause. Sonographers play an essential role in obtaining doppler ultrasonography images. Nurses serve as vital team members in caring for, monitoring, and educating the patients before and after treatment.

Catheterization laboratory or operating room teams are critical in ensuring safe and effective endovascular or open surgery interventions. Pharmacists are necessary to conservative management involving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and to post-intervention anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy, and analgesics when indicated. This collaboration is especially important, as Carroll and Moll note that the potential benefit of keeping venous stents patent with antiplatelets is unknown, and guidelines related to venous stents are currently lacking because of insufficient evidence, rendering the need for clinical trials.

In recent years, de Macedo et al. and Velasquez et al. have performed systematic reviews and produced treatment approaches. (Level 1)
