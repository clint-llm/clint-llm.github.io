Lumateperone is a medication used to manage and treat schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. It is a second-generation atypical antipsychotic medication that exhibits a novel mechanism of action. Lumateperone's mechanism of action involves simultaneous modulation of dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic neurotransmission. This activity describes the indications, mechanism of action, and administration of lumateperone as a valuable treatment of schizophrenia. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse effect profile, and other key factors such as dosage and interactions for the interdisciplinary healthcare team responsible for treating individuals with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia.
- Summarize the recent findings of clinical trials involving lumateperone, a novel treatment for several neuropsychiatric disorders.
- Review important clinical factors relating to the use of lumateperone for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve patient outcomes affected by schizophrenia.
