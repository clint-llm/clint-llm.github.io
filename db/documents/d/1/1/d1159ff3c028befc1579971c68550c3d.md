Tunneled CVCs are typically placed by general or vascular surgeons or interventional radiologists (IR). If the surgeon or radiologist is not certified in conscious sedation, then an anesthesiologist or anesthetist should be present. When performed in an operating room, a scrub technician or registered nurse should be present and scrubbed in to assist. When performed by IR, a scrubbed technician is also required for assistance. An additional registered nurse should also be present in both the operating room and IR suite to monitor patient care and ensure all equipment is available. If the operating room does not have radiographic capabilities, an X-ray/fluoroscopic technician should be present to provide the required visualization for catheter placement.
