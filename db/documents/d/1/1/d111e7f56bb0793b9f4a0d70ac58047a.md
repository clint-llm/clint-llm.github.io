**Fundoplication**

The anterior vagal trunk and its branches are at considerable risk during surgeries involving the distal esophagus, stomach, proximal duodenum, biliary tract, and gallbladder. One such surgery is the fundoplication, often indicated in good surgical candidates who suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease refractory to medical therapy.

Investigators have experimented with severing the hepatic branch of the anterior vagal trunk while performing a fundoplication to determine the post-operative effects on the function of the gallbladder.Â This branch coming off the anterior vagal trunk innervates the liver, biliary apparatus, and provides motor innervation to the gallbladder (i.e., gallbladder contractile function).

A common and unfortunate post-operative side effect of this procedure is flatulence. A report published in September of 2019 by Cockbain et al. investigated the incidence of post-operative flatulence in patients who underwent primary laparoscopic fundoplication. The study entitled Flatulence After Anti-reflux Treatment (FAART) identified select patients who had this procedure done for symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease refractory to medical therapy from 1999 and 2009, and scrutinized incidence of flatulence at follow-up. At a follow-up of 8 to 15 years post-op, 85% of patients reported excessive flatulence. The study also concluded that flatulence was indeed worse in patients who had a total fundoplication in contrast to those who underwent a partial fundoplication. Although the incidence in this population was high, the overall impact on daily life was small.
