Apart from history and physical examination, psychophysical and medical imaging can also take place in the clinical assessment of a patient with gustatory disorder.

**Psychophysical evaluation**: This is essential to identify the patient's complaints and in measuring the degree of permanent taste loss. The clinician must also be sensitive to the psychological state of the patient. Depression can result from a taste problem or contribute to a taste complaint.

**Medical Imaging:**This is done to obtain anatomical and etiological diagnostic information. Imaging techniques help in ruling out or confirmÂ the presence of any damage to the structures of the central nervous system, particularly to the brain stem, thalamus, or pons.
