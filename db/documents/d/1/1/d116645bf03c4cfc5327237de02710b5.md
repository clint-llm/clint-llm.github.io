Pathophysiology is distinct and different based on the underlying etiology of inflammatory arthritis.  External or self-antigen leading to an immune-mediated inflammatory response by an influx of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages from the bloodstream into the synovial membrane and is associated with hyperplasia of synovial fibroblasts. In some cases, damage to the cartilage and bone can cause joint destruction. Direct invasion of the joint by an infectious organism resulting in the inflammation of the synovium is usually the underlying pathogenesis for most infectious arthritis.  Further, infectious agents such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, parvovirus B19 may trigger an immune response leading to the onset of inflammatory arthritis.
