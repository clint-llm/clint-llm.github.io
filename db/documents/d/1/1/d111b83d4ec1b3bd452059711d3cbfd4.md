Barrett's metaplasia occurs as a result of prolonged tissue injury in the esophagus due to chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). One of the risk factors of GERD and its complications has been the increase in obesity, especially central adiposity. The underlying mechanism may be linked to an increase in intra-abdominal pressure and elevated serum levels of pro-proliferative hormones. Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for both Barrett's metaplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma, but the association with alcohol is weak.

There are two large case-control studies of twins suggesting that the development of Barrett's esophagus in GERD is genetically predisposed.

Other studies have proposed the decreasing prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in western populations as a contributing factor for the development of Barrett's esophagus and resultant dysplastic changes. The lack of acid secretion in chronic atrophic gastritis associated with H. pylori infection may have been protective against GERD.
