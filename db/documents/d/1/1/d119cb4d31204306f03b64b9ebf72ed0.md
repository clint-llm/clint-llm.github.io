Struvite and triple phosphate renal calculi are formed as a result of urinary tract infection by urease-forming organisms. They grow rapidly and occupy the entire collecting system causing obstruction, chronic pyelonephritis, and renal failure. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of struvite stones and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the evaluation of triple phosphate renal calculi.
- Review the management options available for struvite and triple phosphate renal calculi.
- Outline the complications associated with struvite and triple phosphate renal calculi.
- Summarize some interprofessional team strategies to enhance communication and patient care in cases of triple phosphate renal calculi.
