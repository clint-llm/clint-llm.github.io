One of the hallmarks of Parkinson disease is alpha-synuclein containing Lewy body inclusions in the substantia nigra. Parkinson disease is a clinical diagnosis, but eosinophilic inclusions of alpha-synuclein as Lewy bodies are definitive.

Additionally, experimentation is underway to find a peripheral biomarker to identify Parkinson disease in patients. Real-time quaking-induced conversion assay functions by vigorous shaking and agitation to induce fibril formation of proteins. Research has revealed that biopsied submandibular gland tissue can be tested via real-time quaking-induced conversion assays for Parkinson disease with high specificity and sensitivity via pathological alpha-synuclein.
