Variation in the physiology of the tibiofibular syndesmosis is uncommon. However, two studies conducted recently explored anatomic variations concerning growth as well as CT characterization of anatomic morphology and structural differences in the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis.

Liu et al. described inconsistencies in reduction outcomes of the tibiofibular syndesmosis due to anatomical differences in morphology of the fibular incisura of the tibia. Variation in morphology was confirmed by CT imaging, and the authors described five morphologic variations of the fibular incisura: crescentic, trapezoid, widowâ€™s peak, flat, and chevron. Careful evaluation and measurements taken via CT imaging to account for these anatomical differences are integral in preventing malreduction of the syndesmosis.
