About 20 percent of people in the general population have an impairment of the sense of smell.

If there is a clear structural pathology in the nose or brain, treatment may be oriented toward the underlying lesion, such as functional endoscopic nasal surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis with polyposis or neurosurgical interventions for an anterior skull base tumor.

Medications such as corticosteroids for chronic rhinosinusitis and other inflammatory conditions may provide some relief from olfactory decline.

Several studies have described the efficacy of olfactory training.

Additionally, younger patients, patients with relatively well-preserved olfactory function, females, and non-smokers have a good chance of a spontaneous improvement of olfactory functioning.

Olfactory training is comparatively simple, and so far, serious side effects have not been reported. Although its precise mechanism of action and efficacy are incompletely understood, olfactory training is increasingly applied in routine care for patients with olfactory dysfunction of varying etiologies.
