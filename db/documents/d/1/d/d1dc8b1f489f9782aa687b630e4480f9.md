Hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients is uncommon. When it does occur,Â a critical illness, sustained alcohol use, malnutrition, and exogenous medications should be considered. Tumors may be a cause of hypoglycemia but are rare.

When addressing hypoglycemic episodes, keep in mind the possibility of postprandial hypoglycemia, as well as the Somogyi effect. The Somogyi effect results from insulin-induced hypoglycemia (particularly at night) and rebounds to hyperglycemia during the morning. Identifying this phenomenon is vital. When patients experience hypoglycemia particularly at night, this should be reported to the provider for the proper management of insulin in the diabetic patient.

Hypoglycemia is relatively common in neonates, particularly in mothers with uncontrolled diabetes. A 2017 study performed in Israel showed that 559 neonates out of 3595 neonates were observed to have a glucose level of less than 47 mg/dL.
