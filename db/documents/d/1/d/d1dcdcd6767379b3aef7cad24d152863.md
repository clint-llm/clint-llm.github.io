RecurrentÂ urinary tract infections (UTIs) are defined as two episodes of acute bacterial cystitis, along with associated symptoms within the last six months or three episodes within the last year.

A UTI has traditionally been defined as >100,000 colony forming units (CFU)/ml of urine associated with typical acute symptoms of dysuria, urgency, frequency, or suprapubic pain.E. coli with typical acute urinary symptoms has a positive predictive value of about 90%, suggesting that a lower CFU threshold may be more appropriate in diagnosing simple and recurrent UTIs.
