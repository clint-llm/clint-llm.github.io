# Introduction

Iron is a vital element for several metabolic pathways and physiological processes**.**

# Fundamentals

Transferrin divides into subgroups; these are serum transferrin, lactotransferrin, and melanotransferrin

# Cellular Level

Transferrin is a free peptide (apotransferrin) that undergoes a conformation change after binding with iron. Iron circulates in the plasma until it attaches to a transferrin receptor on a target cell. A carbonate (CO) has to be present to help attract iron to transferrin by creating opposing repulsive charges. Transferrin can bind to two atoms of ferric iron (Fe3+) with high affinity. The carbonate needed also serves as a ligand to stabilize iron in the binding site of transferrin. Clathrin/receptor-mediated endocytosis mediates the uptake of iron by transferrin receptors

# Molecular Level

Transferrin is a monomeric 80kDA glycoprotein, which consists of two homologous lobes called N- and C- lobes

# Function

Functions of transferrin include:

- Free Fe3+ is insoluble at a neutral pH; when iron binds to transferrin, it becomes soluble.

- Deliver and transfer iron to all the various biological tissues between sites of absorption, utilization, and storage

- Prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species.

- Chelate-free toxic iron and acts as a protective scavenger.

- Deliver WBC macrophages to all tissues

- Transferrin is a part of the innate immune system; the binding of transferrin to iron impedes bacterial survival.

- Transferrin acts as a marker for inflammation; the level of transferrin decreases during inflammation.

# Mechanism

The process of offloading iron-bound transferrin begins with transferrin binding to its cell surface transferrin receptor. It starts with the formation of clathrin-coated pits and the internalization of the vesicle into the cytoplasm. The coated vesicle loses its clathrin coat due to a reduction in pH.  The reduction of pH by hydrogen ion proton pumps (H+ ATPase) to a pH of 5.5 causes the dissociation of iron-bound transferrin vesicle to release its iron ions. Also, the binding of transferrin to transferrin receptors reduces its affinity for iron.  Two pathways can occur once endocytosed–degradation or recycling pathways

# Testing

The laboratory's reference range for transferrin is 204-360 mg/dL. Transferrin can be used to assess the iron level in the body along with other markers in the body. Transferrin level testing is used to determine the cause of anemia, examine iron metabolism and determine the iron-carrying capacity of the blood. Transferrin saturation levels cannot be interpreted alone. They are used in conjunction with other laboratory tests, such as serum ferritin and TIBC. Ferritin is the first marker to become low, therefore, more sensitive than transferrin in diagnosing Iron deficiency anemia

# Clinical Significance

Iron deficiency is recognized as the most prevalent nutritional deficit in the world.   The amount of transferrin in the blood indicates the amount of iron in the body.  High transferrin signifies low iron, which means there is less iron bound to transferrin, allowing for a high circulation of non-bound iron transferrin in the body, revealing a possible iron deficiency anemia. The liver increases the production of transferrin as a form of homeostasis to enable transferrin to bind to iron and transport it to the cells. Upregulation of transferrin receptors occurs in iron deficiency anemia

In anemia of chronic disease, there is a decreased transferrin level.

Causes of low transferrin

- Liver damage leading to reduced production of transferrin

- Kidney insult or injury leads to loss of transferrin in urine.

- Infection

- Malignancy

- Atransferrinemia: A genetic mutation resulting in the absence of transferrin, which leads to hemosiderosis in the heart and liver, which can lead to heart and liver failure. This condition is treated by plasma infusion.

Low transferrin in plasma indicates iron overload, which means the binding site of transferrin is highly saturated with iron.  Iron overload suggests hemochromatosis, which will lead to the deposition of iron on tissues.

Other associations with transferrin and its receptors include,

- Diminishing tumor cells when the receptor is used to attract antibodies

- High transferrin saturation increased the risk of cardiovascular mortality if patients have high transferrin saturation (>55%) and LDL levels
