The choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle is derived from the anterior choroidal artery, a branch of the internal carotid artery; and the posterior choroidal artery, which is a branch of the posterior cerebral artery.

The blood vessels contributing to the formation of the choroid plexus of the third ventricle are derived from the posterior choroidal arteries.

Choroid plexus within the fourth ventricle receive their blood supply from anterior and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries, a part of the vertebrobasilar system.
