Misdiagnosis results in prolonged observation which may result in more extensive local growth of the lesion. Perineural, hematogenous, or lymphatic spread may also develop the following misdiagnosis. Iatrogenic complications from periocular surgery and radiotherapy carryÂ a number of risks.

- Lagophthalmos

- Symblepharon

- Eyelid retraction

- Ptosis

- Ectropion

- Entropion

- Trichiasis

- Dry eye syndrome from exposure, aqueous deficiency, or evaporation

- Damage to the nasolacrimal system

- Diplopia

- Globe injury & damage to surrounding structures

- Orbital hemorrhage

- Infection

- Poor tissue healing (primarily with radiotherapy)

- Poor cosmetic outcome

- Psychologic distress

Each immunologic and chemotherapeutic agent carries specific complications, and physicians should work closely with oncologists and pharmacists when considering treatment options.
