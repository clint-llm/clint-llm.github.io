Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) should be under strict supervision by an APL experienced physician, facility as well as supportive services to monitor drug tolerance and toxicity properly as there can be severe adverse reactions to taking oral tretinoin.

**Topical Use Monitoring**

Monitor for hypersensitivity, photosensitivity, and any other skin irritation or allergies.

**Systemic Use Monitoring**

Monitor APL for side effects (including major, life-threatening side effects such as retinoic acid (RA-APL) syndrome and leukocytosis) and response to treatment.

Monthly follow-ups visits are required. Complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential, lipid panel, liver function tests (LFTs), PT/INR need frequent checking. Fasting lipid checks are recommended weekly or biweekly to monitor lipid response, but this is relative to the individual's health. Asymptomatic, young patients without a personal or significant family history of dyslipidemia or diabetes mellitus require less frequent laboratory draws mentioned above.

Clinical assessment of the following areas is necessary to assess for treatment response and adverse effects:

- Perceived worsening/improvement of acne

- Muscle or bone pain

- Dryness of skin or mucous membranes

- Headaches

- Mood changes, depression symptoms, or suicidality

- Nosebleeds

- Vision changes

- Abdominal pain

- Bowel symptoms

**Women of Childbearing Age**

Monthly follow-up visits are typical to fulfill the requirements of the iPLEDGE program (a program to eliminate fetal exposure to isotretinoin).

Due to tretinoin teratogenicity, women of childbearing potential are recommended the use two dependable forms of contraception while on oral tretinoin therapy for APL and one month following discontinuation of treatment; monitoring for pregnancy and contraception counseling repeated monthly while on medication.

Within one week before starting this medication, a serum or urine pregnancy test should be collected and tested with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within one week.

Delay of treatment should occur until obtaining a negative pregnancy result. If treatment cannot be delayed (in the case of APL treatment), the patient should use two forms of contraception.
