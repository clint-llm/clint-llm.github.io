Management of polyarticular arthritis is indeed a collaborative effort. Primary care physicians, nurses, pharmacists, rheumatologists, orthopedic surgeons, neurologists, physical and occupational therapist, radiologists, pathologists, many other subspecialists, and rehabilitation doctors are all involved in the process, and each contributes to diagnosis and management. Each focuses on their area of expertise and relay the relevant information to all the others in the team. Individualized input and management in the setting of a problem that can originate from a variety of different pathologies are limited and misleading.
