Indications for the use of sural nerve grafts are similar to indications for other nerve grafts; however, due to the advantages sural nerve grafting offers over some other autologous nerve graft options, it is frequently a reconstructive surgeon's preferred choice, particularly when repairing longer defects.

Nerve grafts are commonly employed when there is a segmental loss of a motor or sensory nerve greater than 1Â to 2 cm in length because judicious mobilization of the nerve stumps can frequently decrease or eliminate smaller gaps, and hollow conduits only provide reliable results for gaps <5 mm.

In recent years, nerve grafts have been used for corneal neurotization in patients suffering from neurotrophic keratitis.
