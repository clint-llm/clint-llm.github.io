Many nerves of the lumbar plexus provide sensation to the thigh, including the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN). The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is usually derived from the dorsal branches of the L2 and L3 ventral rami. It appears from under the lateral border of the psoas major and travels towards the notch on the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), exiting the lesser pelvis by passing under the inguinal ligament. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve branches into anterior and posterior divisions and provides sensation to the anterolateral and lateral thigh, respectively. The pathology associated with the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is meralgia paresthetica, also known as Bernhardt-Roth syndrome, which is characterized by loss of sensation on the anterolateral and lateral thigh and has numerous etiologies, including obesity, diabetes, and tight clothing.
