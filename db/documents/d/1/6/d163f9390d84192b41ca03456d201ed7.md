Isoniazid can be administered to patients with stable liver disease, although the risk for drug accumulation and drug-induced hepatitis may increase. These patients should have more frequent monitoring.

It is contraindicated for patients who develop severe hypersensitivity reactions to isoniazid or any other components of formulations. It is also contraindicated for the patients with drug-induced hepatitis or patients who previously reported isoniazid-associated hepatic injury.
