Pediatric imaging relies heavily on morphological imaging using mostly nonionizing radiation techniques such as ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Computed tomography (CT) and nuclear medicine (NM) techniques still hold value and are used in high-yield indications. Although nuclear medicine exams have been around for a century, it is only with recent software and hardware improvements that they have gained an impactful clinical role.

Even though the Society for Nuclear Medicine was founded in 1954, the pediatric nuclear medicineÂ organization known nowadays as the Pediatric Council was only created in the 1970s; we can date to 1946 an NRC report in pediatrics looking at radioisotopes in thyroid pathology. The American medical association (AMA) recognized nuclear medicine as an independent specialty in 1971, leading to the creation of the American Board of Nuclear Medicine (ABNM). The various modalities of nuclear medicine in children have led to prompt diagnosis, selection of appropriate procedures, and treatment resulting in improved outcomes.
