Many patients with esophageal reflux do well with medications, but relapse after stopping medical treatment is common and indicates the need for long-term maintenance therapy. In refractory cases or when complications related to reflux disease are identified (e.g., stricture, aspiration, airway disease, Barrett esophagus), surgical treatment (fundoplication) is typically necessary. The prognosis with surgery is considered excellent. The surgical morbidity and mortality are higher in patients who have complex medical problems in addition to esophageal reflux.Â About 10% of patients with reflux develop Barrett esophagus, a precursor for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
