Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) provides a correlation between anesthetic dose and immobility. It can be applied to all inhalational anesthetics and is used to compare anesthetic potency.

Before the concept of MAC, the Meyer-Overton relationship was well established; it stated that all fat-soluble agents would function as anesthetics due to their ability to cross the lipid bilayer of neurons.

- MAC x Lamda is about 1.82 atmospheres

Where Lamda equals the olive oil/gas partition coefficient for the volatile anesthetic.
