Despite extensive screening protocols for detecting viruses and other infections, the risk of transmission of various blood-borne infections cannot be excluded.

Studies have shown some rare adverse effects seen in very few subjects who received replacement therapy with von Willebrand factor: mild infusion site paresthesia, moderate dysgeusia, moderate tachycardia, mild generalized pruritus, and hot flush. Few serious adverse events were noted, such as mild ECG T-wave inversion, chest discomfort, and increased heart rate. There is also a risk of developing alloantibodies such asÂ anti-VWF binding antibodies; FVIII neutralizing antibodies was noted post replacement therapy.

There can be high levels of FVIII in the plasma when multiple closely spaced infusions are given in cases of severe bleeding or prophylactically before major surgeries. This accumulation is due to exogenous FVIII infused with the concentrate mixture along with an increase in endogenous FVIII synthesized by the infused vWF. There is concern that such high levels of persistent FVIII may increase the risk of postoperative thrombotic events such as deep vein thrombosis.
