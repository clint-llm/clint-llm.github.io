Before starting treatment with lithium, it is essential to get kidney function tests and thyroid function tests. In patients above 50 years of age, an electrocardiogram is also necessary. Repeat these tests once or twice a year in patients on lithium therapy. Because lithium is associated with weight gain, it is important to weigh a patient before starting treatment. It is also beneficial to determine if the patient has prediabetes, diabetes, or dyslipidemia.

Monitoring of therapeutic levels includes trough plasma levels drawn 8 to 12 hours after the last dose. The therapeutic range is 1.0 to 1.5 mEq/L for acute treatment and 0.6 to 1.2 mEq/L for chronic therapy. Monitoring should be done every 1 to 2 weeks until reaching the desired therapeutic levels. Then, check lithium levels every 2 to 3 months for six months. It is also important to monitor patients for dehydration and lower the dose when there are signs of infection, excessive sweating, or diarrhea. Toxic levels are when the drug level is more than 2 mEq/L.
