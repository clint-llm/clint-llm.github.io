**Continence:**functional voiding outcomes must be assessed in terms of the dry period and continence. But, there is no universally accepted definition of urinary continence. According to the Johns Hopkins group, continence wasÂ defined as the dry period of at least 3 hours during the day, dry during the night, able to void without clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), and no need for augmentation. They have shown that 70% of their patients had continence as per this definition.

**Upper tract damage:**hydronephrosis or upper tract dilatation is commonly seen after the repair of exstrophy. After CPRE, it was seen in 53% of the patients during follow-up. Overall, 30% had bilateral hydronephrosis. Male gender is associated with worse renal outcomes.

**Sexual function:**the majority of the patients have a normal long-term sexual function. Fertility, which is normal in females, is significantly low in males. Patients who have undergone diversion procedures have better ejaculatory function and fertility as compared to those who have undergone reconstructive procedures.
