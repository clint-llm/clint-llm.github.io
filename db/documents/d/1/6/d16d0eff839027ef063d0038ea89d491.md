As stated above, empty sella syndrome falls into two categories: primary empty sella syndrome and secondary empty sella syndrome.

PES is the less common of the two entities. Currently, its cause is not entirely understood, but researchers have proposed several mechanisms, including incompetence or complete absence of the diaphragma sellae, chronic intracranial hypertension, small vessel disease, and temporary expansion followed by regression of the pituitary gland.

Incompetent diaphragma sellae has been the finding in the vast majority of PES in autopsy reports. The anomalous diaphragma sellae allows the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the sella turcica, causing remodeling and enlargement of the sella turcica as well as flattening of the pituitary gland.

Intracranial hypertension is also thought to increase the likelihood of herniation of CSF into the sella turcica, especially if the diaphragma sellae is already compromised. The most common neuroimaging finding in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (also known as pseudotumor cerebri) is empty sella.

The last proposed mechanism causing empty sella involves an initial enlargement of the pituitary gland followed by a later decrease in gland size, creating an empty space where CSF can accumulate.

SES, on the other hand, is much more common than PES. It could be the result of treating a pituitary adenoma (by either drugs, surgery, or radiotherapy), spontaneous regression of the pituitary gland under different circumstances, postpartum pituitary necrosis (also known as Sheehan syndrome), or lymphocytic hypophysitis.
