Clinically, phyllodes tumors tend to present as unilateral firm, enlarging painless breast masses that stretch the overlying skin with striking distension of superficial veins.

The size may range from 1 to 45 cm and may occupy the entire breast.

Bloody nipple discharge caused by spontaneous infarction of the tumor has been described.

Ulceration and nipple retraction are uncommon.

Although axillary lymphadenopathy is common, nodal metastases are the exception.
