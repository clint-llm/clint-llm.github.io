The addition of a simulation technician to a simulation-based healthcare education team positively impacts the team's ability to deliver quality simulations, and to evaluate those simulation activities accurately.  One study utilizing the principles of cognitive load theory found that instructors included technical challenges and global team function as feedback when a technician was not present during the simulation.  When a technician was present for the simulation, the feedback centered around "content-based, specific observations of learners."

The recommendation is that simulation-based healthcare education teams include an educator, a content expert, and a simulation technician.
