Infliximab is a type of biological therapy/immunotherapy designed to stimulate our body's immune system and treat certain diseases. Infliximab is a purified, recombinant DNA-derived chimeric IgG monoclonal antibody protein that contains both murine and human components that inhibit tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a).

Infliximab has a high affinity for TNF-alpha and does not inhibit TNF-beta. TNF-alpha is responsible for a number of physiological responses, including inducing proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1 and IL-6), increasing adhesion molecule release, and enhancing the migration of leukocytes from blood vessels into the surrounding tissue (via increased endothelial permeability.)
