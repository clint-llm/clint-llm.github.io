Ingrown toenail, also known as onychocryptosis or unguius incarnatus, is the most common nail problem encountered in podiatry, general family practice, and dermatology.

An ingrown toenail occurs when the nail plate grows into the periungual skin and causes inflammation and infection. It causes considerable pain, discomfort, and disability if left untreated. An ingrown toenail may present at any age, but most commonly it affects teenagers and young adults. The hallux nails are the most frequent location.

Management options range from conservative treatments to extensive surgical approaches, depending on the severity and the stage of the condition.
