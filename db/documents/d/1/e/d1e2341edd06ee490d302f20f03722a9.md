The only contraindication to performing a gastrojejunostomy is when the procedure cannot be safely performed, or the odds of anastomotic leak is very high.

The procedure is unable to be performed safely in the setting of extensive adhesions, massive ascites, abdominal carcinomatosis, extensive gastric varices, or if the anatomy is very altered from previous procedures. These are all relative contraindications, and it is up to the attending surgeon to determine if the procedure can be performed with less severe complications in the setting of these issues.

The primary reason for an unacceptably high risk ofÂ an anastomotic leak is malnutrition, particularly in patients that have gastric malignancy or ulcers. If there is a concern for malnutrition in a patient that requires a gastrojejunostomy, then nutritional labs should be checked and, if low, parenteral or enteral nutrition via a distal feeding tube should be initiated and the malnutrition corrected before performing the procedure.
