Suprascapular neuropathy is very difficult to diagnose from history and physical examination alone. As such, further evaluation with imaging and diagnostic testing, including electrodiagnostic testing and nerve blocks, is warranted.

Initially, plain radiographs should be obtained to evaluate for possible osseous abnormalities that are impinging on the nerve or other comorbid shoulder conditions, such as arthritis or evidence of dislocation or subluxation.

MRI can be helpful in the evaluation of suprascapular neuropathy given its ability to assess for indirect signs of SSN injury such as areas of soft tissue compression as well as the quality of the rotator cuff musculature looking for areas of muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration.

Musculoskeletal ultrasound can be particularly useful in diagnosis for not only visualizing the nerve course and performing a dynamic muscle and nerve exam, but also for guidance for an SSN block.

With ultrasound, the SSN is best visualized during in its supraclavicular course as this is when the nerve is most superficial. It has been suggested that the most useful visualization of the nerve is in the coronal plane over the suprascapular fossa between the spinoglenoid and scapular notch. However, using the anatomic landmarks of the nerve’s origin at the interscalene triangle, the first rib, the lateral supraclavicular fossa below the omohyoid muscle, the supraspinatus fossa, and the spinoglenoid notch, it has been shown that the nerve can be accurately followed through its entire course until its termination in the infraspinatus fossa.

Injection of an anesthetic to the suprascapular or spinoglenoid notch with resultant pain relief helps support the diagnosis of suprascapular neuropathy. Using ultrasound to guide the procedure allows for accurate localization and delivery of medication, with one study showing correct placement, 95% of the time using cadavers (Video 1). Gorthi et al. found that compared to a blind SSN block, ultrasound guidance improved localization and provided significantly longer-lasting relief for patients in one month.

The gold standard for diagnosis and confirmation of suprascapular neuropathy is electrodiagnostic evaluation, including nerve conduction studies (NCS) and EMG. This test can specifically focus on the SSN and its innervations. Findings on electrodiagnostic evaluation that suggest compression and denervation of the SSN include prolonged latency, decreased amplitude, fibrillation potentials, and positive sharp waves.
