Sitosterolemia is aÂ rare condition in which the body absorbs an excessive amount of plant sterols.

The pathophysiologic mechanism of sitosterolemia is the result of a genetic mutation. The genes ABCG5 and ABCG8 encode for the ABC transporter proteins. Specifically, they encode for sterolin-1 and sterolin-2. If a mutation exists in either of these two genes, the ABC transporter may become defunct. This condition is an autosomal recessive disorder.
