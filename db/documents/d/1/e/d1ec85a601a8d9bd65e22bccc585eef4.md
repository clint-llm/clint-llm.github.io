History gathering will often reveal reported episodes of binge drinking of four or five or more drinks at a time. Use of the CAGE questionnaire will reveal a score of 2 or greater. CAGE means (1) have you ever felt you should **Cut**down on your drinking, (2) have you ever been**Annoyed**by people criticizing your drinking, (3) have you ever felt**Guilty**about your alcohol use, or (4) have you ever needed an**Eye-opener**to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover. The patient may also report frequent falls, blackout spells, unsteadiness, or visual disturbances. They may report seizures if they went a few days without drinking, or tremors, confusion, emotional disturbances, and frequent job changes. They may also report social issues, such as job termination, separation/divorce, estrangement from family, or loss of home. They may also report sleep disturbances.

The patient may have hypertension (HTN) or insomnia initially. In later stages, the patient may complain of nausea/vomiting, hematemesis, abdominal distension, epigastric pain, weight loss, jaundice, or other symptoms or signs suggestive of liver dysfunction. They may be asymptomatic early on.

To screen for alcohol use disorder, the following tools are recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force:

- Abbreviated 3 question audit test

- The 10 question alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT)

- Single question screening

They may exhibit signs of cerebellar dysfunction, such as ataxia or difficulty with fine motor skills, on exam. They may exhibit slurred speech, tachycardia, memory impairment, nystagmus, disinhibited behavior, or hypotension. They may present with tremors, confusion/mental status changes, asterixis, ruddy palms, jaundice, ascites, or other signs of advanced liver disease. There may also be spider angiomata, hepatomegaly/splenomegaly (early; liver becomes cirrhotic and shrunken in advanced disease). They may develop bleeding disorders, anemia, gastritis/ulcers, or pancreatitis as complications of alcohol use. Labs will reveal anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, hyponatremia, hyperammonemia, elevated ammonia levels, or decreased B12/folate levels as the advanced liver disease develops.
