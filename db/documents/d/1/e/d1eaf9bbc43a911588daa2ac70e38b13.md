Elbow fractures are more common in the pediatric population than in the adult population. Children often utilize an outstretched arm as a protective mechanism when falling, creating a high incidence of fractures about the elbow. Supracondylar fractures of the humerus account for up to 18% of pediatric fractures and 60% of elbow fractures. Despite evolutions in the evaluation and treatment over the years, these fractures still pose considerable challenges to orthopedic surgeons. This activity reviews the mechanism of injury, classification, and management of these injuries in the pediatric population and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical and radiological features of non-displaced and displaced supracondylar humerus fractures.
- Identify neurovascular injuries associated with supracondylar humerus fractures.
- Describe the management of non-displaced and displaced supracondylar humerus fractures, including those with neurovascular compromise.
- Outline the long-term sequelae of these injuries, including deformity and remodeling potential. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving the care of patients with supracondylar humerus fractures.
