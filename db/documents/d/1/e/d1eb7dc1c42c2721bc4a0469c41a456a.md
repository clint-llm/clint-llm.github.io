Pentobarbital administration can be through three routes: intramuscular, intravenous, or oral. For intramuscular administration, it is advised to inject no more than 5 ml and only into a large muscle to avoid tissue irritation or necrosis. Intravenous administration is not to exceed 50 mg/minute and should only be given by slow IV injection in the undiluted form.
