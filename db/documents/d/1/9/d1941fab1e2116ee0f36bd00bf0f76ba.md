It is essential to obtain an accurate description of the pain. The history of a patient with cervical discogenic pain syndrome can vary greatly. Patients may have pain that is localized, referred, or even experience radiation across a specific dermatome. It is typically worse in positions involved in prolonged sitting. This pain is especially noticeable with prolonged flexion or with a protruded head posture. Bending can exacerbate this pain. Patients usually find improvement in pain with lying supine as it decreases pressure on the discs. Some may find relief following frequent positional changes. It may be worse in the morning, secondary to inappropriate postural positions while sleeping.

Physical examination should include assessment for a disease presentation similar to myelopathy. Patients should be observed and examined for neurological deficits, including altered balance, motor/sensory deficits in all extremities, and upper/lower motor neuron findings. Strength and reflexes can be intact, but these findings may vary depending on the cause and degree of the condition. Patients may experience decreased sensation along a specific dermatome. They may have poor posture and limited range of motion.

The exam may include the following provocative tests in the examination of the spine:

- Spurling test may be performed by passive neck extension with rotation and lateral flexion of the neck towards the affected side. A positive test with reproducible pain may be indicative of cervical radiculopathy.

- Lhermitte test may be performed by neck flexion with the patient in a sitting position. A positive test will produce an electric shock-like sensation down the spine and/or arm and may be indicative of cervical spondylosis or myelopathy.

- A shoulder abduction relief sign may be performed by having the patient actively abduct their shoulder rest their hand on top of their head. A positive test is relief (or decrease) of radicular pain with this maneuver and may be indicative of cervical radiculopathy.

- Arm squeeze test may be performed by squeezing the middle one-third of the upper arm. If pain is elicited, it may indicate the etiology of the shoulder pain to be cervical rather than a shoulder pathology.
