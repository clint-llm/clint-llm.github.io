The peak incidence of dental trauma occurs in the 7-11-year age group, with a male to female ratio of 2:1.

Falls are the most common cause of dental trauma, followed by cycling accidents, full-contact sports, and assaults. Bemelmans reported that at least 32% of athletes involved in full-contact sports had experienced some form of injury to their dentition. The most high-risk sports for dental injury are ice hockey, football, lacrosse, rugby, martial arts, and skating. Helmets have not decreased the incidence of dental trauma, but mouth guards have. Dental trauma in younger children should always raise the suspicion of abuse.
