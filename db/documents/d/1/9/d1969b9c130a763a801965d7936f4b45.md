Erythrocytes, red blood cells (RBC), are the functional component of blood responsible for the transportation of gases and nutrients throughout the human body. Their unique shape and composition allow for these specialized cells to carry out their essential functions. The role of the erythrocyte is critical in investigating many disease processes in a variety of body systems. Their structure, function, physiology, preparation, microscopy and clinical importance are the subject of this review article.
