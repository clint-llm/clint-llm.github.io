Premature ejaculation is the most frequently encountered sexual dysfunction worldwide.

Although premature ejaculation can occur at any adult age, it is most commonly reported in the 18 to 30-year-old age group and, together with erectile dysfunction, in the 45 to 65-year age group. Ethnically, premature ejaculation may be more prevalent among African Americans (34%) compared to Hispanics (27%) or Whites (29%).

Internationally, the estimated incidence in Europe and India is similar to the United States.
