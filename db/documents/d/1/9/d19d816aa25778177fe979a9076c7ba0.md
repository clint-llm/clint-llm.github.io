Initially, all patients with subaxial cervical spine fractures require immobilization in a rigid cervical orthosis.

Patients with fractures deemed unstable or neurologic compromise should undergo decompression and stabilization. Intervention within 24 hours of injury leads to better improvement in ASIA scores.

True compression fractures with no posterior ligamentous or capsular involvement can be treated nonoperatively in a hard cervical orthosis. If there is posterior ligamentous or capsular involvement, surgery for stabilization is indicated.

Burst fractures with retropulsion in the canal are different than a true compression fracture. Inline cervical traction can often reduce burst fractures and decrease bony retropulsion in the canal. These fractures are often unstable and often associated with neurologic symptoms, and most of the time, require surgical fixation.

A timely closed reduction of facet dislocations with cervical traction is appropriate in an awake and alert patientÂ who can undergo serial neurologic exams during the reduction.

When caring for a patient with AS, upon initial evaluation, they may not have a neurologic deficit. However, they require monitoring. Seemingly small fractures can lead to progressive neurologic deterioration in these patients.
