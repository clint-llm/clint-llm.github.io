Immunoglobulins (Ig) or antibodies are glycoproteins produced by plasma cells. B cells are instructed by specific immunogens, for example, bacterial proteins, to differentiate into plasma cells, which are protein-making cells that participate in humoral immune responses against bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, cellular antigens, chemicals, and synthetic substances. The immunogen or antigen reacts with a B-cell receptor (BCR) on the cell surface of B lymphocytes. A signal is produced that directs the activation of transcription factors to stimulate the synthesis of antibodies, which are highly specific for the immunogen that stimulated the B cell. Furthermore, one clone of a B cell makes an immunoglobulin (specificity). Besides, the immune system remembers the antigens that caused a previous reaction (memory) due to the development of memory B cells. These are intermediate, differentiated B cells that can quickly become plasma cells. In addition, circulating antibodies recognize antigens in tissue fluids and serum. This activity describes the physiology and pathophysiology of immunoglobulins.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the function of immunoglobulins.
- Outline disorders associated with immunoglobulin deficiencies.
- Summarize the presentation of patients with immunoglobulin deficiency.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients with immunoglobulin deficiency.
