Factor VIII (FVIII) serves as a cofactor to factor IX (FIX) for the conversion of factor X (FX) to Xa and hence leading to the production of thrombin on the activated plateletsâ€™ surface. Factor VIII is a 330-kDa precursor protein. The proteolytic processing converts the domain structure of factor VIII from A1-a1-A2-a2-B-a3-A3-C1-C2 into heterodimers of heavy and light chains. Most of the acquired inhibitors of FVIII bind to the A2, A3, or C2 domains. The domains A2 and A3 are responsible for factor VIII binding to factors IXa and X, while the domain C2 binds factor VIII to the phospholipids and von Willebrand factor. Autoantibodies that develop in patients with acquired hemophilia are non-complement fixing as well as non-precipitating, belong to the IgG class (mostly IgG1 and IgG4).

These antibodies bind to the domains in time and the temperature-dependent manner in second-order kinetics. However, they do not result in complete factor VIII inactivation invitro; the measurable factor activity offers little if no clinical benefit in controlling hemorrhage.
