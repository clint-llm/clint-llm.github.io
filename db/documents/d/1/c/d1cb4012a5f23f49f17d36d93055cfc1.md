Velocardial facial syndrome requires an interprofessional team approach to take care of the patient. The syndrome has features that span many fields, including medical genetics, pediatrics, psychiatry, endocrinology, speech pathology, neurology, orthopedics, ophthalmology, family medicine, cardiovascular surgery, gastroenterology, and immunology.

The expectations for each stage of development should be discussed early on with parents, with a particular emphasisÂ on their specific child's phenotype. Even within families, the presenting symptoms can range wildly, so care should ideally be tailored to the individual patient.
