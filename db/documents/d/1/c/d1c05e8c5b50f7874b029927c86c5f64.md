Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, resulting in loss of oligodendrocytes, astroglial scarring, and axonal injury (end-stage). Disease-modifying drugs help minimize long-term disability for people with MS by decreasing CNS inflammation, reducing the frequency and severity of acute attacks, delaying disease progression, and improving the overall quality of life. This activity covers cladribine, an established oral chemotherapy agent that the FDA recently approved for relapsing MS.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of cladribine.
- Describe the adverse effects of cladribine therapy.
- Discuss relevant landmark clinical trials supporting the use of cladribine for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication to improve patient-centered outcomes in patients treated with cladribine.
