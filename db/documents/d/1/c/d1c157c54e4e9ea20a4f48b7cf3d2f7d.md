Acute cholangitis is a condition caused by acute inflammation and infection of the biliary duct system as well as the obstruction of biliary flow that leads to increased bacteria and endotoxins in the vascular and lymphatic drainage systems. Normally as bile flows through the biliary duct system, the bile duct epithelium secretes IgA, which is an anti-adherent factor towards bacteria to flush out the ducts. However, when the intra-biliary pressure exceeds the bacteriostatic abilities of the biliary epithelium, this leads to increased inflammation and infection, leading to potentially fatal complications such as biliary septicemia and hepatic abscesses.

As for biliary obstruction, which is most commonly due to underlying mechanical cholestasis such as choledocholithiasis, it is partially believed that the cholesterol bile ductal stones are colonized by a biofilm by a bacterial pathogen and upon multiplication is thought to lead to obstruction-induced mucosa inflammatory cytokine production. Primary bile duct stones are thought to be caused by the biliary infection itself, with both processes leading to ascending infection throughout the biliary system.
