Careful evaluation of the posterior corneal tissues with slit-lamp biomicroscope allows immediate, in-office visualization of the polymorphous lesions.

- Polymorphous lesions may be visualized at the biomicroscope with moderate to high magnification using direct or, preferentially, retro-illumination techniques.

- Specular microscopy enables high-resolution imaging of the characteristic findings associated with PPCD within Descemet membrane and endothelial layer.

- Endothelial cell count can be diminished. The remaining endothelium demonstrates structural pleomorphic irregularities.

- Confocal microscopy is of value in definitively identifying features characteristic of PPCD.

- Careful intraocular pressure measurement is necessary to screen for glaucoma.

- Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) images any abnormalities associated with aberrant endothelium bridging the anatomic angle.

- As an autosomal dominant entity, examination of family members may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.
