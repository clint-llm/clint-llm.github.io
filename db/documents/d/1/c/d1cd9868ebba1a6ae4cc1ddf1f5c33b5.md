The testicular arteries supply blood to the testes. They arise from the anterolateral segment of the abdominal aorta just below the origin of the renal arteries. The vessels travel in the retroperitoneum and cross over the ureter, pass through the deep inguinal ring, and join the spermatic cord.Â  Additional blood supply to the testes comes from the artery of the vas deferens and the cremasteric artery.

Venous drainage from the testes is via the pampiniform plexus which lies anterior to the vas deferens. The veins converge superiorly to form the testicular vein. The right testicular vein joins the vena cava, and the left testicular vein drains into the left renal vein. Drainage of the lymphatics from the testes follows the same path as the testicular arteries and drain to the preaortic lymph nodes.
