Clinically, disease states and environmental factors, such as smoking, all play a major role in the increase of dead space. Increases in dead space can be seen in lung disease states including emphysema, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Emphysema results in the enlargement of air spaces and decreases in the diffusing capacity of the alveolar membrane due to the destruction of alveolar walls. In ARDS there is endothelial damage leading to an increase in the alveolar-capillary permeability, thereby leading to leakage of protein-rich fluid into the alveolar. This results in the formation of intra-alveolar hyaline membranes, which decrease the exchange of CO2 and O2 in the lung contributing to a larger dead space. Studies looking at the causes of death in this disease have shown an increase in dead space in the non-survivors versus survivors. The strongest association of an increased volume of dead space with mortality risk is seen in patients with ARDS.

Clinicians use the understanding of dead space to manage mechanically ventilated patients. Even in a healthy patient, ventilation via an endotracheal tube will increase the dead space volume because the breathing circuit does not participate in gas exchange. During mechanical ventilation, capnography is used; this records the volume of expired CO2, a value used to determine the physiologic dead space in patients. Adjustments in ventilation rates and the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) are used to decrease dead space. Although multiple studies have failed to show this expected effect consistently, it is still widely used in cases of ARDS. Proper use of mechanical ventilation, as well as PEEP, is important considering both have been implicated in causing lung injury. Also, the use of high-flow nasal cannula has been shown to decrease dead space in patients with acute and chronic respiratory diseases. This is largely due to decreasing rebreathing in the existing anatomic dead space. Understanding dead space and being able to calculate it is a vital tool for physicians dealing with ventilated, critically ill patients.
