Damage to the liver is permanent. Nevertheless, further injury to the liver should be avoided to halt the progression of the disease. General management to prevent chronic liver disease includes avoidance of alcohol, vaccination for HBV and HCV, good nutrition with a balanced diet, weight reduction, and early treatment of precipitating factors like dehydration, hypotension, and infections. This is achieved by routine monitoring of volume status, kidney function, varices development, and progression to HCC.

Specific therapy usually targets the etiology, including antiviral medications in viral hepatitis, steroids, and immunosuppressant agents in autoimmune hepatitis, ursodeoxycholic acid and obeticholic acid in primary biliary cholangitis, copper chelation in Wilson disease, and iron chelation and phlebotomy in hemochromatosis. Weight loss of at least 7% is beneficial in NASH, and alcohol abstinence is crucial in alcoholic cirrhosis.
