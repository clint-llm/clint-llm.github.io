This activity reviews the epidemiology and pathophysiology of measles to further understand its epidemiological situation. This will hopefully lead to timely detection in the occurrence of potential future measles cases. This is a very contagious viral infection that most often affects children and can carry with it a risk of significant mortality and morbidity. This activity will also review the treatment and the role of the interprofessional team in managing and improving care by disseminating epidemiological information that guides prevention and control actions for this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of measles medical conditions and emergencies associated.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of measles.
- Outline the management options available for measles.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance measles and improve outcomes.
