Because OSA is so prevalent and has numerous negative health-related outcomes, physicians must appropriately evaluate and screen patients for symptoms and signs of OSA. When diagnosed, patients should be educated regarding the pathophysiology, expected course, and treatment options, including lifestyle modifications, positive pressure therapy, and alternative/additional therapies as indicated. They should also be counseled regarding the need for long-term follow-up and monitoring for potential complications of OSA.
