The care coordination should be between a family physician, a urologist, an endocrinologist, and an andrologist experienced in diagnosing and managing male infertility. It is recommended that primary care initiate the evaluation of infertility by identifying the problem early and making the appropriate referrals. It is also prudent to provide genetic counseling to couples with an abnormality in the clinical or genetic investigation or those who carry a potentially inheritable disease.

Though many of the causes of male infertility are due to spermatogenesis failure, some are medically treatable. This problem has significant psychological, social, emotional, and health effects on the couple as well as their families. The barriers from stigmas associated with infertility arising due to religious and cultural beliefs should be considered and reduced where possible.
