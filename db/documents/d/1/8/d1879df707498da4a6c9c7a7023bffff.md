The aim of treatment for phalanx fractures of the hand is to appropriately heal the fracture while avoiding complications such as stiffness and deformity, which decrease function.

Nonsurgical treatment of phalangeal fractures typically involves closed reduction if indicated, buddy taping to adjacent finger for stabilization and/or splinting versus casting for a short period of immobilization, and then progressive motion and rehabilitation.

Seymour fractures involve the physis of the distal phalanx in pediatric patients with a concomitant nail bed laceration effectively, making it an open fracture. These fractures often trap surrounding soft tissue within the fracture site

Surgical treatment is typically recommended for extra-articular fractures when they are associated with an open wound which requires irrigation and excisional debridement to prevent osteomyelitis, instability which if left would lead to deformity (including angular, rotational, and shortening) or decreased hand function, and in cases of multiple displaced hand fractures.

Open fixation methods allow for early motion by providing increased stability but require more dissection and soft tissue disruption.

Intra-articular fractures are typically treated surgically when associated with joint subluxation or dislocationÂ and in cases in which articular step-off would lead to reduced function by having a bony block to motion or increase risk of development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis.
