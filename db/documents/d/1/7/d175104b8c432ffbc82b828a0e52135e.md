The incubation period varies from 1 to 14 days. Its clinical presentation can mimic that of bacterial meningitis. Early symptoms include fevers, headaches, lethargy, nausea, and vomiting. More severe manifestations that develop later include confusion, neck stiffness, photophobia, seizures, and cranial nerve abnormalities. Primary amebic encephalitis progresses rapidly and eventually leads to coma and death in most cases.
