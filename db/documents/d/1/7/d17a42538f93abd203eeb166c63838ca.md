Salmonella enterica serotype typhi is usually contracted by ingestion of food or water that is contaminated with the excrements of people that carry the organism and must survive the gastric pH barrier in the stomach prior to adherence in the small intestine.Salmonella enterica serotype typhi in healthy individuals ranges between 1000 and 1 million organisms but can be related to the host’s defense mechanisms.

Salmonella enterica serotype typhi enter the submucosal region of the small bowel by either direct penetration into the epithelial tissue mediated by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) or via the M-cell, a specialized lymphoid epithelial cell. Once within the submucosa, the bacterium causes hypertrophy of the Peyer’s patches.

Dissemination of the organism from the Peyer’s patches occurs via the lymphatic system and the bloodstream.Salmonella enterica serotype typhi can be cultured from the bone marrow even after anti-microbial therapy has been initiated.

Approximately 1% to 5% of patients will become chronic carriers of Salmonella enterica serotype typhi despite adequate antimicrobial therapy.
