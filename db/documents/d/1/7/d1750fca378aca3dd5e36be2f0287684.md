Optical nerve sheath fenestration is a surgical procedure employed to prevent vision loss from papilledema in the setting of increased ICP. It is most commonly used in the prevention of vision loss from papilledema in IIH but has other indications reported in the literature. There are three major approaches to exposing the optic nerve for decompression, with the medial transconjunctival approach being the most common. Stability or improvement in visual function is seen in the majority of patients, as is a reduction of papilledema grade. The rate of major complications is relatively low, and many minor complications such as ptosis and diplopia are usually transient. Future studies are needed to evaluate other indications for ONSF and to compare outcomes between different surgical approaches. Comparison studies of ONSF and CSF diversion procedures for the treatment of visual compromise from papilledema will also be beneficial, and a major study is currently in the planning stages.
