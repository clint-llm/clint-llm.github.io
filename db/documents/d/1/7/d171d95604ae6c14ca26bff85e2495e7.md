Mediastinal seminomas are indistinguishable from gonadal seminomas. They both are primitive germ cell tumors composed of somewhat uniform cells that have clear or eosinophilic, glycogen-rich cytoplasm. The cells have distinct cell borders with a round nucleus resembling primordial germ cells. The tumor cells grow in a way that represents a nesting pattern. Oftentimes, a fibrous septa is visualized between the aggregation of cells. A seminoma may be obscured by inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes and eosinophils, and scar tissue. And in other cases, seminomas may be misdiagnosed as thymic epithelial rumors as thymic tissue sometimes remains in the periphery of the seminoma.
