Epstein Barr virus has several associated complications. One dangerous complication is splenic rupture due to infectious mononucleosis. In one case study, splenic rupture occurred 6 days after symptoms of infection. It can be treated conservatively or surgically. Pain control and close monitoring are appropriate conservative management strategies reserved for hemodynamically stable patients. Another non-surgical management option is splenic artery embolization. The surgical option is splenectomy which requires post-operative immunizations, antibiotics, and close follow-up.

Another complication of infectious mononucleosis from EBV is airway obstruction from tonsillar edema of the pharyngeal tissues. Treatment of airway obstruction includes steroids, tracheotomy, or intubation. Airway obstruction is a rare (1-3.5% of cases) but an important complication of infectious mononucleosis that occurs mostly in children.

Acute acalculous cholecystitis is a complication that can be treated conservatively with pain medication and antiemetics.

There are many other complications from Epstein Barr virus infection that can occur, such as myocarditis, encephalitis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, pancreatitis, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
