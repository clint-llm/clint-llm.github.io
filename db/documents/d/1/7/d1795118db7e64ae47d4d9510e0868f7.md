There are nine muscles and muscle tendons that will receive blood supply from the princeps pollicis artery:

- Abductor pollicis brevis muscle

- Abductor pollicis longus muscle

- Extensor pollicis brevis muscle

- Extensor pollicis longus muscle

- Flexor pollicis longus muscle

- Flexor pollicis brevis muscle

These nine muscles also receive blood from arteries that are more proximal in the hand and forearm.
