Herpes simplex encephalitides have significant morbidity and mortality despite prompt detection and antiviral treatment. Varying degrees of neurologic sequelae and/or neuropsychiatric disorders are common among survivors in children and adults. Significant neurologic sequelae occur in neonates due to HSV-2 infection, even with treatment. No available strategies currently prevent HSE in older children or adults. The person-to-person spread has not been described. Prophylactic treatment of close contacts and isolation precautions are not indicated. Neonatal transmission could be mitigated by conducting a cesarian delivery of the baby in women with active herpes labialis during pregnancy and/or avoiding contact with persons with an active infection in the neonatal period.
