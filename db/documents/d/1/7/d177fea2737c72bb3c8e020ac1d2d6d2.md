The procedure is considered a clean-contaminated procedure because the cannula and or catheter breaches the endocervix. Antibiotics are typically not indicated for HSG since the procedure is considered clean-contaminated. Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated if a patient has a history of pelvic inflammatory disease or a known abnormal architecture from a prior laparoscopic procedure.

In rare situations, it has been reported that a hysterosalpingogram finding of prior retained products of conception with associated intravasation of contrast media can be associated with future volume overload in future hysteroscopic procedures.

As with many gynecologic procedures requiring access through the cervix, abdominal cramping and vaginal bleeding are expected in the days after the imaging procedure is complete. The magneticÂ resonance imagining technique for a hysterosalpingogram is a new development. This method would eliminate the potential complications that are associated with radiation. This new imaging technique was determined to be non-inferior to X-ray hysterosalpingograms in a study based in France.
