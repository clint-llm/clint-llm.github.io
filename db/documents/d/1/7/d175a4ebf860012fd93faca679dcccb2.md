**Physical Examination Maneuvers Used to Evaluate a Potentially Torn Meniscus**

**Signs**

Physical signs of meniscal injury include joint line tenderness at the level of the torn meniscus, edema over the joint line with recent injuries, a loss of full extension due to blocking by the torn meniscus, and evidence of quadriceps femoris wasting if the tear has been present for weeks or more.

**McMurray Test**

Flex the hip on the affected side to 90 degrees and the leg to more than 90 degrees. The examiner grasps the knee with one hand with the fingers over the joint line. The other hand grasps the foot. Begin the test with the knee abducted and externally rotated. The examiner then moves the knee into adduction and external rotation. Repeat the test with different degrees of flexion. If there is a palpable click on the lateral or medial aspect of the knee, this is likely to be caused by the locking of the torn meniscus. If the results are positive, confirm them by testing the other knee. In a series of cases of young children, the test was reported as having a sensitivity of 39%, a specificity of 86%, a predictive value of 62%, and a negative predictive value of 71%.

**Apley Test**

The Apley test applies compressive rotational force over the knee. Place the patient in the prone position with the affected knee flexed at 90 degrees. The examiner places their hand or knee on the thigh of the affected side. The foot is rotated externally and then internally in extension. Pain on external rotation indicates a tear of the medial meniscus. Pain on internal rotation suggests a tear of the lateral meniscus.****

**Thessaly Test**

This test has high sensitivity and specificity for meniscal tears. The patient stands with the weight on the affected leg. The examiner holds the patient’s outstretched hands. The patient rotates his knee internally and externally at 5 degrees of flexion and then at 20 degrees of flexion. A torn meniscus is indicated by locking and pain with catching of the knee. This test has a reported accuracy of 94%. It is especially sensitive at 20 degrees.

**A Comparison of Provocative Maneuvers**

A recent study found that the Thessaly test had a sensitivity of 76.6%, a specificity of 52.4%, and a diagnostic accuracy of 70.5%.

A comparison of the three tests has been performed.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has long been considered an important diagnostic method for meniscal injury.

**Injuries in the Younger Population**

Meniscal tears in the younger population generally occur with athletics and acute traumatic injury. Patients present with sharp, medial knee pain after experiencing a "pop" when changing direction, cutting or pivoting, or through direct trauma from another person.

Patients often complain of medial swelling and locking and, depending on acuity, may present with joint line tenderness and joint effusion.

When a fragment of a torn meniscus becomes located in the notch between the condyles, this causes locking of the knee. This commonly results from a bucket-handle tear of a meniscus. In a locked knee, the patient cannot fully extend the leg at the knee, and when the examiner passively extends the leg at the knee, resistance occurs, preventing full extension. Other possible explanations for such a result are the presence of a remnant of a torn anterior cruciate ligament or a discoid meniscus.

Physical examination of a patient with a medial meniscus tear may yield a positive McMurray test and a positive Thessaly test with catching or locking of the joint moving medially. The Lachman and anterior drawer tests will be negative unless an ACL tear accompanies the meniscal injury. Confirmatory diagnosis is made using MRI, while the gold standard for assessment is arthroscopy.

**Injuries in the Older Population**

Meniscal tears in the older population are often due to degeneration instead of acute injury. Patients generally present with medial joint swelling, pain, and locking; radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis is common. MRI is a confirmatory test. There has been much discussion regarding meniscus surgery in the older population. Age-related decreases in meniscus vascularization and possible post-operative worsening of osteoarthritis present issues when discussing the surgical candidacy of a patient. Despite this, complete or partial meniscectomy, depending on the amount of damage, is currently the preferred intervention method among some surgeons.**The Unhappy Triad of the Knee**

The original "Unhappy Triad," first noted in the 1950s by O'Donoghue, showed that athletes who suffered both ACL and MCL tears have a high incidence of medial meniscus injuries. The original study demonstrated that 77% of patients with ACL-MCL injuries had an additional medial meniscus tear.

**Torn Meniscus**

Meniscal root tears are less common than meniscal body tears. They may go unrecognized, causing arthritic changes to the joint due to improper loading of the tibiofemoral portion of the joint.
