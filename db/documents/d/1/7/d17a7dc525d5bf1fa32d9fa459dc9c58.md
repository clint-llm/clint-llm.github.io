The absence of menses in a female of reproductive age is related to the disturbance of normal hormonal, physiological mechanism, or female anatomic abnormalities. The normal physiological mechanism works by balancing hormones and providing feedback between the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovaries, and uterus.

During normal female menstruation cycle, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is released from the hypothalamus, and it works on the pituitary to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and these 2 hormones from the pituitary act on ovaries and ovaries finally make estrogen and progesterone to work on the uterus to carry out the follicular and secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. Any defect at any level of this normal physiology of females can cause amenorrhea.

On the other hand, deviation from the normal anatomy of the reproductive organs of a female can also cause amenorrhea.
