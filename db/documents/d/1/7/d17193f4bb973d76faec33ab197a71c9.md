The bile has five main functions:

- Aids in the digestion of fat via fat emulsification

- Absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins

- Excretion of bilirubin and excess cholesterol

- Provides an alkaline fluid in the duodenum to neutralize the acidic pH of the chyme that comes from the stomach

- It provides bactericidal activity against microorganisms present in the ingested food
