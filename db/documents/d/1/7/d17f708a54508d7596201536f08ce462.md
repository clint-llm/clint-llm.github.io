Common symptoms include:

- Wheezing

- Chronic cough

- Nocturnal cough

- Recurrent pneumonia

- Failure to thrive (in children)

Some of these symptoms may only manifest themselves after the patient eats. In infants, a poor sucking reflex and frequent coughing after feedingÂ may indicate the need to rule out a neuromuscular disease.

On physical exam, early signs can include the above, as well as abnormal lung sounds, including wheezing, rhonchi, or crackles on auscultation. Decreased or lack of breath or sounds can be a finding if a complete obstruction has occurred. Desaturation on pulse oximetry can demonstrate a worsened aspiration syndrome, given that a significant portion of the respiratory tract must be knocked out to cause overall hypoxemia. In ICU patients, especially those who are intubated for an extended period, a sudden worsening of respiratory drive or oxygen saturation can be a key early finding of aspiration and should always be on the differential.
