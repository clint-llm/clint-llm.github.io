Double aortic arch is the most common type of vascular ring malformation. It involves the complete encirclement and compression of the trachea and/or esophagus by the aortic arch, its branches, or atretic ligamentous segments. Left untreated, it may lead to significant morbidity for the patient and can result in sudden death from airway compromise. Hommel described the first post-mortem case in 1737, with the first documented surgical repair only being carried out by Robert Gross in 1947.
