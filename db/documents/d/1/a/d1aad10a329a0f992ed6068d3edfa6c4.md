From a functional point of view, following total wrist arthrodesis, patients usually have limited function of their affected wrist. They are unable to produce active flexion or extension of the wrist, and their grip can be reduced. Patients need to be informed of this, particularly if the affected wrist is their dominant one. The limited functionality can have a strong impact on the daily activities performed using the affected hand as well as on the patient's employment, particularly if it involves active use of the hands or wrist, for example, typing or computer work. Hence wrist arthrodesis should be reserved for patients not responding to any other treatment options. In the right patient, the overall satisfaction rate is more than 75% and the grip strength is 75% to 90% of the contralateral side.
