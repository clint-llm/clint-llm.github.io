The prognosis of esthesioneuroblastoma is both stage- and grade-dependent. TheÂ 5-year survival of stage A tumors is 75% to 90% whereas stage C has a 45% survival. Likewise, high-grade tumors have a 25% 5-year survival whereas low-grade tumors have an 80% survival

Poor prognostic indicators of esthesioneuroblastoma include

- Metastases

- High stage

- High-grade tumor

- Above 50 or below 20 or years of age at presentation

- Intracranial spread

- High proliferation

- Females

- Polyploidy/aneuploidy
