Carpal ligamentous injury and subsequent instability can occur after a simple fall onto an extended hand. Patients who continue to have wrist pain following a fall should seek consultation with a physician educated and trained in hand/wrist injuries. Treatment for these injuries is less invasive in the acute phase, well before chronic carpal changes occur. If these injuries are neglected, they can lead to the destruction of articular cartilage, resulting in wrist arthritis.
