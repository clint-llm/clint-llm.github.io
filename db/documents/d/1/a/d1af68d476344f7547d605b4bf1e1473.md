An interprofessional team approach to caring for patients undergoing hemodialysis is vital to improve patient outcomes. The team should consist of a nephrologist, nephrology nurse practitioners and physician assistants, and dialysis nurses. All providers caring for patients with end-stage renal disease should be aware of dialysis disequilibrium syndrome as a cause of neurological symptoms during the initiation of dialysis. Although most presentations may be mild, it is important to prevent severe manifestations, which can be fatal. Preventive measures should be implemented, especially in patients who are at higher risk, to limit further morbidity and mortality in end-stage renal disease patients.
