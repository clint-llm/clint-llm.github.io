**Antimicrobial Agents**

Third-generation cephalosporin-ceftriaxone or cefotaxime are used for initial therapy.

Continued disease:

- Ceftriaxone (80 mg/kg per day in 1 to 2 divided doses intravenously [IV])

- Cefotaxime (200 mg/kg per day in 3 to4 divided doses IV)

- Penicillin G (50 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours IV)

- Chloramphenicol (100 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses, orally or IV)

- Meropenem for those with severe allergies

The recommended duration of therapy is 7 days for both meningitis and meningococcemia.

**Adjunctive and Experimental Therapies**

Corticosteroid therapy: Replacement doses (25 mg/m3 hydrocortisone 4 times) daily is useful in children with refractory shock associated with impaired adrenal gland response.

- Recombinant bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (rBPI) binds to endotoxin and blocks the inflammatory cascade. Children receiving rBPI had fewer amputation and blood product transfusions and improved functional outcomes.

- Other adjunctive therapies in the management of septicemia are plasmapheresis, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), fibrinolysis, and anti-mediator therapy.

**Emergency Management**

- After securing the airway, priorities in children with meningococcal disease are:

- Correction of cardiovascular shock and 
- Control of raised intracranial pressure

- Aggressive fluid resuscitation with 0.9% NaCl solution in a volume of 20 ml/kg over 5 to 10 minutes is of importance and repeated until shock improves. Inotropic support is needed to maintain tissue perfusion.

- Human albumin solution can be used as an alternative.

- Anemia, coagulopathy is monitored and corrected.

- In cases of raised intracranial pressure, adequate cerebral perfusion should be ensured by correcting shock and providing neurointensive care.
