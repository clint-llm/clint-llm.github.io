The evaluation of a patient presenting with hyperbilirubinemia must include a work-up to rule out pathological causes of hyperbilirubinemia before making the breast milk jaundice diagnosis. First, both unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin levels must be measured. Conjugated bilirubin levels higher than 1 mg/dL or 20% of the total bilirubin level indicate conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (also known as cholestasis or direct hyperbilirubinemia). Once cholestasis is suspected, disorders such as biliary atresia, neonatal hepatitis, and other bilirubin excretion disorders. Both breast milk jaundice and hemolytic anemias cause elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels. Hemolytic causes for hyperbilirubinemia include ABO incompatibility, G6PD deficiency, hereditary spherocytosis, and other antibody-mediated hemolysis. Hemolysis assessment should consist of direct Coombsâ€™ testing, measurement of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and reticulocyte count, a peripheral blood smear, and genetic testing.

The clinician should consider other non-hemolytic causes of prolonged hyperbilirubinemia, such as Crigler-Najjar or Gilbert syndrome but need not investigate them unless jaundice persists longer than what is expected for breast milk jaundice. Galactosemia and hypothyroidism can also cause unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, hence should be ruled out.
