Neurally-adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a relatively newer mode of ventilation in which a ventilator utilizes the electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi) to generate appropriate breaths and assist ventilated patients. This topic highlights and reviews the role of NAVA in the management of respiratory failure in both neonates and adults by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Review the difference between proportional assisted ventilation and NAVA ventilation.
- Identify indications and contraindications to the NAVA ventilator.
- Describe the clinical significance and possible benefits of NAVA ventilation.
- Outline the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique for initial set-up by the interprofessional team.
