Mycoplasma is an obligate parasite andÂ primarily an extracellular pathogen that has developed a specialized organelle for attachment to host cells. The attachment of Mycoplasma to a host cell prevents ciliary clearance of the organism. Hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radicals produced by the Mycoplasma cause oxidative damage to the host cells. Cellular damage causes activation of the innate immune system triggering chemotaxis and cytotoxic effects of cytokine release. Mycoplasma can invade tissues directly and replicate intracellularly in other organs.
