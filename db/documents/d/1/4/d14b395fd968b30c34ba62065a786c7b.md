Initial, conservative treatment involves bed rest and avoidance of Valsalva or other maneuvers that can increase intracranial pressure. Acetazolamide can be used to decrease CSF pressure, and a lumbar drain can be placed to measure opening pressures and maintain a lower intracranial pressure and facilitate spontaneous resolution of the leak.

If the leak persists for more than 1 week, surgical repair can be entertained. High-resolution CT scans with 1 mm cuts are the preferred imaging modality to plan repair and image-guidance protocols can be used to facilitate intraoperative navigation. This imaging can also identify post-traumatic encephalocele that will need management also. All but most anterior cribriform fracture-related leaks can be managed endoscopically, and fascial or bone grafts, vascularized mucosal flaps, or allogenic materials have all been used successfully in repairs. It is important to confidently identify the leak site intraoperatively, and this typically requires a total ethmoidectomy and possible sphenoidotomy. If the leak can still not be identified, an intraoperative intrathecal fluorescein injection can help locate it.
