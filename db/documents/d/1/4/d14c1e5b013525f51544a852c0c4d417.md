DCM is more commonly seen in men than in women. Its prevalence in the general population is estimated at 36 cases per 100,000. DCM accounts for 10,000 deaths and 46,000 hospitalizations in the United States annually. These figures may underestimate the true prevalence because many patients are asymptomatic and, therefore, undiagnosed despite LV dysfunction.
