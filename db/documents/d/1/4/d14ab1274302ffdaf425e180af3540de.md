Primary ciliary dysfunction is a genetic disorder that results in abnormal ciliary ultrastructure and/or function. There are currently 40 known genes associated with primary ciliary dysfunction, with the majority following autosomal recessive inheritance. DNAI1 and DNAH5, which encode components of the outer dynein arm complex in cilia, are the two most common genes associated with PCD.
