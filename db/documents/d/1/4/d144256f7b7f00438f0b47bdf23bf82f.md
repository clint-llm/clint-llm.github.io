Nine total muscles contribute to the diverse movements of the thumb. These muscles can be subdivided into two groups by the location of the muscle fibers in relation to the thumb: extrinsic (muscles in the forearm) and intrinsic (muscles in the hand). The four extrinsic muscles influencing thumb movement include (1) abductor pollicis longus which abducts/extends the MCP joint, (2) extensor pollicis brevis which extends the MCP joint, (3) extensor pollicis longus which extends the MCP/IP joints, and (4) flexor pollicis longus which flexes the MCP/IP joints.

There are five intrinsic muscles which help facilitate thumb movement. With regards to the intrinsic muscles, the first group can be classified as the thenar eminence, a group of three muscles at the base of the thumb which includes (1) the abductor pollicis brevis which abducts the MCP and flexes the IP joint, (2) flexor pollicis brevis which flexes the MCP joint, and (3) the opponens pollicis which opposes/adducts the thumb. The final two intrinsic muscles include the first dorsal interosseous muscle and the adductor pollicis which both participate in thumb adduction.
