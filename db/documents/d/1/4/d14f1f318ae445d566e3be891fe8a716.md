A thorough history of the patient is critical. Knowing the patient’s medical history ahead of time, HIV/AIDS status, medications, or exposures can help point physicians towards the right diagnosis. It is imperative to review the patient's medication as some (like steroids) can mask the full picture of toxic megacolon, and others can aggravate it (anticholinergics or opioids, for example).

Patients with a diagnosis of toxic megacolon will look toxic. Those patients are critically ill and usually present with abdominal pain and distention, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (may or may not be bloody), and altered sensorium. On physical exam, abdominal tenderness and decreased bowel sounds are usually present.

Comorbidities are frequently seen in those patients, as well. Clinicians can expect to find fluid and electrolyte imbalance, hypotension, anemia, weight loss, uncomplicated diabetes, and renal failure.

Peritonitis symptoms (fever, abdominal pain, tenderness, altered mental status, hypotension) could indicate bowel perforation. Patients who have received steroids may not show this picture as steroids can mask some of those symptoms. Nevertheless, if the patient continues to have a fever for 2 or 3 days while being treated with steroids, the clinician should consider the possibility of a perforated bowel.
