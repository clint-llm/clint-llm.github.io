The exact cause of palmoplantar pustulosis is unknown. However, palmoplantar psoriasis is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The most common genetic factor associated with palmoplantar psoriasis includes the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Cw6. There may also be possible linkages to variations in the CARD14 gene and genes in the IL-19 subfamily in palmoplantar pustulosis.

The majority of patients with palmoplantar pustulosis are current or former smokers. It is postulated that activated nicotine receptors in sweats glands cause an inflammatory response in this disease process. Palmoplantar pustulosis has also been linked to thyroid disease, smoking, and arthritis of the anterior thorax.
