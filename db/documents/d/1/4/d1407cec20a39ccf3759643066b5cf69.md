**Overdose**

Bortezomib has a narrow therapeutic window; an overdose can occur when doubling the dose. The patient will usually present with marked thrombocytopenia and hypotension, which are very difficult to reverse. There are reports of several fatal outcomes from bortezomib overdose. If the patient experiences an overdose, close monitoring in the ICU is recommended. Aggressive hydration and maintenance of normal body temperature are vital.
