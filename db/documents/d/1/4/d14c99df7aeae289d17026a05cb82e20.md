Arteries and veins develop from initially small vessels composedÂ of endothelial cells. The remaining components of the blood vessel lining are subsequently added upon signaling from the endothelial cells. Endothelial cells have mechanoreceptors that can sense stress. These allow the endothelial cells to signal the surrounding cells to produce adaptations of the connective tissue and smooth muscle to decrease stress and better accommodate the blood flow. If an area of the vascular system is damaged, the endothelial cells can undergo cell division and proliferate to repair areas.

Angiogenesis is the process of new blood vessel formation. It occurs as a response to signaling from endothelial cells in an existing blood vessel. The most notable signals are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor family (FGF).
