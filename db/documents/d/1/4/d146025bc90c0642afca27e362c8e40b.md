Sepsis secondary to peritonitis can have life-threatening ramifications. The abdominal compartment can become a large nidus for pathogens resistant to standard therapy. On top of that, the abdominal compartment serves as a conduit to other vital organs, which can hasten the spread of resistant pathogens. This activity explains when septic peritonitis should be considered on a differential diagnosis, articulates how to properly evaluate for this condition, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the common mechanisms responsible for the development of septic peritonitis.
- Review risk factors for developing septic peritonitis.
- Identify pertinent evaluation findings associated with the development of septic peritonitis.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the recognition and appropriate management of septic peritonitis.
