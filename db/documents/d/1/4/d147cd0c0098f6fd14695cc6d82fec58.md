There are three distinct phases in the development of ARDS: exudative, proliferative and fibrotic phase. The first exudative phase that occurs over the first 7 to 10 days occurred after lung exposure to injury with subsequent activation of an inflammatory cascade leading to the accumulation of protein-rich fluid and hemorrhage secondary to alveolar endothelial and epithelial barriers damage. In the second proliferative phase, the repair process takes place by restoration of epithelial and endothelial barriers and reestablishing the epithelial integrity with the absorption of the intra-alveolar fluid that enhances functional recovery. The fibrotic phase which does not occur in all patients is associated with fibrous tissue formation and linked to increased mortality and prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation.
