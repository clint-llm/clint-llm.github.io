The prognosis of psittacosis will depend on the patientâ€™s clinical disease severity, comorbid conditions, as well as the time of treatment. Before antimicrobial agentswere available, approximately 15% to 20% of humans with Chlamydial respiratory infection died, but it is not clear how many of those were attributable to psittacosis.

Some cases, however, present with a fulminant disease, and an estimated mortality rate of 1% or less is reported in the modern era.
