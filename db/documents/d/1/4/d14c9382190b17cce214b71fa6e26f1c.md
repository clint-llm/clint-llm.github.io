Clinical findings of drug use and drug dependency can be similar to several psychiatric illnesses like generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, and depression. Besides, signs and symptoms of marijuana use overlap with those of several other drugs like amphetamines and benzodiazepines. This makes it challenging to identify drugs of abuse without a thorough medical and psychiatric history, as well as toxicology screens.
