Complications with arthrocentesis are rare.

- Infection. If the procedure is not done with a completely aseptic technique, or if there is an overlying infection, skin bacteria may be introduced into the joint space. This can be limited by maintainingÂ strict sterile technique and avoiding insertion through infected skin or subcutaneous tissue.

- Bleeding. Hemarthrosis after arthrocentesis is rare but more common in patients with a bleeding diathesis. When inserting the needle during the procedure, do so in a linear fashion without side-to-side movements to avoid shearing blood vessels and other structures.

- Allergic reaction. Patients with allergy to local anesthetic should not receive that class of medications.
