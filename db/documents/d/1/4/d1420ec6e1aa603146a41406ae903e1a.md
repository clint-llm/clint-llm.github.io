To evaluate an iris cyst, it is essential to perform a complete ocular examination of the anterior segment, including the gonioscopy and posterior segment.

Ultrasound B-scan using a 10MHz probe can assess the lesion, including its cystic structure and posterior extension.

Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) utilizes a higher frequency (50Â to 100 MHz) and offers a higher resolution of images but limited tissue penetration up to 4 mm. It is an invaluable tool in evaluating an iris cyst and differentiating it from solid uveal tumors. UBM is useful in determining the anatomical structures and relationship of the lesion.

Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) has been gaining traction in clinical use and assessing anterior segment lesions, including iris cysts. It produces an image with a higher resolution than ultrasounds. However, its major drawback in this setting is shadowing caused by iris pigment epithelium and stroma, reducing the ability to discriminate cystic lesions from solid tumors in some cases.

Fine needle aspirate (FNA) may be indicated when other non-invasive evaluation does not establish a diagnosis.

Given the options, UBM is the gold standard in imaging an iris lesion. It is important to perform adequate documentation so that progression can be carefully monitored.
