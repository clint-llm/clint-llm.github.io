There are various ways to perform an Achilles reflex test.

The plantar strike is an alternative method of assessing the Achilles tendon reflex that may be of use, particularly for hospitalized patients with limited mobility. A plantar strike allows the examiner to assess the reflex while the patient remains supine with extended legs. The plantar strike method is performed by tapping the examiner's fingers on the patient's forefoot with slight tension causing dorsiflexion. A plantarflexion reflex should then be observed. The "plantar tap" has been shown to have 89% concordance with the traditional Achilles "tendon tap," regardless of the examiner's experience level.

A pendulum hammer can also elicit the Achilles reflex in a standing patient.

**Reinforcement**

Occasionally, reinforcement of deep tendon reflexes can be performed to elicit a reflex that might not be observed otherwise in that patient. The Jendrassik maneuver is a commonly employed reinforcement technique in which the patient is asked to hook their hands together with flexed fingers while trying to pull apart as firmly as possible.
