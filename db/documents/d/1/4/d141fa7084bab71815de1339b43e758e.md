The reduction of blood flow secondary to vasoconstriction leads to a corresponding edema reduction. Reduction of vasogenic edema is seen in posttraumatic conditions such as crush injuries, compartment syndromes, burns, and reimplantations. It also reduces cytotoxic edema in the brain, spinal cord, and radiation-induced ischemia by helping to re-establish more normal redox potentials. The consequence is improved intracellular oxygen tensions which maintain cell metabolic functions to keep water in the cell. The result is decreased leakage of water from the ischemic cell to the extracellular spaces. Edema can be detrimental to cell function. It increases the diffusion distance of oxygen from the extracellular fluid to the cell. It also can cause the collapse of microcirculation. Some of the clinical applications of HBOT where vasoconstriction improves outcomes include crush injuries, gas gangrene, compartment syndromes, threatened flaps/grafts, burns, decompression sickness, as well as several other off-label uses.

HBOT angiogenesis has several clinical applications. Wound healing relies on adequate blood flow and oxygen supply. Certain types of wounds, such as diabetic ulcers or radiation damaged tissues, often have impaired circulation which dramatically affects the healing process. HBOT not only provides increased access of oxygen via plasma saturation to damaged tissue, but also encourages new blood vessel formation by activation transcription factors such as VEGF. Additionally, hyperbaric oxygen-induced angiogenesis and fibroplasia has been shown to promote healing to radiated tissue. This is especially useful because radiated tissue does not spontaneously revascularize due to their unique wounding pattern.

HBOT is a valuable adjunct when used early in the treatment of acute blood loss anemia in those who cannot receive blood replacement for medical or religious reasons. The hyperbaric hyperoxic environment accelerates hemoglobin synthesis and increases oxygen delivery throughout the body despite the reduced oxygen carrying capacity due to anemia. This mechanism can help keep patients without a blood transfusion while they regenerate RBCs on their own. HBOT is already being used in the offshore commercial diving realm for acute blood loss situations as a bridge until transfused units of blood become available.

There is still much debate as to whether or not HBOT appears to be helpful in acute coronary syndrome. Physiologically, it would make sense that hyperbaric oxygen preserves myocardial function and reduces mortality for acute myocardial infarctions. However, studies so far have demonstrated either no effect or only small contributions to the overall outcome. It is unclear as to why the data is inconclusive at this time, but more research on this topic continues.

HBOT is also used as a treatment adjunct for peripheral vascular disease through several mechanisms. Hyperbaric oxygen increases oxygen supply in the marginally perfused ischemic/hypoxic tissues and improves the cellular metabolism that has been impaired by hypoxia. It relieves the effects of ischemia by promoting angiogenesis and healing. A variety of different pathways help provide pain relief for patients with PVD including increasing the affinity of endorphins for receptor sites. HBOT significantly reduces postischemic edema, an effect that persists after treatment.
