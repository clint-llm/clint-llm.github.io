Skin biopsy is mandatory for the diagnosis of acquired perforating dermatosis. However, the pathological features of this condition are not uniform. They may resemble any of the four classic perforating dermatoses including RPC, EPS, PF or KD. Frequently more than one pattern is observed in the same patient.

Therefore, many authors prefer to lump all these different diagnoses into one umbrella term of acquired perforating dermatosis. The histology of APD classically shows epidermal invagination often involving a dilated hair follicle with a keratotic plug consisting of collagen, keratin or elastic fibers. The principal diagnosis feature is the presence of a central keratotic core which is overlying a focus of epidermal perforation.
