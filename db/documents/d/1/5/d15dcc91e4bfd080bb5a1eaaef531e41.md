Treating athletes with stress fractures is a complex problem best managed by an interprofessional team. This is especially true for the diagnosis of the female athlete triad. Treating all stress fractures requires a significant team approach, including parents or significant others, coaches, primary care, gynecology, medical and surgical sports medicine specialists, rehabilitation specialists like a certified athletic trainer, physical therapists, and often a sports nutritionist. Orthopedic and school nurses may be involved with care providing education, and coordinating communication among team members. With the size of this team, open and honest communication and respect for each member's contribution to the care of the athlete will be critical to the return of the patient. The only goal of the team is to return the patient to their activity as quickly and safely as possible. This is only possible when the patient becomes the center of the plan.  Patients will have to buy into the process of rehabilitation and return to activity. This will only happen if everyone on the interprofessional healthcare team has the same message. [Level 5]
