**Signs and Symptoms**

A patient can present with recurrent urinary tract infections (usually third MC symptoms)

More specifically they present with pneumaturia and/or fecaluria (air and/or stool in urinary stream, usually at the end of urination). This is present in about 70% to 90% (pneumaturia) and 50% to 70% (fecaluria) of patients with CVF

Less frequently, patients can experience dysuria, hematuria, urgency, frequency, suprapubic pain.

Interestingly less than 50% of patients with diverticular CVF report a history of diverticulitis
