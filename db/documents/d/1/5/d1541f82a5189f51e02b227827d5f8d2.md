In identifying victims, the forensic odontologist plays a crucial role. General dentists should be aware of the use of dental forensics. The unique characteristics of the teeth allow the forensic dentist to compare anti-mortem and post-mortem dental registers and to conclude on the identification of the victim. Other important advances for the legal authorities during the identification process might be the dental records which are used to offer patients the optimal dental service. All dental therapies should, therefore, be properly registered and maintained. Dental doctors are at the forefront of detecting signs of abuse in their patients, as are other healthcare workers. Bite marks are useful to identify the abuse of children and offenders of various violence; however, caution is necessary when using only bite mark proof. The criteria for abusive injury and reporting mechanisms should be understood to ensure that the concerned authorities respond correctly. Forensic nurses, dentists, pathologists, and forensic pathologists should all be educated in this area of medicine and work together for the preservation of evidence anti-mortem. [Level V]
