In a recent study with a total of 21,150 patients who underwent lung resection, the overall incidence of air leak complication is about 24.26% (95% confidence interval).

- Resection type - lobectomy, segmentectomy, wedge resection

- Type of surgical approach

- Age

- Gender

- Presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

The incidence of persistent air leak (PAL) is not known. In patients undergoing lung volume reducing surgery (LVRS), the incidence of PAL is as high as 46%.

After lobectomy, the incidence of PAL can range from 5.6% to 26% from various analyses to 34% to 38%.
