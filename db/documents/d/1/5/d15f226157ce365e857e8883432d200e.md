To reduce the risk of sudden death, healthcare workers should educate the family members of young sudden cardiac death victims that they may also be at an increased risk for ischemic heart disease and ventricular arrhythmias. First-degree relatives, particularly those younger than 35, should be screened. If cardiomyopathy or a genetic channelopathy is present, the evaluation of other family members should also occur. For the most part, the evaluation should be done by a cardiologist or an internist.
