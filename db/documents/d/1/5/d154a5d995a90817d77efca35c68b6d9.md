Polymyxins are bactericidal drugs and act on the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria by destabilizing the phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) present. There is an electrostatic interaction between the positively charged polymyxin and the phosphate groups of the negatively charged lipid A membrane, which causes displacement of divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium from the phosphate groups within these membrane lipids. This activity leads to increased permeability, a disrupted outer cell membrane, and intracellular contents begin to leak out, resulting in cellular bacterial death.
