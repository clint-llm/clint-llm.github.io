Mesenteric adenitis most commonly presents in pediatric and young adult populations. A child under ten years of age who presents with acute onset right lower quadrant abdominal pain is more likely to have mesenteric adenitis rather than acute appendicitis. Mesenteric adenitis commonly follows recent gastroenteritis or upper respiratory infection. Common symptoms include fever, vomiting, change in bowel habits, periumbilical, and/or right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Many surgeons will note that pain from palpation during a physical exam is notably less in the presentation of mesenteric adenitis when compared to acute appendicitis.
