Patients who are diagnosed with a labyrinthine fistula should avoid environments and exposures that instigate symptoms. These include movements likeÂ straining and heavy lifting, increased pressure changes like air travel, popping ears, forceful blowing of the nose, scuba diving, and environments with loud noises. If it is necessary to be in one of these situations, the patient should be encouraged to seek the assistance of someone else to help if imbalance or dizziness occurs. It is important to avoid activities at night or in dark environments such as driving.
