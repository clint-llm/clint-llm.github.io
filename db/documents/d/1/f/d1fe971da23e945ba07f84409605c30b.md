Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as the presence of kidney damage or an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml/min/1.73 mt2, persisting for 3 months or more, irrespective of the cause.

The 6 categories include:

- G1: GFR 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and above

- G2: GFR 60 to 89 ml/min per 1.73 m2

- G3a: GFR 45 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m2

- G3b: GFR 30 to 44 ml/min per 1.73 m2

- G4: GFR 15 to 29 ml/min per 1.73 m2

- G5: GFR less than 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or treatment by dialysis

The three levels of albuminuria include albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR)

- A1: ACR less than 30 mg/gm (less than 3.4 mg/mmol)

- A2: ACR 30 to 299 mg/gm (3.4 to 34 mg/mmol)

- A3: ACR greater than 300 mg/gm (greater than 34 mg/mmol).

The improved classification of CKD has been beneficial in identifying prognostic indications related to decreased kidney function and increased albuminuria. However, a downside of the use of classification systems is the possible overdiagnosis of CKD, especially in elderly.
