**Congested Heart Failure Symptoms******

Atrial myxomas can lead to the presentation of congested heart failure, and diuretics can provide symptomatic relief. Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure with beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, spironolactone is usually unnecessary as the left ventricular function is often intact.

**Cardiac Arrhythmia and Valvular Defect**

Either local invasion of the tumor or surgical resection can precipitate cardiac arrhythmias. Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation or stenosis are also complications of atrial myxomas.

**Thromboembolic Events**

Patients with left atrial myxomas often present with ischemic stroke secondary to systemic embolization, in which case anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies were warranted for secondary prevention.

**Infection**

Atrial myxomas can also be a nidus for infection. Patients can present with signs and symptoms of infectious endocarditis, sepsis, or disseminated intravascular coagulation. The risk factors include dental procedures, invasive procedures, and an immunosuppressed state. Streptococcus viridans, staphylococci, and Enterococcus faecalis are common pathogens. Extensive antibiotics therapy and surgical resection are mandatory for survival.
