Fecal impaction commonly occurs among elderly individuals, rarely presenting as an acute emergency to a hospital. Severe constipation is a significant problem that affects almost 70% of elderly people who are under care in nursing homes. Among those affected, about 7% will have the condition detected during a digital rectal examination. Fecal impaction is more common among older women who are in institutional care and have associated neuropsychiatric disorders. It is a cause for increased morbidity among the elderly, and if allowed to progress, this can lead to complications causing mortality in the older age group.
