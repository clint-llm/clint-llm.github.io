Hemiballismus can also occur as a postoperative complication of neurological surgery if the subthalamic nucleus is damaged. Historically surgical procedures have sought to avoid the subthalamic nucleus to avoid the creation of movement disorders. The effects of the subthalamic nucleus on the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia are critical for normal movement. When hemiballismus does occur, it can result in a high degree of morbidity for the patient.
