Antiplatelet medications divide into oral and parenteral agents. Oral agents subdivide further based on the mechanism of action. Aspirin was the first antiplatelet medication and is a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. Other oral antiplatelet agents include clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel, pentoxifylline, cilostazol, and dipyridamole. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors such as tirofiban and eptifibatide are only available as parenteral agents and are used in acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

The following is a list of indications of antiplatelet medications:

- Acute coronary syndrome

- Post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting

- Mechanical heart valves in combination with warfarin

- Acute ischemic stroke

- Post percutaneous intervention of peripheral arterial disease

- Device closure of an atrial septal defect (ASD) for at least six months

- Stable angina

- Post-coronary artery bypass grafting surgery

- Essential thrombocytosis

- Primary prevention of coronary artery disease

- Prevention of colon cancer

- Kawasaki disease

- Acute rheumatic disease

- Post patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) device closure for the first six months

- Acute pericarditis

- Atrial fibrillation with a high risk of stroke

- Primary prevention of venous thromboembolism
