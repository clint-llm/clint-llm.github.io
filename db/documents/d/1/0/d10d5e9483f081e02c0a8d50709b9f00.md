The liver is the most regularly injured organ in blunt abdominal trauma. Given its large size in the abdominal cavity, it can also be frequently injured with penetrating abdominal injuries. Liver trauma can run the gamut of minor lacerations or capsular hematomas with minimal morbidity and mortality to hepatic avulsions with high mortality. Most hepatic injuries are minor and can be graded with the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Hepatic Injury Scale. Interventional radiological procedures can be used to treat traumatic hepatic injuries. This activity describes the causes of liver trauma, its presentation, diagnosis, and the interprofessional team's role in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the causes of liver injury.
- Recall the presentation of a patient with liver trauma.
- List the treatment and management options available for liver trauma.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with liver trauma.
