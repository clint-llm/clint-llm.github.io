Interferons (IFNs) are proteins that belong to the group of signaling molecules known as cytokines involved in the upregulation of the immune response. Interferons are particularly important in fighting viral infections but also play a vital role in tumor suppression, upregulation of MHC Class 1 and 2, signal transduction, and activation of immune cells, including natural killer cells and macrophages. Interferons can broadly be classified into three main subtypes, interferon-alpha, beta, and gamma, with interferon-alpha and beta belonging to the Type 1 interferon subclass and interferon-gamma belonging to the Type 2 subclass.

Interferons exhibit immune-modulatory effects by initiating signaling cascades that lead to the expression of gene products such as MHC class 1, B2 microglobulin, and others. Alpha and beta interferons bind to the IFNA receptor, which has two parts, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. IFNAR1 has a low affinity for interferon on its own, but binding is enhanced when accompanied by IFNAR2. Phosphatases SHP-1 and 2 associate with IFNAR1 and exhibit negative feedback in the activation of JAK signaling. IFNAR2 has three variants, short, soluble, and long-form. The long-form leads to activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and antiviral response. When stimulated by interferon, protein complexes form and translocate to the nucleus and activate STATs. This, in turn, leads to the dimerization of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, which triggers a phosphorylation cascade. First, the JAK kinase, Tyk 2, which is associated with IFNAR1, is immediately phosphorylated by JAK1, another JAK kinase bound to IFNAR2. Activation of Tyk2 then phosphorylates JAK1, leading to phosphorylation of IFNAR1 and 2. Next, STAT2 binds to IFNAR1 at specific phosphorylated residues. Afterward, STAT2 is phosphorylated by JAK kinases, creating a port for STAT1, which is also phosphorylated. After becoming phosphorylated, the STATS dissociate and bind to the interferon regulatory factor 9, which forms the major interferon transcription factor, ISGF-3. IGSF-3 then translocates to the nucleus and binds to ISRE, initiating transcription of interferon-inducible genes. For interferon-gamma, there are different DNA regulatory sequences called gamma-activated sequence elements, which are present in promoters of interferon-gamma stimulated genes.

Interferons exhibit antiviral activity at many stages of the viral replication cycle, including entry, transcription, RNA stability, translation, maturation, and release. This action is under the mediation of the expression of antiviral genes. Interferons stimulate the expression of PKR through an ISRE and GAS in the promoter of the PKR gene. The kinase activity of the PKR gene, in turn, phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2-a at Ser51. eIF2-a-GTP is necessary for the initiation of viral translation. PKR also plays roles in cell proliferation, tumor suppression, and signal transduction through the regulation of serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and the phosphorylation of IkB, which leads to the activation of NF-kB-dependent genes. Additionally, the 2-5 A oligosynthetase/RNAse L system is strongly induced by interferons. RNAse Ls are activated by double-stranded RNAs and degrade all single-stranded RNA, thereby inhibiting viral replication. The Mx proteins are a family of GTPases induced by interferons and assemble into oligomeric and interfere with transcription in negative-sense virus replication. An additional protein involved in inhibiting viral replication that is induced by interferons is the guanylate binding protein.

In addition to the antiviral properties of interferons, they also exhibit antiproliferative properties. Researchers suspect that these antiproliferative properties of interferons are due to the actions of STAT1 and PKR, the induction of CDK inhibitors, and the decrease of cyclin D and cdc25A. Interferons are also known to act in conjunction with dsRNA, TNF, and LPS to promote apoptosis.

Research has shown interferon beta to upregulate and downregulate many interferon-dependent gene transcripts (SOCS 1, C-C motif, CCL1, CCL7, CCL2, JAK2, ISG20, and CCL20 were upregulated, while CXCL6 and IL-8 were downregulated). Interferon beta has also been demonstrated to increase levels of IL-10, IL-23A, and IL-5 while decreasing lymphocyte counts, including T cells, CT cells, Th cells, B cells, and NK cells.

Furthermore, interferons have significant immunomodulatory effects, with interferon-gamma being the predominant immunomodulatory interferon. Type 1 interferons act as antiviral cytokines. Alpha interferons activate NK cells, which in turn destroy viral and other targets; increase the proliferation of B cells, which secrete antibodies against pathogens; and enhance CD8 T cell response by upregulating the expression of MHC class 1 on surface cells. Type 1 interferons also upregulate IL-12Rb and increase the expression of MHC class II molecules.****
