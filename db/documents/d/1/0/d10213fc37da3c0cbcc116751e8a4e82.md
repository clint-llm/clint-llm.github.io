Groove pancreatitis is a type of chronic pancreatitis that occurs in the 5th to 6th decade of life, with higher prevalence in males than females, and is associated with a significant history of alcoholism or smoking. It affects the anatomical area between the duodenum and the pancreas (The duodenal groove). The condition can simulate or mask pancreatic adenocarcinoma and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic (head of the pancreas) masses or duodenal stenosis. The disease entity presents with varied clinical symptoms, including weight loss, nausea with or without vomiting, and jaundice, depending on the extent of inflammation. Management is usually conservative, involving medical and endoscopic interventions in the initial stages. The definitive treatment is usually surgical in cases where the diagnosis is debatable or in patients refractory to medical therapy.
