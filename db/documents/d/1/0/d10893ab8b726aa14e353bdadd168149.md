Sarcoidosis is a chronic multisystemic granulomatous disorder characterized by the accumulation of non-caseating granulomas in the involved tissues. Ocular sarcoidosis is an inflammatory condition that can involve any part of the eye leading to conjunctival granuloma, episcleritis/scleritis, uveitis, optic neuropathy, and/ or its adnexal tissues leading to lacrimal gland enlargement and orbital inflammation.

The clinical course shows variability. Few patients may have acute self-limited disease, while others experience chronic, progressive deterioration. Corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment with the newer addition of immunosuppressants and biologics in the treatment armamentarium.
