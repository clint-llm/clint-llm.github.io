Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging of choice for the initial diagnosis of PTS. There is a lack of correlation between symptoms and cavity size. The cavity is usually found at the site of spinal column fracture or abnormal angulation. Computed tomographic scan myelography may be necessary for persons who cannot undergo MRI as it can delineate and obstruction to dye flow due to cord tethering/dural adhesions. Plain radiographs, including flexion-extension views, are used to detect spinal instability, spinal kyphosis, fractures, and dislocations. Electromyography may include findings of various forms of abnormal spontaneous activity. These are nonspecific, and electrodiagnosis is best used for the exclusion of other causes producing similar symptoms. Motor evoked potentials can be used to demonstrate and follow prolongation of central motor conduction time and should be used intraoperatively for incomplete patients, however, this technology is not widely available. MRI is used to follow up patients and evaluate the surgical treatment.
