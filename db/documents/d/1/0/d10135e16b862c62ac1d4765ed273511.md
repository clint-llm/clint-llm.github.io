PAD affects over 200 million adults worldwide and the incidence of PAD increases to as high as 20% in people over the age of 70. Although PAD has traditionally been perceived as a disease affecting men, the prevalence of PAD appears to be equal among senior men and women. Under-diagnosis of PAD in the primary care setting may be a significant issue, as most patients with PAD do not present with stereotypical claudication symptoms described in textbooks. Smoking increases the risk of developing PAD fourfold and has the greatest impact on disease severity. Compared to non-smokers, smokers with PAD have shorter life spans and progress more frequently to critical limb ischemia and amputation. Additional risk factors for PAD include diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, race, and ethnicity.
