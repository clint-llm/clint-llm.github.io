Inborn errors of metabolism occur in 1 out of 2500 births. Because of their heterogeneity, different disorders have different distinct epidemiologies, presentations, and heritabilities. For instance, mitochondrial disorders are inherited from mother to 100% of her offspring, while other disorders may have variable penetrance or be sex-linked. The disorder may cause complete dysfunction of the involved enzyme, or it may be partial or incomplete. Although neonatal birth screens seek to identify many inborn errors of metabolism early, different states and even different hospitals have differing panels through which they screen. Neonatal screens may identify 8 to 50 different diseases, but unfortunately, there are thousands of diseases. Furthermore, screens may be falsely negative in children tested too early after birth (before they have had the time to accumulate the measurable diagnostic metabolites) or in those who have received transfusions. Because of all these factors, although medical professionals often think about inborn errors of metabolism as diseases of the neonatal period, 50% of all inborn errors present outside of the neonatal period, and some are not diagnosed until adulthood.
