Basilar migraine was initially thought to have vascular pathology caused by short-term spasms of the basilar artery. However, the vascular hypothesis could not be proved, and it is now believed that like other migraine types, the basilar migraine is related to nerves.

Basilar migraine is now believed to be a type of migraine with aura. The aura is a result of cortical spreading depression, which is a self-propagating wave spreading across the cerebral cortex due to the depolarization of neurons and glia. Location of aura symptoms in a basilar migraine is brainstem or both occipital hemispheres; whereas, in migraine with typical aura, it mainly involves a unilateral hemisphere.

There is little data regarding the genetic basis of basilar migraine. Basilar type aura may be triggered by genes involved in migraine with a typical aura. Some reports suggest that the FHM gene may be involved in a basilar migraine without hemiplegia. However, no definitive genetic linkage is identified.
