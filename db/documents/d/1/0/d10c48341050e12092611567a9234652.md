The ventral rami of the spinal nerves supplying each myotome innervate the rectus abdominis muscles and sheath. The thoracoabdominal nerves arising from spinal segments T7 to T11 and the subcostal nerve (T12) innervate the rectus abdominis muscle. The subcostal nerve innervates the pyramidalis muscle.
