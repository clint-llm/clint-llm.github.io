Long-term monitoring is avoided in newborns, especially in very premature infants due to:

1. Skin maceration

Skin breakdown and maceration can occur because of the electrode adhesives and traction on the electrodes.

2. Chance of infections

Newborn infants are prone to infections due to their delicate scalp, and it is imperative to avoid contamination and placing leads in the proximity of any scalp lacerations and or sutures.

Some studies have shown to have better outcomes with dry electrodes.
