Carvedilol is a non-selective adrenergic blocker indicated for the chronic therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), hypertension, and left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction (MI) in clinically stable patients. Off-label indications for carvedilol include stable angina, atrial fibrillation, cirrhotic esophageal variceal bleeding prophylaxis, and ventricular arrhythmias. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of carvedilol, pertinent for clinicians and other interprofessional team members to allow for appropriate utilization of carvedilol for indicated conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the approved and off-label indications for carvedilol.
- Describe the mechanism of action of carvedilol.
- Review the adverse effects and contraindications of carvedilol.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients receiving treatment with carvedilol.
