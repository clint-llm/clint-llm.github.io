On microscopic examination, hamartomas have characteristics similar to any benign tumor, such as haphazard growth of the normal tissue and architectural pattern of cytologically normal cells native to the local site. There is usually no sign of metastasis or local invasion.

Usually, adipocytes and single chondrocytes appear in lacunae with an abundant neighboring matrix, and some other cell types may also be found depending on the site of origin.
