The diagnosis should always be suspected with a clinically floppy infant or a history and physical with consistent findings. The reasoning is that routine lab tests are often normal. There may be secondary lab findings due to associated sequela from the botulism infection.

To confirm the diagnosis, both a stool culture and direct toxin assay are required. The toxin assay can be obtained from the stool, serum, or gastric contents. A stool culture can be obtained with an enema but not glycerin suppositories. Stool samples can be put into a sterile urine container. Do not put stool samples in containers with preservatives. They can be stored in a refrigerator prior to being sent but should not be frozen. Results for the direct toxin specimen are often available the morning after the specimen has been received. Stool culture results can vary from one week to one month. Only 60% of stool cultures yield a positive result. The best test is the mouse inoculation test performed by the CDC. Today, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is available to detect spores and the results are available within 24-72 hours. However, PCR is not readily available in all hospitals.

No imaging is required to make the diagnosis. Testing of the infected food can be done, however, results are often inconclusive and or delayed.

It is important to rule out meningitis by performing a lumbar puncture.
