Differential diagnoses include primary neurocognitive disorder and its subtypes. Given that persons with HIV have increased longevity, the primary neurocognitive disorder may also set in. It often becomes progressively more difficult to differentiate between neurocognitive disorder secondary to HIV and primary neurocognitive disorder.

Other differentials include substance intoxication and withdrawal, metabolic disorders, opportunistic infections (CNS toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis), brain tumors, traumatic brain injury, and even adverse effects of antiretroviral medications like efavirenz.

The following conditions are important to remember in the differential diagnosis when considering possible HIV-associated dementia:

**Central Nervous System Disease**

- CNS lymphoma

- CNS toxoplasmosis

- CNS vasculitis

- Cryptococcal meningitis

- Cytomegalovirus encephalitis

- Metastatic disease

- Neurosyphilis

- Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy

- Tuberculous meningitis

**Substance Withdrawal or Intoxication**

- Alcohol

- Chronic cannabis

- Opioids

**Metabolic and Endocrine Disease**

- Addison disease

- B12 deficiency

- Thyroid disease

**Psychiatric Illness**

- Delirium

- Mood disorders (major depression, dysthymia)
