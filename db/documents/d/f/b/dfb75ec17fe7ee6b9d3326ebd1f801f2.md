Hemifacial microsomia is the second most common congenital craniofacial defect after cleft lip and palate. It can present with a spectrum of deformities involving the eyes, ears, and the first two pharyngeal arches. To avoid the long-term morbidity associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of hemifacial microsomia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the etiology and epidemiology of hemifacial microsomia.
- Describe the appropriate steps for the evaluation of hemifacial microsomia. 
- Outline the treatment considerations for patients with hemifacial microsomia. 
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by hemifacial microsomia.
