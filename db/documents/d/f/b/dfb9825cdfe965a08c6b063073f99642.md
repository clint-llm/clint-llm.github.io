The majority of abdominal aortic aneurysms are identified incidentally during an examination for another unrelated pathology. Most individuals are **asymptomatic**. Palpation of the abdomen usually reveals a**non-tender,****pulsatile abdominal mass**. Enlarging aneurysms can cause symptoms of abdominal, flank, or back pain.  Compression of adjacent viscera can cause gastrointestinal (GI) or renal manifestations.

**Rupture**of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is life-threatening. These patients may present in**shock**often with diffuse abdominal pain and distension. However, the presentation of patients with this type of ruptured aneurysm can vary from subtle to quite dramatic. Most patients with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm die before hospital arrival. On physical exam, the patient may have**tenderness**over the aneurysm or demonstrate**signs of embolization**. The aneurysm may rupture into adjacent viscera or vessels presenting with GI bleeding or congestive heart failure due to the aortocaval fistula. Physical exam should also look for other associated aneurysms. The most common associated aneurysm is an iliac artery aneurysm. Peripheral aneurysms are also associated in approximately 5 % of patients, of which popliteal artery aneurysms are the most common.
