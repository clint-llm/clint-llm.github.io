I-131 scan is a powerful tool to investigate several thyroid disorders

- To characterize thyroid function in the case of hyperthyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, multinodular goiter, toxic nodule, thyroiditis, congenital hypothyroidism.

- To visualize ectopic thyroid tissue.

- To visualize normal or/cancerous thyroid tissue remnant, thyroid cancer recurrence or distant metastasis

- To re-stage thyroid cancer 6-12 months after thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine ablation therapy.

- To help with the decision of I-131 therapy dose (diagnostic pre-treatment whole-body scan)

- To identify the I-131 therapy dose that is safe for vital organs (in a patient who has been treated multiple times before). This procedure called dosimetry.
