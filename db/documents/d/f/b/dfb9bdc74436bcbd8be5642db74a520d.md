Chemists developed napalm in 1942, and its first documented military use was in 1944.  Allied bombers used napalm in incendiary bombs throughout the European and Pacific theaters during World War II. Handheld or vehicle-borne flamethrowers deployed napalm primarily against dug-in positions given its ability to kill or displace defenders where other weapon systems would fail.  Militaries have deployed napalm in multiple other conflicts, including the Korean War and Vietnam War, and numerous smaller engagements. Civilian exposures to napalm are rare outside of military conflicts.  Although the United Nations banned the use of napalm on civilian targets in 1980, numerous reports suggest its use in several modern conflicts. Homemade mixtures approximating napalm have exploded during manufacture or improvised use, causing injuries outside of armed conflicts.
