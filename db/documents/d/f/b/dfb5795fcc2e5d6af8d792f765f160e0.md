Understanding the physiologic DRG variants in humans has been limited though there are several proposed rat models to explain phenomena. Variants in the voltage-gated ion channels: SCN9A, Na(v)1.7, and Troy are common sites of current DRG investigation in rats. SomeÂ variants considerably influenced the excitability of DRG neurons. For instance, the Na(v)1.7 variant 1739V was identified in some patients with autonomic dysfunction and neuropathic pain to impair slow inactivation within dorsal root ganglion neurons hyperexcitable.
