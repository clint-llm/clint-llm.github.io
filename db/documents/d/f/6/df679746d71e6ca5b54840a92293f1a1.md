The benefits of a well-trained surgical staff cannot be understated. Before every surgery, all involved staff members should systematically verify the present patient's correctness and the planned procedure's accuracy. Instrumentation, supplies, and emergency equipment should all be available and accessible before starting the procedure.Â Tooth extraction is typically an ambulatory procedure, and indications for extraction rarely constitute an emergency. However, emergencies can and do happen in the outpatient surgical setting. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that every surgical team member understands their role since effective management of complications as they arise is a team effort.

Time spent in surgery is costly, both financially and psychologically. It raises patient and provider anxiety and may also contribute to increased morbidity. One of the most fundamental ways to reduce surgical time is preparedness. Instrument anticipation by the assistant during surgery hastens every procedural step, especially during complex root removal.

Teaching staff how to manage intra-operative complications like bleeding or sinus perforation can also significantly reduce morbidity in dental surgery. Risk is inevitable in surgery, no matter the procedure, but the most significant risk often stems from a lack of preparation. Therefore, the surgeon and the surgical team must thoroughly prepare for every case and contingency without exception.
