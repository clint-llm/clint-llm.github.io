Menstrual-related headaches are mainly a clinical diagnosis. In general radiographic images are relatively normal; however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings can sometimes have white matter hyperintensities, which have been linked to brain hyperperfusion, breakdown of the blood-brain-barrier, and localized cerebral edema, rather than to primary ischemia. Diffuse non-lateralizing brain hyperperfusion generally prevails during migraine attacks for more than 48 hours in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia.

Migraines cause vasodilation of intracerebral vessels and sensory sensitization of the trigeminal nerve causing inflammatory changes in the pain-sensitive meninges. This results in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier increasing, which releases proinflammatory mediators. Factors to consider when choosing the type of examination depending on the clinical indication, diagnostic performance, availability of computed tomography (CT) or MRI, radiologist expertise, and patient contraindications. Any imaging of the vessels requires the use of IV contrast. Computed tomography angiogram (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) examinations image both the arteries and veins. MRH should have normal imaging and can sometimes be a diagnosis of exclusion in an emergency medicine setting.

Diagnostic criteria according to International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition:

Pure menstrual migraine:

- Attacks in a menstruating woman fulfilling the criteria for migraine without aura

- Attacks occur on days two days before and last till the third day of menstruation

- Occur in at least 2 out of 3 menstrual cycles
- Do **not**occur at other times of the cycle

Menstrually related migraine:

- Attacks in a menstruating woman fulfilling the criteria for migraine without aura

- Attacks occur on days two days before and last till the third day of menstruation

- Occur in at least 2 out of 3 menstrual cycles
- **Can**also occur at other times of the cycle
