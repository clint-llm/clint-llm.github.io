Other than the underlying neurological deficit that may follow tonsillar herniation (permanent brain damage, brain death, respiratory arrest, coma, and death), other complications include the sequelae of critical illness. These include ventilator-associated pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, and critical illness myopathy. Approximately 5% of patients with TBI have an associated visual system injury.
