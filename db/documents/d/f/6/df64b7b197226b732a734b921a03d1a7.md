The exact etiology of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is unknown. Some studies have shown that young infants treated with macrolide antibiotics had an increased incidence of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Postnatal exposure to erythromycin has also been associated with an increased risk for the development of pyloric stenosis. Other risk factors include bottle feeding, preterm birth, cesarean section delivery, and first-born infants (30% to 40% of cases). If the mother was a heavy smoker during pregnancy, the risk of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis could increase by 1.5. to 2.0 fold.
