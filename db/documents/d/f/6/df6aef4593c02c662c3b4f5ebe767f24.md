TEV is a multifactorial disorder. Causes are structural and genetic. Historically, risk factors for TEV have been described to include maternal smoking, oligohydramnios, and a family history of TEV.

Many genetic studies have been performed looking for causes of TEV. No single genetic cause has been found. However, multiple genes have been associated with an increased risk of TEV. It has been proposed that homeobox A and D (HOXA and HOXD) genes, which are involved in apoptosis and muscle contraction, contribute some genetic risk of TEV.
