Brodalumab is a monoclonal antibody approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who have failed treatment with topical and other systemic therapy. In addition to plaque psoriasis, brodalumab has been explored as a potential treatment for other auto-inflammatory diseases, including psoriatic and rheumatoid arthritis. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of brodalumab, pertinent for interprofessional team members for the treatment of patients with indicated inflammatory pathologies.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for brodalumab.
- Summarize the mechanism of action of brodalumab.
- Review the potential adverse events for patients using brodalumab.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients using brodalumab therapy for indicated conditions.
