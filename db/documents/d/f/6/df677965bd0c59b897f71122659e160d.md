Decompression sickness that occurs with high-altitude exposure such as in aviation can happen through various mechanisms. The first is by exposure to a high-altitude chamber such as is used by military organizations. The second is through exposure to altitude without proper aircraft or suit pressurization. Commercial aircraft typically have a pressurized cabin; however, failure of that system or noncommercial air travel can lead to decompression sickness. A third mechanism is due to the pressure difference as can occur with breath holding during scuba diving or with an individual who was to scuba dive and then fly a commercial flight in a short period. Current recommendations recommend a wait time period of 12 hours after a single dive before flying and 18 hours after multiple dives. For simplicity, generalized recommendations of 24 hours between diving and flying is also often quoted. The sudden exposure to a cabin pressure of around 7000 feet, termed rapid decompression, may cause decompression sickness. It is important to note that decompression sickness still can occur in individuals who follow standard decompression procedures before flying.
