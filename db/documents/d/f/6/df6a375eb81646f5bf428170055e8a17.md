The directionality of shoulder dislocation must be confirmed on prereduction radiographs. Posterior dislocation can occur in seizure or electric shock. They are often missed on presentation to the emergency room. Unlike anterior shoulder dislocations, patients present with the affected extremity in internal rotation with decreased external rotation.

The SC and AC joints of the shoulder complex can be concomitantly disrupted. AC joint separation can be mistaken for shoulder dislocations. They account for 9% of shoulder girdle injuries.

Proximal humerus fractures present similarly or concomitantly. Fractures can demonstrate increased ecchymosis, suggesting soft tissue or osseous injury. Proximal humerus fracture dislocations can have a completely displaced humeral head. Closed reduction is often unsuccessful. An emergent orthopedic surgery consultation is recommended in these injuries asÂ urgent open reduction may be required.
