The management of iliac crest contusions involves the coordination of athletic trainers, all levels of healthcare providers, including orthopedic specialty trained nurses and clinicians. The latter often entails referral to a sports medicine or orthopedic specialist, although many primary care physicians and emergency medicine physicians should feel comfortable managing this relatively benign condition. Although surgery is essentially never indicated for these injuries, chronic pain and dysfunction can significantly hinder a patient's overall quality of life and negatively impact the required performance. School and emergency department nurses will see this condition commonly. They participate in patient and family education and facilitate referrals for further care. This interprofessional team can improve the care and outcomes for these patients.[Level 5]
