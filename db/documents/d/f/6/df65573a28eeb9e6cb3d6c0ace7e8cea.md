The basic concept of echocardiography was first demonstrated by Lazzaro Spallanzani in the 18 century when he described the reflected echoes of inaudible sound.

Since then, echocardiography has expanded tremendously and exponentially over the decades and has become an integral part of cardiac evaluation.

With the advent of echocardiographic contrast media and transesophageal probes, the sensitivity of echocardiographic examination has improved significantly, and it has become an important part of cardiac surgical procedures involving valvular reconstruction.

In some aspects, new technologies have completely replaced old methods. In other circumstances, new technologies have been incorporated to enhance existing capabilities. Even in the contemporary era of newer imaging modalities, an echocardiogram is recommended as the first choice for structural and functional assessment of the heart. This chapter aims to review the basics of ultrasound physiology, important terms used in echocardiography, different echocardiographic techniques, and basic echocardiographic views.
