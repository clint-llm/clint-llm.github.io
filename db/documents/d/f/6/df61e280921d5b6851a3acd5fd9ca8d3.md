The patient typically presents with acute, distal, penile pain and swelling, but the pain is not always present. The glans and foreskin typically are markedly enlarged and congested, but the proximal penile shaft is flaccid and unremarkable. A tight band of constrictive tissue is present, often preventing the easy manual reduction of the foreskin over the glans. Diagnosis is made clinically by direct visualization, as well as the inability to easily reduce the retracted foreskin manually.
