Treatment for Felty syndrome focuses on controlling the underlying RA and treating the neutropenia to prevent infections.

The goal is to achieve a granulocyte count of more than 2000/microliter. Neutropenia without evidence of infection is not an indication for treatment; however, the presence of neutropenia in patients with RA can help in adjusting disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) therapy. Improvement of the neutrophil count with the treatment of RA indicates a component of FS. Patients with neutropenia should undergo a thorough examination to look for signs of infection. The presence of systemic symptoms should prompt treatment. Care of neutropenic patients involves good dental and oral hygiene as well as scheduled age-appropriate immunizations. The clinician should initiate appropriate treatment of infections with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and neutropenic precautions are necessary. An infectious disease specialist consult can be helpful.

There are no randomized control studies available for the treatment of Felty syndrome, and most of the data directing treatment are from observational studies. Low dose oral methotrexate is considered first-line treatment. It has demonstrated benefit in the improvement of neutrophil count and helpful in preventing recurrence of infection. Studies have shown that a dose of less than 7.5mg/week results in prompt improvement of neutrophil count within 4 to 6 weeks. Because the effect of methotrexate is dose-dependent with noticeable change seen after 4 to 8 weeks, an adequate trial with a maximum tolerated dose should be considered before deeming it unresponsive.

Other DMARDs have been reported to be beneficial in some reports. A case report described a patient with RA who developed Felty syndrome while on MTX therapy and then severe cutaneous allergy to etanercept, but subsequently, significant improvement in neutropenia with leflunomide.

Initially, glucocorticoids can be used in patients with Felty syndrome to provide a rapid improvement in neutrophil count. Because of the immunosuppressive effect, however, long term use is generally not advised, and use should be avoided in patients with active infection.

Splenectomy in a patient with Felty syndrome was first tried by Hanrahan and Miller in a 50-year-old woman who had marked improvement in neutropenia and arthritis over five months follow up. After this, splenectomy was the main treatment option for Felty syndrome.
