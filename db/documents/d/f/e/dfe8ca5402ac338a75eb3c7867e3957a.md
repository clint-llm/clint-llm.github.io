The prevalence of hypoparathyroidism in the United States is estimated to be 24 to 37 per 100,000 person-years, most commonly a complication of a thyroidectomy or head and neck surgery. This complication may be transient or permanent, and the frequency is highly dependent upon the surgeon's technical skill. Other causes tend to be rare, and the etiology is suspected based on the age of onset, family history, and associated clinical features.
