**History**

The history will dictate both the likely pattern of injuries as well as the level of suspicion for subtle injuries requiring more advanced imaging.

Depending on the type of injury, the patient may complain of head, facial, dental, ocular, or nasal pain, as well as stiffness of the jaw, the sensation of sinus and nasal congestion, epistaxis, loose teeth or subjective malocclusion, hearing loss, cough, tingling or numbness of a portion of the face, vision problems, confusion, or history of loss of consciousness.

It is also essential to gather information regarding the patient’s medical history, medications, allergies, vaccinations, and last oral intake (especially if procedural sedation is anticipated).

**Physical Exam**

The physical exam has extreme importance in pediatric patients relative to adults as younger children may be nonverbal or unable to provide a detailed history. The initial evaluation of any significant traumatic injury should follow advanced trauma life support (ATLS) principles. Extensive facial injuries may be associated with airway compromise, traumatic brain injuries, neck or spinal trauma, or other significant injuries. After completion of the trauma survey and stabilization of the patient, it is crucial to perform a more focused examination of the facial structures.

Even when there is a seemingly isolated injury to the face and ATLS activation is not necessary, a thorough skin and musculoskeletal exam of the body and extremities should be conducted to identify any concurrently sustained traumatic injuries.

After a trauma, the exam benefits from a calm and cooperative pediatric patient. Calming measures such as being held on a parent’s lap, pain control, and anxiolysis or distraction can dramatically improve examination success.

**Musculoskeletal and Skin**

For lacerations or wound exams, note the depth and gently explore for injury to underlying structures, including muscles, tendons, blood vessels, nerves, salivary ducts, and disruption of fascial planes. Visualization of fat in the cheek is concerning for possible nerve or duct injury and should prompt consultation with a facial specialist.

**Eyes**

For cases with no suspected direct trauma to the eyes and no reported or apparent loss of visual acuity, a visual inspection, pupillary response, and assessment of extraocular movement is sufficient.

The eye exam should occur early in the patient’s course because periorbital swelling can become profound, making it difficult to open the eye for evaluation if delayed. Care should be taken to note brisk, equal, and symmetric pupillary response to light, intact extraocular movements, and patient report of grossly normal visual acuity (with corrective glasses if available). The abnormal pupillary response, especially inequality of size, is most urgently concerning for intracranial hemorrhage. The inability of an eye to fully range raises concern for entrapment of the responsible extraocular muscle. The presence of chemosis or subconjunctival hemorrhage concerns for blunt eye injury, which is further addressed in the associated StatPearls article “Blunt Eye Trauma.”

**Ears**

The external exam should evaluate for hematoma or lacerations with exposed cartilage (management of these conditions is discussed in the associated StatPearls articles.

**Nose**

Examination of the nose should focus on swelling, palpation of bony and cartilaginous structures, and whether the nasal bridge appears midline. Providers can compare the exam to patient photos before the injury. Always inspect internally for the presence of a septal hematoma, a foreign body, and bleeding. If epistaxis is ongoing, an attempt to determine location should be made, though traumatic epistaxis is often anterior.

**Mouth**

Examine the lips, mucus membranes, tongue, teeth, and posterior oropharynx. Evaluation for a fracture or dislocation involves evaluation for trismus, bony tenderness, malocclusion, or dental laxity with palpation; gingival tears or ecchymosis may be a subtle sign of underlying mandibular or maxillary fracture. For mucus membrane lacerations, note whether they are deep, gaping, or through-and-through.
