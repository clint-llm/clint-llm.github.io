Serum CK activity is subject to a number of physiological variations. Sex, age, muscle mass, physical activity, and race all interact to affect measured serum activity. Males generally have a larger muscle mass, which results in higher serum CK activities than those in females. The racial type also has an effect on CK activities, and the mean activity in White individuals is 66% of the mean activity in Black individuals.

Newborns generally have higher CK activities resulting from skeletal muscle trauma during birth. Serum CK in infants decreases to the adult reference interval by 6 to 10 weeks.CK-BB may be elevated in neonates, particularly in newborns with brain-damaged or very low birth weight.

With the CK-MB mass assay, the upper reference limit for males is 5.0 Î¼g/L, with values for females being less than for males. However, many laboratories use a single reference interval (male).
