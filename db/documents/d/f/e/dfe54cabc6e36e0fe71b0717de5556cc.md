The **FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics)**staging system is used most often for cancers of the female reproductive organs, including cervical cancer.

Another widely used clinical staging system for cervical cancer is the one adopted by both the International Union for Cancer Control (UICC) and the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC). Its basis is in the TNM system (T, tumor; N, nodes; M, metastases).
