Urethral injuries are never life-threatening, but they are often closely associated with other significant blunt and penetrating traumatic injuries with significant comorbidities, which may complicate treatment.

Multiple studies and reviews have been done in adults to compare the rates of erectile dysfunction, incontinence and stricture formation between the various treatment options. Many of these studies are of relatively poor quality but taken together they suggest that the rates of erectile dysfunction (15%-20%) and incontinence (4%-6%) are about the same regardless of the selected therapy, but there appears to be a significant difference in stricture rates. Early urethral realignment techniques have an overall stricture rate of about 45%-53% which increases to 89%-97% with suprapubic tube placement and delayed urethroplasty.
