Oliguria is one of the firstÂ indicators of acute renal injury.

Oliguric patients are at higher risk of developing acute renal failure (ARF). 30 to 70 percent of patients with ARF develop infections that are associated with higher morbidity and mortality.

The duration and intensity of oliguria have a great impact on prognosis. As the intensity of oliguria worsens to <0.5 ml/kg/h, the mortality rises significantly.
