The retinal appearance is thought to be due to the occlusion of peripapillary terminal arterioles, which supply the superficially peripapillary capillaries.

Leukoembolization, endothelial damage, activation of complement C5, and blockade of small arterioles causing infarct of the capillary bed have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Purtscher retinopathy and Purtscher-like retinopathy.

Occlusion of the proximal part of the retinal artery or arteriole by a large embolus causes whitening of confluent areas, as seen in central or branch retinal arterial occlusion.

The clinical sources of emboli include:

- Amniotic fluid embolism may occur during childbirth or after birth.

- Fat embolism may occur after the fracture or crush injury of large bones. Acute pancreatitis may also cause fat embolism from enzymatic degradation of omental fat. Fat embolism syndrome (cerebral dysfunction, changes in the lung, and petechial hemorrhage) may be present in patients with fractures of long bones, and patients with fat embolism may have retinal manifestations. Features of fat embolism include respiratory distress, confusion/agitation, petechial rashes, and tachycardia.

- Air embolism from chest compression injury after various causes, including road traffic accident

Points in favor of retinal arteriolar embolism include multifocal lesions, sudden onset, normal-appearing retinal arterioles, which show occlusion on fluorescein angiogram, and geographic distribution of ischemic patch.

Originally, in the first reports, the proposed pathomechanism was hypothesized to be due to extravasation from lymphatic vessels secondary to a sudden rise of the intracranial tension.

There are other proposed mechanisms.

- Rheological disturbances, along with downstream endothelin-induced vasculopathy,

- In chest compression, reduced venous return and acute expansion of retinal veins may lead to a similar retinal appearance,

- Vascular (venous or arteriolar) damage from increased intravascular pressure,

- Vasculitis due to free fatty acids, and

- Thrombotic microangiopathy categorizes a group of disorders characterized by hemolytic anemia (with prominent red blood cell fragmentation), thrombocytopenia, and thrombosis in the microvasculature. It is a feature in TTP, HUS, and various other diseases. Reduced activity of a von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS-13 correlates with the pathogenesis of thrombotic microangiopathy. Thrombotic microangiopathy is important in the pathogenesis of Purtshcer-like retinopathy in many cases.
