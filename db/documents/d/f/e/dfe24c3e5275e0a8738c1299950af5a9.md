The recommended dose of casirivimab is 600 mg along with imdevimab 600 mg. In studies, doses up to 8 g (4000 mg of each drug) have been administered without dose-limiting toxicity. In overdose situations, general supportive measures, including vitals signs and clinical status monitoring, are recommended. There is no specific antidote for toxicity due to overdose.

**Pregnancy and Lactation**

- Casirivimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1). Placental transfer of IgG depends on different factors such as maternal serum level of IgG and IgG subclass.

- Maternal IgG is present in breast milk. Casirivimab is a large protein molecule with a molecular weight of over 145,000 Da, so the amount in milk is probably low, and it is also likely partially destroyed in the infant's gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, absorption by the infant is likely low. No information is available related to using casirivimab during breastfeeding. According to the emergency use authorization, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should depend on the benefit of treatment of the mother and the benefit and risk of exposure to the infant.

- No dose adjustment is recommended for patients who are pregnant or lactating per emergency use authorization by FDA (FDA 2021).
