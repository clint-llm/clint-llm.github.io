Because the patients with the aortoiliac occlusive disease often have other comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, or hypertension, the preoperative workup is essential to prevent post-operative complications. In many cases, a cardiology referral is needed to assess the heart. Exercise stress testing, or nuclear myocardial perfusion scan in patients who are not able to ambulate, is recommended. Smoking should be discontinued for at least four weeks to prevent pulmonary complications of the surgery, and ongoing abstinence should be strongly encouraged.
