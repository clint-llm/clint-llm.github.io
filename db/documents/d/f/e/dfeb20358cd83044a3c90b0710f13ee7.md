The differential diagnosis of dermatologic findings in body lice infestation includes scabies, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, drug reaction, and viral exanthem. Co-infection with head lice, pubic lice, scabies, and fleas may be found, especially in refugee populations.

A high index of suspicion should be maintained for trench fever, relapsing fever, and epidemic typhus in patients with body lice infestation presenting with signs and/or symptoms of systemic infections. Other infectious diseases that may present with similar manifestations include babesiosis, brucellosis, Q fever, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, ehrlichiosis, and tularemia.
