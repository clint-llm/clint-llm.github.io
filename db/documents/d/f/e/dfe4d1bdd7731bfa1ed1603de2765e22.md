Acute esophageal necrosis is a life-threatening condition resulting in acute ischemia of the esophagus. It is associated with a local insult to the esophagus in medically co-morbid patients. Prompt diagnosis and aggressive supportive treatment are needed in the initial setting with early consideration of surgical intervention to prevent poor outcomes. This review evaluates the etiology and clinical presentation of acute esophageal necrosis and the key management steps required by the interprofessional team to treat this rare entity.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of developing acute esophageal necrosis concerning the two-hit hypothesis.
- Identify the risk factors associated with developing acute esophageal necrosis.
- Describe the relevant clinical anatomy of the esophagus.
- Summarise the principles of management by the interprofessional team and indications for surgical intervention.
