The diagnosis and management of dengue are complex, and this is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an infectious disease expert, a CDC consultant, an emergency department clinician, and an internist. The care is supportive with fluid, acetaminophen for fever, and a blood transfusion for hemorrhage. A confirmed diagnosis is established by culture, antigen detection, polymerase chain reaction, or serologic testing. No laboratory tests can predict the progression to severe disease.

The role of the primary care provider and nurse practitioner is to educate the traveler on the prevention of mosquito bites. This means covering exposed skin and using bed nets, particularly during daytime siestas, using mosquito repellents, and indoor insecticides. One should also eradicate mosquito breeding grounds like standing water. The prognosis for untreated dengue is abysmal, but most patients can survive with supportive care, albeit with residual multisystem organ damage.
