Excessive umbilical cord traction with a fundal attachment of the placenta and fundal pressure in the setting of a relaxed uterus are the 2 most common proposed aetiologies for uterine inversion.

Other possible risk factors for uterine inversion include rapid labor, invasive placentation, manual removal of placenta, short umbilical cord, use of uterine-relaxing agents, uterine overdistension, fetal macrosomia, nulliparity, placenta previa, connective tissue disorders (Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), and history of uterine inversion in the previous pregnancy. However, in most cases, no risk factors are identified, thus making this condition unpredictable.

**Degrees of Uterine Inversion**

- Incomplete: Fundus inverts but does not herniate through the level of the internal os

- Complete: The internal lining of the fundus crosses through the cervical os with no palpable fundus abdominally

- Prolapsed: Entire uterus prolapsing through the cervix with the fundus passing out of the introitus

**Classification**

- Acute: Twenty-four hours or less after delivery

- Subacute Longer than 24 hours postpartum)

- Chronic: Longer than 1 month postpartum
