Numerous attempts at defining open airway procedural sedation (OAPS) have been made by several professional organizations. Although minor differences can be seen among these definitions, their common elements can be utilized to formulate a comprehensive definition of OAPS, which can be summarized as the facilitation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures by providing anxiolysis, analgesia, akinesia, and/or amnesia through the administration of one or more pharmacological agents to maintain airway patency and protective reflexes, spontaneous breathing, as well as hemodynamic stability.

A substantial amount of variability exists in the practice of OAPS as it is performed by practitioners with varying backgrounds and skill levels, as well as in various clinical settings. As such, it is important to review core principles that generally remain unchanged irrespective of these variables.
