The degree to which arboviruses can cause neuroinvasive disease depends on both host and virus factors. Although several mechanisms have been described, the exact pathway by which arboviruses can enter the central nervous system (CNS) remains unknown. The infection can then both directly and indirectly cause neuronalÂ injury and apoptosis.
