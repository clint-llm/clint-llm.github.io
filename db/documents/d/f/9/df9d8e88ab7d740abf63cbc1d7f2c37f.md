Plantar heel pain is a common problem among adults; it can lead to severe pain which causes significant disability and impairment of activities of daily living. Plantar heel pain can be due to local causes, for example, plantar fasciitis, referred causes like S1 radiculopathy, or systemic illness like seronegative spondyloarthropathies (SpA). The most common causes of plantar heel pain are plantar fasciitis, heel fat pad atrophy, calcaneal stress fractures, or entrapment of the tibial nerve, medial calcaneal nerve, or the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve (Baxter's nerve). History taking and physical examination, are important for correct diagnosis. Laboratory studies diagnose the systemic causes of the plantar heel pain. Plain radiographs and computed tomography can confirm the diagnosis of the stress fractures of the calcaneus and bone tumors. High-resolution ultrasound confirms the diagnosis of the plantar fasciitis, heel fat pad atrophy, and entrapment neuropathies. Electrophysiological studies are required to scrutinize neurogenic causes of plantar heel pain. Magnetic resonance imaging, like ultrasound, can diagnose soft tissue pathologies and may be better than ultrasound for investigating bony disorders. Treatments include lifestyle modification, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), rehabilitation, local injection, and surgery.
