The etiopathogenesis of primary intraocular lymphoma is still not well understood.

**Chemokine theory –**B cell chemokines such as B-lymphocyte chemoattractant (BLC) and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) present in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) attract lymphoma cells from the choroidal circulation to RPE.

**Infection theory**– Infectious agents are known to cause lymphocyte proliferation which later turns into clonal proliferation. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of the B lymphocytes results in uncontrolled proliferation of the lymphocytes in the absence of T- suppressor lymphocytes in immunodeficiency states such as AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).
