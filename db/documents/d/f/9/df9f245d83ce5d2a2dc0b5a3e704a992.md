The specific cause of yellow nail syndrome (YNS) is unclear. The most widely accepted explanation for the signs and symptoms associated with YNS is a dysfunction of the lymphatic system, specifically, lymphatic drainage.

While cases of familial and congenital YNS have been reported, in the majority of cases, YNS is an acquired disorder of the lymphatic system that presents later in life.
