When considered singly,Â lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are rare, some very rare, with only a few patients reported in the literature. They occur worldwide; the most common among them are Fabry, Gaucher, Metachromatic leucodystrophy, and Pompe. When viewed as a group, the LSDs are much more common. The combined incidence is between 1 in 5000 to 1 in 8000, depending on which literature one cites.

Both ethnicity and geography play a part in the incidence of LSDs. For example, Gaucher disease(GD) occurs in 1 in 40000 to 1 in 60000 in the general population. In Eastern Europen Jews (Ashkenazi Jews), GD is as high as 1 in 800, Tay-Sachs disease as high as 1 in 3900. Niemann-Pick A and mucolipidosis IV also occur with increased frequency in this population.

Recently, in a first-ever multi-center pilot newborn screening program for five most common LSDs, around 65000 were screened, sixty-nine were initially positive, and twenty-three of the 69 were confirmed, all reported with late-onset phenotypes.
