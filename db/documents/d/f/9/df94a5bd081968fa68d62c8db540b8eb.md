Proximal humeral epiphysiolysis, colloquially termed Little League shoulder, is a stress injury of the epiphyseal cartilage of the proximal humerus that occurs exclusively in athletes whose growth plate has not yet closed. It classically affects youth baseball pitchers between the ages of 11 and 16, though theoretically, it could happen at any age up until growth plate closure, which typically happens between the ages of 18 and 21. Although this condition is typically described in youth baseball players and throwing athletes, there have also been cases reported in competitive gymnasts and tennis players. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of proximal humeral epiphysiolysis and highlights the interprofessional team's role in the management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe a typical history consistent with proximal humeral epiphysiolysis.
- Review common physical exam findings consistent with proximal humeral epiphysiolysis.
- Summarize the role of imaging in the workup of proximal humeral epiphysiolysis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the recognition and management of proximal humeral epiphysiolysis and improve outcomes.
