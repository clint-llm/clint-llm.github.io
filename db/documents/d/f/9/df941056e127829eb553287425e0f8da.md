A surgeon needs to be aware of the anatomical relationships when operating on the female internal genitals. Postpartum Hemorrhage is a chief complication, especially after Cesarean Section. Typically, postpartum hemorrhage management is by clamping or embolization of the uterine artery. If bleeding persists, the practitioner should clamp the internal iliac artery below the origin of the superior gluteal artery. Â Some studies have suggested that several arteries, including the uterine artery, are recruited to respond to the demand from the gravid uterus.

Being aware of the position of the ureter during hysterectomy is crucial; it is at the most significant risk of being ligated because of its proximity to the uterine artery and cervix. It travels under the cardinal ligament and is an important clinical association of which to be mindful. Furthermore, during a hysterectomy, the uterine artery is usually isolated to prevent unintentional ligation and massive bleeding. After clamping, it is ligated at the level of the internal cervical os during a hysterectomy.

There have been rare cases of femoral herniation of the internal female genitalia.
