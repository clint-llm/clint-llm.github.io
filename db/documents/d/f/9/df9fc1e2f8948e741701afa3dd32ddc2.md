The clinical significance of the first pass effect is crucial to the proper administration and maintenance of pharmacological therapy. Some drugs that undergo considerable first-pass metabolism include alprenolol, 5-fluorouracil, morphine, pentazocine, and mercaptopurine. When given orally, these drugs are quickly metabolized via the first-pass effect, requiring their oral dosages to be much larger than their intravenous dosages. The first pass effect also has an impact on peak drug concentrations, which may result in drug concentration peaks occurring much earlier than they would in a parenteral dose.

It is critical to maintain proper serum concentrations ofÂ a drug that experiences the first-pass effect; this allows for the maintenance of a safe and effective dose of the drug. Research has shown that monitoring blood concentrations of drugs that experience the first-pass effect is the most viable way to maintain therapeutic concentrations of these drugs.
