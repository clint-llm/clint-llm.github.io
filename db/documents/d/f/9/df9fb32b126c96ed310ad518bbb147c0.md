The pathogenesis of rhinosinusitis involves a combination of viscous sinus secretions and the dysfunction of the sinus ostia and ciliary apparatus. Viral upper respiratory infections or allergens may cause mucosal edema, narrowing the sinus ostia and causing a direct mechanical obstruction. The obstruction of the sinus ostia leads to a transient increase in pressure within the sinus cavity. As air is depleted in this small space, the pressure in the sinus becomes negative relative to atmospheric air pressure. This negative pressure allows nasal bacteria into the sinuses during normal physiologic maneuvers (e.g., sniffing or nose-blowing). Continued mucus secretion in the setting of an obstructed sinus ostium leads to fluid accumulation in the sinus. Inflammation of the nasal ostia and mucous membranes causes structural and functional impairment of the mucociliary apparatus.

The altered characteristics of sinus secretions also contribute to the pathogenesis of sinusitis. The mucous blanket in the respiratory tract is made up of two layers. The periciliary liquid phase is a thin, low-viscosity layer that surrounds the shaft of the cilia and allows the cilia to beat freely. The gel phase is a more viscous layer that rides on top of the periciliary liquid. Alterations in the mucous layer, which occur in the presence of inflammatory debris, as in an inflamed sinus, may further impair ciliary movement because cilia beat most efficiently in a low-viscosity environment.
