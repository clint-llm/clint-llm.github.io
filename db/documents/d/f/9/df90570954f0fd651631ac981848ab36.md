Contraindications for CCTA are similar to those encountered during any contrast-enhanced CT scan. Absolute contraindications are a patient history of severe or anaphylactic reaction to iodinated contrast, inability to cooperate with scan protocols, hemodynamic instability, decompensated heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and renal impairment. Specific thresholds for the definition of renal impairment are deferred to individual performing institutions.  Relative contraindications include pregnancy, inability to tolerate heart rate slowing medications or nitroglycerin, recent phosphodiesterase inhibitor use, severe aortic stenosis, bronchospastic disease, and patient’s weight and height.
