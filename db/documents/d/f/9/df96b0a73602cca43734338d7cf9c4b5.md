Many secretory products have been identified in various intestinal NETs. The most commonly produced substances include serotonin, histamine, tachykinins, kallikrein, and prostaglandins

The metabolism of tryptophan is impaired in these patients with intestinal carcinoids. In a healthy individual only 1% of tryptophan is converted into serotonin whereas, in a patient with carcinoid, the majority of tryptophan is metabolized to serotonin. This serotonin is excreted in the urine as 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (5-HIAA).
