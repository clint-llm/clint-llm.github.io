Bronchiectasis is a progressive disorder with no cure. Hence it is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the primary care physician, nurse practitioner, pulmonologist, infectious disease expert, thoracic surgery, and an internist. The key is to improve symptoms and prevent relapses.

The disease is progressive when associated with ciliary dysfunction and cystic fibrosis and eventually causes respiratory failure. In other patients, the prognosis can be relatively good if postural drainage is performed regularly, and antibiotics are used judiciously.
