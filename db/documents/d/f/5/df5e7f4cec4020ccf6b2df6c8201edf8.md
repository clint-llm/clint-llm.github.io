SBE programs aim to improve patient safety and healthcare quality to better prepare future healthcare providers, with no risks to real patients.

The inclusion of well-trained SPs in medical education provides students with a unique opportunity to respond to complex situations in the clinical environment, which they may not otherwise encounter.

Interprofessional simulation programs that include SPs offer experiential learning opportunities to understand and improve team dynamics, ultimately improving collaboration on future interprofessional teams.
