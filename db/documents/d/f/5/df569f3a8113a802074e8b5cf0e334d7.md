Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare and life-threatening condition. The majority of cases are related to a severe deficiency of enzyme in the blood. TTP is considered a hematologic emergency because, even with treatment, the mortality is estimated at 10 to 20 percent. The diagnosis is challenging given the significant overlap of the clinical presentation of TTP and other conditions. Long-term follow-up is necessary to evaluate for sequelae, identify other autoimmune disorders, and identify recurrence, as this condition usually recurs. This activity examines the differential diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and how to properly evaluate a patient presenting with it. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the presentation commonly associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. 
- Outline potential complications of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. 
- Summarize treatment considerations for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. 
- Revlew interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of thombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
