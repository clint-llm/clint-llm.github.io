The vascular supply of the NAC has been elucidated by several anatomic studies that have shown vascular contributions from the subdermal plexus as well as vessels from the breast parenchyma, with large perforating vessels running along Wuringer's septum.

Certainly, the native NAC size, color, orientation, and shape vary from patient to patient. While NAC reconstruction allows the surgeon to create an NAC that is in harmony with the patient's aesthetic preferences, certain ideals of the NAC position have been outlined in the literature. Classically, the ideal NAC is described as sitting at the point of maximum projection of the breast tissue. A recent study demonstrated the aesthetically ideal NAC position is located in the middle of the breast mound vertically and slightly laterally in the horizontal plane (60:40, lateral: medial ratio).

Unfortunately, NAC reconstruction does not restore the breast's ability to produce milk. Similarly, many of the NAC reconstruction methods do not provide a sensate NAC.
