Desmoid tumors , also known as aggressive fibromatosis, are mesenchymal neoplasms that are considered to be locally invasive but do not metastasize. Despite their lack of metastasizing, they are quite destructive locally and often require resection. This activity reviews the evaluation, and treatment of desmoid tumors, and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the clinical presentation of a patient with desmoid tumor.
- Review the pathological findings and imaging characteristics of desmoid tumors
- Review the treatment approaches for desmoid tumors.
- Describe how an optimally functioning interprofessional team would coordinate care to enhance outcomes for patients with desmoid tumors.
