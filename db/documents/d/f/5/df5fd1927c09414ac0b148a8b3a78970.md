May-Thurner syndrome is more prevalent than thought; however, most patients do not exhibit the signs or symptoms of MTS. The most common presentation is iliofemoral DVT, which should always raise the suspicion for MTS or iliofemoral compression syndrome. Healthcare teams must maintain a high index of suspicion for MTS in patients presenting with left-sided iliofemoral vein thrombosis. Patients must be made aware of the signs and symptoms of DVT and PE so that they can return to seek care at the onset of symptoms. They must also be taught about the post-thrombotic syndrome and given adequate counseling on how to wear the compression stockings. All patients should also be educated regarding the risk of bleeding with DOAC's, warfarin, and parenteral agents and how to seek care in case of uncontrolled or extensive bleeding.
