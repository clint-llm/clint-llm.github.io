Typical treatment includes physical therapy focused on stretching and strengthening the spine and hip joints alongside the psoas muscle. One study found 100% of dancers responded to conservative management. Exercise programs that the patient can do at home with a focus on hip rotation have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing pain and improving activity for patients in pain. Continue over-the-counter pain medications, such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen.

For athletes with suspected groin pain secondary to an iliopsoas tendon injury, an MRI could be warranted for an expected return to play management. MRI changes consistent with muscle strain correlated with a significantly decreased return to play for their respective sport compared to peri-tendinitis changes seen on MRI.

Other treatment modalities include osteopathic manipulative therapy (OMT)

For refractory cases requiring surgery, arthroscopic lengthening of the tendon can be completed for relief, and correcting intra-articular pathology can be done.

Of the reported 24% of patients who developed postoperative iliopsoas tendonitis following total hip arthroscopy, 50% of them required a corticosteroid injection to help relieve pain, while 12% required revision or iliopsoas release.
