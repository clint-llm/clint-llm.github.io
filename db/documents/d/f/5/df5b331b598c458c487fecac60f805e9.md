Adhesive capsulitis has a prevalence of approximately two to five percent in the general population. The mean age of onset is typically 55 years of age. There is a slightly greater predominance in females (1.4:1). Usually, the non-dominant hand is affected. Interestingly, several autoimmune comorbid conditions have been shown to predispose patients to this condition, including thyroid disorders and diabetes mellitus. Additionally, patients with diabetes typically have worse treatment outcomes depending on the duration of their diabetes.
