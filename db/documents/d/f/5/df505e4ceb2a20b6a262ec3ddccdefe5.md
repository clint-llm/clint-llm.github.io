To maintain homeostasis, the excretion of water and electrolytes must match an individualâ€™s intake. The kidneys play a substantial role in osmoregulation by controlling the quantity of fluid reabsorbed from the glomerular filtrate. This fluid is reabsorbed in the renal tubes and may be modulated by hormones such as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), aldosterone, as well as angiotensin II. The capacity of the kidneys to alter fluid excretion, as well as electrolyte excretion (e.g., sodium), is enormous. Studies have shown that sodium intake of 10 times the normal amount has relatively small changes in extracellular fluid volume and plasma sodium concentration as a result of renal compensation.

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of an average human is 180L/day. Given that the plasma volume of a person is only 3L, large amounts of body fluid and solutes are processed by the kidney each day. The advantage of this high GFR in terms of osmoregulation is that it enables the kidneys to rapidly and precisely regulate the volume and composition of body fluids.

At the level of the hypothalamus, osmoreceptor response to extracellular fluid hypertonicity (increased osmolarity), will elicit ADH release from axons down to the posterior pituitary into the circulation. ADH serves a primary function to increase solute-free water reabsorption in the nephrons (less water excretion) to bring down body fluid hypertonicity.
