After finishing medical school, graduates can apply for training in cardiac surgery. The length and content of the postgraduate curriculum differ. With prior general surgical experience, cardiac surgery training can be completed with an additional 2 years specialization. On the other hand, 6-year training programs including subspecialty training in minimally invasive surgery, adult cardiac surgery, pediatric and congenital cardiac surgery, vascular surgery, endovascular interventions, general thoracic surgery, or heart failure surgery.

Training is highly competitive and demanding due to the changing nature of the specialty with increasingly elderly and multimorbid population, working hour restrictions, and new interventional methods. Recent evaluations have predicted shortages for professionals in different countries during the next decades.

Apart from cardiac surgeons, additional disciplines come together to form the cardiac perioperative team. These include extracorporeal technologist, cardiac anesthesia, cardiac intensive care, surgical nurses, cardiologists, and radiologists. Each of them have special training.
