It is important to let patients understand the limitations of surgical intervention. Many dystrophies can reoccur in a few years, despite corneal transplant.

Patients should be educated on post-surgical safety measures to promote optimal outcomes. Bandage contact lenses may aid in preventing loose sutures and displacement of the graft.

The application of artificial tears in the morning may help alleviate corneal erosion pain.
