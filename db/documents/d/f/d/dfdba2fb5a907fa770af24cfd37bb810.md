The exact mechanism of accommodation loss in presbyopia remains controversial, and insights into the mechanism still need to be elucidated.

It has been proposed that these changes result from nuclear sclerosis, reduced distance between the equator of the lens and the ciliary musculature, and reduced elasticity of the lens capsule. The other proposed theories are extra lenticular causes such as ciliary muscle dysfunction, loss of zonular elasticity, and decreased resistance of vitreous.

The various proposed theories include

**Helmholtz**

The classical theory was put forward by Helmholtz nearly a century ago. This theory proposes that when the lens is at rest, it is relatively flat while viewing objects at a farther distance. While accommodating, the ciliary muscles contract and move the zonules both anterior and inwards.

**Coleman**

Coleman proposed the catenary theory. As per the catenary theory, zonules function like pillars of a bridge and regulate the natural curvature of the crystalline lens.

**Schachar**

As per Schachar, there is a different theory of accommodation which state that, at the insertion of the zonular fibers, there is a ciliary musculature contraction, which increases the tension of the zonular fibers and the lens capsule, resulting in a shape change of the lens during accommodation.

**Dysfunctional Lens Syndrome**

The different stages of lens aging are classified as

**Stage 1 -**There is a reduction in rigidity of the lens, corresponding to the stage of presbyopia.

**Stage 2**- There is contrast sensitivity reduction and higher order aberrations reduction that affect night vision. This is seen in stages corresponding to the developmental; cataract, which further influences daily living.
