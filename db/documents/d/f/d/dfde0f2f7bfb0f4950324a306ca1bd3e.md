Prolonged cerebral ischemia will deprive the brain cells of energy leading to physiological dysfunction and, eventually, cell death. Many biochemical, physiological, and morphological changes in the cell and its environment precede its eventual death, such as energy failure, lactic acidosis, increases in oxygen extraction fraction and glucose utilization, protein synthesis inhibition, chromatin condensation, cell organelle disruption, and cell shrinkage.

The multitude of events initiated by the ischemic insult plays a role in the molecular, microscopic, functional, and macroscopic derangements observed in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Most notable are the oxidative stress, leukocyte recruitment, and breach of the blood-brain barrier.
