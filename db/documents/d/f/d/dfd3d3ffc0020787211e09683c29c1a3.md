Initial studies of methicillin-associated AIN showed a favorable recovery of renal function in a majority of patients. However, recent reports of drug-induced AIN show higher residual renal damage rates in 40% to 50% of cases. NSAID-associated AIN portends a poor prognosis. The prognosis of AIN associated with other etiologies has not been fully understood. The factors associated with incomplete renal recovery are delay in the initiation of corticosteroid therapy, the duration of AKI, NSAIDs-associated AIN, and interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy on a renal biopsy.
