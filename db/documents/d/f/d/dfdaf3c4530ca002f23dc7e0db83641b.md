The femoral nerve block affects both motor and sensory nerves. This block can be used for procedures on the knee or to repair trauma to the medial aspect of the thigh and lower leg. After the procedure, the patient will have marked weakness in the quadriceps and should not be allowed to ambulate until all sensation has returned.

The adductor canal block is similar to the femoral nerve block but only affects the sensory nerves of the lower leg. Therefore, it can also be used for procedures on the knee and medial aspect of the lower leg.

The popliteal block at the knee is often used for surgery on the lower leg.

The fascia iliaca compartment block can block the femoral, obturator, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves and is often used for hip fractures and total hip arthroplasties. The block provides prolonged pain relief in the hip and anteromedial thigh.

If successful, most lower extremity nerve blocks last 6 to 24 hours; the duration of anesthesia or analgesia may be shorter. Other options for lower extremity anesthesia and analgesia include spinal and epidural anesthesia.
