The use of chemotherapy in vaginal cancer is relatively new, and most research has been extrapolated from data on cervical cancer treatment. Treatment with cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil has demonstrated some efficacy.

Limited studies on chemotherapy for recurrent vaginal cancer are available. Benefits and toxicity should be carefully considered when using systemic chemotherapy for these patients. Data on the use of chemotherapy is mainly from case reports. Cisplatin is the most common agent reported, and immunotherapy with pembrolizumab and nivolumab has been reported in a small number of patients. The poor prognosis for recurrent or stage IV disease may encourage further investigation of these agents.
