Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by angiomas involving the face, choroid, and leptomeninges. The facial capillary vascular malformation is also known as "port-wine stain" or "nevus flammeus" and usually is seen in the territory of the trigeminal nerve. Sturge-Weber syndrome is also called encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis. It is the third most common neurocutaneous syndrome after neurofibromatosis and tuberous sclerosis.
