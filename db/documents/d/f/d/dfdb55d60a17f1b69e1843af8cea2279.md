The genus Paracoccidioides belongs to the phylum Ascomycota, order Onygenales, and includes species from different phylogenetic lineages: PS1 (more frequent in South America), PS2 (found in Brazil and Venezuela), PS3 (found in Colombia), and PS4 (limited to Venezuela).Paracoccidioides as a dimorphic fungus with mycelial growth at 22° to 24° C, displaying thin septated hyphae, occasional chlamydospores, and conidia. It also describes their growth as a yeast, growing at 36° to 37° C, identified by multiple-budding yeast cells (“pilot’s wheel”). The two main species lack a sexual stage (teleomorph). Paracoccidioides grow in the soil form in humid regions with a medium to a high rainy season, mild temperatures, and the presence of forests and rivers.Paracoccidioides infection is reported in areas of coffee and tobacco crops. Human beings and nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus) are the main accidental hosts. Inter-human transmission has not yet been reported.
