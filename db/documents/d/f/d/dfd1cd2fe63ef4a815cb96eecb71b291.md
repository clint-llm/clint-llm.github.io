**Liver Function Tests**

The liver functions are normal or near normal except if PVT occurs in a patient with cirrhosis. Portal hypertension due to chronic PVT may cause thrombocytopenia due to splenomegaly. Patients with portal biliopathy may show a rise in alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin.

**Doppler Ultrasound**

Doppler ultrasound is an investigation of choice with sensitivity and specificity ranging from 80% to 100% with an accuracy of 88% to 98%. It will show solid isoechoic or hypoechoic material within portal vein either filling the lumen partially or completely with the absence or reduced portal venous flow. Portal cavernoma will be seen as multiple tortuous small vessels replacing the portal vein suggestive of chronic PVT. Ultrasound will also pick up associated with splenomegaly. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CDUS) and endoscopic ultrasound are other modalities that have been found to be superior to ultrasound in demonstrating the presence or absence of flow in portal vein when it is very small.

**Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging**

CT and MRI provide additional information such as the extension of thrombus, evidence of bowel infarction and status of adjacent organs. CT scan with contrast also helps to distinguish bland thrombus from the malignant one. Bland thrombus is typically seen as a low density, non-enhancing defect within portal veins, while a tumor thrombus enhances following contrast administration with distension of vessel wall or intra-thrombus contrast enhancement due to neovascularization. The sensitivity and specificity of MRI for detecting the main PVT are 100% and 98%, respectively. It is valuable in determining the resectability of neoplasm involving the portal venous system and follow-up after therapeutic procedures.

**Splenoportovenography**

This is invasive, but now an obsolete procedure is done in the past which involves injecting dye in the splenic pulp and visualizing the splenoportal venous axis. It helps not only in diagnosing PVT but also identifying the patency of splenoportal axis for future splenorenal or mesocaval shunt surgery. In the pre-US/CT/MRI era, it was proved to be a safe procedure which also helped in measuring portal pressure.

**Endoscopy**

It is important to have an endoscopy in patients with PVT as portal hypertensive gastropathy is often present in the acute PVT with cancer or cirrhosis, while large ectopic/esophageal/gastric varices are present more often in patients with chronic PVT.

**Procoagulant Workup**

Once the diagnosis of PVT is made, the extensive investigation of prothrombotic disorders and local factors is recommended including antiphospholipid syndrome, protein C, S, antithrombin III levels, factor V, Leiden mutation, among others.
