The intrinsic muscles of the hand are divided into five groups:

- Thenar eminence muscles

- Hypothenar eminence muscles

- Lumbrical muscles

- Dorsal interosseous muscles

- Volar interosseous muscles

The intrinsic plus hand occurs most commonly secondary to the spasticity of the intrinsic muscles, leading to flexion of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and extension of the interphalangeal joints. However, it can also occur due to extrinsic muscle weakness (extensor digitorum communis or flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus)

The intrinsic minus hand occurs secondary to loss of intrinsic muscle action, leading to loss of the MCP flexion and interphalangeal extension, which are more evident in the fourth and fifth fingers.
