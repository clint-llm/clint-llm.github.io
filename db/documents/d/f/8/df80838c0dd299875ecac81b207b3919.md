Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the major vessels is associated with the narrowing of the arteries due to atherosclerosis. It is estimated that approximately 2% of the population has subclavian artery PAD. The prevalence of PAD in adults older than 70 years is about 15%. Of these, nearly 25% will require revascularization, and 5% of patients will progress to critical limb ischemia. Subclavian artery stenosis has been reported in up toÂ 1.9% of the community population and 7.1% of the patient population with vascular disease.

The prevalence of disease in a brachiocephalic artery in patients with known PAD is about 42%. Patients with known peripheral arterial disease can also have stenosis of the left subclavian artery (30%). Half of the patients with subclavian artery disease have coronary artery disease, and one-third have carotid or vertebral disease.

In rare circumstances, bilateral subclavian artery stenosis has been reported.
