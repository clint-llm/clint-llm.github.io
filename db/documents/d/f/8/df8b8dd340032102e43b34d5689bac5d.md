The term "glomerulonephritis" encompasses a subset of renal diseases characterized by immune-mediated damage to the basement membrane, mesangium, or capillary endothelium, leading to hematuria, proteinuria, and azotemia. Acute forms of glomerulonephritis (GN) can result from either a primary renal cause or a secondary illness that causes renal manifestations. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of glomerulonephritis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of glomerulonephritis.
- Summarize the physical findings associated with glomerulonephritis.
- Outline the management considerations for the different diseases grouped under the term 'glomerulonephritis.'
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes for patients affected by glomerulonephritis.
