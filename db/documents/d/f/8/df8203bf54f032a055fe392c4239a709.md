Mucoepidermoid carcinoma arises from the epithelium of the interlobular and intralobular salivary ducts. The most common genetic finding is the chromosomal translocation t(11;19)(q21:p13), leading to the fusion of MECT1 and MAML2 genes, which is responsible for disrupting the NOTCH signaling pathway.

Over 50% of Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (AdCC) tumors contain the t(6;9)(q22-23;p23-24) translocation, which fuses the MYB protooncogene on chromosome 6q to the NFIB gene on chromosome 9p, resulting in an overexpression of MYB-NFIB fusion oncogene and worse prognosis.

Acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) develops from tumorigenesis of cells responsible for acinar development, namely the reserve cells of the intercalated ducts and terminal tubule. In mice studies, inactivation of PTEN and Apc led to an upregulation of mTOR and Wnt signaling, which increased the incidence of acinic cell carcinoma.mTOR compared to other salivary malignancies.

The presence of biological receptors in salivary gland malignancies has recently come under investigation. Tyrosine kinase receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are present in up to 71% of all salivary gland cancers.C-kit is expressed in malignancies derived from the intercalated ducts of salivary glands such as adenoid cystic carcinoma.erb-B2, which has been associated with a worse prognosis.

Epigenetic mutations involving DNA promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes can lead to transcriptional inactivation and increase both the risk of salivary duct carcinoma and the transformation of pleomorphic adenoma into carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.

The presence of SCC in the salivary glands is suspected to arise from several sources including 1) malignant squamous portion of MEC, 2) metastasis from a cutaneous or mucosal head and neck source, 3) metastasis from distant primary carcinoma or 4) primary squamous cell carcinoma.

Approximately 4.4% to 5.2% of malignant melanoma of the parotid cases do not have a primary source.

The development of lymphoma from Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is theorized to be due to prolonged B-cell activity and survival. Sjogren Syndrome is associated with excessive expression of cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory factors such as interferon (IFN) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF).
