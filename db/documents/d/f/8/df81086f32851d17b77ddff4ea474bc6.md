Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is typically diagnosed in people younger than 40 years, and about 80% of patients develop first symptoms when they are younger than 30 years. Less than 5% of patients present when they are older than 45 years. AS is more common among men than women. There is an increased risk in relatives of affected patients.
