In cases of suspected foreign body ingestion, the airway (including the oropharynx) and breathing should be evaluated promptly.  A foreign body that has become obstructed within or injured the esophagus may cause chest pain or a foreign body sensation. Symptoms may be more notable when swallowing. Younger children may drool, gag, vomit, or refuse food. Hematemesis and cough may be present.  A foreign body lodged in the stomach or intestines may cause abdominal pain, vomiting, or bloody stools.  If present for a prolonged period, fever or weight loss may develop. A foreign body that has completely obstructed the esophagus will cause more dramatic symptoms.

Importantly, however, there may be no signs or symptoms (or they may be subtle and hard to recognize) in pediatric ingestions. Since many foreign body ingestions by children are unwitnessed, the possibility of non-specific symptoms being caused by foreign body ingestion should always be considered.  In one series, for example, only half of the patients had any symptoms whatsoever despite witnessed ingestion of a foreign body.

Swallowed foreign bodies that contain nickel may cause systemic signs and symptoms, such as rash or pruritus, in patients with nickel sensitivity.
