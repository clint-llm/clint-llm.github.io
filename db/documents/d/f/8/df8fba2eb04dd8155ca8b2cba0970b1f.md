Osteopenia describes a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) below normal reference values, yet not low enough to meet the diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis. BMD is diagnosed via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone scans. Osteopenia, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), is a t-score between -1 to -2.5, while values less than -2.5 are diagnostic for osteoporosis. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of osteopenia and addresses the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of osteopenia.
- Distinguish osteoporosis from osteopenia based on t-score.
- List management considerations for osteopenia.
- Explore interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by osteopenia.
