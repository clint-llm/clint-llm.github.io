Premenstrual symptoms include a constellation of mood, behavioral, and physical indications that occur in a cyclic pattern prior to menstruation and then wane off after the menstrual period in women of reproductive age. Most females have only mild discomfort, and symptoms do not interfere with their personal, social, or professional lives; however, 5% to 8% of women have moderate-to-severe symptoms that can cause significant distress and functional impairment. This activity illustrates the presentation of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. 
- Describe the presentation of premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
- Summarize the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. 
- Explain the means to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
