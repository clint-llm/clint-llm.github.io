Mycobacterium avium complex consists of multiple nontuberculosis mycobacterial species (NTM), which cannot be distinguished in the microbiology laboratory and requires genetic testing. M. avium and Mycobacterium intracellular are the two original members of this complex, known for about a hundred years. Mycobacterium chimaera has been included in the M. avium intracellulare complex (2004). Some include Mycobacterium subspecies paratuberculosis in the My.avium complex as well. A newcomer to the Mycobacterium avium complex is the Mycobacterium paraintracellulare, identified in pulmonary infections in Southeast Asia in 2016.

M. avium was first isolated in chickens 1933 with a cavitary disease resembling tuberculosis. Human cases were identified decades later. M. avium complex is the most common cause of nontuberculosis mycobacterial species infections in humans, and respiratory system is the most common site of infection.
