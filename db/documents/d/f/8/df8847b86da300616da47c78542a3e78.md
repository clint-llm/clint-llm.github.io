A history of recent shellfish ingestion may be present. In coastal areas, the presence of harmful algal blooms may increase the risk of episodes of shellfish toxicity. Saxitoxin causes a flaccid paralysis. Thus, difficulty breathing may be present, and death by respiratory failure may occur. Ataxia, vertigo, dysphagia, dysarthria, blindness, paresthesias, and burning sensations of the face and extremities may also be present; paralysis usually resolves within 12 hours. However, muscle weakness may persist for weeks. Domoic acid can cause memory loss as well as coma, seizures, hemodynamic instability, and cardiac dysrhythmias. Approximately 10% of patients will have long-term antegrade memory deficits and paresthesias. Symptoms of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. However, these symptoms may also be seen in the other shellfish poisoning syndromes. Brevetoxins can cause gastrointestinal symptoms as well as paresthesias, myalgias, vertigo, ataxia, reversal of hot and cold temperature sensation, headache, bradycardia, and mydriasis. Aerosolization of brevetoxins in sea spray can cause severe bronchoconstriction, mucosal irritation, and cough.
