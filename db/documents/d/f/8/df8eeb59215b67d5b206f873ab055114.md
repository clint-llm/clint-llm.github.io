Once the diagnosis has made, early surgical repair of the spinal lesion is essential in preventing further deficits and neurological damage. Prenatal surgery was proven to be more effective than postnatal surgery in lowering the occurrence of future complications.

A trial study about the management of myelomeningocele (MOMS) occurred in the United States on 60 pregnant ladies who had fetal myelomeningocele closure for their fetuses from 2011 till 2017. The results of the study showed that fetal surgical repair was more effective than postnatal surgery in improving and preserving the neurological function as well as reducing the need for the reversal of hindbrain herniation and shunting.

However, reports exist of high rates of pregnancy complications in the literature, such as uterine rupture at the time of delivery. Consequently, the delivery of the child should take place via cesarean section at early term or late preterm.
