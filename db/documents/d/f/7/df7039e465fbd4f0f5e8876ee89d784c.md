Patients with uncomplicated AOM are usually treated by their primary care providers. However, primary care physicians may refer the patient to an otolaryngologist for surgical procedures, most likely tympanostomy tubes, in the case of recurrent AOM or CSOM. An audiologist is involved if children present with subjective evidence of hearing loss or failure to meet language development marks. Young children with CSOM may have speech and language delays owing to the hearing loss created by recurrent ear infections, which are managed by a speech therapist.
