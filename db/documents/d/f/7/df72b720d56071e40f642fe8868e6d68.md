Hyperamylasemia can be from pancreatic sources, salivary glands, or other etiologies. Pancreatic causes of hyperamylasemia include:

- Acute pancreatitis usually presents with severe epigastric abdominal pain and elevations of serum amylase beyond three times the upper limit of normal. Elevated serum amylase levels usually return to baseline in 3 to 7 days. In the first instance of acute pancreatitis, if hyperamylasemia persists for longer than usual it may be associated with recurrence of the disease.

- Trauma, such as blunt trauma, surgery, or recent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) of the pancreatic duct leading to the release of amylase enzyme from within the pancreatic cells. Risk factors include difficult cannulation, age below 60 years, history of diabetes, a stent in the biliary duct, and nasobiliary drainage.

- Chronic pancreatitis

- Pancreatic pseudocysts

- Pancreatic ascites

- Pancreatic trauma

- Choledocholithiasis

Salivary gland-related causes include:

- Trauma to the salivary gland

- Radiation to the neck area involving the parotid gland

- Salivary gland obstruction with calculi

Decreased metabolic clearance of amylase can also lead to hyperamylasemia and can be due to:

- Renal failure

- Liver failure (i.e., hepatitis or cirrhosis)

Other known etiologies of hyperamylasemia include:

- Macroamylasemia

- Intestinal disease (e.g., inflammatory disease of the small intestine, mesenteric ischemia, intestinal obstruction, peritonitis)

- Female reproductive tract disease (e.g., ruptured ectopic pregnancy, fallopian or ovarian cysts, salpingitis)

- Malignancy (e.g., lung, ovary, pancreas, pheochromocytoma, thymoma, multiple myeloma, breast)

- Acidosis (ketoacidosis and nonketotic acidosis)

- Balloon-assisted enteroscopy
