Biological warfare agents include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and biological toxins. Some agents are frequently lethal, while others are intended to cause illness or incapacitation. Biological warfare can be directed not only at the human population but also at crops and livestock. Biological warfare agents are most likely to be dispersed as aerosols to be more easily spread amongst large populations. However, certain agents can be spread from person to person or by vectors, ingestion, direct contact, or other methods. This activity reviews the most common biologic agents addressing the evaluation and treatment of these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify agents that may be used in biological warfare. 
- Summarize the pathophysiology and accompanying presentation of patients affected by various biological warfare agents. 
- Review the treatment regimens for different biological warfare agents. 
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team, including first responders, public health officials, and the medical team, to ensure appropriate precautionary measures and incident management are taken.
