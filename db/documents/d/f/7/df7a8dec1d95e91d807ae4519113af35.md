Indications for placement of a thoracostomy tube are numerous and covered elsewhere. In summary, indications for placement include:

- Removal of an air collection in the pleural space
- Pneumothorax can be treated with a thoracostomy tube placement if it is preventing adequate expansion of the lung or concern exists for the future development of tension physiology, such as in a patient receiving positive pressure ventilation. Recent research has also shown that an air space measuring less than 35 mm in the largest axis can be observed.
- Tension pneumothorax diagnosis based on clinical suspicion should be immediately treated by thoracostomy tube placement.
- Hemothorax or pneumothorax may be appropriate to manage with a chest tube depending on the totality of circumstances and discretion of the treating physician.

- Removal of fluid collection or accumulation between visceral and parietal pleura

- Hemothorax, generally considered, indicated if the calculated volume is greater than 300 cc.
- Pleural effusion (malignant or benign) can become symptomatic from displacement and collapse of alveolar space.
- Chylothorax, where thoracostomy is considered part of the definitive therapeutic modality, along with dietary modification.
- An empyema should almost universally be treated with surgical management (e.g., drainage, irrigation, decortication, etc.) as medical management is rarely successful.

- Use as a delivery conduit to introduce medication or fluid into the pleural space.

- Internal warming allows warm fluid to circulate through the thoracic space to provide an external heat source for the core and circulating blood volume.
- Pleurodesis with a talc slurry can be instilled through the chest tube to promote scarring of the visceral and parietal pleura together.
- Hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy (HITHOC) allows for the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents directly into the thoracic space for malignant pleural mesothelioma and metastatic disease.
