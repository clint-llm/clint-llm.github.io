- Placenta previa is the covering of the internal cervical os preventing a safe vaginal delivery.

- Delivery should be performed from 36 to 37 full weeks, via cesarean section, in uncomplicated cases.

- Bed rest, avoiding intercourse, and avoiding digital examinations are recommended. Any manipulation of the placenta can lead to hemorrhage.

- Patients with placenta previa should go to the emergency room if they have any episodes of vaginal bleeding.

- Prior history of placenta previa and a history of cesarean sections may increase a patient's risk for placenta accreta.

- If there is a concern for placenta accreta, increta, or percreta, then a cesarean hysterectomy may need to be performed.
