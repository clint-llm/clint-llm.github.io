The histology of PAS disorders reveals placental invasion into the uterine myometrium. In the case of placenta percreta, it may also invade into the serosa or other organs. There is also an increased rate of trophoblastic inclusions compared to normal placentation. These inclusions are characterized by an inner layer of syncytiotrophoblasts contained within an outer layer of cytotrophoblasts. They are most commonly associated with molar pregnancies and chromosomal aneuploidies. However, one group documented their presence in 40 percent of placenta accreta specimens, compared to 2.4 percent of controls.
