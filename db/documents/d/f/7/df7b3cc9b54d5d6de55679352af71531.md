Patients with RAPD can present with normal visual function

**Ocular Examination**

- Visual acuity: may range from perception of light (PL) to 20/20

- Ocular alignment: patients with long-standing amblyopia may manifest sensory exodeviation.

- Assessment of pupils:Â 

- A weaker initial constriction with greater redilatation
- An initial stall with greater redilatation
- An initial immediate dilatation, known as pupillary escape

- Pupillary escape is an evident and specific sign of RAPD.

- Anterior segment examination: the presence of iris neovascularization should raise suspicion of ischemic CRVO

- Fundus evaluation: helps to identify underlying causes such as optic neuropathy (optic neuritis, ischemic optic neuropathy), retinal detachment, retinal vascular occlusion, glaucoma, and others.

**Supportive Tests:**Color vision, contrast vision, Visual evoked potential, Visual fields evaluation, MRI in cases of optic neuritis
