Distinct transcriptional mechanisms and specific gene regulatory activity control the differentiation of muscle fibers.

The myotome then differentiates to form the skeletal muscles in the body after receiving stimulation from the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)Â signaling molecule from the notochord, resulting in the Myf5 expression and subsequent differentiation.

Several signaling molecules like the Wnt and the BMP and some transcription factors like sine oculis homeobox are responsible for this differentiation. The development of skeletal muscles in the limb and the trunk depends on the expression of MyoD and Myf5 and their effects on the different myoblasts.
