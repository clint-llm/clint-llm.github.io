Currently, the indications of aortic valve repair are the same as that of valve replacement with a benefit of low perioperative complications.

The outcomes of aortic valve repair in aortic valve insufficiency rely on the size and quality of cusp available to repair. Patients with significant destruction of the aortic valve, calcifications, or mechanical damage due to rheumatic heart disease are less likely to benefit from aortic valve repair.
