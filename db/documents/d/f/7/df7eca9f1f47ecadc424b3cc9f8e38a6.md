Maternal prognosis is benign in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) and symptoms, and abnormal liver biochemistry resolves rapidly after delivery. In some women, the abnormal LFTs may remain persistent and should be investigated further for any other etiology. In a large cohort study, women with ICP were found to have a high incidence of hepatobiliary disorders later in life and, hepatitis C, chronic hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis, and gallstones or cholangitis were seen more commonly in these women compared to the general population.
