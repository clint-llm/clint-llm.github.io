Atrial tachycardia is not considered a life-threatening condition. Lifestyle modifications need to be implemented to prevent atrial tachycardia from being triggered again if that was the cause. Caffeine, alcohol, and situations that cause stress or anxiety should be avoided. Adequate and regular sleep is recommended. Prolonged states of atrial tachycardia can cause long term effects on the heart such as cardiac remodeling. Atrial tachycardia typically is more difficult to control the more prolongedÂ time the heart stays in the arrhythmia, so it is essential to correct the arrhythmia or underlying issue as quickly as possible.
