Infants born with megalocornea should be referred to pediatricians or specialists who can appropriately diagnose and treat the underlying syndromes or other associated conditions if present. A pediatric ophthalmologist should be part of the team to assess for congenital or acquired ocular defects with eventual transfer to a general or cornea specialist as the child ages. Anesthesia professionals should also be a part of the team because complete ocular examinations may require sedating infants and very young children. Ophthalmology nurses assist in evaluation, patient education, and follow-up care. Nurses should communicate effectively with treating physicians to coordinate care and enhance patient outcomes.
