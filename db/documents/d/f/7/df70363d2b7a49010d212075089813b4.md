- Coenzyme Q10 is present naturally in the human body. CoQ10 supplements are generally well-tolerated with only minor and infrequent adverse effects, including stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

- Doses of 100 mg per day or higher have been associated with mild insomnia in some individuals.

- Liver enzyme elevation has been seen in some patients taking 300 mg or more per day, but no liver toxicity has been reported.

- Supplementation has been shown to be tolerated, even up to 1200 mg/day.

- Other rare adverse effects have included dizziness, photophobia, irritability, headache, heartburn, increased involuntary movements, and fatigue.

The FDA does not strictly regulate dietary supplements such as coenzyme Q10, nor are manufacturers required to prove their safety and purity both before and after release to the markets. However, several independent agencies test supplements for purity, composition, and strength and issue certifications to manufacturers that meet their testing criteria. However, these agencies do not test every batch that is manufactured, and they do not guarantee therapeutic value. Manufacturers who have received these agencies’ seal of approval will often advertise so on their product packaging.
