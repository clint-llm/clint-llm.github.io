The prevalence of conjunctivitis varies by age, sex, and time of year. There is a bimodal distribution of diagnosed cases of acute conjunctivitis NOS in the emergency department (ED). The highest diagnosis rates are among children under seven years of age, with the highest incidence occurring between the ages of 0 and 4 years. The secondary distribution peak occurs at the ages of 22 years in women and 28 years in men. Overall the rates of conjunctivitis diagnosed in the ED are slightly higher in women than in men. Seasonality is also a factor in the presentation and, thus, the diagnosis of conjunctivitis. Varying by age, there is a peak incidence in all presentations of conjunctivitis in children ages 0 to 4 years in March, followed by other age groups in May. A nationwide ED study found seasonality to be consistent for all geographic regions, regardless of changes in climate or weather patterns.
