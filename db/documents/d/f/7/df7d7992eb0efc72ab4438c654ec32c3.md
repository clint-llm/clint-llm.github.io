Nerve supply to the meninges derives from the ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). The meningeal branches of the vagus nerve (CN X) and the first and second cervical spinal nerves also contribute to the innervation of the intracranial meninges. The tentorium cerebelli is innervated by the tentorial branches of the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve (CN V).

The supratentorial portion receives its innervation from the ramus tentorii or Arnold's recurrent nerve of the first branch of the trigeminal (ophthalmic) nerve. Beyond the petrous portion, the tentorium's innervation derives from branches of the second and third divisions of the trigeminal nerve.

The infratentorial portion is innervated by branches of the upper cervical nerves, and the meningeal branch of the vagus nerve (CN X).

The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems innervate the infra and the supratentorial portions of the tentorium.
