Various specialty services may be required to manage strangulation injuries. Cerebral edema with impending herniation and cases involving spinal cord compromise (or other neurological injuries) may require neurosurgical intervention. Orthopedic surgeons with spine surgery fellowship training may be required for certain injuries. Vascular compromise, depending on the type and extent, may require a vascular surgeon or interventional radiologist. Tracheal injuries can be repaired by otolaryngology. Critically ill patients will require the care of a trained intensivist â€“ skilled ventilator management is crucial for optimal recovery in this patient population. Once recovered, or if initial injuries are minimal, mental health experts and psychiatric care should be considered depending on case specifics. Long term neurological sequelae are best handled in conjunction with a trained neurologist.
