The bladder is located in the anterior pelvis in an adult. The dome is covered by the peritoneum, and the bladder neck is fixed to the pelvis by fascia and ligaments. IP bladder rupture occurs on the dome of the bladder and above the peritoneal reflection, while EP bladder rupture occurs below the peritoneal reflection and on the anterior or lateral aspects of the bladder.

Bladder contusion is a partial thickness tear of the bladder and the formation of a hematoma caused by blunt trauma. Patients with bladder contusion can present with gross hematuria. On cystography, there is no extravasation of contrast. This is usually self-limiting, as it is a relatively benign process.EP bladder rupture is most often caused by rapid deceleration. A combination of shearing force and direct penetration by bony spicules of a fractured pelvis is thought to be the underlying mechanism of EP bladder rupture. Complex EP bladder rupture can cause urine leaks into the thighs, penis, perineum, or the anterior abdominal wall. Researchers found that 85% to 100% of bladder injuries are associated with concomitant pelvic fractures.

IP bladder rupture occurs most commonly on the dome of the bladder as it is the only portion covered by the peritoneum; thus, it is the least protected area of the bladder. Contrary to EP bladder rupture, IP bladder rupture is usually caused by a direct blow to a distended bladder, although it can also be associated with deceleration injuries. Urine drains into the abdomen and is absorbed by the peritoneal cavity, manifesting as elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, electrolyte and metabolic derangements, and decreased urine output. Combined EP and IP bladder rupture are less common, accounting for 5% to 8% of bladder injuries associated with pelvic fractures.
