Early referral for epilepsy surgery is the key factor determining the outcome of the surgery.

A multidisciplinary approach in a high-volume epilepsy center needs to be promoted for improved patient outcomes.

A significant proportion of patients, though not seizure-free, will at least have improved quality of life owing to the substantial reduction in their seizure frequency.

Since epilepsy surgery has shown to be cost-effective, even when the probability of being a suitable candidate is as low as 5%, harmonization and dissemination of the role of epilepsy surgery is the need of the hour.
