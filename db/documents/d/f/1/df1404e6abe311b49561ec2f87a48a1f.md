Depressed patients may be prone to accidental or intentional overdosage. In a crisis situation, it is also prudent to consider the involvement of alcohol and/or other drugs. Assay methods are not practical for clinical or toxicological use.

For patients who overdose on phenelzine, the symptoms can range from agitation to comatose status. Sympathetic overflow effects can also be observed, including hypertension, tachypnea, tachycardia, and dilated pupils. There may be observable involuntary movements of the eyes, face, and jaw.

If phenelzine overdose is suspected, focused symptomatic and supportive treatment may be necessary. This could include gastric lavage via charcoal slurry with airway maintenance. Diazepam will address any excessive central nervous system stimulation. Dialysis and acidification of the urine may be necessary, but data do not support their routine use. Chlorpromazine may be another option if a hypertensive crisis secondary to suspected phenelzine overdose.
