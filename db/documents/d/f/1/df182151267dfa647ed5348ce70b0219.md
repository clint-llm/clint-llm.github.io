Conjunctivitis is the most prevalent etiology of eye redness and discharge. While there are many types of conjunctivitis, viral, allergic, and bacterial are the three most common.

Infectious conjunctivitis can result from bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. However, 80% of acute cases of conjunctivitis are viral, the most common pathogen being adenovirus. Adenoviruses are responsible for 65 to 90% of cases of viral conjunctivitis.

Bacterial conjunctivitis is far more common in children than adults, and the pathogens responsible for bacterial conjunctivitis vary depending on the age group. Staphylococcal species, specifically Staphylococcal aureus, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza, are the most common cause in adults, while in children, the disease is more often caused by H. influenza, S. pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

Allergens, toxins, and local irritants are responsible for non-infectious conjunctivitis.
