Flying foxes (Pteropus giganteus) are the reservoirs of the Nipah virus in Bangladesh and India.Pteropus species of bats in other countries (Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Madagascar) have antiâ€“Nipah virus antibodies.Pteropus species of bats can be reservoirs.

Transmission of the Nipah virus can occur from direct contact with infected animals (bats, pigs, horses) or their body fluids (blood, urine, or saliva), consuming contaminated food products (palm sap or fruit), or close contact with an infected person or their body fluids (nasal or respiratory droplets, urine, or blood).

NiV enters through the oro-nasal route into humans and other hosts. High concentrations of antigen in the lymphoid and respiratory tissue suggest that these are the probable sites of initial replication. NiV infects the epithelium of the respiratory tract and induces inflammatory cytokines, leading to the development of an acute respiratory distress syndrome-like disease.
