The hypothalamic-pituitary axis regulates TSH release through hypothalamic neurons that secrete thyroid releasing hormone (TRH), a hormone that stimulates thyrotrophs in the anterior pituitary to secrete TSH. TSH, in turn, stimulates thyroid follicular cells to release thyroxine or T4 (80%), and triiodothyronine or T3 (20%). Somatostatin, on the other hand, is another hormone produced by the hypothalamus that inhibits the release of TSH from the anterior pituitary. When T4 enters the circulation, it gets converted to T3 through the process of deiodination. T4 and T3 can then exert negative feedback on TSH levels (high levels of T3/T4 decrease TSH release from the anterior pituitary, while low levels of T3/T4 increase TSH release). T3 is the predominant inhibitor of TSH secretion. Because TSH secretion is so sensitive to minor changes in free T4 through this negative feedback loop, abnormal TSH levels are detected earlier than those of free T4 in hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. There is a log-linear relationship between T3/T4 and TSH, and minor changes in T3/T4 lead to significant changes in TSH.
