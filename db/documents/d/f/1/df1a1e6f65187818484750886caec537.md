**Melatonin Content of Supplements**

FDA does not regulate supplements as supplements are generally presumed safe. However, this can lead to concerns about the actual concentrations of supplements, including melatonin. One study analyzed 31 melatonin supplements and found that actual melatonin content ranged from -83% to +478% of the labeled content.

**Routes of Administration**

- Oral tablet

- Oral liquid

- Rectal suppository

- Transdermal patch

**Formulations**

- Immediate-release

- Extended-release

- Combined immediate and extended-release

**Dosing**

As the FDA does not regulate melatonin as a drug, effective dosing is not well-defined. The dose used in studies varied from 0.1 to 10 mg, administered up to two hours before bedtime.

**Maximum Dosage**

Not defined in trials

**Elimination Half-Life**

One to two hours, depending on the formulation

**Bioavailability**

Highly variable, 1% to 74%, likely dependent on formulation and dose

**Metabolism**

Ninety percent of melatonin is metabolized in the liver primarily by the enzyme CYP1A2. Metabolism of melatonin occurs by hydroxylation, converting it to 6-Hydroxymelatonin. Consequently, it is conjugated to sulfuric or glucuronic acid and excreted in the urine. A smaller amount is excreted in feces.
