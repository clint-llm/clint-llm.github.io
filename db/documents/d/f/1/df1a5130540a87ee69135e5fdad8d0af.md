Over half of the cases of meromelia have a known association or underlying cause. Edward syndrome or trisomy 18 is the most common chromosomal abnormality associated with congenital limb defects. Similarly, a deletion on chromosome 1 can lead to thrombocytopenia absent-radius syndrome. Ectrodactyly and Fanconi anemia are commonly inherited disorders associated with meromelia in children. Non-inherited associates such as VACTERL association****frequently appear in conjunction with limb truncation deficits as well.
