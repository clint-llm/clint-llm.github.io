Common adverse effects associated with benzodiazepines such as oxazepam may include sedation, fatigue, depression, confusion, memory impairment, dizziness, ataxia, slurred speech, hyper-excitability, nervousness, and weakness. Less frequently encountered adverse effects may involve hypotension, hallucinations, mania, dry mouth, hypersalivation, edema, leukopenia, decreased libido, incontinence, rash, menstrual irregularities, jaundice, and diplopia. Severe adverse effects of oxazepam include respiratory depression and neonatal abstinence syndrome. Anterograde amnesia also has correlations with benzodiazepine use.

Several cases of fixed drug eruptions, which clinically present as demarcated ovular macules, have been noted in patients taking oxazepam. In these select cases, however, urticaria and diffuse exanthems have not been observed.
