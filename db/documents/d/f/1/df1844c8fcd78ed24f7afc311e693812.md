The rate of complications for infectious/pyogenic tenosynovitis is high at 38% and includes long-term finger stiffness, boney/tendinous deformation, further infection into the deep spaces of the hand, necrosis of the tendon, adhesions, and eventual need for amputation.

Patients suffering from the non-infectious form of tenosynovitis may progress into the stenosing form of tenosynovitis resulting in chronic contractures and flexion deformities requiring surgery. Treatment of non-infectious tenosynovitis carries additional complications, especially in those requiring surgery, such as infection, injury of the nerve,Â deformities of the flexor tendon, and scarring of the tissue.
