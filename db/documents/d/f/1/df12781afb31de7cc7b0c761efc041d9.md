The natural history of Morvan syndrome is variable. Some cases have been reported to remit spontaneously, and some required extensive treatment, mainly in the form of immunotherapy including plasma exchange and long-term immunosuppression. Some cases were fatal. The overall prognosis of Morvan syndrome was particularly poor when associated with thymoma.
