Free gracilis transfer is a procedure used for a number of different reconstructive issues. The gracilis free flap is considered one of the reconstructive "workhorse" flaps and can be taken with or without nerve for functional reconstruction, or a skin paddle. This activity reviews the relevant anatomy, equipment used, and highlights the role of the inter-professional team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the relevant anatomy of the free gracilis harvest. 
- Identify the most common physical exam associated with flap failure. 
- Recall, analyze, and select appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of free gracilis transfer.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the inter-professional team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for free gracilis transfer and to enhance post-operative management.
