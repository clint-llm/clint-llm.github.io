Calcium channel blockers are a medication class used to treat a wide range of clinical conditions like high blood pressure, high and irregular heart rate, bluish discoloration and spasms of fingers, or headaches. Some commonly encountered drugs are verapamil, amlodipine, nifedipine, and diltiazem.

- Like most other medications, when taken beyond the appropriate recommended dosage, they can have untoward toxicities with a wide range of complications that can even be fatal.

- Sometimes preexisting derangement of metabolism or interaction with other drugs can result in toxic accumulation in the body.

- Any concern for excessive ingestion or early onset of abnormal symptoms should immediately prompt a call for help.

- If mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic, it is always wise to ensure safety. Help is readily available through the poison control center helpline. In the US, call 800-222-1222, available 24/7.

- If symptomatic with dizziness, lightheadedness, confusion, nausea, an immediate visit to the emergency department can save lives. Time is of the essence in this situation.

- Beyond an acute episode, ensure the safety of the home environment, supervise medication administration in the elderly, and seek psychiatric help in individuals with suicidal intent or depression.
