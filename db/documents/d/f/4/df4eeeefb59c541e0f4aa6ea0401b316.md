Studies on the toxic dose of diethylene glycol (DEG) in rodents have revealed that, despite their lower susceptibility to DEG poisoning compared to humans, their toxic dose is estimated to be around 10 grams per kilogram. Historical data from two incidents of mass poisoning, the 1995 Haitian mass poisoning and the 1930 United States elixir sulfonamide poisoning, reported a toxic dose of approximately 1.5 g/kg. However, data from the 2006 DEG mass poisoning incident indicated a lower toxic dose of 0.36 g/kg.

It is important to note that polyethylene glycol (PEG), used for gastrointestinal irrigation and bowel preparation for colonoscopies, contains small amounts of DEG, exposing patients to approximately 11 mg. Despite this exposure, patients do not exhibit symptoms of toxicity, suggesting that a dose of 22 mg in adults may be tolerated without severe adverse effects.

Managing glycol ether toxicity and associated side effects depend on factors such as the amount ingested, time since exposure, and any co-ingestions. Additionally, underlying comorbid conditions, such as chronic renal failure, should be considered when evaluating treatment options.
