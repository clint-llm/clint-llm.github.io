Non-specific orbital inflammatory disease (NSOID): Bilateral proptosis with lacrimal gland enlargement. EOM enlargement involves the muscle belly and the tendinous origin. The lacrimal gland enlarges and prolapses out of the lacrimal fossa. It can be associated with systemic autoimmune diseases like polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and IGG4-related diseases. Serology and soft tissue biopsy are diagnostic.

Lymphoma: Bilateral proptosis with lymphadenopathy. Hemogram and blood counts are usually normal. Orbital CT scan shows bilateral diffuse soft tissue enlargement with the erosion of the bony orbit. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry features on the soft tissue biopsy are diagnostic.

Blow-out fracture of the orbit: Altered globe position and limitation of EOM movements. History of trauma is followed by enophthalmos and restriction of elevation. An orbital CT scan shows the bony defect with entrapped soft tissues.

Amyloidosis: Bilateral proptosis with neuropathy. Soft tissue biopsy shows eosinophilic material on histopathology with birefringence on polarised light microscopy.
