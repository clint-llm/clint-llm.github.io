As patients often present critically ill in shock and unable to assist with the interview, the healthcare team needs to know if the patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency, which helps narrow the differential diagnosis and provide prompt treatment.

If the patient is on chronic steroid therapy, compliance with medication is important, as an Addisonian crisis can be precipitated by both the abrupt cessation of steroids or the opposite - if the patient had an acute stress event and did not increase their steroid dose enough. Other useful elements of history include any recent illnesses such as gastroenteritis, surgeries, traumatic injuries, or other stressors. Family history or a personal history of autoimmune diseases such as hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus raises the likelihood of another concurrent autoimmune diseases such as undiagnosed Addison disease.

Initial signs and symptoms are nonspecific, such as nausea, vomiting, fever, and lower chest/abdominal pain along with hypotension, altered mental status, and obtundation. The physical exam may show hyperpigmentation of the dorsum of the hands in those with primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease) or Cushingoid symptoms such as facial fullness, dorsocervical fat pad, truncal obesity with striae, hirsutism in those who take chronic steroids. Abdominal symptoms may take on features of acute abdomen.
