Two classification systems have been developed to assess prognosis based on early assessment and burn features. The Roper-Hall classification tool uses corneal clarity and amount of limbal ischemia to provide a grade from I-IV. Dua’s classification system uses the number of limbal clock hours involved and the percent of conjunctival involvement to provide a grade from I to VI. The higher the number, the poorer the prognosis for both classification systems.

Since these classification systems were introduced, medical advances have improved outcomes, but they still allow for assessing injury severity and prognosis. A hazy cornea, extensive limbal ischemia, and more conjunctival involvement portend a poorer prognosis. It is important to note that the amount of limbal ischemia may not be easily assessed at the time of original injury by simply looking at the blanching of limbal vessels and may only be appreciated by frequent examinations of the stained limbus.
