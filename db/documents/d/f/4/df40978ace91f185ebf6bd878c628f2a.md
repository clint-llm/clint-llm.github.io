QC is not an individual responsibility but rather a team effort involving everyone inÂ a department. It becomes even more critical in the setting of an NM department, where there is a risk of radiation exposure. Any minor QC flaw can negatively impact the overall diagnostic quality of images, resulting in a higher radiation burden for patients. Therefore, every team member should actively participate in the QA plan, including a radiologist, NMT, radiology manager, nurses, service engineers, medical physicists, and administrative staff. Regular meetings and an evidence-based approach can help reduce the likelihood of QC failure and help to upkeep standard services.
