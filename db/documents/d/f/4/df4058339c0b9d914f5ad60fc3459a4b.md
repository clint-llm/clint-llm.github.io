When the clinician is unable to place the endotracheal tube with direct laryngoscopy using the standard technique, multiple tools can be used.

- A video-assisted laryngoscope can be used to get a better view of the glottis.

- A grade 4 Cormack and Lehane view of the anatomy may prompt the clinician to utilize the tracheal tube inducer or bougie. A bougie is a long rod-shaped medical device with a curve at the tip. This item is introduced into the patientâ€™s airway, and an attempt is made to place the tube inside the trachea. If the bougie is swept along the wall of the trachea, the signature ridges of the tracheal rings can be felt. The endotracheal tube can then be introduced over the bougie, and the bougie will guide the endotracheal tube into the trachea.

- A supraglottic airway such as a laryngeal mask airway can be placed if endotracheal intubation is not possible.
