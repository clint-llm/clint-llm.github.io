As geriatric patients become more debilitated and dependent on caregivers/nurses, it becomes imperative that the nurses are trained in providing daily oral hygiene care to these patients.  The nurses must be aware of precautions that need to be taken when performing oral hygiene in patients who have dentures. Care is necessary not to abrade the fitting surface of the denture. The patient should use a denture cleanser instead of conventional toothpaste, bleach, and vinegar for denture cleaning. The use of methods other than denture cleanser will abrade the polished surface and result in plaque accumulation, causing denture odor. They should be able to identify when to refer the patient to the dentist.
