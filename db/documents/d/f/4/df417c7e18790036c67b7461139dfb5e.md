**Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma:**

Despite occasional nodal involvement and metastases, the prognosis of low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma is excellent with a five-year survival rate approaching 95%.

**High-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma:**

Reports on the prognosis for high-grade tumors vary, but about 25% of patients with these tumors develop metastases, typically in lymph nodes, bone or skin.

Poor prognostic factors include:

- Positive resection margins

- Lymph node metastasis
