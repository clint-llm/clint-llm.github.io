Gram-negative bacterial resistance to antibiotics has decreased the physicianâ€™s ability to combat infection. Carbapenems are the most potent beta-lactam antibiotics for resistant bacteria, but carbapenem-resistant bacteria inactivate this class of antibiotics. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of carbapenem-resistant infections and reviews the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in evaluating, treating, and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the treatment considerations for a patient with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections.
- Describe the reasons for a delayed diagnosis of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections.
- Review the etiology of carbapenem-resistance and its various mechanisms.
- Identify the importance of collaboration and communications among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections.
