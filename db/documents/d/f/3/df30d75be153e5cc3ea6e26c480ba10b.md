A rotator cuff tear, including a tear to the teres minor, will not heal without surgery; however, good function of the affected shoulder can often be gained non-surgically.

The type of surgical repairÂ depends on the type of tear. A "partial thickness" tear, or incomplete tear, may only require debridement or removal of damaged tissue. A "full-thickness" tear extends entirely through the tendon, though it may only involve part of the tendon; it can be repaired using side-to-side sutures. The most common rotator cuff injury results in the tendon being pulled from its bony insertion, termed a complete tear; this requires the tendon to be repaired directly back to the bone. Surgical repair can be open, with a large incision providing direct access to the injury, or arthroscopic, with two small incisions for passage of a camera (arthroscope) and tools for repairing any damage.
