**A) Dysphagia**

The management of dysphagia can be categorized into

- Compensation therapy (eating postures, food characteristics, and eating tools)

- Swallowing function training (including swallowing muscle training)

- Physiotherapy (including electrical, magnetic, thermal stimulation)

- Alternative therapy (acupuncture, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and balloon dilation)

- Drugs (nifedipine and metoclopramide)

- 

- Bolus modification
- Behavioral adjustments
- Oromotor exercises,
- Postural adjustments,
- Swallowing maneuvers,
- Sensory and neurophysiologic stimulation

Behavioral interventions have shown high heterogeneity limiting generalizations into clinical practice. Meta-analysis pertaining to swallowing treatment strategies has shown to reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia with low certainty only during the acute phase.

**B) Dysarthria**

Interventions may be categorized as those directed at:

- Impairment level: non-verbal and oro-motor exercises (applying ice packs, traditional and electrical stimulations).

- Activity level: speech rate control and augmentative or alternative communication aids (an alphabet chart and text-to-talk computer devices).

- Participation level: social level participations

Current evidence is not yet robust and has shown no long-term benefits on everyday speech compared to any control.

Spastic dysarthria benefits mostly from relaxation techniques and speech rate treatments.

**C) Emotional Incontinence**

A fixed-dose combination of dextromethorphan/quinidine for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of laughing and crying behavior and is the only FDA-approved medication for the same.

**D)Â Others**

- Cognitive therapy

- Corpus callosotomy for refractory patterns of drop attacks

- Management of problematic drooling - glycopyrrolate, injection of botulinum, ligation of salivary ducts, and excision of submandibular glands.
