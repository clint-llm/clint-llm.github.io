Thyroglossal duct cysts typically present as mobile midline neck masses near the hyoid bone. They often are asymptomatic. However, they can presentÂ as an abscess or intermittently draining sinus. The mass will elevate with tongue protrusion or swallowing. The mass is closely associated with the hyoid bone and most commonly found at or below the level of the hyoid.
