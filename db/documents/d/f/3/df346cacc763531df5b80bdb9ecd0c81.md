Mechanical ventilation is an essential medical intervention in the context of critical illness. However, this intervention is associated with the risk of significant yet potentially preventable complications. This activity outlines the evaluation of ventilator-associated complications and reviews the role of the interprofessional health care team in improving care for patients with these complications.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the risk factors that can lead to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
- Describe the pathophysiologic mechanisms of colonization with the micro-organisms typically implicated in the etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Outline various preventative strategies that generally comprise a ventilator bundle.
