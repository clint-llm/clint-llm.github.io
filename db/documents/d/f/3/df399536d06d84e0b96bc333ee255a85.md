Breastmilk jaundice is rarely recognized prior to routine mother-baby discharge. If the infant stays in the hospital longer for other treatment, early breastmilk jaundice may be seen on day 4 or 5 of life. The nurse will continue to teach the parents routine infant care and assist with breastfeeding. It is possible for an infant to experience physiologic hyperbilirubinemia in the first 2-3 days, and then have jaundice worsen again from breastmilk jaundice. Continue to reassure the parents, and encourage them to spend as much time with the infant as possible. Teach parents the expected output patterns and encourage frequent breastfeeding. Refer to a lactation consultant for a home visit, if possible. Reassure parents that while breastfeeding is natural, it is not always easy. Nursing measures supportive of parents and breastfeeding are expected. If the provider recommends caloric supplementation, educate the parents about the option of using supplemental nursing systems, rather than an artificial nipple.
