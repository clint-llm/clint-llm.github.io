Pharmacological stress testing is a relatively safe procedure with minimal side effects, but patients can occasionally suffer from undesirable side effects based on the mechanism of action of the pharmacologic stress agent used. Vasodilator agents, including adenosine, dipyridamole can produce bronchospasm and AV block. Less common with regadenoson due to its selective action. Dobutamine can cause tachyarrhythmias.
