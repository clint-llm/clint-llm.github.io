Cardiovascular diseases are the major cause of death worldwide.Â  Early and accurate diagnosis of cardiac diseases guides the therapeutic interventions, which would lead to a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Cardiac positron emission tomography is a powerful, noninvasive imaging technology that is increasingly penetrating clinical cardiovascular imaging. The advantages of PET scan include clinical assessment of myocardial perfusion, quantification of myocardial blood flow, and assessment of viability with high accuracy. Despite high single-test costs, PET has been proven to be cost-effective due to its high accuracy leading to early diagnosis and treatment of disease. It has also made its place as an adjunct advanced cardiac imaging tool in the diagnosis of infiltrative cardiac diseases such as cardiac sarcoidosis. The advent of hybrid imaging with a combination of PET and CT-derived morphologic parameters has further improved the diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity.
