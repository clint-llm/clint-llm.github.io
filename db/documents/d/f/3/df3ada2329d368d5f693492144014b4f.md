The list of equipment necessary to procure before placement of a chest tube can vary depending on the clinical setting, acuity of the patient, therapeutic indication, and provider practice patterns.  Please reference the associated StatPearls for chest tube and chest trauma for further information.

- Chest tube: Prospective studies of trauma patients have shown no difference when using small-bore chest tubes (20 to 22 Fr) compared to the traditional 28 to 32 Fr tubes from ATLS 10 recommendations when appropriately managed.

- Chest drainage system: All modern designs, which are single, self-contained units, have their basis in the original 3-bottle system. The chest tube is connected to the first bottle, and all subsequent bottles are connected in a series to a suction device. The first bottle collects drainage from the chest; the second bottle acts as the water seal preventing air and fluid from moving back into the chest, and the third acts as suction control.

- Antibiotics: Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended before the procedure.

- Scalpel for initial skin incision, often a #10 blade.

- Necessary surgical instruments to assist with sharp and blunt dissection

- Large clamp to bluntly enter the pleural space. Consider Rochester Peons or Kelly clamps.

- Means of securing the chest tube to the patient.
