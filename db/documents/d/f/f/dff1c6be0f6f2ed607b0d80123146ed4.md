The diagnosis of congenital smooth cell hamartoma is clinical. However, histopathological examination is sometimes required to exclude resembling entities.

Becker hamartoma displays overlapping clinical and histological features with congenital smooth muscle hamartoma. It is an acquired lesion usually diagnosed at puberty. It presents as a well-defined infiltrative and a pigmented plaque with hypertrichosis, Histopathology shows the same epidermal features. Occasionally, a proliferation of dermal smooth muscles may present. Unlike congenital smooth cell hamartoma, pigmentation and hypertrichosis of Becker hamartoma tend to increase over time. Considering these similarities, there are suggestions that these two entities belong to the same continuous spectrum.

Other differential diagnoses of congenital muscle cell hamartoma include Congenital melanocytic nevus, piloleiomyoma, café-au-lait spots, and nevus pilosus.

Histologically, piloleiomyoma closely resembles congenital smooth muscle hamartoma. When smooth muscle bundles are badly-defined and intermingle with collagen fibers, the diagnosis of piloleiomyoma should be a consideration.

Finally, it is sometimes hard to differentiate an acquired smooth muscle hamartoma from a congenital one that was underdiagnosed at birth. Few clinical features should favor the acquired etiology. They mainly include discrete hyperpigmentation, decreased density of villous hair, and a negative pseudo-Darier sign.
