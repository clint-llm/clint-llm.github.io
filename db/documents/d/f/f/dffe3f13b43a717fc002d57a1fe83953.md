Succinylcholine chloride is a short-acting depolarizing neuromuscular blockade approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a provision to other sedatives or hypnotics. It blocks the action of acetylcholine (ACh); hence, it disrupts all cholinergic receptors of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. Its use can expedite rapid endotracheal intubation, facilitate surgical procedures, and aid in mechanical ventilation by relaxation of skeletal muscles. Succinylcholine is often used as an adjunct therapy in patients undergoing electroconvulsive shock therapy (ETC) to control muscle contractions induced due to the electrical impulses delivered during the procedure. However, this is an off-label use that is not currently approved by the FDA. This activity outlines the indications, mechanisms of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of succinylcholine, so providers can control muscle activity when necessary as part of the interprofessional team, with a basis on the current knowledge for optimal utilization.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of succinylcholine.
- Outline the indications for utilizing succinylcholine.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of succinylcholine.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the use of succinylcholine where it is indicated and improve patient outcomes.
