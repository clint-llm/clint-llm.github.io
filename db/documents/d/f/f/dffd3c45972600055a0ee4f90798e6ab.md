Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an atopic disease presenting with symptoms of sneezing, nasal congestion, clear rhinorrhea, and nasal pruritis. It is an IgE-mediated immune response that is against inhaled antigens in the immediate phase, with a subsequent leukotriene-mediated late phase. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of allergic rhinitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the abnormal immune response in the etiology of allergic rhinitis.
- Explain the epidemiology of allergic rhinitis.
- Describe the use of intranasal steroids, antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and immunotherapy in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.
