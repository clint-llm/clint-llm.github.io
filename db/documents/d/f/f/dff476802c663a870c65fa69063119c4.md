Suppurative (septic) thrombophlebitis describes thrombosis in a vein that occurs in the setting of inflammation and infection. This condition is characterized by the presence of a thrombus that is associated with inflammation and pus formation (suppuration) both in the venous wall and surrounding the vessel. Although this process can occur in both superficial and deep vessels throughout the body, it is seen most commonly in venous structures, including peripheral veins, pelvic veins, superior vena cava, internal jugular vein, portal veins or dural sinuses. This activity describes the evaluation and management of septic thrombophlebitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of septic thrombophlebitis.
- Explain the evaluation of septic thrombophlebitis.
- Outline the treatment options for septic thrombophlebitis.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to enhance the management of patients with septic thrombophlebitis and improve outcomes.
