Germ-cell tumors are observed to develop secondary to a tumorigenic event in utero that leads to intratubular germ-cell neoplasia.****Intratubular germ-cell neoplasia is derived from gonocytes that have failed to differentiate into spermatogonia.

Several genetic loci that confer a predisposition to testicular cancer have been identified.

The genes related to the pathogenesis and their respective chromosomes as outlined below:

- UCK1: Chromosome 1

- HPGDS: Chromosome 4

- CENPE: Chromosome 4

- TERT: Chromosome 5

- TERT/CLPTM1L: Chromosome 5

- SPRY4: Chromosome 5

- BAK-1: Chromosome 6

- MAD1L1: Chromosome 7

- DMRT1: Chromosome 9

- AFT7IP: Chromosome 12

- KITLG: Chromosome 12

- RFWD3: Chromosome 16

- TEX14: Chromosome 17

- PPM1E: Chromosome 17

Distinct gene expression through epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation, may result in the formation of the different histologic subtypes**,**as outlined in the flowchart.
