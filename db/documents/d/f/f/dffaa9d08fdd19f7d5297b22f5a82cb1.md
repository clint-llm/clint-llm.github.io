Various descriptions of sedation-facilitated intubation performed by prehospital agencies in the United States cite the use of drugs such as etomidate, midazolam, and ketamine as induction agents.

Benzodiazepines such as midazolamÂ can cause hypotension when used in dosages high enough to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Benzodiazepines also have a relatively slow onset and unpredictable efficacy in some patients.

Etomidate has a better profile as a possible induction agent for sedation-facilitated intubation

Other induction agents have not been adequately examined for their use during sedation-facilitated intubation.
