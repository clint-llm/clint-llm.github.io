Extensive implementation of a universal immunization program proved to be effective in declining the incidence of diphtheria to approximately 70% by 1980.

Nigeria reported its outbreak of respiratory diphtheria in 2011. A similar outbreak also occurred in India from 2010 to 2016. Diphtheria outbreaks were also said to have happened in Haiti, Venezuela, and Yemen from 2015 to 2018 as a result of inadequate income, poor access to health care, and ineffective vaccination and monitoring regime. In 2017, outbreaks due to similar conditions were noted in multiple areas throughout the world, such as Rohingya refugee resettlement centers in Bangladesh and Indonesia. According to WHO, 16,611 reported cases were recorded in 2018.

An active immunization schedule against the toxigenic strain of C. diphtheria may have effectively control the toxigenic strain. However, the non-toxigenic strain of C. diphtheria is still at large and has now been an emerging burden of disease in developed countries. In the late 1990s, a severe invasive infection caused by nontoxigenic strains was reported in Europe, particularly in Italy, France, Switzerland, Great Britain, Canada, and Brazil. Among these countries, the most dramatic increase in the number of cases was seen in England and Wales, where the cases of non-toxigenic strain raised from 1 to 294 in the 2000s and have been increasing ever since.
