The prognosis largely depends on the type and cause of ataxia. Patients with progressive ataxia may suffer from worsening symptoms over the years and require symptomatic treatment. Hereditary ataxia has a shorter life expectancy; however, some people live up to the fifth or sixth decade. Severe forms may lead to death in childhood or the early years.

If the cause is acquired, for example, alcohol or drug-induced ataxia, the underlying cause needs to be treated, and triggering factors removed to improve prognosis.
