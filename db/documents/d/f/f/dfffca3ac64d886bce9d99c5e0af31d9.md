The citric acid cycle serves as the mitochondrial hub for the final steps in carbon skeleton oxidative catabolism for carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acids. Each oxidative step, in turn, reduces a coenzyme such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) or flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2). These reduced coenzymes contribute directly to the electron transport chain and thus to the majority of ATP production in the human body.
