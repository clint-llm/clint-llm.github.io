**Otosclerosis**

Otosclerosis is defined as abnormal bony growth starting in the bony labyrinth and oval window moving toward the auditory ossicles leading to conductive hearing loss. The hardening of the structures results in loss of flexibility and ultimately prevents the stapes footplate from transmitting oscillations to the oval window. The pathologic process involves new bone formation and proliferation of the vasculature.

Histologically, increased osteoblasts and osteoclasts are seen with the presence of abnormal sclerotic bone.

**Cholesteatoma**

Choleastomas are benign growths of keratinized squamous epithelium that are commonly located within the middle ear. The abnormal growths can be either acquired or congenital. Choleastomas that grow rapidly can damage the ossicles and lead to significant hearing loss. The location of the choleastoma plays a large role in which the ossicle may be damaged.

**Facial Nerve Palsy**

The stapedius muscle that attaches to the stapes is responsible for dampening sounds. In conditions where the facial nerve is compromised, the stapedius muscle will be nonfunctional. This leads to an increased range of motion of the stapes to sound, causing hyperacusis.
