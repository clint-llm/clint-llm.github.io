**The first division of the maxillary artery:**

- Deep auricular and anterior tympanic artery supplies the external acoustic meatus and deep surface of the tympanic membrane, respectively.

- The middle meningeal artery is a major branch of the internal maxillary artery and has very significant clinical scenarios discussed later. This artery mainly supplies the dura, bone, and cranial cavity of the middle cranial fossa. It is attached to the periosteal or outer layer of the dura.ascending pharyngeal and occipital artery (branches of the external carotid) also give rise to posterior meningeal arteries supplying the dura within the posterior cranial fossa. The posterior meningeal artery coming from the ascending pharyngeal artery travels through the hypoglossal canal to reach the posterior cranial fossa.

- The inferior alveolar artery supplies all the lower teeth, lower lip, and chin (through the mental artery). The mylohyoid artery supplies the mylohyoid.

**The second division of the maxillary artery**:

- The anterior, middle, and posterior deep temporalis artery supply blood to the temporalis muscle. The temporalis muscle also obtains some blood supply from the superficial temporalis artery (branch of the ECA).

- Buccal artery supplies the buccinators muscle, and the masseteric artery supplies the masseter muscle.

- The pterygoid branches are small branches from the maxillary artery, which supply both the lateral pterygoid and medial pterygoid muscle.

**The third division of the maxillary artery**:

- The pharyngeal artery supplies the posterior aspect of the roof of the nasal cavity, sphenoid sinus, and Eustachian tube.

- The greater palatine artery provides blood to the hard palate, and the lesser palatine artery gives supply to the soft palate.

- The sphenopalatine artery terminates into the posterior lateral nasal artery and posterior septal branches. The posterior lateral nasal artery supplies the lateral wall of the nasal cavity, and the posterior septal branches supply the nasal septum of which some branches anastomose with the greater palatine artery.

- The posterior superior alveolar artery supplies the lower mandible, molar, premolars, and surrounding gingiva.

- The infraorbital artery supplies the lower eyelid and upper lip. The anterior superior alveolar artery supplies the incisors and canines.

**Venous drainage:**

The venous drainage for most of the structures supplied the maxillary artery is through the pterygoid plexus, which is between the medial and lateral pterygoid as well as between the lateral pterygoid and temporalis muscle. This venous plexus drains much of the blood from structures of the infratemporal fossa and pterygopalatine fossa. Other veins which also drain into the pterygoid plexus include the inferior ophthalmic vein and emissary veins from the cavernous sinus. These emissary veins travel through the foramen ovale, through the foramen lacerum and sphenoidal foramen to reach the pterygoid plexus.
