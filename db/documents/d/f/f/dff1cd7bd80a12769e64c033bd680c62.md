Peripheral nerve blocks are often performed by anesthesiologists, surgeons, and emergency department physicians. However, a dedicated nurse must monitor the patient's vital signs during the procedure. More important, resuscitation equipment must be in the room before starting the procedure. A protocol should be established to conduct a peripheral nerve block to ensure patient safety and improve patient outcomes.
