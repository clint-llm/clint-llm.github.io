A histological understanding of the layers of the eye is essential for appreciating disease pathophysiology and also understanding certain therapeutic approaches. Broadly, from an anatomical perspective, the eye can be viewed as a series of overlapping layers of tissue.

External structures of the eye include the eyelashes, lids, muscles, accessory glands, and conjunctiva.

The internal structures of the eye consist of three layers of tissue arranged concentrically:

- The sclera and cornea make up the exterior layers.

- The uvea is the vascular layer in the middle, subdivided into the iris, ciliary body, and choroid.

- The retina constitutes the innermost layer and is made up of nervous tissue.

AllÂ of these layers can further subdivide and undergo histological classification.
