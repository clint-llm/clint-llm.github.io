Laceration to the eyelid that does not involve the canalicular system occurs more frequently. An experienced operator will repair simple eyelid lacerations. More complex eye lacerations that should warrant consult ophthalmology include full-thickness lid lacerations, lacerations with orbital fat prolapse, and lacerations through the lid margins. A ruptured globe is an ophthalmologic emergency and should be treated prior to the management of an eyelid injury. Facial bone fractures requiring repair should be addressed prior to proceeding with repair of the canalicular injury.
