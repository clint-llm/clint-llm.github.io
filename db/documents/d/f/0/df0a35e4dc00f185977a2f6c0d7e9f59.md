Supportive care is recommended with the maintenance of glomerular filtration in case of overdose suspected or confirmed with daptomycin.

- Approximately 15% of daptomycin is cleared slowly from the body by hemodialysis (low-flux membrane) over 4 hours. High-flux dialysis membranes hemodialysis may increase the percentage of dose removal.

- Approximately 11% of daptomycin is cleared by peritoneal dialysis over 48 hours.
