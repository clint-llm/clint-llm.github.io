The approach to any patient with suspected pneumothorax is to prevent further tension physiology to develop and support the patient’s ventilation. Patients can benefit from supplemental oxygen use which helps with both oxygenation and pneumothorax reabsorption. Pain control should be given for suspected rib injuries which may cause splinting and decrease the patient's ability to ventilate. If shock is present, evaluation and treatment of other causes should not be avoided, even if a pneumothorax is suspected, as often multiple sources of shock may be present in the traumatically injured patient. Lastly, avoid positive pressure ventilation unless it is necessary due to respiratory failure. Ultimately the EMS provider must be constantly vigilant in the identification of developing tension physiology and be ready to intervene with decompression if necessary.

Rapid exposure and assessment of the chest wall in the setting of a penetrating chest injury can identify sucking chest wounds. Additional attention should be paid to the axilla and posterior back where these wounds may not be readily seen in the supine patient. Because the most frequently seen complication with occlusive dressing application is difficulty in keeping it on the patient, remove moisture from the application area before placement when possible.
