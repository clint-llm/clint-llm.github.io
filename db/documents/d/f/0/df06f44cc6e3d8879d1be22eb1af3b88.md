The most common diseases associated with erythema marginatum include acute or chronic rheumatic fever, psittacosis, and C1esterase inhibitor deficiency (hereditary angioedema). Acute rheumatic fever is predominantly associated with beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection but has also been reported with group C streptococcus. Serotypes M3 and M18 of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus associated with acute rheumatic fever have been linked with the formation of anti-collagen IV antibodies, which are responsible for post-streptococcal rheumatic disease.
