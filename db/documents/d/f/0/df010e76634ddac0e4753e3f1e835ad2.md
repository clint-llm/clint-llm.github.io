Pain is an unpleasant sensory and psychological experience resulting from actual or potential tissue damage and is commonly associated with dental treatment.

The maxillary and mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve provide sensory innervation to the soft and hard tissues of the oral cavity.

Local anesthesia in dentistry can be given as either infiltration or block anesthesia. Generally, infiltration anesthesia is commonly used in the maxilla, whereas block anesthesia is frequently used in the mandible.

This paper will explore the anatomical course of the nerves supplying the oral cavity and the different techniques utilized to anesthetize these nerves prior to delivering dental treatment.Â  The equipment required for dental local anesthesia, including common anesthetic agents and their applications, will be considered. Furthermore, the prevention and management of complications associated with local anesthesia will be discussed.
