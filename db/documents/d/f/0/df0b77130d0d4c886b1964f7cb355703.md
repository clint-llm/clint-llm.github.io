Keratoconjunctivitis and conjunctivitis are extremely common causes of visits to primary care providers and nurse practitioners. Referral to an ophthalmologist for every case of red eye is unnecessary and burdensome to the patient both temporally and financially. Referral to ophthalmology should take place when any of the following develop: persistent/worsening disease states, vision loss, moderate to severe pain, severe purulent discharge, marked corneal involvement, conjunctival scarring, a concern of herpetic disease, lack of response to therapy. Special attention should is necessary for patients who wear contact lenses, may require treatment with steroids, or also present with severe photophobia.

Keratoconjunctivitis requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level V]
