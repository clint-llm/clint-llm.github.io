An EPS is generally contraindicated in patients with:

- Acute coronary syndromes and/or decompensated heart failure since rapid atrial pacing can significantly deteriorate their symptoms causing hemodynamic stability

- High risk of bleeding due to the administration of anticoagulation (heparin) during the procedure

- Presence of arrhythmogenic conditions which can significantly decrease its diagnostic accuracy (electrolyte abnormalities, drug toxicity, hyperthyroidism, etc.)

- Pregnancy due to radiation exposure (although in patients with arrhythmias resistant to medical management an ablation procedure with specific precautions can be performed)
