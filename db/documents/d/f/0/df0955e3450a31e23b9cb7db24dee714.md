Patients at high risk of a pulmonary contusion are in motor vehicle accidents with sudden deceleration or a fast-moving vehicle hitting a stationary object. Soldiers exposed to blasts are also at increased risk of developing pulmonary contusions that can cause significant respiratory compromise. These patients should be identified quickly, and appropriate imaging should be done to quantify the severity of injury to the pulmonary parenchyma. This would help in the prognosis and identification of those patients at risk of significant clinical decompensation.
