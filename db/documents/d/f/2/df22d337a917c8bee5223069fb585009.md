Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection in humans and animals. Infection in healthy immunocompetent adults is asymptomatic in about 50% of the cases although it can also cause a self-limited mild nonspecific illness presenting with signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, maculopapular rash, headache, fatigue, and tender lymphadenopathy.Â  In immunocompromised individuals and neonates, it causes a severe infection with devastating sequelae. Congenital toxoplasmosis, as a result of vertical transmission from infected mothers, is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in fetuses, neonates, and children as they progress into adulthood. Since asymptomatic infection is more common, a high index of suspicion is necessary, and diagnosis can be made readily by serologic testing.
