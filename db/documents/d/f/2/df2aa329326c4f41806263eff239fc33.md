Patients with diabetes mellitus most commonly present with increased thirst, increased urination, lack of energy and fatigue, bacterial and fungal infections, and delayed wound healing. Some patients can also complain of numbness or tingling in their hands or feet or with blurred vision.

These patients can have modest hyperglycemia, which can proceed to severe hyperglycemia or ketoacidosis due to infection or stress. T1DM patients can often present with ketoacidosis (DKA) coma as the first manifestation in about 30% of patients.

The height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) of patients with diabetes mellitus should be recorded. Retinopathy needs to be excluded in such patients by an ophthalmologist. All pulses should be palpated to examine for peripheral arterial disease. Neuropathy should be ruled out by physical examination and history.
