**Tibial Fractures**

Fractures involving the tibia are relatively common injuries. Tibial plateau fractures are proximal tibial fractures with extension into the articular surface.  In general, these fractures have significant associated morbidity and long-term implications that can significantly impact patient function and outcomes.  For example, tibial plateau fractures correlate with

- Meniscal tears:

- Lateral meniscal tears 

- More commonly associated lateral tibial fractures (e.g., Schatzker II pattern)
- Associated with greater than 10mm of articular depression 


- medial meniscal tears

- More commonly associated with medial tibial plateau fractures (e.g., Schatzker IV pattern)


- ACL injuries
- Compartment syndrome
- Vascular injury

Operative fixation is often necessary for the setting of increasing displacement and associated injury.

Tibial shaft fractures can occur and are often open due to the proximity to the skin of the tibia. Operative treatment may be required, consisting of open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) with plate/screws, external fixation, or intramedullary nail fixation.

**Ankle Fractures**

Ankle fractures, in general, constitute a wide range of injury patterns, bony/ligamentous involvement, and potential instability.

**Fibular Grafting**

The advantage of the fibula being a large, relatively non-weight-bearing bone is clear in its use as a bone graft during mandibular reconstruction; this is the “gold standard” with several variations in the surgery in development. The fibula has a large amount of dense cortical bone that is easily accessible and a highly vascularized intrinsic blood supply that will decrease union time. This vascularity has shown superiority to non-vascular bone grafts in both functionality and aesthetics.

Fibular strut grafts are also often utilized in various procedures to augment surgical fixation in the setting of comminuted fragility fractures (i.e., those occurring secondary to osteoporosis or low bone mineral density.)
