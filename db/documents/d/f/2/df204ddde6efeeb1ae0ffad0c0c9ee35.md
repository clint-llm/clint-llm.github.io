Reentry around an anatomical obstacle has been named anatomic reentry as compared to functional reentry. Cox et al. who developed the surgical treatment for atrial fibrillation observed that chronic atrial enlargement causes atrial fibrillation. The concept of the "two holes macro-reentry" including the left atrial appendage and the pulmonary vein orifice led to the idea of creating lesions to interrupt these anatomical reentry circuits.

Identifying parts of the reentry circuit is essential for successful ablation maneuvers to terminate the arrhythmia.

Left atrial macro-reentry circuits have also been described. The Bachmann bundle is a large muscle bundle that conducts excitation under physiologic conditions from the right atrium to the left.

The fibrous skeleton of the heart plays a role as electric insulation between atria and ventricles.

Electrophysiologists prefer ablation of the slow pathway since ablation of the fast pathway poses a higher risk for AV block.

Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardias form a reentry circuit via the atrioventricular node/his Purkinje system and one or more accessory pathways. Accessory pathways bridges span the atrioventricular plane in addition to the physiological pathway via the atrioventricular node and his bundle. Wolff, Parkinson, and White described the first preexcitation syndrome in 1930. Atrial fibrillation may conduct via the accessory pathway instead of the av node bypassing the frequency limiting effect. This leads to a fast, broad and irregular tachycardia and rarely to ventricular fibrillation.

The bundle branch reentry ventricular tachycardia (BBRVT) runs via a macro-reentry circuit including the His bundle and the fascicular branches. It is common in dilatative cardiomyopathy with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. The right bundle branch is more vulnerable to unidirectional block due to a long refractory period and slow retrograde conduction via the left bundle branch. The connection between the two bundle branches forms by bridges spanning the ventricular septum. The surface electrocardiogram (ECG) will show a left bundle branch block (LBBB) pattern. The contrariwise BBRVT showing right bundle branch block (RBBB) pattern on ECG is rare.

Interfascicular tachycardia or left ventricular BBRVT includes antegrade conduction through the left-anterior and retrograde conduction via the left posterior fascicles, which manifests as right bundle branch block with left-posterior hemiblock on ECG. Criteria for the diagnosis of BBRVT through electrophysiologic examination include the following:

- LBBB pattern on ECG; slowed conduction of the His-Purkinje system

- Termination of BBRVT through blocking the His-Purkinje system proximal to distal activation of the His bundle and right bundle branch

- The His ventricular interval in BBRVT is equal or longer than the His ventricular interval in sinus rhythm

- Variations of the V-V interval that are preceded by variations of the H-H interval

BBRVT should be not inducible after ablation of the right bundle branch.

In contrast to macro-reentry better resolution of mappings systems allowed to detect smaller reentry circuits, called localized reentry or micro-reentry. The resolution of mapping depends on the distance between electrodes, which is limited, per se. There is an ongoing debate about whether focal activity is micro-reentry. Some studies propose micro-reentry based on fractionated electrograms, areas of slow conduction or zig-zag pattern of activation. Ideker et al. estimated the electrode spacing needed to detect the smallest micro-reentry. Spach et al. described the smallest reentry circuit in superfused human atrial trabeculae spanning an area of 1.6 mm. Ideker argues that electrodes need not be as close together to register the reentry circuit just as a hurricane is noticeable from a great distance.

El-Sherif illustrated the competing concept of disorders of impulse generation (rapid firing focus) against disorders of impulse conduction (reentry) using the clinical entity of SVT. He concludes that a rapid firing focus cannot be differentiated from a micro-reentry completely.
