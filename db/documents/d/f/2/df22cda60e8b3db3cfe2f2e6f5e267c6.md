An arterial pseudoaneurysm, AKA false aneurysm, is caused by damage to the arterial wall, resulting in locally contained hematoma with turbulent blood flow and a neck that typically does not close spontaneously once past a certain size. Unlike a true aneurysm, a pseudoaneurysm does not contain any layer of the vessel wall.  Instead, there is blood containment by a wall developed with the products of the clotting cascade.  Eventually, a wall forms from fibrin/platelet crosslinks that is ultimately weaker than those of a true aneurysm. The most common clinical presentation of a pseudoaneurysm is a femoral pseudoaneurysm following access for endovascular procedures. Other less common presentations include visceral pseudoaneurysms and aortic pseudoaneurysms.  This article will focus on these three entities.
