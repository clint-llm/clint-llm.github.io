The patient should be placed supine with head slightly extended and turned 45 degrees away from the examined side. The sonographer position is based on individual preference; some prefer to sit behind the patient’s head facing caudally, while others may prefer sitting to the side facing superiorly. The patient’s bed height should be adjusted according to the sonographer’s comfort to avoid hunching over.
