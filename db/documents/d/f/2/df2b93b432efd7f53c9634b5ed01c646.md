Olanzapine is one of the most commonly used medications in episodes of psychosis.

From a clinical standpoint, the injection form may be the preferred route when dealing with an agitated patient who does not wish or cannot swallow a pill; however, a provider should not subject a patient to injection if they do not need it. Strong interpersonal communication skills are necessary when working with an uncooperative or agitated patient. If the patient can consume the dissolving form of olanzapine, this route of administration should merit consideration over the injectable form.

The prescribing clinician should work closely with specialists, the pharmacy, and the nursing staff in patients receiving olanzapine. Nursing staff will administer the medication in the most controlled circumstances; they should be alert to patients refusing to take the drug and watch for its adverse effects. In this scenario, specialty-trained psychiatry nurses can contribute as they are more familiar with monitoring parameters. Pharmacists should carefully vet the patient's medication regimen, looking for red flags for drug interactions. A board-certified psychiatric pharmacist can participate in agent selection and dosing with the clinicians. Clinicians should be familiar with the fact that long-acting intramuscular olanzapine carries a substantial risk of delirium. Hence, it is only available through the FDA REMS(Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.

In the case of an overdose, emergency department physicians should ensure a patent airway, breathing, and circulation. Similarly, critical care physicians and ICU nurses can play a vital role in cases of severe overdose. Finally, psychiatry referral is crucial in the case of intentional overdose. As illustrated above, clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), specialists, pharmacists, nurses, and other healthcare providers are involved in taking care of the patient. Therefore, all the healthcare providers working in an interprofessional team should collaborate closely so that the patient on olanzapine receives the maximum benefit with minimal adverse effects, resulting in optimal patient outcomes.

APA guidelines recommend that patients with schizophrenia receive assertive community treatment (ACT) if there is poor compliance with treatment. For ACT to be successful, a multidisciplinary strategy is necessary in which patients receive individualized care from clinicians, psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, and case managers. Patients with poor compliance may benefit from considering a long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic medication like olanzapine. Studies suggest that assertive community treatment with an interprofessional team-based approach is associated with improved quality of life, and patients are less likely to be hospitalized.
