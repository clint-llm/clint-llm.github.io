Brachycephaly can be diagnosed by history and physical examination. It is essential to distinguish between non-synostotic and synostotic brachycephaly. Most cases of non-synostotic brachycephaly improve with conservative measures. Refractory cases should be referred for consideration of helmet therapy. Cases of brachycephaly secondary to craniosynostosis should be referred early for craniofacial consultation and appropriate surgical management as part of an interprofessional team approach to care.
