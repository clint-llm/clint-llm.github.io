A fibrocellular proliferation over the internal limiting membrane (ILM) characterizes the epiretinal membrane (ERM). The initiating event in an idiopathic ERM is the posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). Aging vitreous liquefies and detaches from its posterior attachments leading to posterior vitreous detachment. PVD causes dehiscence in the internal limiting membrane, which allows the microglial cells to migrate to the preretinal surface where they interact with the hyalocytes and laminocytes of the vitreous cellular membrane. These cells later transdifferentiate into fibroblast-like cells to form a cellophane thin epiretinal membrane.

- Microglial cells migrate to the retinal surface over micro leaks produced by PVD. These cells later differentiate to form the fibroblasts.

- Following PVD, segments of cellular vitreous remain on the surface. These segments contain hyalocytes that transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts from ERM.

- PVD induced ILM avulsion in the posterior paravascular retina upregulates the cytokines to form the ERM.
