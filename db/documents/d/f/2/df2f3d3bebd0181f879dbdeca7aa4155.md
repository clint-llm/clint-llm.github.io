For clarity, the structure and function of the arteries of the forearm will be discussed separately for each artery.

**Ulnar Artery**

The ulnar artery is the larger of the two branches of the brachial artery at the level of its bifurcation.

The ulnar artery and its branches are responsible for blood supply to the medial forearm, including the bones and muscles of the forearm and the ulnar and median nerves. It is also responsible for part of the blood supply to the carpal bones and the hands, specifically of the medial hand and the medial two digits. The proximal branches help supply structures of the elbow joint.

**Radial Artery**

The radial artery is the smaller of the two branches of the brachial artery at the level of its bifurcation. It branches off the brachial artery anteromedial to the biceps tendon, and courses inferolaterally along the forearm.

The radial artery mainly supplies blood to the wrist and hand, as it does not have many branches in the proximal forearm. It is the main blood supply of the lateral hand and lateral three digits. It forms part of the blood supply of several forearm muscles. It supplies the radial nerve and helps supply the elbow joint.

**Radial Recurrent Artery**

The radial recurrent artery branches laterally off the radial artery in the cubital fossa anterior to the biceps tendon.

**Anterior Ulnar Recurrent Artery**

The anterior ulnar recurrent artery is the first branch of the ulnar artery. It branches medially in the cubital fossa and travels superiorly up the arm between the brachialis and pronator teres.

**Posterior Ulnar Recurrent Artery**

The posterior ulnar recurrent artery branches laterally off the ulnar artery directly below the origin of the anterior ulnar recurrent artery.

**Common Interosseous Artery**

The common interosseous artery branches medially off the ulnar artery distal to the origin of the posterior ulnar recurrent artery.

**Anterior Interosseous Artery**

The anterior interosseous artery branches off the common interosseous artery and travels inferiorly down the arm anterior to the interosseous membrane.

**Posterior Interosseous Artery**

The posterior interosseous artery branches off the common interosseous artery and travels inferiorly down the arm shortly before piercing the interosseous membrane and giving off a branch called the recurrent interosseous artery at the level of the supinator.

**Recurrent Interosseous Artery**

The recurrent interosseous artery branches off the posterior interosseous artery at the level of the supinator muscle.
