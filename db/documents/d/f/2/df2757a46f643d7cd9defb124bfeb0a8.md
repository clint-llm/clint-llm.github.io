A perinephric abscess can occur through the hematogenous spread of infection from a focus outside the kidney or local spread of a related urologic infection. These abscesses are usually due to ascending infection from the urinary bladder with associated pyelonephritis. With local spread, there is an outward migration of kidney infection into the perirenal fat. It might also result from a ruptured kidney abscess through the capsule to form renal abscess of the cortex due to staphylococcus. Perinephric abscesses may arise from non-renal contiguous infections. These infections may originate from trauma, an extension of infection in other body organs including liver, cervix, pancreas, gallbladder, and appendix or from small bowel Crohn’s disease, or vertebral osteomyelitis. Perinephric fat infection can also occur from hematogenous seeding mostly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The kidney is usually unaffected in hematogenous seeding.

Perinephric abscesses are usually due to gram-negative enteric bacilli or a polymicrobial infection. The most frequently encountered organisms are Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumonia.Escherichia coli accounts for 51.4% of perinephric abscesses.  Perinephric abscesses due to Staphylococcus aureus are usually secondary to hematogenous seeding of infection.
