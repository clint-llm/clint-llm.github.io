The West Nile virus is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA arbovirus that can cause disease in humans. These range from the asymptomatic infected patient to fever and malaise to florid neurological deficits secondary to encephalitis and neuroinvasive disease. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of infection from West Nile virus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in collaborating to provide care for the treatment of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of West Nile virus infection.
- Describe an appropriate history and physical examination findings for someone with West Nile fever and with neuroinvasive West Nile virus.
- List the means of diagnosis along with the treatment and management options available for patients with West Nile virus.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of West Nile virus and improve outcomes.
