Digit reimplantation requires an interprofessional team that includes a hand surgeon, plastic surgeon, emergency department physician,Â and specialty trained nurses. Once the digit is reimplanted, close monitoring is required to ensure that no ischemia or infection occurs. Following the surgery, patients require prolonged physical therapy to regain joint function and strength. While digit reimplantation does have success, the procedure does not work in everyone.
