Turcot syndrome is the association of primary brain tumors with colorectal cancer. Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are the 2 most well-known inherited colorectal cancers. If a brain tumor arises in a patient with either HNPCC or FAP, then the patient is considered to have Turcot syndrome 1 (TS1) or Turcot syndrome 2 (TS2). This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Turcot syndrome. It highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe Turcot syndrome.
- Review the etiology of Turcot syndrome type 1 and Turcot syndrome type 2.
- Explain the management of Turcot syndrome.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of Turcot syndrome and improve outcomes.
