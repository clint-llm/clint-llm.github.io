Once ventilator-associated pneumonia is suspected and appropriate culture samples are sent, empirical therapy will be based on the duration of intubation and hospitalization, prior or current antibiotic therapy, the severity of clinical disease, and knowledge of local pathogen’s susceptibility patterns. Initial broad-spectrum therapy with coverage of gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa, and possibly methicillin-resistant S. aureus is generally appropriate. Treatment is then narrowed based on subsequent culture data and clinical and radiographic findings.

Treatment duration has not been evaluated in children. In adults, uncomplicated cases may be treated with 7 to 10 days of therapy. For complicated cases or those with necrotizing pneumonia, at least 14 days of therapy should be administered. Courses less than 7 days may be appropriate for children with ventilator-associated tracheitis without evidence of pneumonia.
