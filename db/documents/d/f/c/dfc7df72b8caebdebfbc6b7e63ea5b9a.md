# Continuing Education Activity

Antiplatelets and anticoagulants are used to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients at high risk. However, when these patients need gastrointestinal procedures like endoscopy, these agents increased the risk of bleeding related to the procedure. This activity reviews an interprofessional approach to holding antithrombotic therapy before different gastrointestinal procedures, and the resumption following the same.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk of bleeding associated with different gastrointestinal procedures.
- Summarize the risks of thromboembolism in different medical conditions.
- Describe the approach to the management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets before elective gastrointestinal procedures.
- Outline the approach to managing the risks of bleeding associated with antithrombotic agents in patients requiring emergent endoscopy by an interprofessional team.

# Introduction

Antithrombotic therapy, including antiplatelet and anticoagulants, is used to reduce the risk of thromboembolic episodes in patients with medical conditions like coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), venous thromboembolism (VTE), hypercoagulable states, and mechanical heart valves among others. These agents increase the bleeding risk when undertaking endoscopic procedures, but there is also a risk of thromboembolic sequelae if they are withheld. The strategy for managing this therapy when these patients need gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic procedures has been a subject of controversy. In this chapter, we discuss this based on the available evidence and the current guidelines.

# Function

**Bleeding Risk Associated With The Procedure**

Various endoscopic procedures have different risks of associated bleeding. Table 1 lists the general risks of bleeding among the commonly employed endoscopic procedures.

**Thrombosis Risk Associated With The Condition**

The underlying condition dictates the risk of thromboembolic episodes in these patients, especially when withholding the antithrombotic agent. Stroke prevention in non-valvular AF is a very common indication for antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, and the risk of cerebral thromboembolism in these patients is predictable using the CHA(2)DS(2)Vasc index.table

# Clinical Significance

**Interruption of Antithrombotic Therapy Prior To Endoscopy**

**Elective Endoscopy**

In patients who need elective endoscopic procedures, if the indication for anti-thrombotic therapy is short-term, the procedure is best delayed until after that period. For patients on long-term or life-long antithrombotic treatment, the decision to temporarily hold the treatment for endoscopy should occur after a discussion with the patient and the concerned providers (primary medical provider, cardiologist, neurologist, or hematologist). In some high-risk patients, these agents cannot be interrupted, in which case the surgeon and patient must consider the risks and benefits of the procedure.

**Parenteral anticoagulants**

Unfractionated heparin (UHF) administered as a continuous intravenous infusion can be stopped 3 to 4 hours before the procedure, given the short half-life. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), including enoxaparin and dalteparin, should be stopped 24 hours prior to the procedure.

**Warfarin**

The therapeutic effect of warfarin is measured in terms of the International Normalized Ratio (INR). The INR decreases to less than 1.5 in over 90% of patients when holding treatment is held for five days.

**Direct Oral Anticoagulants**

The use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has been on the rise over the last decade. This trend includes anti-Xa agents, rivaroxaban and apixaban, and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. There are no reliable laboratory assays to assess the anticoagulant effect of these agents at this time. The duration before high-risk endoscopic procedures that the DOACs have to be held depends on the patient's renal function. The anti-Xa drugs should be held for 1 to 2 days if the creatinine clearance (CrCl)is 60 mL/min or more, for three days if the CrCl is between 30 mL/min and 59 mL/min, and for four days if the CrCl is less than 30 mL/min.

**Antiplatelets**

Aspirin and thienopyridines (clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor) are the most commonly used antiplatelet agents. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase systems. It takes 7 to 9 days to regain platelet function following the discontinuation of aspirin.

**Emergent Endoscopy**

The most common indication for emergent endoscopic procedures is GI bleeding. The common etiologies for acute upper GI bleeding are peptic ulcer disease, variceal bleeding, and gastritis or esophagitis, while lower GI bleeding is most commonly diverticular in origin. The decision to discontinue antithrombotic therapy and reversal of anticoagulation must be weighed against the risk of incurring a thromboembolic event. Correction of INR to between 1.5 and 2.5 is adequate for diagnostic and intervention purposes and is comparable to patients not on any form of anticoagulation. Therapeutic measures to achieve hemostasis in patients with GI bleeding are effective even with a moderately elevated INR.

If an urgent reversal of anticoagulation is necessary for patients on UFH therapy, they can receive a slow infusion of protamine sulfate. The dose is calculated based on the dose of heparin administered and the duration of therapy. The anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is reversible with idarucizumab. Idarucizumab is approved for life-threatening bleeding or before emergent surgery.

**Resumption Of Antithrombotic Therapy After Endoscopy**

Anticoagulation should generally be resumed upon completion of the procedure unless there remains a continued risk of major bleeding.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

It is essential for health care providers to educate patients on the importance of holding these medications for the specific duration before the procedure and on their prompt resumption. This counsel is possible through direct counseling, educational materials, and the use of technology to send reminders. The potential risks and benefits of this strategy have to be discussed with patients by the interprofessional team. This interprofessional approach is vital in ensuring an appropriate treatment plan. In addition to the specialists, surgeons, and other clinicians, nursing will monitor the patient following the procedure. A board-certified pharmacotherapy pharmacist can consult with the clinicians to stop and resume anticoagulation therapy surrounding the procedure.

A patient-centered interprofessional team consisting of the primary care provider, gastroenterologist, cardiologist, or hematologist, pharmacists, and nurses have to be involved in guiding patients on handling the change in their medication regimen, monitoring for bleeding, titration of therapy, and early recognition of any complications should they occur. This team paradigm will positively drive patient outcomes.
