Patient education is of utmost importance in the management of TB at the level of an individual, as well as the whole community. The need for isolation of patients who can potentially transmit the disease to others cannot be understated. Although extrapulmonary (including spinal TB) disease is not communicable, there can be an associated pulmonary involvement in a proportion of these patients. The role of strict compliance to long term chemotherapy in ensuring complete cure from the infection needs to be well understood by the patients. Directly observed therapy can ameliorate the compliance rates in TB patients. Appropriate bracing can also reduce the occurrence of kyphosis in non-operatively treated patients. In pediatric disease, the chances of progression of deformity even years after healing of the infection and the need for regular follow-up until skeletal maturity need to be clearly communicated to the parents.
