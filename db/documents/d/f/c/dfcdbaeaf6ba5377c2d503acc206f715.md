A detailed review of the patient’s history, with a thorough understanding of the cardiac anatomy, as well as specific attention to the details of previous surgical interventions (i.e., type of RVOT reconstruction, size of conduit, type of conduit, intra-operative concerns or challenges, etc.), are crucial. Review of other available diagnostic studies such as previous hemodynamic evaluation, echocardiography, EKGs, stress tests, cross-sectional imaging with either cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), or computed tomography (CT).

The preferred approach may depend on several factors such as RVOT morphology, compliance and distensibility of the RVOT, and the coronary artery anatomy. CT or MRI cross-sectional imaging with 3D reconstruction can be very helpful to carefully assess the RVOT morphology, conduit type, and degree of calcification.
