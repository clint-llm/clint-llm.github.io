Pancreatic serous cystadenomas are mostly benign lesions. Their incidence has increased recently due to the improvements in imaging techniques nowadays. They are usually discovered incidentally and are asymptomatic. The etiology behind these serous cysts are not well identified. They can be either microcystic or macrocytic, and the management usually depends on their type and size. In this article, the pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and different labs and imaging techniques that can help in a better understanding of serous cystadenomas and how to manage them accordingly will be discussed. The role of the interprofessional team will be reviewed.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pancreatic serous cystadenomas.
- Describe the histology of pancreatic serous cystadenomas.
- Outline the different treatment modalities and ensure adequate management.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to ensure adequate delivery of care and patients.
