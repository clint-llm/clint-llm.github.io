For contraindications, factors to consider are renal function, pregnancy, and neuromuscular disease.

- It is crucial to assess renal function before giving magnesium. Renal failure can cause decreased magnesium excretion leading to toxicity. Closely monitor magnesium levels in patients with reduced renal function.

- Patients with neuromuscular disease, such as myasthenia gravis need to beÂ closely monitored if they are given magnesium. Magnesium inhibits the release of acetylcholine which can cause deterioration.

- Magnesium is considered class D for pregnancy. Skeletal demineralization, hypocalcemia, and hypermagnesemia are seen with long-term use, more than 5 to 7 days, of magnesium, which is necessary for pre-term labor treatment.

- There are no contraindications for magnesium supplements with other prescriptions. However, various drugs increase or decrease the concentration of either magnesium or the prescribed medication.

- Magnesium may be used in pregnancy and lactation; there is no expected risk of fetal or infant harm based on limited data in humans.
