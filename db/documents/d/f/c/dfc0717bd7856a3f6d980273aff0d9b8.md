Etomidate can lower seizure threshold in patients with a seizure disorder and can also cause nausea and vomiting. Etomidate can cause dose-dependent inhibition of adrenal cortisol production for up to 12 hours. Hence, one should exercise caution in those with known adrenal insufficiency or seizure disorder.

Ketamineâ€™s sympathomimetic effects can lead to an increased cardiac output and blood pressure, which can precipitate cardiac ischemia in patients with known coronary artery disease. Ketamine is also a cerebral vasodilator, which can cause increased intracranial pressures. Due to these side effects, ketamine is contraindicated in patients with closed intracranial trauma, raised intraocular pressures, coronary artery disease, and hypertension.

Propofol most commonly causes hypotension by reducing systemic vascular resistance. Usually, this is overcome by a bolus of intravenous fluids. Additionally, some patients may have hypersensitivity reactions if allergic to eggs or soy products. Propofol should be used cautiously or avoided in those patients with pre-existing hypotension.

A personal or family history of malignant hyperthermia and conditions predisposing to life-threatening hyperkalemia are absolute contraindications for using succinylcholine.
