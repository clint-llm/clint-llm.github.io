The most frequent presentation of patients with clinical otosclerosis is hearing loss. Also, tinnitus and vertigo can occur. It is vital to take a detailed clinical history. Usually, the patient with otosclerosis presents with bilateral hearing loss as the most common symptom that has been gradually worsening over many years. Typically, it starts in one ear, and as it progresses, it involves the other ear.

The initial symptoms include being unable to hear the low-frequency sounds, such as a whisper. Also, the patients may give a history that they can hear well in noisy surroundings termed as "paracusis willisii." Though it is not specific of otosclerosis, it is indicative of conduction deafness. The patients themselves may speak in a low volume and a monotonous voice. As the disease becomes extensive, tinnitus may worsen as well. Dizziness is usually mild, but as the disease progresses, dizziness may deteriorate, mimicking Meniere disease.

On physical examination, otoscopy may reveal minimal details and may be normal. However, with active otosclerosis or cochlear otosclerosis, increased promontory vascularity may be visible through the eardrum and is clinically termed as the Schwartz sign.
