The quadriceps femoris is a large muscle group of the anterior thigh consisting of the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, and vastus medialis, that acts as the primary extensor muscle of the knee. These 4 muscles converge into the quadriceps tendon at the superior aspects of the patella, which allows the components of the quadriceps femoris to act together to extend the leg at the knee joint.
