The umbilical cord lacks intrinsic and extrinsic innervations during all stages of embryonic development. Vasoactive substances secreted locally within the umbilical vessels wall or carried through the fetal circulation are responsible for regulating the smooth muscle tension within the umbilical vasculature. For instance, nitrous oxide and prostacyclin play an essential role in maintaining the low vascular resistance within the umbilical and placental circulation. Furthermore, catecholamines are primary contributors for vasoconstriction of the umbilical vessels immediately after parturition.
