**Imaging Studies**

**Specular Microscopy**

It basically means photographic mapping of the corneal endothelium. When light rays fall onto the cornea, the reflected images from the optical interface can be imaged (endothelium or aqueous humor). The endothelial layer is mapped under high magnification, and thus the cell density can be quantified. The normal cell density is 3000 to 3500 cell/mm^2 in young individuals and 2000 to 2500 cell/mm^2 in older adults. A cell density below 1000 cells/ mm^2 is labeled as critical cell density, and individuals with such cell density are at the highest risk of developing corneal decompensation. The various endothelial parameters assessed are polymorphism (variation in cell shape), polymegathism (variation in cell size), the maximum or minimum number of cells, average cells, number of cells showing hexagonality, coefficient of variation, standard deviation, presence or absence of guttae and artifacts. Endothelial cells depicting various sizes and shapes are considered under stress and are abnormal.

**Ultrasound Pachymetry**

The corneal thickness can be easily assessed using ultrasound and corneal pachymetry. The normal central corneal thickness is 0.55 mm, and it increases to 0.80 in the corneal periphery. In conditions causing cornea thickening and edema, the thickness is usually more than 0.60, indicating corneal edema. The clinical application for pachymetry is to help assess the progression of endothelial diseases like Fuch’s endothelial dystrophy and follow up of corneal graft rejection cases under steroid regimen.

**Optical Pachymetry**

This imaging modality helps assess the depth of corneal pathology (e.g., nebular, macular, or leucomatous corneal opacities), especially when full-thickness stroma is not involved, and it becomes necessary to decide for depth before preoperative excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy.
