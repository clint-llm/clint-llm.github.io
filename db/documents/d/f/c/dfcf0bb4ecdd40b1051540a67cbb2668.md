The antiperinuclear factor is a rheumatoid arthritis-specific autoantibody that is present in 49-91% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies directed against antiperinuclear factor shows staining of KHG.

Identification of hypergranulosis or hypogranulosis on H & E staining is often helpful in the histological diagnosis of skin conditions like psoriasis, lichen planus, Bowen disease, and actinic keratosis amongst others.

The presence of coarse KHG in cases of irritated seborrheic keratosis is useful to differentiate seborrheic keratosis from verruca vulgaris, as the coarse granules are a specific feature of irritated seborrheic keratosis.

One of the main proteinaceous components of KHG is filaggrin, which is essential in facilitating cellular compression and the biogenesis of the stratum corneum.  Loss-of-function mutations involving the filaggrin gene has been shown to be the cause of many conditions, including monogenic genodermatosis ichthyosis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis (eczema). A number of independent and complementary genetic studies demonstrate that inheritance of loss-of-function mutation in the filaggrin gene (FLG) confers a high risk of AD and related atopic diseases like ichthyosis vulgaris.
