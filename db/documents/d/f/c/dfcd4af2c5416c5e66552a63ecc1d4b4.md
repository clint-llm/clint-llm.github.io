The addition of hyperbaric oxygen treatment improves the tissue response to surgical wounding and improves the patient's chances of healing after surgical resection or reconstruction of the mandible. Perioperative prophylactic hyperbaric oxygen treatment is recommended for patients with previous head and neck irradiation who are undergoing dental extractions or complete exodontia procedures again to increase the blood flow, oxygenation, and penetration of bone by antibiotics. Studies have shown a reduction from 30% to 5% incidence of osteoradionecrosis with the use of prophylactic hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Dentists are encouraged to refer patients at risk to hyperbaric medicine for consultation before tooth extraction in previously irradiated fields. Before beginning radiation therapy all patients should undergo a thorough dental evaluation. Prophylactic extraction before radiotherapy can preclude osteoradionecrosis issues later.
