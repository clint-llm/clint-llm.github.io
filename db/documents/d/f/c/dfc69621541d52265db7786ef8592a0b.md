The opponens pollicis muscle is in the thenar eminence along with three other muscles that make up the thenar eminence. The opponens pollicis muscle is a muscle originates from the tubercle of the trapezium bone and the transverse carpal ligament (flexor retinaculum). The muscle then inserts onto the entire length of the first metacarpal bone. The function of the opponens pollicis muscle is to draw the thumb across the hand and touch the tips of the other digits. When the opponens pollicis muscle contracts it pulls the thumb medially towards the other digits. The medially drawn thumb is made up of flexion, internal rotation, and palmar abduction of the thumb. This combination equates to the opposition of the thumb.

The movement produced from the opposition of the thumb and the other muscles allows the hand to cup objects. The pincher grip is also made possible by the opponens pollicis muscle contracting and touching the tips of the other digits.
