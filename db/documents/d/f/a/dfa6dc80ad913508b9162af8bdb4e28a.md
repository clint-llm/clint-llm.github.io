The diagnosis and management of right heart failure is with an interprofessional team that consists of a cardiologist, pulmonologist, intensivist, internist and cardiac surgeon. In the outpatient setting, these patients are managed by the primary care provider and nurse practitioner. In patients with PH, primary therapy should be directed at the underlying cause of the PH. In addition, the need for diuretic, oxygen, and anticoagulant therapy should be assessed. Patients with persistent PH whose WHO functional class is II, III, or IV despite treatment of the underlying cause of the PH should be referred to a specialized center to be evaluated for advanced therapy. There is no single best approach to selecting an agent for advanced therapy. The strategy is to choose an agent based on multiple factors including WHO functional class, right ventricular function, hemodynamics, vasoreactivity test, and patient characteristics and preferences. The prognosis for patients with pulmonary hypertension is guarded. The key is to manage the primary cause. In patients with fixed pulmonary hypertension with right heart failure, the prognosis is very poor. In the clinical setting of concomitant cardiovascular disease, survival is influenced by TR,;severe TR is an independent predictor of mortality.
