Usually, the outcome of this viral infection is self-limited, and the patient will fully recover; however, the prognosis depends on which serotype of the virus the patient was infected with. The morbidity of HFRS is very low, and its mortality rate is from 0.43%-15%, depending on the strain of the virus.

However, all strains can produce symptoms that range from asymptomatic to severe forms of the disease. Once a patient recuperates, very seldom do their kidneys have sequelae from the disease; however, it has been noted in the USA that 10% of patients with ESRD have hantavirus antibodies.
