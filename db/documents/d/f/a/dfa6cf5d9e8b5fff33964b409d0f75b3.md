QuinolonesÂ are most often administered through oral and intravenous (IV) routes, though topical formulations in the form of ophthalmic solutions also exist. Oral quinolones are rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and possess a high oral bioavailability, allowing the oral and IV routes of administration to be used interchangeably for certain quinolones.

Concurrent consumption of food (including dairy products) with oral quinolones has minimal effect on its absorption and activity.
