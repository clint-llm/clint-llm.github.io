Goodpasture syndrome refers to an anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease that involves both the lungs and kidneys, often presenting as pulmonary hemorrhage and glomerulonephritis. However, some clinicians may interchangeably use several terms, including anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, Goodpasture syndrome, and Goodpasture disease.

Goodpasture syndrome is an eponym named after Ernest Goodpasture, who described this disorder for the first time in 1919. Later the discovery of anti-GBM antibodies led to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of Goodpasture syndrome.
