Clinical manifestations of the infection caused by C. difficile vary from an asymptomatic carrier to severe disease-causing, toxic megacolon, depending on a wide range of pathogen and host factors. Watery diarrhea with mucus or occult blood, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, low-grade fever, and lower abdominal pain are the symptoms commonly associated with diarrhea and colitis caused by C. difficile.
