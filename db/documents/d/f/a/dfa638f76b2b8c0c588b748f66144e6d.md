While parasympathomimetic medications are highly effective in treating several neurological, ophthalmic, gastrointestinal, and urinary disorders, they also carry the potential for adverse effects. All members of the interprofessional health care team, including clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other health professionals, should be aware of the side effects and contraindications of parasympathomimetics. Prescribers should consult with the pharmacy team regarding appropriate dosing and potential drug-drug interactions. Furthermore, it is important that health care providers counsel patients on how to take prescribed medications and educate them on potential side effects associated with treatment. Nurses and other clinical staff should be able to recognize the signs of cholinergic toxicity and promptly communicate these findings with other team members in cases of overdosage. Interprofessional collaboration is critical to the effective use of parasympathomimetic medications. By implementing an interprofessional team-based approach to care, providers can achieve optimal patient outcomes while minimizing the risk of adverse events. [Level 5]
