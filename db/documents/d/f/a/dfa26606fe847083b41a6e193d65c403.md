Laboratory studies are usually significant for early leukocytosis, but both leukopenia and a normal white blood cell count have been reported in the literature.

No diagnostic criteria for pylephlebitis currently exist. As such, the diagnosis is usually made after imaging shows a portal vein thrombus in a patient with sepsis and a clinical picture consistent with pylephlebitis.

In one study, CT and US were the most common imaging modalities utilized, but other less used modalities included MRI and PET/CT. Previously, a subset of patients has been diagnosed at autopsy, but more advanced imaging techniques have aided in facilitating an earlier diagnosis.
