The diagnosis is made clinically in most cases. Sticky tape can be used over the infected area to pick up the adult lice and examine them under a microscope. The nits are oval-shaped and firmly attached to the hair shaft. A Wood lamp examination may reveal greenish-yellow fluorescence of the nits. Sometimes the pubic hair may reveal the presence ofÂ lice, and this is an indication for a workup of a sexually transmitted infection.
