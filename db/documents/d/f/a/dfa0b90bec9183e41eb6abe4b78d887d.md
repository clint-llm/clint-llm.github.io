Rhabdomyolysis means dissolution of skeletal muscle, and it is characterized by leakage of muscle cell contents, myoglobin, sarcoplasmic proteins (creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aldolase, alanine, and aspartate aminotransferase), and electrolytes into the extracellular fluid and the circulation. The word rhabdomyolysis is derived from the Greek words rhabdos (rod-like/striated), mus (muscle), and Lucis (breakdown).

Myolysis after the consumption of Coturnix coturnix, common quail, is well-known in Mediterranean countries for ages. Rhabdomyolysis history can be traced back to the time of the old testament, where Israelites suffered from similar symptoms like rhabdomyolysis after consumption of quail during their departure from Egypt. This myolysis results from the consumption of hemlock herb intoxicated quails (coturnism) during spring migration.

The common causes of rhabdomyolysis are trauma, exertion, muscle hypoxia, infections, metabolic and electrolyte disorders, drugs, toxins, and genetic defects.

Rhabdomyolysis clinically is a triad of myalgia, myoglobinuria (tea-colored urine), and weakness. Even though less than 10% of patients present with classic symptoms, most patients have mild abnormal laboratory findings and are asymptomatic.
