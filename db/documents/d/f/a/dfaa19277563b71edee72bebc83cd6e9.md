The immediate treatment of a subdural hematoma initially includes management of the airway, breathing with stabilization of the circulation for the critical care professional. After stabilization and monitoring of the patient, a secondary plan of care should follow. The management must include the involvement of neurosurgery and neurological consultation with a consensus on the injury and a determination of the immediate and long-term consequences. Conservative non-surgical management for subacute and chronic subdural hematomas is appropriate if the accumulation has not extended further into the calvarium as to cause impingement on the brain or the brain stem. In contrast, a subdural hematoma that is quickly increasing or causing any signs of increased intracranial pressure, for example, hypertension, bradycardia with erratic respirations should prompt surgical evacuation and is paramount to preserve vital functions. In the interim, the clinician must begin immediate medical management. These measures include sedation, neuromuscular blockade when appropriate, moderate hyperventilation to a Pc02 (32 to 36), adequate oxygenation to maintain Sp02 greater than 95%, head elevation, and avoidance of hyperthermia.
