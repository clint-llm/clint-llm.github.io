Advancements in five areas of cell biology have contributed to the understanding of Reed-Sternberg cells.

- Fixed tissue and cell line immunophenotyping have helped in the understanding of the Reed-Sternberg cell surface.

- Genotyping has given this information genetic context.

- Cell lines from Hodgkin Disease specimens have permitted the development of specific monoclonal antibodies.

- A relationship between Hodgkin and Epstein-Barr virus has hinted at a relationship between the two.

- Cytokines produced in Hodgkin Disease provide insight into the cells involved and the pathophysiology of the disease.
