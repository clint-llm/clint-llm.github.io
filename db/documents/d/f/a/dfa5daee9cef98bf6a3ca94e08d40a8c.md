An interprofessional team approach is imperative in the care of these patients. Patients with TA are usually cared for in a neonatal ICU (intensive care unit) preoperatively and postoperatively in a cardiac ICU. A collaborative approach between intensivists, cardiologists, and the surgeon is of paramount importance in ensuring good outcomes. Some of these patients have non-cardiac organ systems involved due to syndromes. Hence, consulting other pediatric sub-specialists becomes necessary. Nurses, respiratory therapists, perfusionists, nutritionists, and social workers are important parts of the comprehensive interprofessional medical team.

Upon discharge, these patients need to have a medical home and comprehensive care as their care is complex. A board-certified cardiology pharmacist should definitely have involvement in any anticoagulation vs. platelet-blocking debate, as well as performing medication reconciliation, verifying dosing of all drugs, and offering counsel to both patients, family, and team members. A good primary care provider is important to coordinate care and minimize the burden to the family.
