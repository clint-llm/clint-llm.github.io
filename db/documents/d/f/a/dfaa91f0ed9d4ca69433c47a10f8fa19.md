Intracerebral hemorrhage contributes to 10 to 20% of all strokes worldwide and about 8 to 15% of all strokes in the United States. The lifetime risk of stroke in individuals 25 years and older in 2016 was estimated to be 24.7% among men and 25.1% in women. The overall risk is thus, an estimated 24.9% compared to 22.8% in 1990. The highest risk is in East Asia and Europe, and the lowest risk is in countries with a low sociodemographic index, such as Sub-saharan Africa. Similarly, stroke incidence and mortality are highest in Asia, especially in China and East European countries. Although the rates are declining, the absolute number of incidence cases in 2016 has doubled since 1990, with the majority of individuals being under the age of 70. The estimated case fatality of intracerebral at one month is 40% and at one year is 54%. Long-term functional independence occurs in only 13 to 49% of the patients.
