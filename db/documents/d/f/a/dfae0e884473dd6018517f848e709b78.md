Up to the fifth and sixth week of fetal life, the genital system remains indifferent. Two pairs of genital ducts are present at this time: the mesonephric (Wolffian duct) and paramesonephric (Mullerian duct). In females, the absence of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and SRY gene conditions the regression of Wolff ducts and further differentiation of Mullerian ducts. The upper third of the vagina, the cervix, both fallopian tubes, and the uterus derive from the paramesonephric ducts.

In the eighth week, a  vertical fusion of paramesonephric ducts occurs. The fused cranial end gives origin to the left and right parts of what will ultimately become the uterus. This structure contains mesoderm that will form the endometrium and myometrium. The unfused cranial ends of the Mullerian ducts will develop into the fallopian tubes,  the fimbrial portion of the fallopian tubes derives from the tip of this structure that remains open and acquires a funnel shape. The caudal end of the fused ducts will form the upper third of the vagina.
