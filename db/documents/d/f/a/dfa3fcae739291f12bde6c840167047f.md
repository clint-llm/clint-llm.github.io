After observing unstable ventricular tachycardia on the monitor, and defibrillation is not immediately available, a firmly clenched fist at approximately 20 centimeters above the patient should swiftly strike the inferior third of the patientâ€™s sternum. After making contact, the physician should immediately remove their hand to allow for chest recoil. The cardiac monitor should be observed for any change in rhythm, and proper advanced cardiac life support protocol followed after the blow.
