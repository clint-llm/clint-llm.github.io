Assessing the toxicology profile of omalizumab has proven to be complicated. Based on the initial manufacturer information and literature searches, it is unclear what the actual toxicology profile is with regards to the initial animal studies; they identified no apparent single-dose toxicity or multiple dose toxicity. However, there was some discussion and delay in trials due to thrombocytopenia observed in monkey studies. Study data demonstrated no overt carcinogenic properties.
