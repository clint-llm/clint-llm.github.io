The rectum is approximately 15cm long. It has an intraperitoneal portion, which includes the upper two-thirds anteriorly and the upper one third laterally. The lower third of the rectum is extraperitoneal. The blood supply is from the superior hemorrhoidal branches from the inferior mesenteric artery, the middle hemorrhoidal branch of the internal iliac artery, and the inferior hemorrhoidal branch of the internal pudendal arteries.

Decision making for management of rectal injuries has as its basis intraperitoneal and extra-peritoneal zones and the Rectum Injury Scale of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (image attached below).
