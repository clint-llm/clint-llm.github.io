In cosmetic surgery practices, aging of the neck is a very common complaint due to the frequency with which skin and muscle laxity develops over time. Accumulation of submental fat, in both the subdermal and subplatysmal compartments, further compounds the issue in most cases. Because there are so many options for addressing the aging neck, operative and non-operative, there is a role for a great number of clinicians of different specialties and levels of training in the management of patients with this chief complaint. Aestheticians, nurses, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners can all provide non-surgical treatment, and some may also assist in the operating room, or provide care that supports or supplements surgery. From 2019 to 2020, necklifts accounted for between 160,000 and 180,000 surgeries in the United States alone. Bearing in mind that the necklift often constitutes a key component of facelifting, that number could possibly be closer to 400,000 cases per year, making it a hugely popular surgical option. For this reason, it important for clincians outside of cosmetic practices to at the very least be aware of what options may be available to their patients, and more importantly, how to recognize complications from these treatments.
