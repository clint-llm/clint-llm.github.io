Psoriasis has to be differentiated from tinea corporis (dermatophyte fungal infection) and eczema. In some patients, they can coexist. ILVEN should be differentiated from Blaschko linear psoriasis. In chronic plaques that resist treatment, squamous cell carcinoma in situ and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma may require exclusion by histological examination.
