Due to the multifactorial nature of hearing loss, the evaluation of a child with significant hearing loss should ideally take place by a multidisciplinary team involving geneticists, audiologists, otolaryngologists, pediatricians, speech and language pathologists, psychologists, early childhood special needs educators, social workers, and any other medical professionals depending on any syndromic findings.

Because many deaf infants are born to non-deaf parents, it is crucial to ensure accurate and updated information is delivered by the most qualified health care professional to parents. It is advisable to consult a medical geneticist who can accurately relay recurrence risk to the parents in these circumstances.
