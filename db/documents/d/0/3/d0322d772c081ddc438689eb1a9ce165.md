Pulmonary artery sling (PAS) symptoms can be non-specific, but effective treatment requires proper pre-operative workup and surgical intervention.

A thorough multimodal pre-operative workup is essential for precise surgical planning since there is associated tracheal stenosis with PAS: CT, echo, and bronchoscopy.

Patients with mild symptoms of congenital tracheal stenosis need careful pre-operative assessment due to an increased risk of mortality with surgical intervention.

A crucial component to ensuring successful surgical outcomes in a thorough, multidisciplinary approach for perioperative management.
