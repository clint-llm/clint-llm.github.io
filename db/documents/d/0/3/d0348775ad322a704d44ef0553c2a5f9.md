During resuscitation, rhythm strip analysis may help guide interventions. Point-of-care ultrasound may be useful to exclude concomitant injuries like pneumothorax or pericardial effusion/tamponade. Radiography has essentially no role in the management of commotio cordis but may be important to identify concomitant serious injuries like a sternal fracture.

The American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) provide a strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence that after resuscitation, patients with commotio cordis should undergo “a comprehensive evaluation for underlying cardiac pathology and susceptibility to arrhythmias.”

An electrocardiogram (ECG) may reveal evidence of myocardial injury, but it may be difficult to distinguish whether it occurred primarily or secondary to cardiac arrest. Troponin and echocardiogram may be useful to determine the presence of myocardial contusion.  An echocardiogram may also help identify if there are other underlying structural abnormalities. Stress testing or cardiac catheterization may be considered to evaluate for coronary artery disease, as appropriate.  Pharmacological testing for Brugada syndrome and long-QT syndrome should also be considered.
