The most common etiology for metatarsal fractures is either direct or indirect trauma. Such injuries may vary from a simple isolated metatarsal fracture to crush injuries involving multiple fractures and drastic soft tissue compromise.

The Lisfranc joint complex consists of the tarsometatar­sal joints. The Lisfranc fracture-dislocation can result due to falling from height or stairs. The common mechanisms of injury are either longitudinal compression of the foot or rotation around a fixed forefoot. In the former mechanism, the metatarsal head remains fixed while body weight lies over the hindfoot, especially against the base of metatarsals.

The other variety of fractures that are commonly seen in metatarsal bones is stress fractures which result from a small amount of repetitive force and are commonly associated with ballet dancers, athletes and soldiers, hence termed “march fracture.”

Insufficiency fractures can also be seen in metatarsal bones, which occur due to normal stress loading over a weakened bone. Such injuries are usually seen in osteoporosis patients and postmenopausal women.
