Tetanus immunization should be updated if necessary after tooth avulsion.

Dental follow-up is mandatory for further treatment after replantation.

Brushing teeth after every meal and using chlorhexidine 0.12% rinse twice daily can decrease infection rates.

Patients should be placed on a soft to chew diet for at least two weeks following tooth avulsion.

The success of replantation of the tooth is difficult to predict, and the patient and family should be warned that dental root resorption and tooth loss are possible.
