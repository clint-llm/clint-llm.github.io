Absolute contraindications to edrophonium include hypersensitivity to edrophonium patients with gastrointestinal and urinary obstruction. Edrophonium administration requires extreme vigilance and monitoring in patients with cardiac arrhythmias and asthma. Physicians are cautious with the use of edrophonium in asthmatic patients due to possible oxygen desaturation from bronchoconstriction and increased bronchial secretions. In the setting of non-depolarizing NMBA reversal, edrophonium administration is contraindicated and cannot be administered when the peripheral nerve stimulation does not elicit at least one twitch.

According to the manufacturer's product labeling information, the excipient contains sodium sulfite, which may cause allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. The clinical presentation of sulfite allergy includes hives, rhinorrhea, bronchoconstriction, flushing, and cardiovascular collapse. Hence use with extreme caution in patients with sulfite allergy.
