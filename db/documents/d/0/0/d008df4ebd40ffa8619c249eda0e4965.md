The underlying pathophysiology depends on the cause of pancytopenia. The pathophysiology of aplastic anemia is an autoimmune-mediated T-cell activation, which leads to the destruction of the hematopoietic stem cells. Bone marrow suppression is also caused by the direct cytotoxic effects of medications such as methotrexate, anticonvulsants, and chemotherapeutic agents. Ineffective hematopoiesis is seen in the bone marrow of myelodysplastic syndrome.

Sepsis causes pancytopenias through several mechanisms (marrow suppression, hypersplenism, and consumptive coagulopathy), which usually act in combination. The virus causes pancytopenia through several mechanisms that modulate the hematopoietic stem cells.
