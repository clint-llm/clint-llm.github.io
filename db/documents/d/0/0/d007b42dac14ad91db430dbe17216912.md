The closed-circuit anesthesia machine has become the main-stay for providing oxygenation, ventilation, and administration of volatile anesthetics to patients to allow for otherwise intolerably painful procedures to be performed in modern-day medicine. Anesthesia machines and the providers utilizing them have become such an essential component of the operating room that they have evolved to incorporate various electronic monitoring equipment and complex ventilators to become what is known as the "anesthesia workstation." This activity reviews the anesthesia machine's important components and functionality, highlighting the importance of the interprofessional team's understanding of the anesthesia machine to prevent adverse outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify pitfalls of the anesthesia machine that could potentially result in patient harm.
- Review the safety mechanisms in place on the anesthesia machine.
- Explain the difference between high, intermediate, and low-pressure systems of the anesthesia machine.
- Describe in detail the issues of concern and clinical significance for a better understanding of the interprofessional team.
