A muscle of facial expression, the levator anguli oris, elevates the corners of the mouth. Along with the zygomaticus major and minor, the levator labii superioris, and the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, it provides upper dental show, primarily during smiling, and for maintaining the resting tone and position of the upper lip. While the levator anguli oris is not the most critical of the smile muscles, unilateral dysfunction of the levator anguli oris can lead to noticeable asymmetry of the smile, which can impact a person's quality of life.
