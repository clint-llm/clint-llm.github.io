Sternum, clavicle, humeral head, iliac crest, distal femur, proximal tibia, distal tibia, and calcaneus are all potential sites for intraosseous access. The proximal tibia, humeral head, and sternum are the preferred sites in adults. The distal femur, proximal tibia, and distal tibia are preferred sites for infants and neonates.Â Always palpate both margins of the boney site to ensure penetration of the bone centrally. Note that each site is always one to two fingerbreadths in measurement to locate the correct location.

- Sternum: 1 cm below the sternal notch.

- Humerus: The humerus should be internally rotated and the hand placed on the abdomen with the elbow flexed to 90 degrees, ensuring that the bicep tendon is medially located and not penetrated. The surgical neck is palpated, and the needle is placed 2 cm above the surgical neck into the greater tubercle at about 45 degrees to the anterior plane. A longer IO needle is necessary, such as the 45 mm needle, to access the intramedullary space.

- Distal femur: With the leg straightened and centered in the anterior plane, 1 cm proximal to the patella, and 1 to 2 cm medially.

- Proximal tibia: 1 cm to 2 cm inferior and medial to the tibial tuberosity in the flat portion of the tibia

- Distal tibia: 2 cm proximal to the medial malleolus in the flat portion of the tibia.
