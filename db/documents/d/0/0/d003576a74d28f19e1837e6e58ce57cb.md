The dawn phenomenon is known for early morning hyperglycemia.Â  Other considerations for this clinical presentation must include the Somogyi effect as well as poor glycemic control.

The Somogyi effect (still a matter of debate for some authorities) is the development of rebound hyperglycemia after an episode of hypoglycemia, often induced by excess insulin or inadequate calorie intake with insulin therapy. Exclusion of overnight hypoglycemia by the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is an effective way of ruling this out when evaluating early morning hyperglycemia. When CGM is not available, a fingerstick in early morning hours (between 2-3 am) is recommended and it can provide guidance on the trend of the glucose levels.

Poor glycemic control in the overall picture of diabetes is evident by the persistent elevation of blood glucose levels, without an obvious prominence of early morning hyperglycemia.
