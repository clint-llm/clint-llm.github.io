The anesthesiologist will often encounter patients with cerebral palsy for a variety of surgical procedures. In order to provide exceptional perioperative care, the provider must have advanced knowledge of this group of disorders. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with cerebral palsy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical physical exam findings associated with cerebral palsy.
- Outline the anticipated challenges for airway management in patients with cerebral palsy.
- Identify common intraoperative complications associated with cerebral palsy.
- Summarize anesthetic management considerations taken by the interprofessional team for patients with cerebral palsy.
