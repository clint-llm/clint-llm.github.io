Breath holding spells might be benign, but they can be extremely stressing for caretakers; therefore reassurance and proper explanation is the mainstay of the treatment. If there is an underlying cause such as iron deficiency anemia, it should be addressed, and treatment options considered if these spells interfere with patients' or parents' regular daily activities. Individual therapies, online support groups, and education by the mental health nurse and clinician may be offered to the families.
