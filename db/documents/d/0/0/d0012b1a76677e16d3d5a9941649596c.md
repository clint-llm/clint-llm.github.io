Clinical symptoms of ciguatera toxicity include gastrointestinal and neurological effects. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, gastric upset, belching, and diarrhea, whereas neurological symptoms include headaches, muscle aches, perioral paresthesia, numbness, vertigo, metallic taste in the mouth, blurred vision, ataxia, pruritus, and hallucinations. Severe ciguatera toxicity can cause cold allodynia, which is a perception of a burning sensation on coming in contact with a cold object. Persistent ciguatera toxicity may be misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis due to its symptomatology. Dyspareunia has been reported following sexual intercourse suggesting the toxin may be sexually transmitted. Breastfeeding mothers have reported diarrhea and facial rashes in their infants. This supports the theory that ciguatera toxins are secreted into breast milk. Cardiovascular effects can include bradycardia and hypotension. Cardiac symptoms are only present in the early stages of the toxicity. Alcohol consumption during toxin ingestion has been found to increase the risk of developing bradycardia, hypotension, and altered skin sensation. Signs and symptoms can last from weeks to years and usually most recover with an occasional relapse. Relapse may be triggered by the consumption of alcohol, nuts, seeds, fish, chicken, and eggs.
