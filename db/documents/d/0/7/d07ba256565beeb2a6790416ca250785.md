The type of iris cyst determines the histology seen. Central and mid-zonal iris pigment epithelium cysts comprise heavily pigmented columnar cells and do not transilluminate, whereas peripheral iris pigment epithelium cysts are partly lined by non-pigmented epithelium and usually transilluminate.

Stromal cysts have an epithelial lining that may be made of the stratified squamous epithelium to mono-layered cuboidal cells.

ImplantationÂ cysts require epithelial cells to enter the anterior chamber. These may proliferate to form secondary iris cysts. The classic appearance is of concentric layers of stratified squamous epithelium.
