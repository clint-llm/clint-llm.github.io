Accumulating excessive fluid in the subretinal space between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and neurosensory retina leads to retinal detachment (RD).

There may be a combination of these categories in some cases. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurs when there are retinal tears or holes leading to fluid seeping into the subretinal space.

Exudative retinal detachment occurs when excessive subretinal fluid accumulates in the absence of any retinal breaks or tractional forces.

There is no anatomical adhesion between the retinal pigment epithelium and the neurosensory retina.

Any etiologic factor, whether inflammatory, idiopathic, infectious, surgical, neoplastic, vascular, or drug-induced, can induce ischemic-hypoxic stimuli, leading to the loss of integrity of the blood-retinal barrier.

If diagnosed and treated on time, reasonably good visual acuity can be recovered in patients with exudative retinal detachment.
