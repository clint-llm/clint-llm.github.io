Marcus Gunn pupil (MGP) is the term given to an abnormal pupil showing aberrant pupillary response in certain ocular disorders. In literature, the term is often used synonymously with Marcus Gunn phenomenon or relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD).

An afferent pupillary response is characterized by:

- Constriction of pupils of both eyes when the light stimulus is applied to the normal eye

2. Dilatation of pupils of both eyes when the light stimulus is rapidly transferred from the normal eye (after brief light exposure to the normal eye) to the affected eye.
