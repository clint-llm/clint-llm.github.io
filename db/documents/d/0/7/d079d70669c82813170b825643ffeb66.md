# Continuing Education Activity

Irinotecan is a medication used to manage and treat a variety of solid tumors. It is in the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor class of drugs. Also known as CPT-11, irinotecan is used adjunctively with other therapeutic agents against colorectal cancer as a first- or second-line treatment. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for irinotecan as a valuable agent in treating solid tumors such as colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, and lung cancers. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for healthcare team members in the care of patients who receive treatment with this medication.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of irinotecan.
- Describe the adverse effects associated with irinotecan.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for Irinotecan.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure the optimal therapeutic results with irinotecan resulting in optimal patient outcomes.

# Indications

Irinotecan is a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor that received approval for use in the United States in 1996.Camptotheca acuminate, and is used as a chemotherapy agent against various solid tumors, such as colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, and lung cancers.

**FDA-approved Uses**

**Colorectal Cancer**

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer mortality in the United States. It constitutes about 10% of worldwide cancer deaths.

Capecitabine, the pro-drug of 5-FU, is also combined with irinotecan for a treatment regimen known as XELIRI. There is insufficient supporting evidence to state whether FOLFIRI or XELIRI works better against colorectal cancer.

Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is combined with irinotecan for patients with wild-type K-Ras colorectal tumors.

**Pancreatic Cancer**

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has a poor prognosis due to its late stage of presentation, increased susceptibility to metastasizing, and resistance to treatments. Nanoliposomal irinotecan, combined with 5-FU/leucovorin, was approved for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in October 2015. Nanoliposomal irinotecan allows for better pharmacokinetics and biodistribution due to the drug's encapsulation within liposome-based nanoparticles. Because of how aggressive pancreatic cancer is and how recently the approval of this regimen is, there is no set sequencing of therapy to be considered superior. It is up to the provider and the patient's age and status.

**Non-FDA-approved Uses**

**Ovarian Cancer**

Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States. To treat ovarian cancer, irinotecan is combined with cisplatin, a platinum analog that cross-links DNA. It is still undergoing clinical trials, but early phase I and phase II trials show response rates of 20% to 25% in patients with recurrent or refractory disease.

**Lung Cancer**

The current chemotherapy regimen for small-cell lung cancer is etoposide and cisplatin. Recent studies have been demonstrating the efficacy of irinotecan with cisplatin. Myelosuppression is the most common side effect with either regimen researchers note it to be worse in patients receiving etoposide and cisplatin. Using irinotecan in place of etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor could allow patients to tolerate the regimen longer and thus improve outcomes.

# Mechanism of Action

DNA topoisomerase I is involved in the relaxation of the DNA double helix during replication and transcription.

Irinotecan is a prodrug that inhibits DNA topoisomerase I, acting on the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle.

# Administration

Irinotecan is a hydrophilic compound with a large volume of distribution.

# Adverse Effects

The adverse effects of irinotecan are primarily due to its active metabolite, SN-38. Common adverse effects include neutropenia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, alopecia, and fatigue.

New regimens and administration schedules are under investigation to reduce the adverse effects that cause limitations on irinotecan use.

# Contraindications

Contraindications to irinotecan would involve severe allergic reactions to its group of chemotherapeutic agents, the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitors. Irinotecan is contraindicated in gastric cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis or impaired liver function. If this is the case, paclitaxel is a better alternative to consider.

# Monitoring

The active metabolite of irinotecan, SN-38, is about 100 to 1000-fold more cytotoxic than irinotecan. SN-38 is inactivated by enzymatic conversion through UDP-glucuronosyltransferase into SN-38G.

The monitoring of appropriate concentrations of irinotecan for patients is through total bilirubin levels.

# Toxicity

Life-threatening toxicities can occur even in patients who are in relatively good conditions. When a patient is unable to manage the side effect profile of irinotecan, it limits the therapeutic advantages that come with its use. Most of the irinotecan's side effect profile is due to its active metabolite, SN-38. Researchers have noted higher incidences of toxicity with genetic polymorphisms to the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 gene. A particular polymorphism, UDP1A1*28, decreases the inactivation of SN-38, causing adverse toxic effects.

Among the most common dose-limiting toxicities of irinotecan, commonly shared with the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor group of chemotherapeutic agents, is diarrhea. Diarrhea is most widely noted within 7 to 10 days after treatment and can be life-threatening. High-dose loperamide, a dopamine agonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, is effective against diarrhea caused by irinotecan. It allows the ability to increase doses during chemotherapy to levels that patients can tolerate.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

The use of irinotecan for FDA-approved purposes such as colorectal and pancreatic carcinoma has greatly improved patient longevity. Factors that limit its usage mainly involve dose-limiting toxicities. Irinotecan's appropriate dosing regimen is still unclear, but the medical community has come to a consensus. The goal for the recommended dosing of irinotecan involves limiting side effects but still providing adequate treatment. The use of irinotecan requires the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team to be maximally effective.

To minimize its side effects, there have been attempts to manage drug-limiting diarrhea that can occur in patients. A combination of atropine with irinotecan or loperamide with irinotecan has demonstrated effectiveness in preventing diarrhea in some patients.

Irinotecan therapy requires the focused efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team. Board-certified oncologic pharmacists review dosing, check for interactions and assist with patient education, as well as consult with the oncologist or other ordering clinicians. Oncology nurses administer the medication, monitor for side effects, facilitate communication with the team, and chart their observations for use in making therapeutic decisions in the future. These are but two examples of interprofessional teamwork that can improve patient outcomes; this needs to be the norm in healthcare delivery. [Level 5]

In a study completed at the Gustave Roussy Institute in 2002, the Department of Medicine conducted a study to determine the appropriate dosing of irinotecan in patients with cancer with hyperbilirubinemia. Researchers noted that the dose-limiting toxicities observed in the patients were mainly neutropenia and diarrhea. Patients with high bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels had a reduction in the clearance of irinotecan.

Research has noted that irinotecan works better as a combination therapy. Two main combinations, XELIRI and FOLFIRI, are used to treat colorectal carcinoma. XELIRI is the combination of capecitabine with irinotecan, whereas FOLFIRI is the combination of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan. A meta-analysis in 2014 in China demonstrated that one was not superior to the other.
