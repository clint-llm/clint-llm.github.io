Paget disease occurs when there's an increase in bone resorption that leads to a decrease in bone mass and lytic structures. This process gives rise to osteoblasts from the bone utilizing a sensing system that allows them to increase their activity.

Paget disease pathological process occurs in four stages. Briefly, it begins with osteoclastic activity followed by a hybrid osteoclastic/osteoblastic process. The third stage is where the osteoblastic activity is observed and culminates in the final stage, where malignant degeneration will be seen.

The disease occurs in isolated pockets but is usually progressive. Often there is erythema and warmth over the involved bone due to hypervascularity, which in turn can also lead to high output heart failure.

The disease can affect almost every bone in the skeleton but has an affinity for the long bones, axial skeleton, and skull. The involvement of the feet and hands is very rare.
