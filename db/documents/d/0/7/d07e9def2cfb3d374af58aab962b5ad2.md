SPS is usually prescribed by clinicians, including primary care providers, PAs or NPs, or internists. Since the drug can cause several side effects and is related to several toxicities, all interprofessional healthcare team members should be familiar with its pharmacology. They must be aware of its side effects and toxicities. A proper history and physical examination should take place before the initiation of SPS in any patient. Interprofessional discussion with nephrology, pharmacists, and nursing staff is prudent when considering using SPS as the primary line of therapy for hyperkalemia. The team should monitor the signs-symptoms of toxicity regularly and be ready to initiate any necessary measures if any complications occur. Upon successful management, this interprofessional team should educate the patients about dosing, side effects, and warning signs which may arise in the future. This approach will result in better patient outcomes with fewer adverse events. [Level 5]
