While oxygen saturation refers to the percentage of hemoglobin bound to oxygen within red blood cells, mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) refers to the oxygen content of the blood that returns to the heart after meeting tissue needs. Therefore, mixed venous oxygen saturation is a clinically useful parameter when managing patients in the perioperative period, critical care setting, or presenting with shock pathophysiology. Monitoring mixed venous oxygen has significant value in risk stratification, prognosis, and monitoring to recognize tissue hypoxia in the critically ill. Realistically, it is one among several parameters that should be taken into account when assessing adequate tissue perfusion. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and methodology for measuring mixed venous saturation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with poor tissue perfusion.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the technique for measuring mixed venous oxygen saturation.
- Outline the indications for measuring mixed venous oxygen saturation.
- Review the clinical relevance of mixed venous oxygen saturation.
- Explain the importance of clear communication among interprofessional team members to improve care for patients with abnormal mixed venous oxygen saturation.
