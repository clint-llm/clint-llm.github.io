Muir-Torre syndrome is caused by a genetic defect in mismatch repair genes and is most often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The genes most commonly mutated in Muir-Torre syndrome include MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. More recently, some autosomal recessive cases of Muir-Torre syndrome have been described which do not display microsatellite instability and are due to defects in the base excision repair gene known as MYH. It is estimated that these cases account for roughly 35% of Muir-Torre syndrome cases and have been named MTS II. Sporadic cases also have been described, and these are usually seen in the setting of immunosuppression with tacrolimus and cyclosporine being the main offenders.
