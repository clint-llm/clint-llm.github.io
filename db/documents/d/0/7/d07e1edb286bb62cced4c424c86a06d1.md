In acute rectus femoris muscle injuries, the patient may feel a tearing sensation with abrupt onset of pain. Subacute injuries may present with gradual onset of pain while running. Evaluation of a suspected rectus femoris injuryÂ generally includes imaging (ultrasonography and MRI) to diagnose and monitor the resolution of the injury.

Distal rectus tear is more commonly associated with and involved in quadriceps tendon ruptures; isolated tears are uncommon. Proximal rectus femoris tears are typically managed conservatively initially. Should conservative management fail (exceedingly rare), surgery is a consideration. In keeping with the principles of surgical tendon management, repair of an avulsed tendon involves sewing the tendon into sutures anchored into the bony origin. If the torn tendon has sufficient tissue for surgical sewing, it may be sewn to the tendon stump. If the tendon edges are not suitable for repair or, more commonly, cannot be adequately mobilized (typical in chronic cases). Reconstruction with the use of tendon allografts (i.e., from a cadaver) is usually performed.
