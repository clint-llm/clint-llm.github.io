Connective tissue is the most abundant and diverse type of animal tissue. Animal tissue divides into four basic groups, which include epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, nervous tissue, and connective tissue. Similar to a framework of a house, connective tissue serves to provide structure, support, and protection throughout the human body.
