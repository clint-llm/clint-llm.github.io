Cryptorchidism is a relatively common condition, occurring in up to 9% in full-term infants and can occur in as many as 30% in premature neonates.

Multiple risk factors contribute to the development of UDT. These include twinning, low birth weight, a birth weight that does not correlate appropriately with gestational age, and prematurity. Of these, prematurity is the most significant.

Types:

True undescended testis - The testis is located anywhere in the natural path of descent.

- Retroperitoneal, intrabdominal, in the inguinal canal, at the superior aspect of the scrotum

Ectopic undescended testis - testis is not anywhere along the natural path of descent.

- In the femoral canal

- The opposite scrotum

- Perineum

- In the femoral canal

Hypoplastic - underdeveloped testis

Dysgenetic - derangement of seminiferous tubules and function of testes

Vanished - thought to be due to intrauterine testicular torsion in late gestation.

- It is important to note only 20 to 40% of non-palpable testes are truly absent at the time of surgery.

Ascent - a testis that was in the scrotum but has since returned to the inguinal canal

Retractile - A testis that moves in and out of the scrotum

Acquired - failure of the spermatic cord to grow in proportion to body growth
