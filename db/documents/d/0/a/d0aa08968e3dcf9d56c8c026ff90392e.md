Suboccipital puncture is a procedure that was developed at the beginning of the last century. It was designed to obtain cerebrospinal fluid for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes as an alternative to lumbar puncture. This activity describes suboccipital puncture and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who undergo a suboccipital puncture. The lateral C1-C2 cervical puncture technique is also described in this activity as it serves the same purpose.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for suboccipital puncture and lateral C1-C2 cervical puncture.
- Describe the technique for suboccipital puncture and lateral C1-C2 cervical puncture.
- Outline the most common adverse events associated with a suboccipital puncture and lateral C1-C2 cervical puncture.
- Summarize the risks associated with a suboccipital puncture and lateral C1-C2 cervical puncture.
