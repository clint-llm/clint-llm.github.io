Conduct disorder (CD) is classified in the spectrum of disruptive behavior disorders, which also includes the diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Disruptive behavior disorders (DBD) are frequently comorbid with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is to be noted that ADHD was previously listed in the DBDs spectrum in DSM-IV-TR, but DSM V has moved the diagnosis of ADHD to Neurodevelopmental disorders. ODD can be seen as a precursor to CD. CD is characterized by a pattern of behaviors that demonstrates aggression and violation of the rights of others and evolves over time. Conduct disorder is comorbid with many other psychiatric conditions, including depression, ADHD, learning disorders, and thus a thorough psychiatric evaluation is required to understand the psychopathology before initiating an appropriate treatment plan (American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. 5th ed. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association; 2013; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association; 1994).
