**Initial Care**

Immediate management consists of supporting the airway, breathing, and circulation. Once the patient is stable and if they are visibly contaminated, then the next step involves removing clothes and irrigating the skin with water. Gastric lavage and activated charcoal are not indicated in acute poisoning, according to the American Academy of Toxicology.

Acute gastrointestinal effects may benefit from anti-emetics and rehydration to help correct electrolyte derangements. Initiate cooling mechanisms such as evaporative cooling if severely hyperthermic such as in strychnine poisoning. Cholinergic toxicity may benefit from administering anticholinergic agents such as atropine, glycopyrrolate, and pralidoxime. Further treatment is often mainly supportive.

**Specific Medical Treatment**

Renal replacement therapy

- Includes hemodialysis, continuous renal replacement, or charcoal hemoperfusion for heavy metal poisonings such as thallium, arsenic, or barium

Benzodiazepines

- Indicated for muscle spasms and seizures, especially in strychnine poisoning

British anti-Lewisite

- Used for chelation in acute arsenic poisoning

Meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or 2,3-dimercapto-1-propane sulfonate (DMPS)

- Used for chelation in chronic arsenic poisoning

Sodium sulfate or magnesium sulfate

- Specifically used for acute barium carbonate ingestion rendering it a non-absorbable barium sulfate compound

Nicotinamide (intravenous)

- Used in cases of pyriminil poisoning to replenish NAD and NADH products for cellular energy metabolism

Mineralocorticoids

- Used for orthostatic hypotension in pyriminil poisoning

Digoxin immune fab

- Used for symptomatic treatment of red squill poisoning

Most importantly, clinicians should evaluate and manage patients in consultation with regional poison control or a toxicology resource.
