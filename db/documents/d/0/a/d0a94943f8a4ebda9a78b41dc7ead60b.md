The diagnosis and management of MFS are complex and best done with an interprofessional team that includes the neurologist, internist, intensivist, pulmonologist, physical therapist, ophthalmologist, psychiatrist, infectious disease expert, and ICU nurses. MFS is mainly treated with adequate supportive care, pain control, and respiratory support as needed, and immunotherapy. IVIG or plasmapheresis are the mainstays of therapy. Corticosteroids are no longer recommended and are ineffective in the majority of cases. Most patients require a prolonged stay in the hospital. The prognosis of MFS is usually good with a case fatality of less than 5%. The mean recovery times range from 8 to 12 weeks. Although recurrence may occur, it is uncommon.

After discharge, fatigue remains a common complaint and physical therapy is highly recommended. Pain and limited range of motion will persist in a significant number of patients.
