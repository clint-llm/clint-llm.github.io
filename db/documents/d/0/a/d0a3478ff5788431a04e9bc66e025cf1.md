Dexrazoxane is a medication used in the management and treatment of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity and extravasation injuries. It is in the class of medications known as cardioprotectants. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for dexrazoxane as a valuable agent in the management of cardiotoxicity and anthracycline extravasation leading to tissue damage. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, extravasation injuries and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of dexrazoxane.
- Review the administration of dexrazoxane including dosage adjustments in renal and hepatic impaired patients.
- Identify the adverse effects seen with dexrazoxane use along with the protocols in place as regards to the toxicity of this drug.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients receiving dexrazoxane.
