An interventional cardiologist with experience doing EMBs is required to minimize the risk of complications. Additionally, a skilled interprofessional team of nurses and technologists in the cardiac catheterization lab should be utilized. Interpreting cardiac tissue samples requires knowledge and experience. Cardiac pathologists are specially trained pathologists and interpret histologic samples which stem from EMB or autopsy.
