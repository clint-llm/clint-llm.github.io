The diagnosis of napalm burns is typically clear by history.  However, in the rare situation where a history of exposure is unknown, patients exposed to napalm effects but not burned may present with altered mental status, hypoxia, respiratory collapse, or shock.  The area surrounding the patient’s initial location would show clear signs of combustion. Clinicians should consider carbon monoxide toxicity, carbon dioxide toxicity, cyanide inhalation, and blunt head injury in such patients.
