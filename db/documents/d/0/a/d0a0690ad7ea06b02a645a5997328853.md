Patients with a prolonged QT interval may be first identified by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, internist or pharmacist. It is important to refer these patients to the cardiologist/cardiac surgeon ASAP as the management is complex.

The goal of management is the prevention of lethal arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes (TdP).  The long-term management in congenital Long QT syndrome is with beta-blockers as help prevent ventricular arrhythmias by stabilizing ventricular action potential and helping block sympathetic surges associated with arrhythmias. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is recommended in patients with Long QT syndrome who were resuscitated from a cardiac arrest.

It is important for the pharmacist to keep a track of patient medications because many can cause prolonged QT syndrome. The nurses should inform the patient to follow up with the cardiologist or primary care provider and undergo regular ECGs to ensure that the condition is under control. With an interprofessional healthcare team approach, QT prolongation can be both prevented or treated appropriately when present. [Level 5]
