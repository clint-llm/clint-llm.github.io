Bronchogenic are rare lesions. In children, they often tend to be symptomatic, but in adults, they are often an incidental finding. However, because their diagnosis and management are not straightforward, the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a radiologist, pediatrician, thoracic surgeon, and a pulmonologist. Specialty trained nurses in perianesthesia, operating room, and critical care work with the team to monitor patients, communicate with the patient's families, and provide feedback about issues in care.
