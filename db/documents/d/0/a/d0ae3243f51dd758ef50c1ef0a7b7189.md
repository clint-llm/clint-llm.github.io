Although rare with statins, rhabdomyolysis is a serious and potentially fatal complication. Rhabdomyolysis is the most severe form of myotoxicity and can occur with the administration of any statin. Patient risk factors that may predispose an individual to develop statin-induced rhabdomyolysis include low body mass index, advanced age, female sex, hypothyroidism, hypertension, polypharmacy, and alcohol or drug use disorder. Although rhabdomyolysis can occur with monotherapy, it is more likely to occur when combined with other drugs. Data about this toxicity primarily comes from individual case studies and shows that statins, including fluvastatin, are the most common cause of statin-related rhabdomyolysis when combined with fibrates. Individual case studies also show that statins combined with antifungals, macrolides, fusidic acid, cyclosporin, protease inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers increase the risk for rhabdomyolysis. In addition, cases of myopathy have been reported during postmarketing experience with concomitant administration of fluvastatin and colchicine.

Additionally, clinicians should rapidly assess the patient’s renal function (serum creatinine, urine myoglobin) and CPK levels. Rhabdomyolysis is managed with intravenous rehydration and, in severe cases, dialysis.
