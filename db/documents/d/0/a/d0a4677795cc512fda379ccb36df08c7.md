The lesions of lichen striatus begin as small pink, flesh-colored, or red spots, which may be raised. Over the course of approximately 1 to 2 weeks, these spots begin to join to form a dull, red, linear band. These lines can be lightly scaly. The band itself is often about 2 mm to 2 cm in width and a few centimeters in length, or as long as the limb it affects. At times, 2 parallel bands can be seen side by side. Typically, these are observed on 1 of the major extremities, such as an arm or a leg, but may also be seen on the neck, buttock, or trunk region of the body. Slight or intense itching is frequently the only accompanying symptom. Though less common, nails can also be affected with or without the presence of skin lesions and may become thick, ridged, split, or possibly fall off.
