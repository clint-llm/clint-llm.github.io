Before performing an alloplastic chin augmentation procedure, it is important to perform a thorough preoperative assessment and identify any potential risk factors specific to the patient. A team approach is always ideal to ensure the procedure is performed to the highest possible standards. Prior to surgery, the patient should have the following done:

- Evaluation by a surgeon experienced in selecting the appropriate patient for the surgery.

- Evaluation by primary care physician, anesthesiologist, and nurse anesthetist to ensure that the patient is fit for general anesthesia (if applicable).

- Evaluation and monitoring by the preoperative and postoperative specialty nurses to assist with coordination of care and patient education.

An interprofessional team consisting of personnel experienced in chin implantation (e.g., surgeon, anesthesiologist, surgical assistants, operative nurses, etc.) should perform the alloplastic chin implantation for the best outcomes. If performed in the clinic, a nurse fully dedicated to monitoring the patient (particularly if using sedation) is strongly recommended. A close follow-up should be scheduled in the post-operative period to ensure there are no signs of infection, hematoma, or rejection that occur. The patient should also be educated on avoiding strenuous activity, heavy lifting, or stooping over within the first week post-operatively to prevent complications. By following these basic steps, outcomes should be favorable when performing alloplastic chin implantation.
