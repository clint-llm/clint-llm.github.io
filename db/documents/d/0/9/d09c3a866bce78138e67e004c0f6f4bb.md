**Calculating the RhIg Dosage**

The following calculations should be used to determine an additional number of vials of Rho(D) immune globulin needed if the KB test is positive, indicating a large amount of FMH. One vial contains 300 mcg and will protect against 30 mL of fetal blood.

Volume (mL) of fetal blood = Percentage of fetal cells x 50

Number of Vials of 300 mcg RhIG required= Volume of fetal blood/30 mL

Combining equations: Number of vials* = Percentage of fetal cells x 50 / 30

* If the number to the right of the decimal point is less than 5, **round down**and add one vial.

* If the number to the right of the decimal point is greater than or equal to 5, **round up**and add one vial.

Example 1:  If 2.9% of fetal cells are reported on KB, what dose of RhIG would be required?

- Volume of fetal blood:  2.9 x 50 = 145 mL

- Number of vials = 145 mL/30 = 4.83

- The decimal is greater than 5, therefore round up and add 1 vial (5+1).

- Answer: 6 vials

Example 2:  If 2.6% of fetal cells are reported on KB, what dose of RhIG would be required?

- Volume of fetal blood: 2.6% x 50 = 130 mL

- Number of vials = 130 mL/30 = 4.33

- The decimal is less than 5, therefore round down and add 1 vial (4+1).

- Answer: 5 vials
