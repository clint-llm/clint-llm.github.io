During the third and fourth weeks, the ventral side of the embryonic plate begins to fold, creating the anterolateral and anterior abdominal wall. The embryonic plate undergoes four folds: the cephalad, caudad, and two lateral folds. The lateral folds are responsible for the anterior abdominal wall, ultimately joining at the ventral ring by the end of the fourth week. The muscles arise from the mesodermal layer. The nerves extend from the origins of the spinal cord, creating dermatomes along the trackÂ through which it travels. These dermatomes will change shape and distribution as the fetus elongates after the initial embryonic plate folding.
