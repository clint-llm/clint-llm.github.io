Right heart catheterization is an invasive hemodynamic procedure that allows direct measurement of right-sided cardiac pressures and calculation of cardiac output. This activity describes the right heart catheterization and describes its indications, contraindications, clinical importance, and explains the role of the interprofessional team for patients who undergo right heart catheterization.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications for a right heart catheterization.
- Summarize the technique of right heart catheterization.
- Explain the clinical relevance of right heart catheterization.
- Outline how an interprofessional team can improve outcomes for patients undergoing right heart catheterization.
