Long-term outcomes of CSX may be determined by typical disease characteristics such as chest pain, poor intracoronary microvascular response to acetylcholine (Ach), the severity of endothelial dysfunction, and ischemia of the myocardium.

The intensity of CSX symptoms is reported to reduce in 30% of subjects but may progressively worsen in approximately 20% of patients over time.

Progressive disease comprises regular and lengthy anginal chest pains that manifest at decreased exertion levels and may even occur at rest. Some subjects may also experience a disease course resistant to pharmacological management, which further diminishes the quality of life. Patients with a progressive disease course may require drastic diagnostics that could lead to functional disability.
