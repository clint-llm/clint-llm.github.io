While some simple, superficial patterns of hand infections may be managed by primary care or emergency physicians in an outpatient setting, it is essential to recognize that certain pathology may require an interdisciplinary approach. There should exist a low threshold for the primary care or emergency medicine physician to provide referral or consultation to a hand surgeon for further management. Furthermore, depending upon the etiology of the infection and microorganism susceptibilities, consultation with an infectious disease specialist may help determine the optimal antimicrobial regimen. In cases of immunocompromised patients or in dealing with drug-resistant organisms, an interprofessional approach may be necessary to ensure appropriate patient care.
