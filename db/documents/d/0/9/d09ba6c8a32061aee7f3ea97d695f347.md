There is some documentation of increased risk of deep vein thrombosis, embolic cerebrovascular accident, and pulmonary embolism with the usage of this drug. Patients developing new-onset vaginal bleeding will need workup, including endometrial biopsy and OB/GYN consultation. There are some reports of an increased risk of death due to a cerebrovascular accident in trials of postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease or with high-risk factors for coronary arterial disease.

In an 8-week clinical study, 63 postmenopausal women safely tolerated 600Â mg raloxifene daily. No death associated with raloxifene overdose has been reported in postmarketing spontaneous reports. One patient overdosed with raloxifene 1.5 grams was reported. Adverse reactions (mainly leg cramps and dizziness) were reported in approximately half of the adults who took more than 180 mg raloxifene. Overdose toxicity was reported with 180 mg raloxifene in two 18-month-old children. Reported adverse reactions include vomiting, ataxia, diarrhea, dizziness, rash, flushing, tremor, and elevated alkaline phosphatase. There is no specific antidote for raloxifene.
