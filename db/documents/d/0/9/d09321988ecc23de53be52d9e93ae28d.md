The well-known side effect related to niacin is flushing, most commonly in the face, arms, and chest, which typically occurs within 30 minutes of ingestion and abates after 60 minutes.

Niacin can also cause serious hepatoxicity that ranges from a mild elevation of liver enzymes to acute liver failure. The hepatocellular injury pattern is more common than the cholestatic damage pattern. Clinical manifestations are jaundice, itching, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Early in the course of liver injury, transaminase levels can elevate significantly but may normalize with the removal of the offending agent. The thought is that there is a direct toxic effect similar to acute hepatic necrosis. Biopsy has revealed centrilobular necrosis. The severity of toxicity seems to be dose-dependent and more commonly involves sustained-release (SR) preparations.

Niacin associated hepatotoxicity is generally related to ingestions of around 3 grams per day.  In contrast, the more common symptom of flushing can occur at doses as low as 30 mg per day. Niacin is broken down in the liver via two pathways. One pathway has a low binding capability but can handle a lot of nicotinic acid substrate as it conjugates it with lysine into nicotinuric acid, which triggers the prostaglandin mediated flushing. The other pathway binds stronger to the substrate that it encounters. It is easily overwhelmed, and its by-products build up to damage the liver. This route processes the sustained release form.
