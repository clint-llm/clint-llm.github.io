Contraindications to cystoscopy are relatively straightforward. If there is any evidence of acute urinary infection, the procedure would be contraindicated as it could put the patient at risk for developing sepsis from a urinary source. For this reason, it is recommended to obtain a urinalysis 5 to 7 days before any scheduled cystoscopy procedure. If a UTI is identified, the patient should be treated appropriately before the procedure. A contraindication for flexible cystoscopy in the office would be any intolerance to pain or discomfort with the procedure. This may necessitate a trip to the operating room (OR) for cystoscopy under anesthesia. A urethral stricture can sometimes make cystoscopy impossible, as the scope will not be able to pass.
