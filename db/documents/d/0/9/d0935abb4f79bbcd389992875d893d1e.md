There are several possible theories about the mechanism that results in the development of Dieulafoy lesions and their complications. The three main theories include the following:

- Pulsations of an abnormally large artery may disrupt the mucosal surface leading to exposure of the artery to the bowel contents resulting in mechanical and chemical erosion and bleeding

- Wear and tear of the gastric mucosa may lead to arterial thrombus formation resulting in necrosis and bleeding.

- Age-related gastric mucosal atrophy

Several factors appear to trigger the rupture of the tortuous vessel, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tobacco, alcohol, and peptic ulcer disease (PUD); however, there is no proven association yet.
