Cerebellar infarcts represent only about 2% of all strokes, but they account for a disproportionate share of resulting morbidity and mortality. In one study of almost 2000 consecutive stroke patients, cerebellar strokes had nearly twice the mortality rate (23%) of more common cerebral strokes (12.5%), with brainstem strokes falling in between (17%).
