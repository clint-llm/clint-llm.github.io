The care of children receiving LA begins with the professional placing the LA, whether noninvasive, invasive, one-time dose or continuous infusion. Interprofessional communication is key in providing the first level of protection for children receiving LA. That begins with a minimum of two people checking the drug, dose, route, and site of administration, patient allergy profile, and patient weight. (see Tables 1-4) This could be the pharmacist and physician, the anesthesiologist and CRNA, or the nurse on the floor with a nursing colleague. This type of interprofessional teamwork enhances patient-centered care. [Level 5]

Next, one must know the local anesthetic that has been given to appropriately monitor for adequate analgesic effect and maintain vigilance for signs and symptoms of adverse effects and LAST.  Institutions should develop a standard handoff that details the local anesthetic used, the method and timing of the administration of the local anesthetic, and the expected analgesic effect and duration. Signs and symptoms of toxicity should be reviewed. Prompt recognition and treatment of LAST can prevent potentiation of LAST. [Level 1]

Monitoring provides the third level of protection for children receiving LA. Non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and electrocardiogram are the minimum required mechanical monitors.

The last level of protection for pediatric patients receiving LA is to implement an institutional, educational program that involves an annual review of local anesthetics, their effects, their potential adverse effects, and ultimately the treatment of LAST.  It would improve team performance to have a system for routine simulations that reviews the treatment and management of LAST in children. For example, vasopressin, beta-adrenergic blockers, and calcium channel blockers should be avoided in the treatment of cardiac arrest (Level 3).
