As mentioned previously, the fastigial nucleus is involved in axial along with proximal motor control. Studies involving patients with lesions in the fastigial nucleus have found that these patients lose control in the muscles of the axial and trunk regions in antigravity posture.

Afferents involving serotonin and histamine have also been shown to be involved in fastigial nucleus-related motor behavior. For instance, serotonin and histamine have excitatory outcomes on the fastigial nucleus.
