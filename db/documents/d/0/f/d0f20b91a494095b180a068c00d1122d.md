An M-plasty is a useful technique for shortening the expected final scar length of an excision.

Additionally, an M-plasty may be used to remove dog ears created by flaps. M-plasties can be added to either one or both ends of an incision to shorten a wound. Although M-plasties decrease the length of a scar, they increase its width by adding a fork to the end. This compromise may be cosmetically less noticeable than long, linear scars in some cases. For example, large tumors on the back may be less noticeable with an M-plasty on each end when compared to a longer, straight repair. The main goal of the M-plasty is to take an excision that would otherwise extend across cosmetic unit boundaries and keep the incision within a single unit.

Lastly, the use of the M-plasty has also been described for the orientation of pathological specimens, an application that may conserve suture and tissue at the same time.
