There have been a few small volunteer trials on medications to relieve the symptoms of mosquito bites. Today it is suggested that cetirizine (10 mg by mouth) can reduce itching and swelling as a result of bites. In the only pediatric-focused study, 0.3 mg/kg of loratadine was also found to be effective. In some studies, starting medications prophylactically before exposure can prevent symptoms.

There is a need for more clinical trials to explore the efficacy of topical glucocorticoids and leukotriene receptor antagonists. In other insect bites, topical glucocorticoids have demonstrated effectiveness and thus have recommendations for use for more severe mosquito bites. In severe and substantial reactions it may be prudent to start oral glucocorticoids, as one would with other urticarias.
