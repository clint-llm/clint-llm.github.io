Patients should be educated that the virus can spread to other parts of their body or to other people via direct contact. Viral shedding is present until the epidermal lesion is healed, so patients should be counseled on the importance of wearing gloves or another protective barrier. The patient should also be counseled that the chance of recurrence is about 30% to 50%.
