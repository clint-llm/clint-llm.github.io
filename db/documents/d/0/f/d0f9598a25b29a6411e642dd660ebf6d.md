Coronary artery calcification is frequently encountered during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Calcified plaque poses numerous challenges to successful percutaneous coronary intervention. Stent delivery and optimal stent expansion become more difficult with a calcified plaque. Procedural complications and long-term adverse outcomes are worse and closely correlated with increasing severity of coronary artery calcification. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of calcified plaque lesions and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the evaluation of calcified plaque in coronary vessels.
- Summarize the treatment of calcified plaques in coronary vessels and the unique challenges they present.
- Review the prognosis of patients with calcified plaques in coronary vessels.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes for patients with calcified plaque lesions in their coronary arteries.
