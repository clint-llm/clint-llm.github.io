Clinically, various phenotypes of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita have been described. The classic presentation is a non-inflammatory mechanobullous disease characterized by skin fragility, tense blisters, erosions, scarring, milia formation, and post-inflammatory dyspigmentation. These findings are localized to trauma-prone sites and extensor surfaces, such as the elbows, knees, dorsal hands, and feet.

The inflammatory variants of EBA resemble other autoimmune bullous dermatoses and include bullous pemphigoid (BP)-like EBA, mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP)-like EBA, linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD)-like EBA, and Brunsting-Perry cicatricial pemphigoid-like EBA.

BP-like EBA features widespread pruritic tense vesicles and bullae on an erythematous base, commonly involving the trunk, intertriginous areas, and extremities. Oral mucosa may be involved in approximately 50% of cases, with erosions or intact vesicles in the mouth. The lesions heal without milia or scars.

MMP-like EBA is characterized by predominant involvement of mucous membranes, with lesions and scarring most commonly in the mouth, upper esophagus, conjunctivae, anus, and vagina.

LABD-like EBA presents with tense vesicles, blisters, and urticarial plaques in an annular or polycyclic pattern, with mucous membrane involvement.

Brunsting–Perry cicatricial pemphigoid-like EBA features a vesiculobullous eruption localized to the head and neck with minimal to no involvement of mucous membranes. Involvement of the scalp results in scarring alopecia.

Patients may present with one of these subtypes alone or a combination of two subtypes simultaneously. Conversion of clinical features from one variant to another during the disease has been reported.
