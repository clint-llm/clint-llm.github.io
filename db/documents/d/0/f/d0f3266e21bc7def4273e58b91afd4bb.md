Usual imaging for parathyroid glands includes ultrasound and CT. Ectopic parathyroid glands are not readily visible with ultrasound, so technetium-sestamibi CT scanning may be a diagnostic option which has high sensitivity and specificity for parathyroid adenomas.

Ectopic parathyroid management requires close collaboration with an interdisciplinary team that includes the family physician, specialists, nursing staff, and pharmacists; this interprofessional team approach best leads to optimal patient management and clinical results. [Level V]
