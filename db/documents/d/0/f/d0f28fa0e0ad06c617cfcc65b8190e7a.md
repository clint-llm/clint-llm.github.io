Tetracaine is rarely used today outside of topical applications for short ENT and ophthalmologic procedures. It has been studied on rat models and found to function via a dose-dependent inhibition of intracellular calcium release through ryanodine receptors. This pharmacology has not been studied in humans but may be of some interest as this mechanism is similar to that of dantrolene to treat malignant hyperthermia.

For a successful outcome, the entire interprofessional healthcare team, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), specialists, nurses, and pharmacists, should work in a coordinated fashion to safely use tetracaine and monitor for side effects. This will result in more effective anesthesia and fewer adverse events with better patient outcomes. [Level 5]
