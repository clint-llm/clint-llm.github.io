When the olecranon bursa is inflamed and tender, interfering with the patient's ability to lean on their elbows, drainage of the bursa is important to determine etiology. Treatment will depend upon precise etiology.

Even though the patient may have had a prior episode of olecranon bursitis, the current episode, unless precisely stereotypical of prior events, does not diagnose the current episode. In other words, having had previous traumatic olecranon bursitis in no way rules out a current infectious etiology.

The prime indications and purposes for drainage of an olecranon bursa are:

- Diagnostic evaluation

- Symptomatic relief

- Therapeutic intervention
