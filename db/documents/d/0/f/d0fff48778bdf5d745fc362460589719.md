Hyperacusis is a difficult condition to manage.Â The lack of formal clinical guidelines reinforces the importance of working closely with the interprofessional team, and clinicians are encouraged to collaborate with researchers to advance the understanding of hyperacusis and improve patient outcomes.

Successful patient outcomes rely on input from a large interprofessional team with an effective professional-patient relationship. Many patients are successfully managed in the community, however, for those with especially troubling symptoms, a referral may be made to an otolaryngologist. The otolaryngologist will be involved in the initial evaluation of the hyperacusic patient and will work closely with several other professionals, including audiologists, specialist nurses, and clinical psychologists. In select cases, radiologists, neurosurgeons, and maxillofacial surgeons may be involved in the care of a patient with hyperacusis. These professionals rely on having an accurate and comprehensive workup by the otolaryngologist. The audiologist is an expert in audiometric testing, namely pure-tone audiometry, which is vital for diagnostic purposes. Specialist nurses are often used for education and information provision, and the clinical psychologist is essential for the delivery of CBT.
