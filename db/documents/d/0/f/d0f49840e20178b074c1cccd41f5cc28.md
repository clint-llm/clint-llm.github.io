Kaposi sarcoma is subdivided into four groups: classic, endemic, immunosuppressed, and AIDS-related (also called epidemic).

Angiosarcomas are rare malignancies consisting of anaplastic vascular or lymphatic cells that invade local structures. Angiosarcomas are very rare, with 1% to 2% of all head and neck sarcomas being angiosarcomas.
