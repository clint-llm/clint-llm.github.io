Interactions between three different organ systems are necessary for ovulation and the subsequent BBT fluctuations seen around the physiologic process. The hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis is the foundation of menstrual cycles in women. The hypothalamus, a unique endocrine organ that secretes neurohormones, releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in a pulsatile fashion. GnRH then acts on the anterior pituitary gland to release LH and FSH.
