The duochrome test is a valuable method to quickly and correctly ascertain the spherical value of an eye. The technique is simple, and results tend to be close to the eventual spherical endpoint. It is possible to train a member of the interprofessional healthcare team other than theÂ clinician to carry out this test correctly. A properly trained healthcare team can assist the clinician in performing the test when managing patients, which can help to reduce waiting times in the clinic in addressing the refractive needs of the patients.
