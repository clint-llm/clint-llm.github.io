The Jarisch Herxheimer Reaction (JHR) is a transient and reversible condition that can be clinically diagnosed with proper history and physical examination. However, there are reports of lymphopenia, polymorphonuclear leucocytosis, and raised ESR on laboratory analysis. Usually, no investigation is mandated but if an unexpected reaction to an antibiotic occurs in a patient with risk factors, then a serological test for syphilis is required.
