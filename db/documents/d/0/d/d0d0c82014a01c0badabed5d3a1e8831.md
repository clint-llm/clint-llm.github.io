The cervical spine functions as bony protection of the spinal cord as it exits the cranium. Despite the presence of seven cervical vertebrae, there are eight pairs of cervical nerves, termed C1 to C8. C1 through C7 exit the spine cranially to its associated vertebrae, while C8 exits caudally to C7.

Direct innervation of the spinal column is highly complex, yet three discrete innervation sources have been identified in the ventral compartment of the cervical spine. These include branches of the sympathetic trunk, the sympathetic rami communicantes, and the perineural vascular plexus of the vertebral arteries. Meanwhile, the posterior aspect of the cervical spine receives innervation by the medial branch of the posterior primary rami. Coursing through the intervertebral foramen with the vertebral arteries, the vertebral nerves are thought to supply additional sympathetic innervation.
