NODAT outcome is affected by different factors, including the type of organ transplant, age, obesity, other cardiovascular risk factors, and immunosuppressants. Studies show a higher mortality rate in patients with NODAT compared to those with type 2 DM. NODAT decreases patient survival by increasing both cardiovascular events and the risk of infections. NODAT is associated with a higher prevalence of rejection and post-transplant renal failure. Studies showed that graft survival in patients with NODAT was 48%, while it was 70% in a patient without NODAT. Also, studies demonstrate that in kidney transplant recipients, cardiovascular events are 2 to 3 fold more in NODAT in comparison with other patients. Additionally, diabetic microvascular complications develop rapidly in patients with NODAT than traditional DM.
