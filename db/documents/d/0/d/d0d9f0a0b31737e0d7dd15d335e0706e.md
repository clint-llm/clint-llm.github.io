Today the management of obesity has become more and more complicated as the incidence of obesity rises, and the comorbidities associated with it do as well. Now more then ever, the management of obesity requires interprofessional communication. Care coordination between nurses, physicians, extenders, surgeons, pharmacists, and primary care providers can enhance patient-centered care and reduce the incidence of obesity using education, a healthy diet, and exercise. The preventative measure can work if patients are held accountable by the health care team and are compliant. It's important that patients to understand that bariatric surgery does not cure obesity and that weight loss is not always guaranteed. Patients must be educated that without lifestyle change there is a risk that they can gain the weight back after bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery has been shown to help lose weight which leads to better glucose control and lowering of cholesterol.
