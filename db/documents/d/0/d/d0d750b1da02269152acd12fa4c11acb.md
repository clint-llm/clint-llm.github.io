Iron is essential for the production of hemoglobin. The depletion of iron stores may result from blood loss, decreased intake, impaired absorption, or increased demand. Iron-deficiency anemia could arise from occult gastrointestinal bleeding. Adults older than 50 years of age with iron-deficiency anemia and gastrointestinal bleeding need to be evaluated for malignancy. However, gastrointestinal diagnostic evaluation fails to establish a cause in one-third of patients assessed. Iron deficiency will lead to microcytic hypochromic anemia on the peripheral blood smear. Because iron is the most common single-nutrient deficiency, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends supplementation. When to begin supplementation and the needed dosage depends on the age and diet of the child.
