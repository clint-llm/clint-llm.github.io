The venous system of the upper extremity has many variations. The network of interconnecting veins occurs at many different points. The connections between the deep veins and the superficial veins exist at many variable sites. The only consistency is that the upper extremity's veins eventually drain back into the superior vena cava via the subclavian veins.
