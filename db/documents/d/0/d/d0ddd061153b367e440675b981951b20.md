Early and correct diagnosis is essential. This involves the recognition of a patient with an acute abdomen, proper resuscitation with antibiotics, crystalloid fluids, pain control and correction of other concurrent conditions. The interprofessional team should include emergency room physicians, general surgeons, specialty trained nurses, and pharmacists. The nursing staff must closely monitor patients for clinical deterioration, including hypotension. Pharmacists evaluate medical treatment and asses for drug-drug interactions. Communication between team members will improve outcomes. Proper treatment must involve the surgical team at presentation to ensure expedient surgical intervention which is the best predictor of improving morbidity and mortality.
