Menorrhagia, or abnormal uterine bleeding (which is the preferred terminology), can be classified into nine categories making up the PALM-COEIN acronym. This table divides AUB into structural and non-structural causes:

- Polyp

- Adenomyosis

- Leiomyoma

- Malignancy and hyperplasia

- Coagulopathy

- Ovulatory dysfunction due to hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, prolactin-secreting tumors, PCOS

- Endometrial

- Iatrogenic (IUDs, chemotherapeutic agents, anticoagulants)

- Not yet classified

It is essential for the provider to choose the most likely etiology for the effective and appropriate management of these women.
