Hemodialysis initiation is needed for acute illness associated with:

- Acute kidney injury

- Uremic encephalopathy

- Pericarditis

- Life-threatening hyperkalemia

- Refractory acidosis

- Hypervolemia causing end-organ complications (e.g., pulmonary edema)

- Failure to thrive and malnutrition

- Peripheral neuropathy

- Intractable gastrointestinal symptoms

- Asymptomatic patients with a GFR of 5 to 9 mL/min/1.73 m²

- Any toxic ingestion

These conditions cause dysregulation and impaired clearance of cytokines (immune response modulators), causing vasodilation, cardiac depression, and immunosuppression leading to end-organ damage, hemodynamic instability, or delaying renal recovery. RRT enhances cytokine removal in high-cytokine states like sepsis. There is potential harm arising from catheter complications, electrolyte disturbances, and intradialytic hypotension.

The National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) has provided the guidelines (2015 update) for hemodialysis adequacy.

It recommends that patients who reach CKD stage 4 (GFR, 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2), and those with an imminent need for maintenance dialysis during the initial assessment, should be counseled about renal failure and the treatment options (kidney transplantation, hemodialysis at home or in-center, PD) and conservative treatment. Family members and caregivers should also be educated. The decision to initiate maintenance dialysis should be based on an assessment of signs and symptoms of renal failure (pruritus, acid-base or electrolyte abnormalities, serositis), volume or BP dysregulation, and a progressive deterioration in nutritional status despite dietary intervention or impairment in cognition. The decision to initiate dialysis should not be based on the level of kidney function in an asymptomatic individual.

Cardiac conditions requiring dialysis are arrhythmias due to electrolyte derangements, uremic pericarditis, and fluid overload due to severe congestive heart failure precipitated by suboptimal kidney function. After structural cardiac abnormalities, electrolyte (calcium, magnesium, and potassium) derangements are the most common arrhythmias. Metabolic acidosis and decreased renal excretion in chronic kidney disease or renal failure patients lead to potassium abnormalities. Iatrogenic causes in cardiac patients are an improper use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, and aldosterone antagonists. In renal failure patients, elevated urea levels can also lead to uremic pericarditis. Patients with CKD and heart failure experience fluid retention, which leads to worsening heart failure and pulmonary edema.
