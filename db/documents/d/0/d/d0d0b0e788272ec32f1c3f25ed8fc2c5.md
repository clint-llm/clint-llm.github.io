Acute kidney injury can occur in patients with preexisting chronic renal failure, therefore it is crucial to make every effort to preclude all the reversible factors. The best indicator of reversibility is the rate at which the renal function declines, for instance, accelerated worsening of renal function should prompt the search for the cause. Differentials to be considered in AKI include:

- Renal calculi

- Sickle cell anemia

- Chronic renal failure

- Dehydration

- Gastrointestinal bleeding

- Heart failure

- Urinary tract infection

- Protein overloading

- Diabetic ketoacidosis

- Urinary obstruction
