The healthcare of CAWs is not overly streamlined or consistent. CAW health evaluations are routinely performed by either occupational or Undersea & Hyperbaric Medicine physicians and those practicing primary care.  OSHA states that physicians caring for CAWs need only have "experience" in working with those subjected to the extremes of atmospheric pressure.  The OSHA policies regarding CAWs are clearly outdated, non-specific, and in need of significant revision.

Although needed, there are no significant new clinical trials ongoing to evaluate the risks to CAWs.  Studies in saturation divers are few and have relied on brief communications about diver self-reporting.
