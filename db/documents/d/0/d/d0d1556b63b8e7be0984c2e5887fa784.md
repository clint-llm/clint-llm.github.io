FollowingÂ intravenous access and the injection of the appropriate radiopharmaceutical, an uptake phase occurs. During the uptake phase, the radiotracer will biodistribute to its intended target and wash out from background tissues, allowing optimal imaging. Uptake times vary based on the radiotracer and indication. The PET radiopharmaceutical is a positron emitter and, once injected, will biodistribute in tissues where it will interact with electrons. This interaction phenomenon is called an annihilation phenomenon, as the positron will annihilate with the electron and produce two 511 KeV photons that travel in two opposite directions at 180 degrees.
