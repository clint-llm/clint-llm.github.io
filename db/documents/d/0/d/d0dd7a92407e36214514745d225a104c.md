The severity of the disease depends upon the duration and intensity of exposure. More intense contact for a long period of time has a poor prognosis. Early intervention after the first symptom has a good outcome and prolongs survival. The condition worsens in acute exacerbations and superimposed infections. Radiologic screening in workers helps in picking the earliest abnormal changes.
