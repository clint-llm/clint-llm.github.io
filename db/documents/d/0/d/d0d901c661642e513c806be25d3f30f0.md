FMF is a genetic disease. A diary of the attack's frequency and symptoms should be maintained for review by the healthcare providers. Colchicine has been shown to reduce the severity of the attack and prevent amyloidosis. Amyloidosis can lead to fatal complications. Adherence to colchicine therapy is equally important. The patient should notify their provider of any compliance issues due to the side effects.
