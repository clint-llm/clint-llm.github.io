The dominant blood supply to the mandible derives from the inferior alveolar artery. The inferior alveolar artery travels within the mandibular foramen. As the inferior alveolar artery travels within the mandibular foramen, it will perfuse the mandible. The inferior alveolar vein is the venous drainage system for the mandible.

The lymphatic drainage of the mandible directs toward the submental or the submandibular lymph nodes. These lymph nodes will eventually drain their contents back into the central circulation via the right lymphatic duct or the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct will empty the lymph fluid from the left side of the mandible while the right lymphatic duct will drain the lymph fluid from the right side of the mandible.
