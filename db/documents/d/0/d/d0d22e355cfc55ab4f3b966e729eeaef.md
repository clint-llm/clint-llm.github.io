The mechanism of PCA strokes are variable and include large artery disease, small artery disease, atherothrombosis of PCA, BA and VA, embolism (cardiac, aortic, coagulopathy), dissection, hemorrhagic, migraine, Moyamoya disease, fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), mitochondrial disease, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia (VBD), and vasculitis as well as central nervous system (CNS) infections. The most common causes are still atherosclerosis, embolism, and small artery disease.

- Thromboses, that are generated from atherosclerotic arteries (VA, BA, and proximal PCA), is the main pathology of large artery disease. A study of 79 patients with infarcts in one or more cortical territories of the PCA shows 25 (32%) patients with proximal arterial disease. VA atherosclerosis is the most common cause with 18 patients including extracranial and intracranial, followed by 4 patients in the BA.

- Studies are lacking that show small artery disease as a cause of PCA infarcts. Lacunar infarction was the most frequent stroke subtype 80/232 (34.5%) in the Sagrat Cor Hospital of Barcelona Stroke Registry during 19 years between 1986 and 2004.

- A cardiac embolism is the most common etiology of embolism. It includes valvular disease, atrial fibrillation (the most common etiology of cardiac embolism), left atrial or ventricular thrombus, dilated cardiomyopathy, patent foramen ovale (PFO), and congestive heart failure. A cardiac embolism is a reason for pure PCA infarcts in 58/122 (48%).

- A VA dissection is reported to occur more often than PCA dissection.

- The diagnosis of a migrainous stroke is challenging. Studies show that PCA strokes may be due to a migraine, but patients typically have thrombotic arterial occlusions or PFO. A study of 117 patients with strokes in the superficial territory of the PCA included 4 patients (3.4%) with a history of migraines.

- Intracranial involvement in the setting of FMD is a rare condition. FMD of the basilar artery presented with multiple cerebral infarctions which included the PCA territory.

- Patients with the syndrome of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) typically have mutations at the base pair 3243 (A3243G) of their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Four young patients were diagnosed with clinical and molecular evidence of mitochondrial disease (mtDNA:3243) in a study with 38 patients with occipital stroke (18 to 45 years old).

- Dolichoectasia means elongation and distension. Vertebrobasilar Dolichoectasia (VBD) is another occasional cause of PCA stroke.
