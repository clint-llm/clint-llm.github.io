Trisomy 13 is a chromosomal aneuploidy****originally described by Patau et al. in 1960.

Trisomy 13 arises from the nondisjunction of germ cells during meiosis I or II of either parental cells.

Phenotypic findings in trisomy 13 are associated with patterns of congenital anomalies and mental disabilities incompatible with life.
