In the context ofÂ hepatic encephalopathy management, there are multiple decision-making steps involved to ensure the best form of patient care. These would range from the mode of administration of lactulose (either orally, rectally or via a nasogastric tube), the monitoring of the number of bowel movements to achieve the required frequency of 2-3 stools per day.

Communication between the physicians, pharmacists, and the nursing staff is of paramount importance to monitor frequent changes in mental status and accurately measure stool output. In certain situations, dose titration of the lactulose may also be required to prevent dehydration, diarrhea, and excoriation of the anal skin, requiring pharmaceutical intervention. Patients in the ICU who would require lactulose administered via an NG tube would need physical positioning designed to decrease the odds of aspiration.
