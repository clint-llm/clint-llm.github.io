Given early identification and management in a timely manner, the prognosis for diphenhydramine toxicity or overdose is good. Recovery is likely; however, complications may occur from prolonged hospital stays, such as pneumonia. Therefore, patients may be considered for discharge if they remain asymptomatic beyond four hours of diphenhydramine oral exposure or eight hours if dermal exposure. However, a patient may be admitted if they display moderate to severe signs of anticholinergic toxicity.
