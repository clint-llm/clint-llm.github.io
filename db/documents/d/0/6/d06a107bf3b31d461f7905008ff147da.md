Orthostatic hypotension, also called postural hypotension, is a drop in blood pressure on standing to a certain extent. It hampers the quality of life and increases the risk of falls, cardiovascular diseases, dementia, depression, and death.

Early detection in patients with certain risk factors or symptoms may provide better outcomes and prevent some complications. Current guidance for detecting and managing orthostatic hypotension is varied and based on inadequate evidence. Primary care providers could play a crucial role in screening and detecting orthostatic hypotension. Also, they could help patients make shared management decisions in improving symptoms and reducing risk.

Orthostatic hypotension results from an insufficient physiologic reaction to orthostatic changes in blood pressure. It may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, as well as acute or chronic. In the absence of volume depletion, chronic autonomic failure is generally the cause of orthostatic hypotension in younger patients. A related problem called postprandial hypotension is common in elderly patients and those with autonomic failure. In this disorder, systolic blood pressure drops by at least 20 mm Hg within 75 minutes of having a meal.
