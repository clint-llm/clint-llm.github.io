HIPEC, often combined with surgical cytoreduction, is a heavy procedure with a non-negligible morbidity and mortality rate even in the most efficient centers; it must be performed in university centers specializing in oncological surgery with multimodal and multidisciplinary care. This also implies collaboration between inter-professional teams.

The oncologist must respect the correct selection of patients in agreement with the surgeon to perform this procedure by taking into account the beneficial effects of HIPEC on the long-term survival of the oncological patient without forgetting the benefit/risk ratio.

The anesthesiologist should perform a preoperative evaluation necessary for the patient's operability. The resuscitator in charge of the intensive care unit must be informed of the procedure and its complications before admission to the intensive care unit.
