EAH occurs in a wide variety of athletes in activities of various intensities, including ultramarathon and marathon running, triathlon, shorter distance running, military training operations, team ball sports, recreational hiking, and yoga.

Men and women are at equal risk for EAH when adjusted for body mass index and exercise duration.

EAH is commonly an incidental finding in asymptomatic athletes. Incidences of 5-51% are reported following endurance events where athletes are screened, or their serum is analyzed for another reason.
