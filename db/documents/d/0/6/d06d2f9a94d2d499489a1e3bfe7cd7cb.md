Cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), also having been termed for the clinical sign of creeping eruption, is an infectious syndrome caused by multiple types of hookworms. This is most commonly transmitted by animal feces depositing eggs in the soil, with larvae entering humans through direct contact with skin. Cutaneous larva migrans is distinguished from the cutaneous manifestation of Strongyloides stercoralis infection termed larva currens. The latter demonstrating fast movement through the skin. Other non-larval cutaneous migrations, including loiasis, scabies, or larva with dermal penetration, are also excluded from CLM.

- This disease is classically seen in warmer climates, including the southeast United States. Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.

- Symptomatology includes a progressive migrating serpiginous rash commonly with pruritus. While the disease can affect any exposed area, the most common location is the feet.

- The natural progression of the disease is self-limited as the organisms are unable to produce a collagenase to penetrate the basement membrane and reach the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to reproduce. When treatment is given, topical thiabendazole, oral albendazole, or ivermectin are the drugs of choice.

- Complications often arise from secondary bacterial superinfection or complications from inappropriate empiric therapy.
