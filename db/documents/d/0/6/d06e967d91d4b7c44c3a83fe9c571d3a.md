Refractive errors are defined as conditions when the light rays are not focused at a single point on the retina.

Uncorrected refractive errors can produce symptoms such as blurred vision, sore and strained eyes, squinting, feeling of ocular dryness, headache, sensitivity to light, and watering of the eyes.
