Surgical considerations regarding the papillary muscles include pathologic papillary muscle abnormalities leading to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and papillary muscle rupture. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction secondary to papillary muscle pathology that is amenable to surgical resection has been established in multiple case reports, with significant clinical improvement described post-intervention.

Pathologic papillary muscle anatomy has been described as a contributing factor to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It may require modifications to surgical techniques generally used for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Surgical intervention, such as mitral valve replacement or repair, is the recommended treatment for treatment following papillary muscle rupture after myocardial infarction.
