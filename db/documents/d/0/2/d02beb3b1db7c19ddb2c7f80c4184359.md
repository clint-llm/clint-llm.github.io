The evaluation of EP should include a careful history of asthma, occupational or environmental exposures, travel, medications, infectious symptoms, the presence of systemic findings, and the acuity or chronicity of symptoms.Â Based on certain signs and symptoms, it can help narrow down the differential further. Findings of a rash can point towards EGPA, HES, drug-induced, or parasitic causes. Findings of cardiomyopathy could be due to system involvement of EGPA or HES. Upper airway involvement could be due to EGPA or ABPA.

**Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP)**usually is acute onset within days to weeks of symptoms with dyspnea, cough, and fever. No other causes of eosinophilic pneumonia can be elicited from history such as inciting drugs. AEP occurs predominantly in males, and they have no prior history of asthma. Cigarette smoking is believed to have a causative role in this disease as the majority of the cases reported have either recently started smoking or have had an alteration in their smoking habits. Findings on examination are tachypnea, tachycardia, crackles, and wheezing; many have acute respiratory failure, with around 70% of the patients needing mechanical ventilation.

**Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP)**occurs predominantly in women and nonsmokers. Though the etiology is not known, it is more frequently seen in asthmatics and those with a history of atopic disease. Usually, it presents with a few months of dyspnea, cough, or chest pain and may have associated constitutional symptoms.

**Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA)**presents at a mean age of 35, with a history of severe corticosteroid-dependent asthma that usually precedes the onset by a few years. Up to 75% of patients have associated rhinitis and sinusitis. These patients have multisystem vasculitis and can have constitutional symptoms, arthralgias/myalgias, signs and symptoms of heart failure, renal failure, neuropathy, and palpable purpura.

In **HES**, symptoms are nonspecific such as a cough and dyspnea, which are seen in only one-quarter to one-half of all cases. They often will present with signs and symptoms of heart failure, central nervous system complaints, peripheral neuropathies, and cutaneous changes such as urticaria and angioedema.

Patients with **ABPA**usually have a history of poorly controlled asthma or cystic fibrosis with a productive cough, occasionally with brownish sputum and wheezing.

**Loeffler syndrome**occurs in temperate and tropical climates. Pulmonary symptoms are usually coughing and wheezing with fever. The symptoms may remit spontaneously. Tropical eosinophilia commonly occurs in young male adults living in a tropical climate of Asia or Africa. Patients usually have a dry cough which is worse at night and associated with wheezing.
