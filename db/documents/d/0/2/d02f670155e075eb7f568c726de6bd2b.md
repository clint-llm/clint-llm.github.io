Hamartomas are fundamentally comprised of disordered replications of normal tissue cells. The underlying mechanisms of anomalous replications are not fully recognized. The particular property is a clearly demarcated mass mainly containing fat and cartilage, but other tissue cells may also be present depending on the anatomic location. The size of most hamartomas is between 1 to 3 cm. Hamartomas are usually not encapsulated and have multiple lobes divided by septations.

A broad spectrum of disorders and syndromes is associated with gene mutations, resulting in multiple hamartomas in various body parts—loss of function of the PTEN gene by mutation results in PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS). Cowden syndrome is the best-studied phenotype within PHTS.In addition to multiple hamartoma formation, patients have dermatologic manifestations such as oral fibromas, trichilemmomas, and punctate palmoplantar keratoses. These are also associated with increased malignant potential.
