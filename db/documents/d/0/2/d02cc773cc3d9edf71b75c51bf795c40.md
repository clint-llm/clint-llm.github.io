The EEG is a technique of electrophysiological monitoring that involves electrodes attached to the scalp to measure the amplitude and frequency of electrical activity in the brain. The K-complex is a waveform seen on electroencephalography during the second stage (N2) of NREM sleep. An EEG conducted during a sleep study helps in the identification of the various waveforms and phases of sleep architecture. The second stage of NREM sleep on EEG shows theta waves, which, along with K-complexes and sleep spindles, are the defining characteristics of this stage. Any abnormalities in these waveforms are therefore picked up on EEG.

When performing a functional MRI of the brain in conjunction with the EEG, the K-complex corresponds with increased signals in the paracentral gyri, thalami, medial region of the parietal, and frontal lobes and superior temporal lobes.
