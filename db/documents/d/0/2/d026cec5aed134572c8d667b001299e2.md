There are six main categories of enzymes: oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, and ligases. Each category carries out a general type of reaction but catalyzes many different specific reactions within their own category. Some enzymes, called apoenzymes, are inactive until they are bound to a cofactor, which activates the enzyme. A cofactor can be either metal ions (e.g., Zn) or organic compounds that attach, either covalently or noncovalently, to the enzyme. The cofactor and apoenzyme complex is called a holoenzyme. Enzymes are proteins comprised of amino acids linked together in one or more polypeptide chains. This sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is called the primary structure. This, in turn, determines the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, including the shape of the active site. The secondary structure of a protein describes the localized polypeptide chain structures, e.g., α-helices or β-sheets.

The complete three-dimensional fold of a polypeptide chain into a protein subunit is known as its tertiary structure. A protein can be composed of one (a monomer) or more subunits (e.g., a dimer). The three-dimensional arrangement of subunits is known as its quaternary structure. Subunit structure is determined by the sequence and characteristics of amino acids in the polypeptide chain. The active site is a groove or crevice on an enzyme in which a substrate binds to facilitate the catalyzed chemical reaction. Enzymes are typically specific because the conformation of amino acids in the active site stabilizes the specific binding of the substrate. The active site generally takes up a relatively small part of the entire enzyme and is usually filled with free water when it is not binding a substrate.
