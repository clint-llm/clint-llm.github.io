Disrupted homeostatic mechanisms in hypothyroid patients lead to myxedema coma. There are many Precipitating factors. The most important are:

- Infections: urinary tract infection, pneumonia, viral infections, influenza, etc.

- Burns, carbon dioxide retention, and trauma

- Hypothermia and hypoglycemia

- Hypoxemia and cerebrovascular accidents

- Drugs: amiodarone

- New case reports with anti-TNF therapy causing myxedema have documentation in the literature.

- Congestive heart failure

- Gastrointestinal bleeding

- Surgery (given the effect on pituitary-thyroid axis with decrease thyroid hormones secretion after surgery in response to stress)

- A case report in 2019 showed that diabetic ketoacidosis precipitated myxedema coma in a patient after total thyroidectomy.
