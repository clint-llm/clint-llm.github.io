The exact pathophysiology of adhesive capsulitis is unknown. The most commonly accepted hypothesis states that inflammation initially occurs within the joint capsule and synovial fluid. The inflammationÂ is followed by reactive fibrosis and adhesions of the synovial lining of the joint. The initial inflammation of the capsule leads to pain, and the capsular fibrosis and adhesions lead to a decreased range of motion.
