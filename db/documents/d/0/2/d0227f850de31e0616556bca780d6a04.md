The clinical symptoms of different cardiac tumors are often non-specific and insidious, which can delay diagnosis and surgical management.Â The symptoms may relate to processes in the heart, such as valvular dysfunction, pericardial effusion with tamponade, intracardiac blood flow obstruction, arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure. An increasing proportion of cardiac tumors induce no symptoms and become obvious only as an incidental finding.
