The first endothelin was identified by culturing aortic endothelial cells and was named as endothelin-1 (ET-1) from the name ‘endothelium-derived-vasoconstrictor.’ Over time ET-2 and ET-3 were discovered from snakes. They are genetically encrypted into the human genome in chromosomes 6, 1, and 20, respectively. Promoters of endothelin production include factors such as thrombin, insulin, epinephrine, angiotensin II, cortisol, and other extrinsic factors such as cyclosporine, vascular shear stress, and hypoxia. The factors that reduce ET include nitric oxide and its inducers, natriuretic peptides, and prostanoids. ET is produced in an immature form called preproendothelin-1 in the cell and undergoes maturation, which involves the enzyme endothelin converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), which is responsible for cleaving and thus maturing the molecule to 21-amino acids. A newly discovered endothelin produced from mast cells has 31-amino acids (therefore called ET-11-31) in length and has a more constrictive potency.
