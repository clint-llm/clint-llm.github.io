Hypovolemia results in inadequate left ventricular filling volume.

For critically ill patients in hypovolemic shock, stroke volume optimization algorithms are increasingly becoming utilized to monitor for early signs of hypovolemia. Critical care specialists currently use several physical examination findings during their clinical assessment to monitor a patient's volume status. Some of these include assessing axillary hydration status, mucous membrane color, sunken eyes, capillary refill time, and mentation status.

There are several new methods of measuring stroke volume that are efficient and becoming increasingly accessible. External Doppler imaging is considered the most popular and can be performed using an ultrasound probe placed along the chest wall cavity. This method is less commonly performed in critically ill patients as it is technically difficult, and the required serial measurements are impractical. In sedated patients such as those in the operating room or intensive care unit, esophageal Doppler imaging may be obtained by placing a probe in the esophagus and collecting Doppler signaling data from the descending aorta. In intubated patients, endotracheal bioimpedance can obtain the stroke volume and cardiac output from measuring the impedance signal from the ascending aorta. Some several other techniques and devices may be implemented to continuously assess for stroke volume using electrodes that will not receive coverage in this article.

Heart failure is among the most prevalent chronic conditions in the elderly population and is the fastest-growing clinical cardiac disease.

HFpEF is clinical signs of HF with LVEF over 50% whereas HFrEF is having clinical signs of HF with LVEF below 40%.
