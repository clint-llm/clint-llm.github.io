As in any shoulder trauma presentation, a thorough and targeted history, followed by examination including neurovascular assessment and special tests, should be performed on initial review. Often clinical history and examination findings are vague, and isolating the presence of a GLAD based on clinical suspicion alone is difficult.

Therefore the position of the arm at injury and the direction of impact may provide some indication that a GLAD lesion may be present. However, it may simply be that pain persists following a traumatic instability episode, including a subluxation or dislocation.

On examination, pain may be elicited on abduction and external rotation, while forced adduction may produce a ‘popping’ sensation. The patient may localize to deep-seated anterior joint pain. Typically, the above findings are observed in the context of a stable shoulder joint, as normally, the anterior labroligamentous complex remains intact (it is only the superficial labral fibers that are damaged). In more recent studies, however, an association between GLAD lesions and anterior shoulder instability has also been recognized.

In any case, the non-specific nature of the clinical characteristics makes evaluation with imaging essential for diagnosis.
