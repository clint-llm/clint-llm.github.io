The innervation of the oral cavity is distinct and comes primarily from the maxillary and mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve.

The oral mucosa, teeth, and supporting structures receive their innervation from the maxillary and mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve.

The greater palatine and nasopalatine nerves both branches of the maxillary nerve innervate the hard palate, whereas the lesser palatine branch of the maxillary nerve supplies the soft palate.

The innervation of the tongue is complex. Motor innervation of all intrinsic and extrinsic muscles, except for the palatoglossus comes from the hypoglossal nerve. The palatoglossus receives innervation from the vagus nerve. The anterior and posterior portions of the tongue have different taste and sensory innervation due to their different embryological origins. The anterior two-thirds of the tongue receives taste sensation by a branch of the facial nerve called the chorda tympani nerve whereas the general sensation of the anterior two-third tongue is by the lingual nerve, which is a branch of the mandibular branch of trigeminal. The posterior one-third of the tongue gets both its sensory and taste sensations from the glossopharyngeal nerve.

The buccal nerve, also a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve innervates the cheek.
