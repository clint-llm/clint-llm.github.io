Periorbital cellulitis is sometimes called preseptal cellulitis. It is is a skin and soft tissue infection around the eye that is anterior to the orbital septum. Serious complications of periorbital cellulitis are rare, however a more serious condition called orbital cellulitis is sometimes misdiagnosed as periorbital cellulitis. Periorbital cellulitis is most common in children and primarily caused by trauma or sinusitis. Patients present with unilateral eyelid swelling and edema. In contrast, patients with orbital cellulitis present with similar findings plus ocular symptoms such as proptosis, eye pain, decreased vision, and limited extraocular motility. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of periorbital cellulitis and illustrates the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its management.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the presentation of periorbital cellulitis from orbital cellulitis. 
- Describe the etiologies of periorbital cellulitis.
- Review the strategies for managing periorbital cellulitis.
- Summarize how the interprofessional team can work collaboratively to prevent the potentially profound complications of periorbital cellulitis by applying knowledge about the presentation, evaluation, and management of this disease.
