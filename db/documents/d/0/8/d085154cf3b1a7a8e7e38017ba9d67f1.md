Newly- diagnosed patients with thrombocytopenia are referred to a hematologist to confirm the diagnosis. In patients with unexplained thrombocytopenia, consulting hematologist is the recommendation. Immediate consultation is necessary for conditions like TTP, HUS, HIT, aplastic anemia, leukemia, and other bone marrow failure conditions.

Pregnant patients with HELLP/preeclampsia require an obstetrician consultation.
