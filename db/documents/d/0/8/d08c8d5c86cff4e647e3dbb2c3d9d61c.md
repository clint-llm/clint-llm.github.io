The pivotal basis in managing patients with traumatic subluxation is three-fold:

- Early reduction, spinal decompression and graft, and implant fixation

- Early institution of graded physiotherapy to maximize neurological recovery

- Prevention of secondary complications in the patients

However, in patients with severe deficits, the caretakers have to look after them even for their activities of daily living. The management plan should, therefore, be targeted, focusing on the patient and the care provider together as a unit.
