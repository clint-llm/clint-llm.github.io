Elementary bodies (EB) of C. psittaci infect the lung by direct interaction with the surface microvilli. EBs are subsequently engulfed by endocytosis, hence creating inclusions called reticulate bodies (RB) that avoid lysosomal fusion. These bodies then transform back into EB and are released during cell lysis, restarting the cycle. The pathogen can also cause systemic symptoms due to hematogenous spread, perhaps within macrophages. Persistence of infection has been observed when pathogens remain viable but non-cultivable, and the host immune system is unable to eliminate them. Hence, alveolar-lining cells with intracytoplasmic inclusions are pathognomonic.
