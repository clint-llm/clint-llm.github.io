The notochord sends signals and induces the overlying ectoderm to form the neural tube that will create the entire nervous system. By week four, the neural tube form into the forebrain (prosencephalon), midbrain (mesencephalon), and hindbrain (rhombencephalon). The forebrain develops into the telencephalon and diencephalon. The telencephalon develops into the cerebral hemispheres.
