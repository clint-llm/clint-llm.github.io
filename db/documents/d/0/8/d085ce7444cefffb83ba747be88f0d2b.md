There is no specific antidote for overdosing on biotin. Excess in the body is rare, and since biotin is a water-soluble vitamin, it is excreted in the urine when in excess. Signs and symptoms of biotin overdose may include and are not limited to insomnia, excessive thirst, and urination. Since biotin has documentation in playing a role in postprandial glucose control, it bears mention that excess would cause signs and symptoms of a person experiencing hyperglycemia (e.g., increased thirst).
