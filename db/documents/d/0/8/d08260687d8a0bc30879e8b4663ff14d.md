Disadvantages of the open approach

- Potentially increased edema

- Extended surgical time

- Destabilized cartilaginous framework

- External transcolumellar scar. Note: the majority of patients (98%) are not “disturbed” by their external rhinoplasty scar, with 90% considering them to be invisible or barely perceptible. Furthermore, for the patient with anxiety regarding suture removal, the surgeon can use rapid resorbable sutures to lessen discomfort.

Certain components of the patient’s history require attention and/or resolution before performing a rhinoplasty, including

- Preexisting allergic disorders

- Vasomotor rhinitis

- Nasal trauma

- Prior nasal procedures

- Airway problems (e.g., asthma or cystic fibrosis)

- Sinus pathology.

Use of illicit intranasal drugs (e.g., cocaine) complicates the procedure and may compromise the postoperative result.

Patients at increased risk of developing post-operative bleeding and/or septal hematoma:

- Patients taking anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

- Patients taking herbal medications and supplements such as chondroitin, ephedra, echinacea, glucosamine, Ginkgo biloba, goldenseal, milk thistle, ginseng, kava, and garlic

- Poorly controlled hypertension, both pre-operatively and intra-operatively

Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD):

- A psychiatric disorder characterized by an obsessive preoccupation with self-perceived defects in one's appearance that are either minute or absent to the casual observer

- Patients who have BDD tend to be less satisfied after surgery and exhibit higher aggression and litigation rates toward surgeons.

- The prevalence of BDD may be as high as 13% for all patients seeking facial plastic surgery,
