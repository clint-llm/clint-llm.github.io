As practitioners in this era of the anti-vaccination movement, advocating the benefits of the MMR vaccine is vital. The resurgence of mumps outbreaks is preventable with proper patient education by practitioners from all spectrums of practice. Nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare workers should repeatedly encourage parents to get their children vaccinated against mumps. Today, school nurses and local public health officials now offer vaccination, unless otherwise contraindicated.

When a mumps case is diagnosed, it has to be reported to the local authorities. The child has to be educated on hand washing and the need for isolation until the symptoms subside. The public health nurse should follow these patients for complications and refer all patients with symptoms to the primary care provider. Patients and caregivers need to be educated that the vaccine is safe and adverse reactions are rare.

While the infection is not life-threatening, it can have considerable morbidity if the testes or ovaries are affected.
