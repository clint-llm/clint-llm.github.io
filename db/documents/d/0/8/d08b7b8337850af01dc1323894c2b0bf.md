Pantoprazole is a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) widely used in hospitals and outpatient settings. Pantoprazole has approval from the Food and Drug Administration Agency (FDA) to treat various disease processes, including treatment of erosive esophagitis associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease and the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions, including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. It is also FDA approved for the healing maintenance of erosive esophagitis. Pantoprazole also has various off-label uses, including eradicating Helicobacter pylori bacteria and preventing peptic ulcer re-bleeding and/or NSAID-induced ulcers. Patients who are critically ill may be given pantoprazole as stress ulcer prophylaxis. This medication is safe for administration in adult and pediatric populations. This activity reviews the uses of pantoprazole and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with peptic ulcer disease.
