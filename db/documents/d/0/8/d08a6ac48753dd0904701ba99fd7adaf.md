Overall, cooling is a benign intervention that has few complications. The patient's vital signs must be monitored closely during the cooling process. As mentioned, patients should be monitored for shivering, which will hinder cooling efforts. Critically ill patients may further decompensate during cooling. Additionally, if a patient's body temperature drops below normal (36 degrees C), they will be at risk for the sequelae of hypothermia. An important organ to monitor during the cooling process is the skin. It is susceptible to damage from prolonged exposure to ice. Covering ice packs with a towel or sheet and regularly adjusting the site of application will mitigate this risk.

If the patient was submerged in ice water, make sure to continue to monitor for hypothermia, and wrap the patient in blankets so as not to leave them exposed.
