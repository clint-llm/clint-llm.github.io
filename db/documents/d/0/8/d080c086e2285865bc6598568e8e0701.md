Once a diagnosis of trichinosis is confirmed, therapy implementation should begin as soon as possible. If given within the first 3 days of infection, it prevents muscular invasion and disease progression. The primary drug treatment for trichinosis is antihelminthics. These include albendazole and mebendazole. Albendazole has been shown to reach adequate plasma levels and does not require monitoring whereas mebendazole plasma levels can vary from patient to patient and requires individual monitoring and dosing. The recommended dose of albendazole is 400 mg two times a day for 8 to 14 days. The recommended dose for mebendazole is 200 to 400 mg thrice daily for 3 days. Another dose of 400 to 500 mg should be given thrice daily for 10 days.

These doses are acceptable for children and adults but contraindicated in those <2 years or those who are pregnant. Pyrantel can is an option for children and pregnant women, given as a single dose of 10-20 mg/kg of body weight. It is only effective against intestinal larvae and does not affect newborn or muscle larvae. Primary chemotherapy for severe symptoms is prednisone given at a dose of 30-60 mg/day for 10-15 days.
