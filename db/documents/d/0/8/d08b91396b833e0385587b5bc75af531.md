Acute telogen effluvium is a self-limited condition. If the causative event is identified by history and has been adequately treated, no further treatment is required. If a hormonalÂ or dietary imbalance or metabolic illness is present, hair growth will return after these factors are corrected. If a medication is the cause of the shedding, hair growth will restart after the medication is withdrawn.

Hair transplantation has no role in the treatment of telogen effluvium.

While topical minoxidil has not been proven to promote recovery of hair in telogen effluvium, it has theoretical benefits. Patients who wish to take an active role in their treatment may choose to use minoxidil.
