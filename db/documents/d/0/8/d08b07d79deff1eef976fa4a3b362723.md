Patients are encouraged to follow instructions and post-injury or post-operative rehabilitation protocols as dictating by his or her provider(s).  Also, in complex elbow injury patterns and traumatic fracture-dislocations (i.e., terrible triad elbow injuries), it is important to manage patients expectations appropriately.  Nearly all patients experience some degree of post-recovery loss of ROM.  Thus, it is important to emphasize regaining elbow ROM following any elbow injury.
