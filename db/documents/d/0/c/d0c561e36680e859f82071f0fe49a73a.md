A variety of causes can create the appearance of pseudopapilledema. Congenitally small nerves with a crowded optic nerve head, often seen in hyperopic eyes with shorter axial lengths can appear to have some mild elevation of the optic nerve head. Conversely, in myopic eyes with longer axial lengths, the optic nerve can insert into the globe at an oblique angle so that the nasal part of the nerve is relatively elevated compared to the temporal nerve. Another congenital variant, Burgmeister papillae, originate from an incompletely regressed hyaloid artery that can obscure the optic nerve and give the impression of papilledema. Myelinated nerve fibers, which result from the anomalous migration of oligodendrocytes past the lamina cribosa, can also obscure the margin of the optic nerve.

Optic disc drusen (ODD) are extracellular deposits consisting of calcium, hyaline, and other proteins located posterior to Bruch's membrane and anterior the lamina cribosa.

Any other abnormalities around the optic nerve that obscure the nerve margins or elevate the nerve can produce pseudopapilledema; this would include vitreopapillary traction, non-calcified peripapillary astrocytic hamartomas or other peripapillary tumors.
