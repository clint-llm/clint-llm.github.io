The diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy can be supported by electrodiagnostic testing, which includes nerve conduction studies (NCS) and needle electromyography (EMG). This activity reviews some of the causes of peripheral neuropathy and the corresponding electrodiagnostic findings. It also reviews the technique for planning an electrodiagnostic study for the evaluation of peripheral neuropathy. It explains the interdisciplinary team's role in evaluating and improving care for patients who suffer from peripheral neuropathy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for electrodiagnostic testing in patients with symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. 
- Describe the nerve conduction study (NCS) findings in a patient with peripheral neuropathy.
- Review the electromyographic (EMG) findings in a patient with peripheral neuropathy. 
- Outline the importance of communication among the interdisciplinary team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with peripheral neuropathy.
