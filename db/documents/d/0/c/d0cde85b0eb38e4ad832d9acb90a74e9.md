- The role of viruses in primary pneumonia is increasing, and viral respiratory pathogens are increasingly recognized as a cofactor in bacterial pneumonia secondary to the increasing prevalence of immunosuppression-cancer treatment, organ transplant, and HIV.

- Prevention, especially in the form of immunization against influenza and measles, can significantly decrease the incidence of viral pneumonia.

- Increasingly, specific and sensitive real-time diagnostic laboratory tools are available in the form of ELISA and PCR modalities for the specific diagnosis of viral pneumonia and assignment of specific treatment when existent.

- Although there are no pathognomonic history or physical findings for viral pneumonia as opposed to bacterial pneumonia, there are a number of clinical cues that are quite suggestive.

- Although specific antiviral agents do exist, the cornerstone of treatment for viral pneumonia remains supportive care.
