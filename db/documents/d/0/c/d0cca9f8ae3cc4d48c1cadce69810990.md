Mandible reconstruction is performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. A minimum of four personnel is required to carry out the procedure:

- A qualified surgeon

- Anesthetist or anesthesiologist

- Circulating nurse

- Scrub tech

- Often, a retractor holder or first-assist is helpful to the surgeon and frees the scrub tech to pass instruments more efficiently
