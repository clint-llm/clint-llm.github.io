The uterus receives blood from the uterine and ovarian arteries, which arise from the anterior branch of the internal iliac artery. The uterine arteries are the main blood vessels that supply blood to the uterus. As the blood supply enters the myometrium, it branches into the arcuate arteries, which branch into the radial arteries. As they enter the level of the endometrium, they branch into the basal and spiral arteries.

The fundal area of the uterus chiefly drains into para-aortic lymph nodes along with the ovarian and fallopian tube lymphatic drainage. Some of it also drains into superficial inguinal lymph nodes along the round ligament. The lower portions of the uterus drain along uterine blood vessels into external and internal iliac lymph nodes.
