SPECT imaging alone has no absolute contraindications; however, patients may rarely experience allergic reactions to the tracer compound. Most often, contraindications for SPECT imaging is related to the underlying procedure rather than the SPECT scan itself. For example, a cardiac stress test augmented with SPECT carries the same risks and contraindications as a routine stress test. Clinicians should also carefully consider the risks of radiation exposure when referring patients that are pregnant for SPECT, and radioactive iodine isotopes should be avoided in these patients as well due to fetal iodine uptake.
