In the United States, approximately 300,000 patients are seen annually in emergency departments for animal scratches or bites.Pasteurella multocida is the pathogen most commonly associated with infection in these patients.Pasteurella species are part of the normal flora of the mouth and upper respiratory tract of many animals, both wild and domestic. The animals with the highest rate of carriage are cats, with rates of 70% to 90%. Dogs have the second-highest rate of carriage at 20% to 50%.Pasteurella species can be isolated in wound cultures in 50% of injuries from dog bites and 75% of injuries from cat bites.Pasteurella infection may occur in the absence of physical injury. While rare, there have been cases of patients suffering from serious infections after only being licked by an animal.

Respiratory infections are rare and almost exclusively occur in the immunocompromised or in those with chronic pulmonary disease.
