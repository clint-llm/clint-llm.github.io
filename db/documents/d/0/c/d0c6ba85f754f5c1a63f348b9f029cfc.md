Scabies is a contagious skin condition caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei which burrows into the skin and causes severe itching. Scabies is transmitted by direct skin-to-skin contact or indirectly by contact with contaminated material (fomites). This condition is often challenging to diagnose as many patients may have only subtle symptoms. However, other patients may present with the classic history of exposure, severe pruritis that is worse at night, and reference to other individuals with similar symptoms. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of scabies and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the transmission of scabies. 
- Explain how to make the diagnosis of scabies. 
- Summarize strategies for preventing recurrence of scabies.
- Identify the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members in assuring treatment of the entire family of a patient infected with scabies, which will prevent transmission and enhance outcomes for patients with this infection.
