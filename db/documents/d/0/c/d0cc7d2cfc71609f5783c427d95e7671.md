A unique impact of AST on patient management is the identification of the specific diagnosis, and additionally, targeting the particular etiologic agent causing the disease.Â  No two patients can be managed similarly, especially if they have the same signs and symptoms (disease manifestation) but with different treatment regimens because the same causative organism can have different resistance patterns. For example, two patients may present with an ordinary strain of Staphylococcus aureus vs. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); and another example would be patients with drug-susceptible (DS-TB) and drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB).
