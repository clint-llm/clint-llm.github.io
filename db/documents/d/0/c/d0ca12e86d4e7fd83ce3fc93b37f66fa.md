Calciphylaxis or calcific uremic arteriolopathy is an arterial calcification, typically found in patients with long-term kidney disease. Radiography shows the process of arterial calcification, for example, in the forearm. The radial pulse may appear very strong; the causes remain unclear.

The adventitious cystic disease of the radial artery is a pathology that is difficult to find, but real. It appears as a painful mass in the forearm. It attaches with a stem at the intra-mural level of the artery. The approach is always surgical.
