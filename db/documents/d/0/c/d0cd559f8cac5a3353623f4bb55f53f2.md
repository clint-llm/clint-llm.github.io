A significant complication of penetrating trauma is acute compartment syndrome; this is a surgical emergency as it causes tissue ischemia and eventually necrosis.  In general, reversible neuropraxia can occur with ischemia time of one hour.  If the ischemia time continues to the four-hour mark, it correlates with irreversible axonotmesis, and if it goes longer than six hours, necrosis can occur and be irreversible.  There are common areas within the body where compartment syndrome can occur.  The areas that are most common include below the knee, thigh, forearm, and arm.  Of these the most common site is below the knee.  Studies have demonstrated that one can predict the risk of compartment syndrome based on the site of injury.   The risk of compartment syndrome occurring with a proximal below the knee injury (proximal tib/fib fracture) is much high than a distal below the knee injury (middle or distal fracture).  Fracture of the lower extremity is the leading cause of compartment syndrome. Patients that have an injury to both the venous and arterial system are at high risk.
