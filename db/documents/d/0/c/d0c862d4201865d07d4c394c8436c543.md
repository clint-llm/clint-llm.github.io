Plasma proteins, on the other hand, have distinct organs that produce them based on an individual's stage of development. **In Embryo**

In the embryonic stage, the mesenchymal cells are responsible for plasma cell production. The first protein to be synthesized is albumin, followed by globulin and the other plasma proteins.

**In Adults**

The reticuloendothelial cells of the liver are in charge of plasma protein synthesis in adults. The bone marrow, degenerating blood cells, general body tissue cells, and the spleen also contribute to the formation of plasma proteins. Gamma globulins originate from B lymphocytes, which in turn form immunoglobulins.
