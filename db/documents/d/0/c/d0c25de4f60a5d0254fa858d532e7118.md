Late-onset depression frequently poses a diagnostic dilemma. These patients may exhibit non-specific signs and symptoms such as somatic complaints- pain abdomen, generalized body ache, anger outbursts, irritability, decreased cognition. It may be due to several causes with different etiologies. While history may reveal that the patient has depression, the cause is difficult to know without detailed mental status examination, cognitive testing, and laboratory investigations. For the timely diagnosis and management of late-onset depression, a collaborative interprofessional effort is necessary. For example, if an elderly patient complains of persistent pain in the abdomen despite normal routine investigations and adequate treatment with medications by a physician, he should consider the differential of late-life depression in mind before ordering further rigorous laboratory investigations as this could be an early sign of depression. Another common concern in the elderly is of polypharmacy and drug interactions. The pharmacist should regularly monitor the medications and communicate with the clinician if there are any potentially harmful medications. Some medications can worsen or cause a depression that comprises antihypertensive, antiparkinsonian, anticancer, hormonal agents, and benzodiazepines. Finally, a mental health nurse and a social worker should be involved in the outpatient care of these patients as many need support services, a safe living environment, and understanding caregivers. An interprofessional team approach is vital if one wants to improve outcomes and minimize untoward events associated with severe depression. [Level 5]
