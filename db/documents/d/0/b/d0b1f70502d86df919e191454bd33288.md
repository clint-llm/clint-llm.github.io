Acute ischemic stroke is a neurological emergency that prompts urgent evaluation and treatment to limit disability and mortality. This is a multidisciplinary team effort where different teams are involved at varying levels of care. This activity describes the interprofessional team's role in deciding the type of anesthesia, maintaining hemodynamic and metabolic parameters for best neurological outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the vascular pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke.
- Review the importance of initiating the treatment early in order to limit disability.
- Summarize the anesthetic concerns of patients undergoing endovascular treatment (mechanical thrombectomy) and establish goals of care.
- Outline the importance of communication between interprofessional teams taking care of patients with acute ischemic stroke.
