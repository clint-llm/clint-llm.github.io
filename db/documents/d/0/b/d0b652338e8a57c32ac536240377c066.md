**Lymphedema Stages**

**Stage 0 (Latency stage)**

- The patient is considered “at-risk” for lymphedema development due to injury to the lymphatic vessels but does not present with outward signs of edema.

- Includes patients with breast cancer who have undergone sentinel lymph node biopsy and or radiation but have not yet developed swelling.

- Lymphatic transport capacity has been reduced, which predisposes the patient to lymphatic overload and resultant edema.

**Stage 1 (Spontaneous)**

- Reversible

- Has pitting edema

- Swelling at this stage is soft and may respond to elevation

**Stage 2 (Spontaneously irreversible)**

- Has tissue fibrosis/induration

- Swelling does not respond to elevation

- Skin and tissue thickening occurs as the limb volume increases

- Pitting may be present but may be difficult to assess due to tissue and or skin fibrosis

**Stage 3 (Lymphostatic elephantiasis)**

- Show the following:

- Pitting edema
- Fibrosis
- Skin changes
- During this stage, papillomas may form, infections/cellulitis may occur, and the skin becomes dry

The Stemmer sign may not be present in Stages 1 or 2.
