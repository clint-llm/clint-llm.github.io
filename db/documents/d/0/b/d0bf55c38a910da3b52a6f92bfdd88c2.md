This activity discusses os odontoideum, a rare cervical entity characterized by a failure in the normal development of the odontoid process resulting in a hypoplastic round-shaped odontoid that has no continuity with the C2 vertebral body. This condition can be asymptomatic, but in some cases, can produce severe cervical instability. This anomaly must be promptly diagnosed to decrease the risk of spinal cord compression. This activity reviews the etiology, evaluation, and treatment algorithm of this condition highlighting the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with os odontoideum.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of os odontoideum.
- Describe the clinical presentation of os odontoideum.
- Summarize the treatment of os odontoideum.
- Explain how early recognition of os odontoideum by the interprofessional team is imperative to guide proper specialist referral required to manage this condition, provide patient and family education, and improve outcomes avoiding complications derived from cervical instability and cord compression.
