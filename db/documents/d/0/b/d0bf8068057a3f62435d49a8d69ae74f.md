- Couples should undergo genetic counseling.

- Informed written consent should be taken.

- Risks, benefits, indications, procedures, and complications related to the mother and fetus must be explained in detail to the couple. The fetal and maternal risks associated with the procedure should also be discussed in detail. The time required to obtain results, failure to culture cells, and the type of cytogenetic test performed on the sample should be discussed.

- Proper procedure documentation isÂ necessary, and the number of needle insertion attempts should be recorded.

- Ultrasonography before the procedure is done to document the number of fetuses, viability of the fetus, placental location, gestational age, site of cord insertion, and any obvious fetal malformation.

- An operator has to have enough experience of at least 20 supervised amniocentesis procedures done under supervision to do this procedure independently. Operators doing amniocentesis in multiple pregnancy situations should be experts in accurate pregnancy mapping, accurate sampling, and selective termination of the pregnancy by correctly identifying the fetus.
