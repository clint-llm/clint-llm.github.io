The serum level of thiamin is not a reliable indicator of thiamin status. However, thiamin function can be measured by erythrocyte transketolase activity (ETKA). An EKTA of 0 to 15% is considered adequate, 15 to 25% is considered a moderate risk, and 25% or higher is considered high risk for thiamin deficiency.
