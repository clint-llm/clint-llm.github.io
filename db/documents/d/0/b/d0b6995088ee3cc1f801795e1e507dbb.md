Alpantaki et al. previously demonstrated that the tendon of the long head of the biceps contains a complex network of sensory and sympathetic nerve fibers.

Boesmueller recently histologically characterized the most proximal extent of the LHBT, specifically the neurofilament distribution, as the tendon transitions into the superior labral complex. The authors demonstrated via immunohistochemical staining that there is an inhomogeneous distribution of nerve endings and sympathetic nerve fibers throughout the superior labral complex. Interestingly enough, the anterior aspect of the superior labrum and the labral region anterior to the LHBT origin have the highest density of these fibers.

This factor may have a potential impact on patients experiencing persistent pain following various types of SLAP repairs.Â  More research is necessary regarding the histologic characterization of the superior labrum-LHBT complex.
