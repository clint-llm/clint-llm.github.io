As mentioned above, Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome are often thought to be on a spectrum with one another as they are both due to thiamine deficiency. Thus, clinicians should screen for them together. Wernicke encephalopathy classically presents with the triad of altered mental status, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. In reality, less than 20% of patients will present with all three of these findings.

- Altered mental status (up to 82% of patients) - amnesia, disorientation, confabulations

- Oculomotor findings - most often horizontal nystagmus, retinal hemorrhage, ophthalmoplegia, cranial nerve IV palsy, conjugate gaze

- Ataxia - wide-based gait

The cognitive impairments specific toÂ Korsakoff syndrome vs. Wernicke encephalopathy include anterograde amnesia, profoundly limiting one's learning capacity, retrograde amnesia, as well as executive deficits, resulting in decreased inhibition and difficulties with judgment, planning and problem-solving.

The Caine criteria have been described to have a sensitivity or 85% and specificity of 100% for Wernicke encephalopathy, in the alcoholic population.

Caine criteria for the diagnosis of Wernicke encephalopathy in chronic alcoholics. Two of the following four signs are necessary to diagnose Wernicke encephalopathy[3] clinically

- Dietary deficiency

- Oculomotor abnormalities

- Cerebellar dysfunction

- Either altered mental status or mild memory impairment
