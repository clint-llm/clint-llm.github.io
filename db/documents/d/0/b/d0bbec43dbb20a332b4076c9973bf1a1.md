CD4-T cells can differentiate into T helper cells Th1 and Th2. Th1 cells participate in cell-mediated inflammation by producing interferon-gamma, TNF, and IL 2 that target intracellular pathogens. Th2 cells participate in humoral immunity that stimulates antibody production by B cells to produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 that target extracellular pathogens. These cytokines are involved in the mediation of inflammatory response, infection, autoimmunity, transplant rejection, and GVHD.
