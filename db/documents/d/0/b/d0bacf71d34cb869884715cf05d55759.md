There are citations that the prevalence of osteomalacia histologically at post-mortem is as high as 25% in adult Europeans. The true incidence of osteomalacia, however, remains largely underestimated across the globe. At-risk individuals include those with dark skin, frequent wearers of full-body clothing, limited sun exposure, low socioeconomic status, and poor diet. These risks vary across the world and are contingent on geographic location, cultural preferences,Â and ethnicity. Healthcare providers should take these factors as well as other relevant clinical findings into account when choosing to obtain further studies or recommend vitamin D supplementation.
