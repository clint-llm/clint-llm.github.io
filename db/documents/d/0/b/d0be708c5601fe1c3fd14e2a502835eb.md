The two most important treatment modalities for diphtheria are antitoxins and antibiotics. Besides these two, the patient should be assessed for any respiratory and cardiovascular instabilities. When the patient is suspected of having diphtheria, antitoxin should be given immediately on a clinical basis without waiting for laboratory confirmation. The suspected cases must be kept in the isolation unit, and proper droplet precautions should be initiated. Further, the patient should be assessed for respiratory distress, and definite airway must be secured if needed. Cardiac monitoring is also an essential component of early management.

**Diphtheria Antitoxin (DAT)**

Diphtheria antitoxin is an antiserum derived from the horse.

**Antibiotic Treatment**

The choice of antibiotics for diphtheria are erythromycin or penicillin G. Antibiotic must be initiated as soon as possible for the eradication of the organism. This helps to limit the toxin released into the system, quickens the recovery phase in the patient, and prevents the spread of the infection to the close contacts. Further, in the case of antibiotic resistance, linezolid or vancomycin can be used.
