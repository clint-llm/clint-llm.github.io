Ebstein anomaly is a rare congenital abnormality involving the tricuspid valve and the right ventricle (RV),

- Apical displacement of the tricuspid valve

- Adherence of the septal and posterior leaflets to the myocardium

- Apical displacement and dilatation of the tricuspid annulus

- Dilatation of the "atrialized" portion of the right ventricle

- Redundancy, fenestrations, and tethering of the anterior leaflet

Associated cardiac defects commonly include a secundum atrial septal defect and a variable degree of RV outflow tract obstruction. Some newborns may present with functional, or anatomical pulmonary atresia (both are ductal-dependent lesions). Less commonly associated cardiac defects include ventricular septal defects, tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries, and atrioventricular canal defects.

Atrial tachycardia such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or ectopic atrial tachycardia can occur in 25% to 65% of patients. In addition, 10% to 45% of patients have accessory pathways, frequently multiple, which increase the risk of protracted arrhythmias that can produce cardiac failure and sudden cardiac death.
