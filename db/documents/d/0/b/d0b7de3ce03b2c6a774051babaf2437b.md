The course and complications of allodynia will vary depending upon the cause of allodynia. In general, allodynia often worsens over time as crisscrossed neuronal synapses make stronger connections. Allodynia can have a substantial negative impact on mental and emotional health, due to the distress caused by continual pain. Medical treatments for allodynia also have side effects, especially if the treatment involves opioids.
