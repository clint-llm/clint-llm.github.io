The diagnosis and management of cervical spine fractures usually require an interprofessional team that includes an emergency department physician, radiologist, neurosurgeon/orthopedic surgeon, EMS, and nurses.

Cervical spine fractures are high-risk injuries with the potential for devastating neurological sequelae. Hence, a trained spine specialist should carry out subsequent evaluation and treatment. All patients with cervical fractures should be closely monitored with a follow-up to ensure continued cervical stability and healing. Any fracture extending into the foramina transversarium from C2 to C6 should be evaluated for the possibility of co-occurring vertebral artery injury. This is most often done with a CT angiogram.

Each fracture described should warrant cervical collar placement with surgery indicated for restoration of cervical lordosis, decompression of the spinal cord, or fixation as determined by the instability of ligamentous components.

The outcome of cervical spine fractures depends on the neurological deficit at the time of presentation and concomitant head injury.
