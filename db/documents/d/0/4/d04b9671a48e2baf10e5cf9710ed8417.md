Transmission electron microscopy reveals abundant rER and Golgi apparatuses in the cell cytoplasm. These organelles increase in number during wound repair as fibroblasts become "activated." The close approximation of fibroblasts to collagen fibrils is easily visualized. Fibroblasts may also differentiate into myofibroblasts, a cell that possesses qualities of both fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. The actin filaments of myofibroblasts distinguish this cell from a standard fibroblast (no actin content). Myofibroblasts differ from smooth muscle cells in that they lack a surrounding basal lamina.
