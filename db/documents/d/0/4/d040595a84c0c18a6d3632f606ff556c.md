Phototherapy is a safe, easy, and effective treatment modality in a number of dermatoses with lower cost and lower side effects. As the disease burden of dermatological diseases is high, phototherapy has a superior efficacy as compared to topical or systemic therapy in treating the patients of psoriasis, mycosis fungicides, atopic dermatitis, pityriasis Versicolor, chronic urticaria, palmoplantar pustulosis, and vitiligo. Phototherapy prevents patients from the side effects of systemic therapy because it is a safe alternative.
