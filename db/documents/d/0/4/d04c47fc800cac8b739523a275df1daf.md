The prognosis of arsenic toxicity is highly variable dependent on the arsenic state, amount ingested and duration of exposure. Exposure can lead to a multitude of different systemic illnesses. Peripheral neuropathy may resolve with cessation of exposure; however arsenic exposure is a known carcinogen linked to cancer of the skin, lung, and bladder and hepatocellular carcinoma.

The estimates for lethal exposure dose of inorganic arsenic are 0.6mg/kg. Lethal doses resulting in death are estimated to occur 1 to 4 days after ingestion.
