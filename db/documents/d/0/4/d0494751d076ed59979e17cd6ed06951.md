**Modified Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis and Nausea (PUQE Score)**

No single measure can easily define, quantify or evaluate the treatment of hyperemesis. Still, an English pregnancy-specific questionnaire, PUQE (Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis), has been developed to assess the severity of emesis (nausea and vomiting) in pregnancy. This questionnaire contains three questions regarding the time-span of nausea, vomiting, and retching, respectively, as well as one question assessing the global psychological and physical quality of life (QOL). Initially, the questionnaire evaluated symptoms during the last 12 hours, but it has been modified to encompass 24 hours and the whole of the first trimester of pregnancy.
