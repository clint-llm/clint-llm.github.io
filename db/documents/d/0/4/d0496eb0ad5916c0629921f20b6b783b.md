Simulation in training is already of enormous value in the context of healthcare education, however, unlike other high-risk industry training, the use of simulation training in surgery remains confined to courses which often exceed trainee study budgets and have long waiting lists due to immense demand. High-fidelity modalities such as ‘Sim-man’ are routinely used for Advance Life Support (ALS) courses. Low-fidelity models such as a box-trainers are often used in laparoscopic skills courses; these allow the practice of instrument handling and special awareness.

To optimize orthopedic training using simulation, educators must provide instruction to trainees and implement the need for a level of proficiency in the simulated setting before progression into the OR. Protected time in a simulated environment as part of the trainees’ teaching program with the aim to encourage participation in simulation-based education and engagement with the Dreyfus model of skills development will ensure competence before carrying out skills on a real patient. The Dreyfus model shares the characteristics of trainees at various stages of skills development and highlights the need for trainee assessment from ‘novices’ to ‘advanced beginners.’

Drop-in sessions for clinical skills learning are often offered to medical students to allow DP and experiential learning.
