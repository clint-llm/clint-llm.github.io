In developed regions, acute diarrhea is almost always a benign, self-resolving condition, that subsides in a few days. The duration of illness and clinical presentation vary on the basis of the etiology of diarrhea and the host factors. For instance, rotavirus commonly presents with vomiting, dehydration, and more workdays lost than nonrotavirus diarrhea.

Knowledge of certain factors associated with diarrhea, such as volume, consistency, color, and frequency is helpful in distinguishing the source. The following table outlines these characteristics that can be utilized to narrow down the list of differential diagnoses:

Mucoid/bloody

Usually normal

- Rotavirus

- Adenovirus

- Calicivirus

- Astrovirus

- Norovirus

- E coli

- Klebsiella

- Clostridium perfringens

- Cholera species

- Vibrio species

- Giardia species

- Cryptosporidium species



- Escherichia Coli (enteroinvasive, enterohemorrhagic)

- Shigella species

- Salmonella species

- Campylobacter species

- Yersinia species

- Aeromonas species

- Plesiomonas species

- Clostridium difficile

- Entamoeba organisms

Daycare centers are also responsible for certain causes of diarrhea:

- Certain pathogens spread quickly in daycare. These include rotavirus; astrovirus; calicivirus; and Shigella, Giardia, Campylobacter, and Cryptosporidium

- The increasing trend of daycare usage has increased the occurrence of rotavirus and Cryptosporidium-related infections.

As various foods can lead to gastrointestinal infections, food history is important:

- Consumption of raw or contaminated food items is commonly associated with infectious diarrhea.

- Organisms that are commonly found associated with infectious diarrhea include the following:
            
              
- Dairy products - Campylobacter and Salmonella species
              
              
- Eggs - Salmonella species
              
              
- Meats - Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter, Aeromonas, and Salmonella species
              
              
- Poultry - Campylobacter species
              
              
- Ground beef - Enterohemorrhagic E coli
              
              
- Seafood - Astrovirus, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, and Vibrio species
              
              
- Pork - C perfringens, Y enterocolitica
              
              
- Oysters - Calicivirus, Plesiomonas, and Vibrio species
              
              
- Vegetables - Aeromonas species and C perfringens
              
              
- The American Academy of Pediatrics advises that when evaluating children with persistent diarrhea, excessive flatulence, bloating, and abdominal pain, the provider should determine the quantity of juice being consumed.

Swimming pools harbor Shigella species and Aeromonas organisms are causative agents of infectious diarrhea in the marine environment.

Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Entamoeba stay unaffected by water chlorination; therefore, suspicion for these parasites should be high in contaminated water. Also, there is an association between Campylobacter infection, agriculture, and drinking water.

Travel history is important as it may direct towards the underlying causative agent of infectious diarrhea. Enterotoxigenic E coli is by far the leading cause of traveler's diarrhea. Following are some common associations between certain areas and causative pathogens:

Australia, Canada, Europe
