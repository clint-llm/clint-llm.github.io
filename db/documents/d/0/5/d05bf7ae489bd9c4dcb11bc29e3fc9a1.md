All patients with dyslipidemia should be educated about dietary and lifestyle changes in addition to pharmacotherapy. A nutritionist referral can significantly benefit patients in learning details about various dietary changes that are necessary.

Counseling about lifestyle changes such as exercise, reduced screen time, cessation of smoking, and reducing alcohol intake are important. The consequences of uncontrolled dyslipidemia should be explained to improve compliance with therapy since it is a silent disease for most of its course.

If pharmacotherapy is required, the risks and benefits of medications should be discussed with the patients. Counseling should be done regarding the potential adverse effects and the need for long-term monitoring and medication use.
