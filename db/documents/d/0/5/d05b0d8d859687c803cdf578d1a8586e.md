The flow of urine from the renal pelvis to the ureter depends on two main factors, firstly, the pressure within the renal pelvis and its compliance, which is affected by the produced urine volume, the internal diameter of the UPJ, and the collecting system. Secondly, the peristaltic activity of the ureter, which might be affected by the abnormal smooth muscle arrangements, absence, or hypertrophy, in the proximal ureteral walls affecting the peristaltic function. With the latter being the main cause of congenital ureteropelvic junction obstruction.

Less commonly as a congenital cause of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), an accessory renal vessel arising from the renal vessels, aorta, vena cava, or the iliac vessels can interfere with the collecting system.

On the other hand, acquired stenosis of the UPJ due to the previously mentioned causes can result in reactive fibrosis in the affected ureteral segment, and annual strictures might appear.

Most of the UPJOs seen are partial. In this type of obstruction, there is an increase in the production of the vasoactive peptides and cytokines as interleukin (IL)-5Â and eotaxin-2 from the urothelium, acting as a chemoattractant for leukocytes, lead to inflammatory cell infiltration. By changing the eicosanoid elaboration in the kidney, the monocytic infiltration is believed to affect the renal blood supply and decrease the total GFR in the affected kidney, however, single nephron GFR will be increased. A good understanding of the pathophysiology of the UPJO might guide the provider toward an early intervention to prevent worse outcomes.

Similarly, the activation of the renin-angiotensin system can cause a reduction in the GFR of the affected kidney by its vasoconstrictor effect.
