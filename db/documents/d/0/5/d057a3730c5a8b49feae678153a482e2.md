MC is a highly variable but potentially devastating condition affecting patients and their families from early childhood throughout their lives. As this is a genetic condition, there is an important role for genetic testing and counseling in order to test other family members and advise family planning. Effective and safe care of MC, therefore, requires coordination of several medical specialties, including pediatrics and clinical genetics, as well as input from physiotherapists, dieticians, occupational therapists, and psychologists. The role of this interprofessional team is now well-established in specialized centers.
