The differential diagnosis for refeeding syndrome is unique in the sense that it is a diagnosis of exclusion requiring other more acute conditions to be ruled out. Fluid overload is one, which causes a decrease in many of the electrolytes in plasma. This could lead to grossly depleted amounts of Na, K, Mg, or P. The after-effects of refeeding syndrome must also be evaluated. Independent cardiac arrhythmias, which are high risk from electrolyte imbalances, must also be ruled out, such as long QT syndrome.
