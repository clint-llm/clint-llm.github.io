Electrical alternans is the alternating voltage noted in the QRS complexes seen on an ECG; refer to the image below. Electrical alternans can be diagnosed by the varying changes in the amplitude of the QRS complex. Of note, T-wave alternans can be present as well. This review focuses on the QRS complex alternans. These changes are thought to be caused by the anterior-posterior swinging of the heart with each contraction in the fluid-filled pericardial sac. As the heart swings, the electrical signals detected by the electrodes travel over a greater distance through the fluid resulting in reduced voltage at the electrodes. Alternans may also be seen in other physiology including myocardial disease, pneumothorax or emphysema wherein the electrical conductivity of the tissues between the heart and the electrodes are affected causing variations in the QRS amplitudes. Other causes of electrical alternans can include AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, bundle branch block, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WOW), late premature ventricular complexes where the underlying change in conduction pathway is responsible for the change in the QRS amplitude observed on the ECG. In some ventricular tachycardias, changes in ion concentrations around the myocardium can result in regional changes in potassium causing varied action potential instability creating an alternans type pattern as different regions of the heart depolarize at varied levels of excitation.
