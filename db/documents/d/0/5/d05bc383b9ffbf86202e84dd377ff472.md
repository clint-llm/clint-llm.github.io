The pathophysiology of Bochdalek hernias and congenital diaphragmatic hernias, in general, is poorly understood. A Bochdalek hernia is a type of congenital hernia due to a developmental defect in the formation of the diaphragm. At around 4 weeks of gestation in humans, the diaphragm starts to form from several infoldings. Anteriorly, the central tendon is proposed to form from the septum transversum. Posterolateral infoldings form the pleuroperitoneal membranes. The pleuroperitoneal canal, in turn, communicates between the pleural and peritoneal cavities via the foramen of Bochdalek at the posterior aspect of the developing diaphragm. This communication normally closes around week 8 of gestation.

Herniation of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity can interfere with normal development of the lungs and can result in a varying degree of pulmonary hypoplasia (PH) and persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPH).
