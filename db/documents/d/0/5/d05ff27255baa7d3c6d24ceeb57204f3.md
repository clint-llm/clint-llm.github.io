Pierre Marie and Eugen von Bamberger first described the syndrome in 1890 and 1891. For this reason, secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is also referred to as Pierre Marie- Bamberger syndrome. Marie first coined the term hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, referring to the more prevalent association with pulmonary diseases like lung carcinoma, cystic fibrosis, or pulmonary tuberculosis. Ninety-five to 97% of reported cases of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy are of secondary origin.

The causes of secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy can be broadly divided into generalized with the symmetrical involvement of multiple bones and localized disease. The majority of generalized disease is of pulmonary origin; hence the name hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA). There are, however, several diseases of extrapulmonary origin that can cause generalized secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.

**Causes of Generalized Pleuro-Pulmonary HPOA**

- Bronchogenic carcinoma

- Metastatic disease

- Mesothelioma

- Solitary fibrous tumor of pleura

- Cystic fibrosis

- Pulmonary tuberculosis

- Chronic infections

- Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation

- Sarcoidosis

**Causes of Generalized Extra-Pulmonary HPOA**

**Cardiac**

- Congenital cyanotic heart disease

- Atrial myxoma

- Infective endocarditis

**Gastrointestinal**

- Polyposis

- Cancer

- Inflammatory bowel disease

- Achalasia

- Laxative abuse

**Hepatobiliary**

- Cirrhosis

- Biliary atresia

- Primary biliary cirrhosis

- Wilson disease

- Carcinoma

- Primary sclerosing cholangitis

**Miscellaneous**

- Thymoma

- POEMS syndrome

- Myelofibrosis

- Hematological malignancy

**Causes of Localized HPOA**

- Infected vascular graft

- Infected arteritis

- Patent ductus arteriosus

- Aneurysms
