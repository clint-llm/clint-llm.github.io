Cytomegalovirus colitis occurs most commonly in immunocompromised hosts, including patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), organ transplantation, hematological malignancy, cancer therapy, and corticosteroid therapy. However, colitis can also occur in healthy patients without immunodeficiency. These patients usually have a median age of 68 years and have accompanying symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hematochezia or melena. The outcomes are typically favorable, including resolution without antiviral treatment in nearly 25% of these patients.

The work of Ko JH et al., in a case-control study, identified several risk factors associated with CMV colitis in immunocompetent individuals, including renal diseases, patients on hemodialysis, neurological disorders, rheumatic disease, or those in the intensive care unit, or exposed to antibiotics, antacids, corticosteroids, or red blood cell transfusion within one month of diagnosis of colitis.

Cytomegalovirus colitis is also associated with acute, severe ulcerative colitis, particularly in patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids.
