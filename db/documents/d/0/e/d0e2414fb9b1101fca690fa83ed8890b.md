**Procedure**

Pain is commonly associated with this procedure even when an adequate penile block is performed. Phenylephrine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist that can cause headaches, dizziness, blurry vision, hypertension, bradycardia, tachycardia, and irregular cardiac rhythms. Because of these risks, the patient’s vitals need to be closely monitored, and the dosage of phenylephrine should be limited to 1000 micrograms in 1 hour. Recurrence is possible and is an indication that the patient may require a more invasive procedure.

**Post-procedure**

A penile hematoma can form following puncture of the corpora but can be reduced with an appropriate pressure dressing. The duration of the priapism is directly correlated with future erectile dysfunction due to associated fibrosis. Penile length loss can also occur due to fibrosis.
