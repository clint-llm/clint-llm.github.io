CCTA is a generally accepted means of testing for the presence and severity of coronary artery stenosis. It is an anatomical test that can be used in patients presenting with chest pain who have an intermediate pre-test probability of having obstructive CAD. In these patients, it can be used in place of, or complementary to, functional tests. A CAC score can be obtained during the non-contrast phase of the CCTA, which may be appropriate per the most recent Multimodality Appropriate Use Criteria for the Detection of Stable Ischemic Heart Disease guidelines.  CCTA also maintains a strong recommendation from professional organizations for the diagnosis of a patient with suspected congenital anomalous coronary arteries.
