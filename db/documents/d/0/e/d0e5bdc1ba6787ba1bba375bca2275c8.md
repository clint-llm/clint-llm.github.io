Meningocele usually has no neural involvement and without any acute neurological complications, hence a favorable prognosis. Spina bifida aperta usually presents a skin defect with the looming risk of CSF leak, whereas the occult forms have no visible skin opening. The prevalence of spina bifida at birth has decreased by 23% over ten years between 1995 and 2004 after the Food and Drug Administration mandated fortification of all cereal and grain products with folic acid. In clinical practice, the prognosis of patients with meningocele is excellent, and simple surgical repair is adequate.
