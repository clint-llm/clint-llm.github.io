The cartilaginous physeal plate of a long bone is divided into specific areas or zones. Each area has its distinct characteristics. There are 5 zones in an epiphyseal cartilaginous plate. These are the resting zome, the proliferative zone, the hypertrophic zone, the zone of provisional calcification, and the ossification zone. The resting zone is composed of a germinal layer of cells that differentiate into chondrocytes. In the proliferating zone, the chondrocytes divide by mitosis and begin to organize into columns of cells within a matrix of proteoglycans. In the hypertrophic zone, the chondrocytes grow larger and begin to differentiate terminally. This is the weakest zone of the physis, and it is the zone through which fractures occur. In the zone of provisional calcification, the matrix becomes calcified and is ready for osteogenesis (bone formation) chondrocytes die. In the zone of ossification, the calcified matrix is replaced by a bony matrix and osteocytes.
