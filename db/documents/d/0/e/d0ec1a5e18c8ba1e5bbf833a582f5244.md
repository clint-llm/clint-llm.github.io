Cordotomy is the name of a surgical procedure aimed at destroying the pain-conducting tracts of the spinal cord. First performed in 1912 by neurosurgeons William Spiller and Edward Martin, they found the cordotomy to effectively decrease temperature and pain sensations in patients who suffer from painful conditions. It was originally widely used for chronic pain, but now it has been adapted for use in patients with cancer only.   The open procedure is rarely performed due to the high risk and complication rates observed previously.

The open method underwent further adaptation to a percutaneous cervical cordotomy in 1963. In the 1990s, with improvements in pain management, the cordotomy again fell out of favor. However, it is still a palliative option for therapy-resistant pain. Given the population which receives this procedure, there is severely limited availability of studies testing its long-term effects. There is a case study of a patient with seminoma who underwent a right-sided percutaneous cervical cordotomy and chemotherapy. The physicians found the patient, five years later, to have continued sensory impact with minimal impact on motor and autonomic function.
