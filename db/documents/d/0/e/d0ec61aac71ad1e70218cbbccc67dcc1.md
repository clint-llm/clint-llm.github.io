Anterior tarsal tunnel syndrome occurs due to compression or entrapment of the deep peroneal nerve. Most commonly, the deep peroneal nerve becomes entrapped beneath the inferior extensor retinaculum secondary to acute trauma or repetitive micro-trauma, however other causes have also been reported. This activity describes the evaluation and management of anterior tarsal tunnel syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review treatment considerations for patients with anterior tarsal tunnel syndrome. 
- Summarize the risk factors for developing anterior tarsal tunnel syndrome. 
- Describe the common physical exam findings associated with anterior tarsal tunnel syndrome.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by anterior tarsal tunnel syndrome.
