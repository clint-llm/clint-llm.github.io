The three primary functions of the nose are to aid in respiration, to filter and defend against external particles and allergens, and to enable olfaction. The nasal cycle is a physiologic alternation of resistance between the two nasal airways, created by changes in congestion and decongestion, and may aid in respiratory defense.

**Respiration**

As air is inhaled, the nasal cavity assists in respiration by preparing air for oxygen exchange. Due to the narrow nature of the cavity, inhaled air is rapidly introduced to a large mucosal surface area with a rich supply of blood at body temperature. This process facilitates rapid acclimation of the inhaled air to temperature better suited for the lungs.

**Defense**

The nasal cavity also aids in defense of respiratory tissues. Mucus secretions trap particles and antigens carried into the respiratory system during inhalation. As pathogens become trapped in these secretions, they are bound by secretory IgA dimers (a component of the adaptive immune response), which prevents attachment of pathogens to host epithelium, thus hindering invasion. Mucus can also contain IgE, which is involved in the allergic response and can cause a pathologic type 1 hypersensitivity reaction.

**Olfaction**

Additionally, the nasal cavity enables olfaction. Olfaction helps to identify sources of nearby danger or nutrition, as well as influencing mood and sexuality.
