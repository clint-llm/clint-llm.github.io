The vagal nucleus consists of four nuclei located in the medulla oblongata. The three main nuclei are the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (cranial nerve [CN] X), nucleus ambiguus, and the solitary nucleus. The fourth nucleus has a minor input from the vagus nerve, the spinal trigeminal nucleus, which receives the main input from the trigeminal nerve. These nuclei all contribute to the various functions of CN X as well as the function of several other cranial nerves. The functions of CN X include motor, sensory, taste, and chemoreception involving numerous organ systems of the body, such as the heart, pharynx, tongue, and gastrointestinal system. Due to the diverse actions of CN X, there are many clinical connections associated with vagal nuclei pathology.
