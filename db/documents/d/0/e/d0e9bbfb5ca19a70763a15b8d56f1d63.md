Hypoplastic lips are the primary indication for lip augmentation, which may be age-related or not. While a variety of injectable fillers are available (e.g., hyaluronic acid), they are temporary, requiring repeated injections at several month intervals to sustain lasting results. For patients who have needle-phobia or who are looking for a more permanent and more cost-effective solution to lip augmentation (relative to undergoing repeated injections with fillers), lip implantation with an alloplastic implant is the option of choice.

Areas of the lip/peri-oral region addressed with lip implantation

- Decreased vermilion height

- Decreased pout (lack of effacement)

- Perioral lines and wrinkles

- Decreased volume (fat and muscle atrophy)

- Excess visible dentition

Guidelines to improve aesthetic outcomes with lip augmentation (to avoid "duck" or "sausage" lips

- Lip surface area: the most attractive lip augmentation should create roughly a 50% increase in surface area from baseline. Note: The lip surface area should equal approximately 10% of the height of the lower third of the face.

- Lip vertical height (assessed on frontal view): the upper to lower lip height ratio should be between 1.6:1 and 2:1 (i.e., the lower lip should be taller than the upper lip).

- Lip projection (assessed on lateral view): referencing a straight line from the subnasale to the pogonion, the upper lip projection should be 3.5 mm anterior to the line and the lower lip 2.2 mm, roughly equal to a 1.6:1 ratio (i.e., the upper lip projections should be slightly more than the lower lip)

- Lip width: should be approximately 40% of the width of the lower face
