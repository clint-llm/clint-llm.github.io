**Radiological Assessment**

The most common radiological tools for imaging breast tissue are mammography, ultrasound, and MRI.

Mammography is the first-line imaging for women over 35 who present with a new breast mass. Mammography is also helpful in screening asymptomatic women who fit their regional screening criteria. This process involves obtaining X-ray imaging in both a craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique plane to ensure imaging of all breast tissue. Mammography tends to have higher specificity and lower sensitivity than ultrasound in all cases.

Ultrasound imaging is preferred to mammography in younger women and men as their breast tissue tends to be denser, with a much lower proportion of fatty tissue. This dense tissue impedes the accuracy of mammography and makes it more challenging to detect microcalcifications.

MRI can also be useful in the assessment of a new breast lump. It is not routinely used as it is more expensive with longer wait times but shows high sensitivity for detecting and delineating breast masses. It is the preferred modality for patients who have had previous breast augmentation surgery as the breast implants can distort the underlying parenchyma in mammography or ultrasound. It may also be a recommended approach for high-risk patients, such as those with known underlying BRCA mutations.

Imaging reports are standardized using a tool called BIRADS – Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (fifth edition). This standard allows breast imaging to be described according to a certain structure: density of breast tissue, presence and location of a mass or masses, calcifications, asymmetry, and any associated features.

- BIRADS 0 – insufficient or incomplete study

- BIRADS 1 – normal study

- BIRADS 2 – benign features

- BIRADS 3 – probably benign (<2% risk of malignancy)

- BIRADS 4 – suspicious features (divided into categories 4a, 4b, and 4c depending on the likelihood of malignancy)

- BIRADS 5 – probably malignant (>95% chance of malignancy)

- BIRADS 6 – malignant (proven malignant on tissue biopsy)

The BIRADS system includes different classifications for masses depending on the imaging modality in question. In mammography, to be considered a mass, the lesion must be visible in two different projections, must have convex outer borders, and must be denser in the center than on the periphery.

**Pathology Analysis**

The third aspect of triple assessment requires an invasive procedure to allow pathological diagnosis. Pathology analysis involves either fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) or core biopsy.

The need for pathological analysis has undergone review and, in some instances, is thought to be unnecessary if the physical examination and radiological assessments are negative in a patient of low risk (i.e., young patients under the age of 25).

It is suggested that a minimum of six epithelial cell clusters may provide a reasonable balance to the reduction of false-negative FNAC smears and an inappropriate rate of inadequate smears. The lesion, which is well circumscribed and mobile with a typical catch a mouse appearance, is characteristic of a fibroadenoma.

The histological diagnostic features of fibroadenoma can be described as sheets of uniformly distributed epithelial cells that are typically arranged in a honeycomb pattern. There is a presence of foam cells and apocrine cells and an absence of excessive mitotic activity or anaplasia. Cytopathologic features of fibroadenoma include hypercellularity with characteristic monolayer “staghorn” sheets of benign-featured epithelial cells mixed with myoepithelial cells. The sheets have an antler-like configuration on their edges. Moreover, the background of the aspirate is composed of numerous bipolar nuclei.

Many other investigations can be carried out in analyzing breast masses, depending on the likely differential and the level of resources available.

Baseline blood tests are usually recommended in a patient likely to undergo surgery, emphasizing hemoglobin, bone profile, and liver function tests in case of suspected hepatic metastasis. Inflammatory markers and blood cultures should be considered where a breast abscess is suspected. Tumor markers such as Ca27.29 and Ca15-3 can be used for prognostication and monitoring for recurrence.

Nuclear medicine, PET scanning, and bone isotope scanning may help to assess the metastatic disease. Genome-mapping may be an option, for example, if a patient is suspected of carrying the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.

The utilization of biological markers to provide details about clinical characteristics has been considered a well-established part of a newly diagnosed breast mass that can give information on prognosis independent of other findings. The resultant information would assist in patient's risk stratification within predetermined clinical classifications and further identify a sub-group of patients who would benefit most from adjuvant therapy. An optimal prognostic marker, with the specific capability to predict the relapse risk, would assist a precise patient selection among those with node-negative breast cancer to be offered adjuvant therapy.

Several alternative prognostic markers have been tested to optimize a clinically relevant marker in a newly diagnosed breast mass. Accordingly, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines has approved the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELIZA)level of uPA/PAI-1 as a prognostic marker in a newly diagnosed breast cancer with a couple of significant indexes, including lack of lymph node involvement and hormone-receptor positivity. However, the use of other biological markers of tumoral proliferation and or tumor suppressors, including Ki-67 and P53, in the management process of the breast mass has not been well-established yet.

Evaluating predictive markers, with the advantage of providing a certain beneficial target treatment modality accordingly, has been the area of research interest in breast cancer. Including a couple of well-studied markers, estrogen receptor (ER), and HER2 in the routine evaluation of a newly diagnosed breast cancer, has been recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines. The estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2-positive breast cancer patients would potentially benefit from target therapy with tamoxifen and trastuzumab, accordingly. Moreover, utilizing the novel transcriptional analysis measures has enabled the assessment of mRNA levels with microarray technology, and provided the targeted therapy, accordingly.

One of the validated multiparameter tests for recurrence prediction purposes in breast cancer is the Oncotype DX assay. ASCO has approved this quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test to be applied on paraffin-fixed breast tissue and evaluate 21-genes, including 16 cancer genes. The resultant recurrence score (RS), varying from 0 to 100, would predict the course of a specific breast mass without lymph node involvement and hormone-receptor-positive, which was under tamoxifen therapy. The mentioned multigene panel was further examined in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NASBP-14).
