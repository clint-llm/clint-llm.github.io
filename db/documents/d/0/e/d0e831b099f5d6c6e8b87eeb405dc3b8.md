**Imaging**

- Xrays – CXR, AP pelvis

- Inlet view – allows evaluation of anterior or posterior translation.
- Outlet view – allows evaluation of coronal plane deformity.
- Flamingo views – for assessment of chronic pelvic ring instability

- CT scan – should be obtained for all pelvic ring injuries.

- Helps to assess the extent of the sacral injury

- MRI – rarely indicated in acute pelvic ring trauma

**Classification**

Tile Classification

Type A – Stable

- A1 – Fractures not involving the pelvic ring

- A2 – Stable minimally displaced fractures of the pelvic ring

Type B – Rotationally unstable, vertically stable

- B1 – Open book

- B2 – Lateral compression ipsilateral

- B3 – Lateral compression contralateral

Type C – Rotationally and vertically unstable

- C1 – Unilateral

- C2 – Bilateral

- C3 – Associated with an acetabular fracture

Young and Burgess Classification

- Lateral Compression (LC)

- LC1 – Anterior sacral compression fracture +/- pubic rami fractures (often a stable pattern)
- LC2 – Crescent fracture +/- pubic rami fracture (unstable)
- LC3 - LC 1 or 2 with a contralateral APC injury

- Anterior-Posterior Compression (APC)

- APC1 – Minor symphysis widening or distracted ramus fracture
- APC 2 – Opening of symphysis greater than 2.5 cm, disruption of sacrospinous and anterior SI ligaments, assumes posterior SI ligaments remain intact
- APC3 – Complete disruption of symphysis and SI joint

- Vertical Shear (VS)

- VS – Vertical displacement of hemipelvis represents complete instability.

- Combined Mechanism (CM)

- CM – Any combination

Denis Classification of Sacral Fractures

- Zone 1 – Lateral to the sacral foramen

- Zone 2 – Entering sacral foramen

- Zone 3 – Medial to sacral foramen – Highest incidence of neurologic injury including nerve root or cauda equina

Lumbopelvic Dissociation

- Fracture pattern which renders the base of the spine discontinuous with the pelvis requiring fixation

- Beyond the scope of this activity

- Bilateral sacral fractures have a high incidence of lumbopelvic dissociation, and CT scan should be reviewed carefully for coronal plane sacral disruptions
