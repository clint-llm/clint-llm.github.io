Initial diagnostic workup may include a variety of imaging techniques. CT venography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), MRI venography, and multiplanar venography have been useful in verifying a diagnosis, including the determination of external compression. Duplex ultrasonography and plethysmography may help evaluate DVT and venous obstruction but are best used in conjunction with other imaging techniques. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound and other provocative maneuvers with duplex ultrasound may delineate hemodynamic significance at rest and improve accuracy.

Prior published literature demonstrates that using duplex ultrasound, a > 50% venous diameter reduction at the point of compression and peak velocity ratio > 2.5 in the area of compression in the internal iliac vein indicate clinically significant stenosis.

Patient symptoms have a significant enough impact on quality of life to warrant their consideration due to the permanent nature of these stents. The diameter of veins can vary in size depending on patient position, hydration status, and respiration. Intravenous hydration and intraprocedural instruction to the patient to perform a Valsalva maneuver during IVUS can assist in determining accurate luminal measurements. IVUS is more sensitive to assessing treatable iliofemoral vein stenosis than multiplanar venography and frequently leads to revised treatment plans and the potential for improved clinical outcomes.
