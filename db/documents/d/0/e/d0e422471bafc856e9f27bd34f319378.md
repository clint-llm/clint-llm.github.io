Empyema of the gallbladder is the most severe form of acute cholecystitis. Empyema of the gallbladder is usually the result of a progression of acute cholecystitis in a background of bile stasis and cystic duct obstruction. This is a surgical emergency that requires promptÂ treatment with antibiotics and urgent aspiration/removal of the gallbladder to reduce the risk of septic shock.
