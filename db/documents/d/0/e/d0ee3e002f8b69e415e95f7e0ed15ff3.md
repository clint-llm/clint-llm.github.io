The symptoms vary in severity, location, and duration, but the organs involved include the upper airway, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. In the latter, bowel obstruction creates the symptoms. The skin swelling is deforming but not pruritic; however, if extreme can be painful. The main fear is upper airway swelling that can proceed to asphyxiation. Fortunately, upper airway involvement accounts for only 1 to 3% of attacks.

The attacks last 2 to 5 days, usually slowly increasing and then resolving even without therapy.Â  Triggers, such as trauma, infections, stress, or procedures, are identified in 40% of attacks. Prodromal symptoms, including a rash, referred to as erythema marginatum, occur before the majority of attacks, but the sensitivity and especially specificity are questionable. Other triggers include ACE inhibitors and estrogens.
