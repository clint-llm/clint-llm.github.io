The primary complications of malabsorption are malnutrition, weight loss, steatorrhea, diarrhea, electrolyte imbalance, and vitamin deficiencies. Other complications include nephrolithiasis due to hyperoxaluria, cholelithiasis, transient gastric hypersecretion, bacterial overgrowth, dehydration, hyponatremia, potassium deficiency, magnesium deficiency, renal failure, calcium oxalate kidney stones, cholestasis secondary to intestinal failure-associated liver disease, gallstones, and d-lactic acidosis.

In adults and older children, steatosis is more common, whereas in infants cholestasis and rapid progression to liver fibrosis is the more common progression. Intestinal failure-associated liver disease deaths are seen in between 16% and 60% of deaths in infants on home parenteral nutrition.
