TSS is a toxin-mediated disease that is caused by toxin-producing streptococci or S. aureus. These superantigens bypass the normal pathway for activation of T cells resulting in over-activation of cytokines and inflammatory cells. This then leads to the presenting signs and symptoms of fever, rash, hypotension, and end-organ failure due to capillary leak. Strep pyogenes (GAS) has other toxins that play a role in necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.
