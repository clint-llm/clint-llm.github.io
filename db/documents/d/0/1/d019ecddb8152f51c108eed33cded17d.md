An AC joint injection is a minor procedure that can provide patients significant pain relief. As is the case with all procedures, it is not without risk. The importance of communication and coordination of care amongst the provider, nurse, acting as an interprofessional team, and the patient cannot be understated. Pharmacists may be involved in the preparation of the anesthetic and need to have clear communication with the rest of the team, although, in the outpatient setting, nurses will more likely perform this task. Providers should clearly communicate expectations and precautions to the healthcare team and the patient to drive excellent outcomes. Nurses should also be aware of these return precautions as they are often the first ones on the healthcare team to communicate with the patient and family. They should work with the surgeon to keep the family informed and contact the team if unexpected complications arise. Interprofessional teamwork is crucial to obtaining the best outcomes in AC joint injection therapy. [Level V]
