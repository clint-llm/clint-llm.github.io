Intraoral physical examination of patients with pericoronitis can show localized erythema, edema, purulence, and tenderness to palpation in the posterior mandible, where third molars are erupting. More advanced stages of pericoronitis, lymphadenopathy, fever, facial asymmetry, limited mouth opening, difficulty swallowing, change of voice, or even difficulties breathing can be noticed. Prompt intervention is necessary with the latter symptoms as they may indicate pending airway obstruction.

Pericoronitis can be divided into transientÂ or non-transient based on the position of the erupting tooth that is associated with the condition.

Radiographic examination is an important aid in diagnosing pericoronitis as it can show the positions of erupting third molars if present. A panoramic radiograph is the best method to assess the presence and the position of erupting third molars. Pell and Gregory's classification and Winters's classification can be used to describe the position of third molars. Studies have shown that vertical positioning of third molars is associated with a higher prevalence of pericoronitis, as discussed in the etiology section.
