Pseudobulbar palsyÂ epidemiology depends on the cause that has led to corticobulbar pathway damage. A study on the prevalence of motor neuron disease, including pseudobulbar palsy, reveals that prevalence increases, particularly after 50 years of age. Incidence is higher in males compared to females among all age groups.

Pseudobulbar apathy affects 1 in 5 patients with acute stroke and 1 in 8 patients with chronic stroke.
