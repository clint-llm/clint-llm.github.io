Patients who develop blunt or penetrating trauma to the eye commonly have multiple ocular injuries. Most of these complications are under the management by additional ophthalmic specialists and are likely to be of sufficient severity to require operative intervention. Therefore vitrectomy may have to be delayed or expedited depending on the extent of the other ocular injuries. In this setting, it is essential to have a collaborative approach and effective communication between the ophthalmic surgeons and ophthalmology nursing staff. There is level three evidence for this approach to PPV if needed in the setting of multiple traumatic ocular injuries.

Clinicians learn PPV during ophthalmology residency and vitreoretinal surgical fellowship. Studies have shown that ophthalmology residents perform a limited number of PPVs during their residency and are probably not competent at performing it by the end of their residency.
