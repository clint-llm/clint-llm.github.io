A Step-by-step organized procedural pathway is paramount to having an ideal outcome for this procedure. The first step in this procedure is diagnosing the patient's cervical somatic dysfunction. Then ensuring that a patient is a candidate for HVLA therapy by verifying that there are no existing contraindications.

Diagnosing cervical somatic dysfunction involves a careful manual examination of the atlantooccipital joint with the patient in the supine position, comparing the depths of the occipital sulci. The atlantoaxial joint is examined by flexing the patient's cervical spine, locking the atlantooccipital joint and the C2-C7 joints. The range of motion of the atlantoaxial joint is then evaluated by slowly rotating the cervical spine from right to left, noting any restricted movement when comparing the rotation to each side.  C2-C7 are also evaluated with the patient in the supine position, with careful attention directed to the freedom of movement of each segment with palpation to the right and left.  With the cervical spine positioned in the neutral, flexed, and extended positions, the practitioner should determine which segments are rotationally translated (manually displaced) more easily from one side versus the contralateral side.  A lack of equality at any level of translation of an individual vertebra indicates restriction at that level.

HVLA techniques are most successful when the patient is relaxed. Myofascial techniques may be instituted before HVLA therapy to relax muscle groups further. This is achieved by applying a slow and gentle force to loosen hypertonic muscles.  By delivering perpendicular and parallel traction and stretching motions with the fingertips, the muscles and soft tissues will "release."

When the restricted barrier is identified (for example, C4 flexed rotated left, side bent left), the practitioner will take the restricted barrier into the opposite orientation. In this example, the practitioner would engage C4 in the extended, rotated right, and side bent right position.

The patient is instructed to relax. If the patient does not adequately relax, the treatment will fail, and the corrective thrust cannot be executed appropriately. The physician should instruct the patient to take multiple deep breaths, further engaging the restrictive barrier in the exhalation phase. The physician then will execute a short effective thrust to move the dysfunctional segment through the restriction barrier. The ability to perform a successful adjustment with HVLA therapy will, at times, elicit a "popping" sound. The restrictive barrier should be engaged entirely before applying the thrust. Finally, after executing the HVLA technique, the practitioner should reassess the range of motion and the somatic dysfunction treated. A successful result would lead to approximately 70% or greater return in the restricted range of motion and/or relief of pain.

Patients will be discharged after thirty minutes of observation with instructions to hydrate appropriately. The patient will follow up in one week for further evaluation and reassessment.
