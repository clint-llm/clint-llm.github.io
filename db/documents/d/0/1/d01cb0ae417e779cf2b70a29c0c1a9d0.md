Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy (CCM) is a type of cardiac dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis without known cardiac disease. First described in 1953, CCM is characterized by an impaired cardiac response to stress, a hyperdynamic circulatory state, both diastolic and systolic dysfunctions, and various electrophysiologic abnormalities (most notably QT prolongation). This disease occurs in up to 50% of patients with cirrhosis, regardless of etiology. Alcohol use disorder and hemochromatosis are additional risk factors in the development of cardiac disease. As CCM manifests under stress, it remains an under-recognized condition, and no standardized treatment regimen has yet been established. A significant improvement, or reversal, of CCM has been noted in patients after liver transplantation.
