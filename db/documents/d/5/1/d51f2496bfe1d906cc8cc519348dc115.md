The diagnosis of CCHD might be missed prenatally, or during birth hospitalization; therefore, clinicians should be aware of its clinical manifestation during the first weeks of life. History alone may be not sufficient to differentiate between congenital heart disease, pulmonary disease, an inborn error of metabolism and sepsis. Additional physical exam findings and diagnostic evaluations would be necessary to identify CCHD. Thorough family history must also be obtained giving the genetic component of CCHD.

The history associated with CCHD include:

- Irritability or decreased level of activity

- Diaphoresis and crying with feedings

- Decrease amount of formula per feed

- History of longer time per breastfeed

- Poor weight gain

- Fast and/or irregular breathing

- Bluish or purple discoloration of the skin or mucous membranes

- Older children may present with exercise intolerance, including dyspnea, diaphoresis cyanosis or palpitations during exercise

Physical findings associated with CCHD include:

- Cyanosis

- Tachypnea

- Increased work of breathing

- Pulmonary edema

- Tachycardia

- Heart murmur

- Hepatomegaly (Liver edge located more than 2.5 cm below the right costal margin)

- Weak femoral pulses

- Signs of poor perfusion or shock

- Lethargy
