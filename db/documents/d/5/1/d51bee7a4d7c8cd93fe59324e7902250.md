Preparticipation physicals are mandated in nearly every organized athletic program and are performed with the intent of identifying any condition that may preclude an athlete from safely participating in athletic events. It is also noteworthy that a preparticipation sports physical exam may be the only time that a child or adolescent actually sees a medical professional with the presumption that many of America’s youth do not regularly undergo physical exams or checkups. Thus, it is important to utilize this opportunity to screen athletes for physical and or psychological ailments that may warrant further workup and treatment by other healthcare professionals.
