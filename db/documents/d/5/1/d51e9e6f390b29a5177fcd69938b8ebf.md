Presentation of hypercarbia can be acute or chronic, with a range in severity and symptoms depending on the underlying process. Most often, patients with acutely developing hypercarbia will complain of dyspnea, fatigue, and confusion that can progress to somnolence. Other potential symptoms can include headache, flushed skin, and nausea. For chronic hypercarbia, patients will often note dyspnea on exertion, but also fatigue, irritability, and headache. If possible, a full medical history should be obtained, including past medical history, social history, and medication list.

Physical exam findings can also be variable. Reduced respiratory rate, shallow breathing, use of accessory muscles of respiration, altered level of consciousness, fever, diaphoresis, or wheezing may be present. Hypercarbia is often accompanied by hypoxia, and some of the signs and symptoms will overlap. For patients with low oxygen saturation noted on pulse oximetry, hypercarbia should be considered.

Patients with drug overdose may have signs of illicit drug use or cardiac murmur. For patients with chronic lung disease, wheezing, or rhonchi may be present. It is important to assess patients for the use of chronic oxygen therapy, as excess supplemental oxygen delivery (to saturations more than 94%) can cause oxygen-induced hypercarbia.
