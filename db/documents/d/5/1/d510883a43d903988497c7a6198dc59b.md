- Radiographic evidence of resolving pneumonia or persistent ground-glass opacity should always raise suspicion for adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth.

- Diagnosis of adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth should be avoided from pure cytology or core biopsy specimens without evaluating an entire excised specimen for an invasive component.

- The presence of an invasive component excludes the diagnosis of AIS or erstwhile bronchioloalveolar carcinoma.

- Histologic evidence of lepidic tumor growth has mirrored a uniform CT appearance of ground glass pattern, a favorable prognostic pattern, and, therefore, the scope for targeted therapy as well as limited surgical resection.

- The diagnosis of AIS, MIA, and even AAH are likely to grow in the recent and coming years due to their incidental diagnosis by the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial.

- What was previously known as mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma is now recognized as invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma.
