There are multiple steps involved in heme synthesis. Eight enzymes accomplish this process, four of which work in the mitochondria and four in the cytosol. The process starts in the mitochondria, where  ALA (aminolevulinic acid) synthase links glycine and succinyl coenzyme A to form ALA. Steps 2 through 5 occur in the cytosol. Next, ALA dehydratase takes two molecules of ALA and produces porphobilinogen (PBG). In the third step, porphobilinogen deaminase takes four molecules of PBG and produces hydroxymethylbilane. Next, uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase takes hydroxymethylbilane and produces uroporphyrinogen III. In the fifth step, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase takes uroporphyrinogen III and produces coproporphyrinogen III. The final three steps of heme synthesis occur in the mitochondria. Coproporphyrinogen III is then transformed to protoporphyrinogen IX by coproporphyrinogen oxidase. The seventh step occurs when protoporphyrinogen oxidase converts protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX. The eighth and final step of heme synthesis is the addition of Fe to protoporphyrin IX by ferrochelatase, producing a heme molecule.
