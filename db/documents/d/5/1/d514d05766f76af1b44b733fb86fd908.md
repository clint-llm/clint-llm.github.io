**Serum Calcium and Parathyroid Hormone Levels**

Serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels****are performed to rule out Albrightâ€™s hereditary osteodystrophy.

Conventional soft tissue radiographs, computed tomography (CT) scans, or ultrasonography of the skin can help to evaluate calcification.

**Conventional 2D Radiographs**

The conventional 2D radiograph is an imaging study that poses diagnostic difficulties, especially regarding the interpretation and the location of osteoma cutis.

Cone-beam CT:

Cone-beam CT, with its three-dimensional (3D) capabilities, is a beneficial and accurate imaging modality that helps to detect and establish the diagnosis of osteoma cutis.

Osteoma cutis is a radiopaque regularly outlined lesion that can occasionally have a radiolucent center. The density of osteoma cutis is identical to the bone. Different shapes of osteoma cutis are described, including donut-or snowflake-like or washer-shaped.

**Skin Biopsy**

The histopathological examination of the cutaneous biopsy confirms with certainty the diagnosis of osteoma cutis.
