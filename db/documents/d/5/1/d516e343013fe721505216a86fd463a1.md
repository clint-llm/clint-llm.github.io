The LSTV of Bertolotti syndrome are niduses for abnormal mobility and mechanics of the spine. Consequently, greater stress is typically dispersed onto the adjacent segments of motion. These increased forces that the adjacent segment experiences are at risk for accelerated disc and facet joint degeneration, arthrosis, and ultimately neural stenosis.

The surgical treatments for Bertolotti syndrome carry their inherent risks. As with all surgical procedures, there is a risk of bleeding at the surgical site, infection, and the need for the patient to have future operations if the first was unsuccessful. These procedures also risk nerve injury due to the surgery’s proximity to the nerve root canal and the spinal cord.

Although surgical complications are rare, it is imperative to discuss these with the patient.
