On gross examination, the visceral pleura is markedly thickened, especially on the lateral and diaphragmatic surface of the lung with localized fibrous plaques and pleural effusions. Diffuse fibrosis of the lower lobe of the lung is visible on the cut section.

On microscopic examination, asbestosis is marked by interstitial fibrosis with characteristic asbestos bodies and ferruginous bodies. The presence of both asbestos bodies and ferruginous bodies helps pathologists differentiate between asbestosis and interstitial lung fibrosis. Asbestos bodies are golden yellow, beaded rod-like structures with a translucent center. It is formed when asbestos fibers get coated with iron-containing proteinaceous material.Â A ferruginous body is an indication that the patient may have had prior exposure to asbestos and appear as golden-brown fusiform rods resembling dumbells. Fibrosis causes distortion of the lung parenchyma architecture, which causes the formation of enlarged air space surrounded by a thick fibrous wall and hyperplastic type 2 pneumocytes called honeycomb appearance.
