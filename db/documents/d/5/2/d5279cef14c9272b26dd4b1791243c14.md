On histologic examination, demyelination and subsequent degeneration of the dorsal root neurons can be visualized that results in discoloration of the affected dorsal column into pale white. Unfortunately, organisms are not seen in most cases of spinal cord lesions. Perivascular infiltration of predominantly CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, macrophages, plasma cells, and obliteration of small vessels are seen. Gummas, i.e., central caseous necrosis surrounded by inflammatory area showing a granulomatous appearance, may be seen anywhere in the CNS.
