Conventional treatment of metacarpal fractures is with hand surgery, with metacarpal shortening ranging from 2mm to 10mm. Researchers have found that withÂ metacarpal shortening of 2 mm, there is an approximate 8 percent in strength reduction of the respective interossei. Moreover, a 10mm shortening can reduce the respective interossei strength of roughly 55 percent.

Compartment syndromes of the interossei are relatively rare and are typically associated with severe ischemia, crush injuries, or burns.
