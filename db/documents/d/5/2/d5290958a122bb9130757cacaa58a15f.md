Epithelial cells have specialized cytoskeletons comprised of microtubules, actin filaments, and intermediate filaments. Intermediate filaments provide structural resilience to the cytoskeleton and show tissue-specific expression, unlike microtubules and actin filaments. These intermediate filaments are a valuable target for histochemical staining techniques. There are five main groups of intermediate filaments. Glial filaments are in astrocytes, neurofilaments are found in nerves, desmin filaments are found in muscles, vimentin filaments are seen in the mesenchyme, and keratin, which occur in epithelial cells. Keratin can not only define the tissue as epithelial cells but also differentiate between the types of epithelial cells. For example, keratin three is found in the corneal epithelium, whereas keratin 20 is present in Merkle cells and umbrella cells of the urothelium. These keratins are crucial to epithelial cells, and mutations in keratin or loss of keratin can cause or predispose a person to many diseases.
