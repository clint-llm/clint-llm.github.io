In the event of a disaster, mass casualty incident or epidemic, hospital systems face a significant demand for healthcare services that often outpaces the supply of resources available. Developing techniques to handle these periods of surge demand are critical for allowing healthcare systems to continue functioning in the face of supply constraints. Reverse triage is one tool that can be implemented to allow the judicious use of resources to provide the most beneficial care to the greatest number of patients. Discharging inpatients who can safely continue their medical care at an outside acute care facility or private residence opens hospital beds that can then be used for more critically ill patients. Despite the benefits of reverse triage in increasing hospital capacity, a standardized system should be used to determine which patients can be safely discharged to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with premature discharge. Hospital systems should evaluate the discharge criteria used in reverse triage at the individual system level as risk tolerance, capacity needs, and post-discharge resources vary from system to system to increase the effect of reverse triage while maintaining a high quality of care.
