Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is associated with numerous retinal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, acute glaucoma, and other vascular retinopathies. In the case of coronary ischemia, it can result in septal or ventricular wall rupture or arrhythmias. Cerebral ischemia can be complicated by the development of cerebral edema or hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct. When limbs are involved it can exacerbate the damage to endothelial lining, increasing capillary permeability and leading to edema. This can eventually result in acute compartment syndrome. Occasionally reperfusion injury is seen to activate the systemic inflammatory process and eventually result in multi-organ failure.
