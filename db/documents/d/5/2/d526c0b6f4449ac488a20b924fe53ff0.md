Cholesterol embolism or atheroembolism is a phenomenon where cholesterol crystals and atheroma debris such as cholesterol, platelets, and fibrins embolizes from proximal large arteries such as the aorta and its major branches to distal small arteries. Cholesterol embolism frequently occurs after the intraarterial procedures, but it can also occur spontaneously.

Another name for cholesterol embolism syndrome or atheroembolism is "blue or purple toe syndrome."  Atheroembolism that causes digital vascular occlusion causes the syndrome. In this disease, embolisms usually occlude smaller diameter vessels, and hence peripheral pulses are often intact. Therefore, whenever distal gangrene, ulcers, and cyanosis are present, but the pulse is intact, then it is highly suggestive of blue or purple toe syndrome.
