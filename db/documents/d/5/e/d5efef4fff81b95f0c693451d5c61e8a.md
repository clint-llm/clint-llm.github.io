The main blood supply to the buccinator comes from three arteries which form extensive anastomotic vascular plexus on the muscle's lateral surface and within its fibers. The posterior part of the muscle is supplied by the buccal artery, a branch of the maxillary artery. The artery runs in an anteroinferior direction, either superficial or deep, to the lateral pterygoid muscle to reach the posterior part of the muscle. The facial artery, via its numerous branches, supplies the posterior, inferior, and anterior parts of the muscle. The posterior buccal branch, the largest branch of the facial artery, supplies the posterior half of the muscle. Inferior buccal branches of the facial artery supply the inferior half of the muscle. It then runs anterosuperiorly to give off anterior buccal branches, which supply the anterior half of the muscle. Two small branches form the posterosuperior alveolar artery, a branch of the maxillary artery that enters the buccinator muscle posterosuperiorly and supplies the surrounding area.

Venous drainage of the muscle occurs through the pterygoid plexus and internal maxillary vein.
