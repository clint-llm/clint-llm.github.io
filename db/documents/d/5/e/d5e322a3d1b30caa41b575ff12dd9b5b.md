Being a gram-negative organism, the drugs used to treat Acinetobacter infections include the aminoglycosides, fourth-generation cephalosporins, tigecycline, and rifampin. The organism will not respond to macrolides, third-generation cephalosporins, and penicillin. When an infection is suspected in the presence of a long-term catheter or a pacemaker, it should be removed.

Any external device, infected line, shunt, or drain must be removed to obtain a cure.

One should avoid treating colonization as it only leads to more antibiotic resistance.

Over the last few years, drug resistance has become a common problem in the United States. Anti-microbialsÂ which may be used in Acinetobacter infections include colistin, carbapenems, tigecycline, polymyxin, amikacin, and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase combinations. But, there have been more recent outbreaks with extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter which makes the management of these infections much more complicated.
