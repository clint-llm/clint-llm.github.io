The labyrinthectomy procedure is done under general anesthesia in an operating room. The surgeon will need an operative microscope, an otologic drill with appropriately-sized cutting and diamond burrs, an otologic instrument set, and a facial nerve monitor. Facial nerve monitoring can improve the safety and speed of otologic procedures.
