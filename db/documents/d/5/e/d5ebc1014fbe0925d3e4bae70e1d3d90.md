The femoral artery is the continuation of the external iliac artery below the level of the inguinal ligament and serves as the primary blood supply to the lower limb. The deep femoral artery is the main branch of the common femoral artery. The largest branches of the deep femoral artery are the medial femoral circumflex artery and the lateral femoral circumflex artery. The medial femoral circumflex artery is anatomically posteromedial, while the lateral femoral circumflex artery is posterolateral as they branch from the deep femoral artery.

The lateral femoral circumflex artery is clinically significant because it can suffer an injury during surgical procedures in the area around the hip joint. It is also useful as a vascular graft for coronary artery bypass graft surgery and other vascular graft surgeries.
