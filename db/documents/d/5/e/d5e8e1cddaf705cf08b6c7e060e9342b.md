Anoscopy is a bedside procedure that is inexpensive, can be performed quickly without bowel preparation or the need for sedation. With this method, the examiner can visualize the internal portions of the anal sphincter and the distal rectum. Prospective studies suggest that anoscopy has a higher sensitivity for anorectal lesions such as internal hemorrhoids, proctitis, lacerations, fistulas, ulcers, and masses than a flexible sigmoidoscopy. Up to 50% of rectal bleeding can be falsely attributed to hemorrhoids without internal examination to confirm this diagnosis.
