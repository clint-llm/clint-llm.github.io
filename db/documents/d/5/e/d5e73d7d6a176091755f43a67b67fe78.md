Lasers are essential to ophthalmology treatment and diagnostics, but if used improperly can cause unnecessary injury. Understanding the use and mechanism of lasers is crucial for all team members associated with care. Lasers are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an ophthalmologist trained in the specific use of that laser, nurses, and technicians, all contributing from their areas of expertise and engaging in open communication among team members, so that patient care is the top priority. Proper setup and safety precautions are important to ensuring patient and staff safety while maximizing outcomes and comfort.
