The spleen is a highly vascularized organ, and an injury to this organ can result in significant blood loss either from the parenchyma or the arteries and veins that supply the spleen. The spleen is an important lymphopoietic organ. The normal splenic function is necessary for the opsonization of encapsulated organisms.

The spleen serves the following functions:

**Hematologic Function**

- Maturation of red cells

- Extraction of abnormal cells via phagocytosis

- Remove particulates such as opsonized bacteria, or antibody-coated cells from the blood

**Immunologic Function**

- Contribute to humoral and cell-mediated immunity

In adults, normal splenic size is up to 250 gm and up to 13 cm long. It involutes with age and is usually not palpable in adults. The spleen, in adults, is less pliable than in children.
