Sever disease is relatively common in young people but often does not come to attention as it is self-limited. Patients may present to the emergency department, to the primary caregiver or the urgent care clinic. Nurses and doctors need to be familiar with this condition as it is sometimes mistaken for plantar fasciitis. Sever disease is managed conservatively with most people having symptom relief once the overactivity is discontinued.

Patients (including parents and family members) should be educated regarding using patient-reported symptoms as the guide for treatment and a possible return to play.  Also, patients and parents need to be informed about the relatively high incidence of recurrence of symptoms until skeletal maturation and closure of the apophysis occurs.  The growth plate usually starts to close sometime between the ages of 8 and 14 years old.
