A pancreatic abscess is a very serious condition, and the most effective way to approach the disease is with an interprofessional team that includes hospitalists, gastroenterologists, radiologists, general surgeons, intensivists, pharmacists, and nurses. The pharmacist can educate the patient on the medications that might cause pancreatitis and possibly find an alternative to them.****The nurses might educate the patient on lowering the risk of acute pancreatitis, such as abstaining from alcohol, eating a low-fat diet, losing weight. Close follow-up with the gastroenterologist will help the patient stay dedicated to the treatment plan. [Level 5]
