Glomerulonephritis is a term used to describe varying degrees of glomerular injury associated with an activated inflammatory process. This, combined with increased cellular proliferation and involvement of more than 50% of glomeruli, makes it diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (DPGN), which can present with either nephrotic or non-nephrotic range proteinuria as well as hematuria. DPGN encompasses immune disorders with subsequent renal involvement due to either immune complex deposition or direct formation of antibodies causing cellular injury with sclerosis, fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and necrosis visible on renal biopsy.
