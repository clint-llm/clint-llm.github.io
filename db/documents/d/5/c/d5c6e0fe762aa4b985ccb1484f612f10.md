History and physical exam are essential in the diagnosis of spine osteoarthritis. However, a broad differential diagnosis is critical to rule out other, more threatening causes of back pain. Labs or imaging are often part of the evaluation of osteoarthritis of the spine. Less common but potentially severe etiology of back pain include infection, neoplasm, inflammatory disease, myelopathy, and aortic aneurysm or dissection.

Plain films in an acute setting should be limited to patients with spinal pain suggestive of systemic disease or trauma — other more advanced imaging modalities, including MRI and CT. When there is high suspicion for a possible infection, neoplasm, or persistent and or severe neurological deficits such as severe lumbar radiculopathy, the patient requires advanced imaging. More severe etiologies of a patient's pain are more common in an elderly population. A herniated nucleus pulposus can occur at all levels of the spine but most often occurs in the lower cervical (C5 to C6 and C6 to C7) and lumbar segments (L4 to L5 and L5 to S1). Early evaluation in an elderly population with advanced imaging is recommended for persistent pain.
