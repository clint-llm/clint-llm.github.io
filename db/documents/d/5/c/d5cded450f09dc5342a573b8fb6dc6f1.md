In patients with SCA, peripheral blood smear shows elongated RBC with tapering ends that look like a sickle (also called drepanocytes). Additional findings are present in a few patients.

- Howell-Jolly bodies- Remnants of DNA are seen in the RBC and commonly seen in patients in whom the spleen has been removed. Therefore, patients with SCA have auto-splenectomy.

- Target cells (Leptocytes)- Most commonly seen in patients with Thalassemia. They are seen frequently in sickle-thalassemia syndromes and are sometimes noted in patients with SCA.

- Polychromatic cells - these are reticulocytes that signify marrow response to hemolysis.

- Nucleated red blood cells can sometimes be visible on the peripheral smear.

None of these findings are confirmatory. Confirmation is obtained only through hemoglobin electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography, or isoelectric focusing. DNA-based techniques are not used routinely. Instead, they are used in patients with uncertain diagnoses. Pre-natal fetal testing involves using fetal DNA obtained through amniocentesis. Techniques to capture the fetal DNA in maternal blood remain investigational.
