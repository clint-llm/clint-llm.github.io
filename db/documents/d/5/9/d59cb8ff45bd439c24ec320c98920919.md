Management of tonsil cancer requires an interprofessional approach. The initial investigation occurs within the otolaryngology outpatient setting, with the involvement of radiology and pathology departments proving vital for definitive diagnosis and clinical staging. Otolaryngologists and oncologists will ultimately manage the disease with a specialist interest in head and neck cancer; however, support is required from speech and language therapists, nurse specialists, and dietician teams to manage the resultant swallowing, emotional, and nutritional issues. For those undergoing radiotherapy, a review by restorative dentistry is necessary to avoid debilitating osteoradionecrosis.
