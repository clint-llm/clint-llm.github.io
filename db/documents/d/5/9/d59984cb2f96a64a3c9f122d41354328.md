**Types of Stents**

Different stents are used for different indications; the common types and their uses are as follows:

**Laryngeal Stents**

These are used only for glottic or subglottic stenosis and can be either short term (less than six weeks) or long term (more than six weeks).

- Short term stenting is usually used to stabilize cartilaginous graft following a reconstruction surgery of larynx or trachea, or post-trauma or for laryngeal web or atresia. The common stents used are:

- 
              
- Aboulker stents
              
              
- Silicone stents
              
              
- Montgomery laryngeal stents
              
              
- Endotracheal tubes and
              
              
- Laryngeal keels.

- Long term stenting is used when the trachea above the tracheostomy tube requires stenting from either collapse or stenosis. The common stents used is Montgomery T-tube, or a long Aboulker stent is wired to a metal tracheostomy tube and wired into the trachea.

**Aboulker Stent**

- The most commonly used stent in children after laryngotracheal reconstruction surgery.

- It is a cigar-shaped prosthesis in different diameters at a length of 120 mm.

- Low incidence of granulation tissue formation or irritation.

- It is most effective in counteracting scar contracture and preventing the collapse of the lumen after reconstructive surgery.

**Montgomery Stent**

- It is made of silicone material and has a long center lumen with a smaller lumen projecting from the side at a 75° or 90° angle.

**Silastic Sheet**

- First used by Evans in 1977 for laryngotracheoplasty.

- Since it applies pressure to the mucosa, granulation tissue formation chances are high, so a Teflon Aboulker stent has replaced it.

**Endotracheal Tubes**

- Made of polyvinyl chloride and has been used in the laryngotracheal area.

- They are associated with a high incidence of fibrosis, inflammation, and granulation tissue after four weeks.

- These stents should be used for procedures involving four weeks or less to prevent complications.

**Silicone Stents**

- Mainly used in adults and are placed in the larynx.

- Common complication from this stent is vocal cord edema, stent migration, and restenosis after removal.

**Metallic Stents**

- Made of bare metal or coated with silicone, nylon, or polyurethane.

- It can be placed in an outpatient setting using flexible bronchoscopy under local anesthesia.

- Higher incidence of granulation tissue and irritation and are difficult to remove.

- It should not be used for benign airway disorders and has an FDA black box warning.
