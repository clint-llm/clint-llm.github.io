M. kansasii infection mostly occurs in males, at an average patient age of 45–62 years.M. kansasii occur in geographic clusters.M. kansasii infections are more common in southern and central states with the highest incidence seen in the southern states of Texas, Louisiana and Florida, as well as the central states of Illinois, Kansas, and Nebraska. M. kansasii infections are more likely to occur in urban areas than rural areas, and several studies have reported an association with mining practices.M. kansasii infections are most frequent in Wales. Of all countries in Europe, Poland has the highest M. kansasii isolation rate (35% of all NTM compared to 5% in Europe).

M. kansasii infections are also prevalent in areas where HIV infection is common due to the susceptibility of the hosts.

M. kansasii infections were the most common non-tuberculosis mycobacterial infections during the 1960s and 70s, before being surpassed by M.
avium-intracellulare. In the 80s with the rise of HIV infections, there was a resurgence of M. kansasii, which has now decreased in the antiretroviral therapy (AR) era. M. kansasii infections can occur in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients.M. kansasii infections was estimated to be 0.5 cases per 100,000 persons. Since mycobacterial infections are not reported, there is no reliable data for M. kansasii infections in transplant patients. Generally in transplant patients mycobacterial infections present as disseminated infections.M. abscesses, M. chelonae, and M.kansasii are the mycobacteria most commonly present with dissemination. Even in HIV and late-stage AIDS patients, M. kansasii presents with pulmonary disease. In one study from California, the prevalence of mycobacterial infections was 0.75 /100 000 in HIV-negative patients, 115/100000 in HIV-positive patients, and 647/100000 persons in AIDS patients.
