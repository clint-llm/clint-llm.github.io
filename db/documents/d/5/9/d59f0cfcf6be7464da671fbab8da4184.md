Nursing management of patients with dementia should be focused on promoting safety and improving the quality of life for the patient. Nurses should evaluate all of their patients for early symptoms of dementia. They should perform a comprehensive assessment for identification and monitoring of cognitive decline on all patients with a diagnosis of dementia. They should evaluate and assess for pain and anxiety and report it as needed. They should also assess for findings of medical symptoms or diseases the patient may be unable to report verbally. Finally, they should partner with the patient's family to promote patient-centered care that encourages quality of life improvements.
