The knowledge about beta-thalassemia (BT) is limited overall, especially in developing countries. Considering the chronic treatment, patients with BT need regular psychosocial support. Healthcare workers should provide available resources in the form of pamphlets, booklets, lectures, and videos to both patients and caregivers.

Due to the preventable nature of this disease in offspring by pre-marital or intrauterine screening, countries should focus on promoting community education widely to reduce BTM cases. Both the parents and the patients should be made aware of the disease inheritance pattern and the risk associated with it in subsequent pregnancies. They should be offered prenatal screening and genetic counseling. In Iran and Bahrain, the implementation of standard premarital screening in a locality significantly reduced the incidence of affected newborn babies.
