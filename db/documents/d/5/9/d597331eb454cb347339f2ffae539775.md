Patients with familial hypertriglyceridemia are reliant on an interprofessional team of providers at all levels to ensure accurate management. The primary care physician (PCP) plays a crucial role in screening patient lipids for abnormalities. After a diagnosis is made of elevated triglyceride levels, it requires the PCP as well as other healthcare professionals to be aware of the disease and possible complications that may occur. The PCP must first begin by ruling out various acquired causes of elevated lipid levels like those mentioned above. Patients must begin appropriate therapy to combat the elevated lipid levels. The pharmacist for the patient will be vital in management and counseling on potential drug interactions and side effects.

Furthermore, the pharmacist can help aid in elucidating an iatrogenic cause of elevated levels through an examination of the patientâ€™s current medications. Emergency Room staff will also play a vital role in patient management due to an increased risk of acute pancreatitis. It is pertinent that emergency department practitioners and staff communicate best practices and recommendations dependent on episode severity. Cardiovascular consult is necessary for those that would be at high risk to monitor the increase of atherosclerotic burden. The consultation of a nutritionist would be invaluable as well to better recommend appropriate dietary changes in managing this disease from a nonpharmacologic avenue.
