Signs and symptoms of MIS-C are highly variable. The time of onset of the symptom of COVID-19 exposure is essential. Since MIS-C is a post-infectious immune sequela of COVID-19, there usually is a latency period of 4 or 5 weeks following the COVID-19 exposure to the development of MIS-C symptoms. It is important to note that infants with a maternal history of COVID-19 exposure may present earlier than 4 to 6 weeks of life due to the placental transfer of antibodies in fetal life. The presentation can range from asymptomatic infection to multiorgan failure. Infants can present with or without fever. Signs of inflammation and multiorgan dysfunction aid the diagnosis.

Symptoms may include fever, rash, conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms such as emesis, diarrhea, and abdominal tenderness. It is important to note that fever may be absent in infants even with the signs of inflammation and multiorgan dysfunction.

Other clinical signs and symptoms include:

- Bilateral non-suppurative rash, conjunctivitis, or mucocutaneous involvement

- Hypotension, shock, or signs of cardiovascular dysfunction

- Gastrointestinal involvement such as emesis, diarrhea, abdominal tenderness

- Respiratory distress or pneumonia

- Neurological impairment, seizures, signs of meningitis

- Signs of acute kidney injury

- Signs of coagulopathy
