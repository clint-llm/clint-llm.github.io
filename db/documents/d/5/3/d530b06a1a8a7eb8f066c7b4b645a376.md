**Test Bone Conduction**

- Initiate vibration of the tuning fork and then place the vibrating tuning fork onto the patient's mastoid process of the tested ear.

- Ask the patient to cover the opposite ear with their hand.

- Ask the patient to report when the sound can no longer be heard.

- After the patient can no longer hear the tuning fork placed on the mastoid process, move the vibrating tuning fork adjacent to the ear canal with the tines oriented perpendicular to the ear canal, approximately 3 to 4 cm from the ear.

- The patient should indicate when they can no longer hear the sound conducted through the air.

**Interpretation**

Normal finding: Air conduction is better than bone conduction. The patient should be able to hear the sound of the tuning fork adjacent to their ear, persist for approximately twice as long as the sound they heard over their mastoid process. This is considered a "positive test."

Abnormal: Bone conduction is better than air conduction. The patient cannot hear sound conducted through the air after the fork is moved from the mastoid process. This suggests conductive hearing loss and is referred to as a "negative test."
