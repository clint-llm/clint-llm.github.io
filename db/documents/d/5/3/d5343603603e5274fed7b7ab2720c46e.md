Oral mucositis is a severely debilitating condition characterized by erythema, edema, and ulcerations of the oral mucosa. It is a complication of radiation therapy (RT) to the head and neck, chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, and hematopoeitic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The lesions can also break the mucosa barrier resulting in local or systemic infection. In severe cases, this can lead to parenteral nutrition, ultimately leading to poor quality of life. This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, history and physical, evaluation, and treatment of oral mucositis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of oral mucositis.
- Summarize the pathophysiology of oral mucositis.
- Identify the physical exam findings of oral mucositis and its evaluation.
- Review the management options available to prevent and treat oral mucositis.
