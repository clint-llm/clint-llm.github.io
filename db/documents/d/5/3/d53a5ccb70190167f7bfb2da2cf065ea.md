Histopathology with immunohistochemistry (IHC) remains the gold standard investigation for confirming the diagnosis of microphthalmia with the cyst.

The outer wall of the cyst is composed of dense fibrous connective tissue and the inner layer, derived from the neuroectoderm, comprises thick neuroglial tissue with variably differentiated immature retinal elements seenÂ in relation to the glial element. A varying amount of calcification and pigmentation may be found in the cystic cavity. Surrounding rudimentary ocular structures may be seen in connection with the cyst.

The cyst is usually found attached to the inferior portion of the globe in microphthalmos, unlike anophthalmia, where the cyst is usually centrally or superiorly located with the absence of ocular structures. IHC may reveal glial positivity, owing to the expression of astrocytes, using glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) staining. Optic nerve elements are identified using the neurofilament protein, and the surrounding meningeal tissue may demonstrate epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) positivity. Disorganized retinal tissue may stain positive for S-100, vimentin, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE).

Recent advances in IHC, scanning, and transmission microscopy have aided in gaining further insights into these complex malformations.
