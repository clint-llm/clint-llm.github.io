Microscopic polyangiitis is a complex condition to manage by the provider because of the heterogeneity in its clinical presentation and the patient-specific treatment that it demands. Good communication and an interprofessional medical team comprised of clinicians, nurses, radiologists, pathologists, and pharmacists may help ease this hurdle. The nurses play an essential role in monitoring and charting vitals, especially urine output, which is crucial in helping the provider decide on the treatment. Radiologists play a vital role in assisting image-guided tissue biopsy, which the pathologist then studies to confirm the presence of disease. Proper dosing and dispensing of immunosuppressive agents by pharmacists can help in the induction and maintenance of remission. In contrast, failure to do so can lead to severe systemic side effects of these drugs. Pharmacists must also perform medication reconciliation to ensure there are no drug-drug interactions.

To ease the process of deciding the appropriate treatment, researchers at Johns Hopkins University have teamed up to provide the revised Birmingham score, which can be used to classify the patient's disease state clinically.
