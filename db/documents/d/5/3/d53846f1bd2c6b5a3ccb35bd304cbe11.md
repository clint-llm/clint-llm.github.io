There are no described contraindications for olfactory training in terms of past medical or surgical history or medications. However, the value of olfactory training for treating olfactory dysfunction secondary to sinonasal disease remains yet to be determined.

Many patients with olfactory dysfunction due to sinonasal disease, especially those with chronic rhinosinusitis (with or without polyposis), may benefit from functional endoscopic surgery, generally with a pre-operative course of nasal topical steroids.
