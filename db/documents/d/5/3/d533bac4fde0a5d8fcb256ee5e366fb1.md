Clinicians (nurse practitioners, physicians, physician assistants) may notice a pulsating sensation in the neck. One cause for this might be a phenomenon called Cannon A wave. It is an exaggerated pulse wave. In normal healthy people, when the atria contract blood is pushed into the ventricles. When the cardiac action is not well synchronized as might be the case in cardiac rhythm abnormalities, blood pushes against the closed tricuspid valve and create a large reverse pulsation into the venous system. This pressure wave might be felt in the neck, jaw, and abdomen. A feeling of pulsation should prompt further investigation. When Cannon A waves are found, further investigations may be needed to identify the reason why the heart rhythm is not well synchronized. Cardiology consultation may be necessary.
