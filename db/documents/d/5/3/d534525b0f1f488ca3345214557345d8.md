The genus Enterovirus belongs to the Picornaviridae family. Enteroviruses are typically spread via the fecal-oral route. Transmission can additionally result from the ingestion of infected saliva, respiratory droplets, or direct contact with fluid from vesicles. The incubation period ranges from 3 to 5 days. Viral shedding can occur even in asymptomatic patients. Respiratory viral shedding can persist for up to 3 weeks and in the stool for up to 8 weeks. Patients are most contagious in the first 1 to 2 weeks of infection.
