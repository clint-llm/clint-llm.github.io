The patient of PDS or PG presenting to the clinic should be evaluated in detail by the ophthalmologists, and all the findings must be documented in detail. Patients with PG requiring treatment must be referred to a glaucoma specialist for targeted investigation. These include applanation tonometry, gonioscopy, visual field assessment, optical coherence tomography, and the need for antiglaucoma therapy or filtration surgery. Patients with complicated cataracts may need an expert opinion from a cataract surgeon or a uvea specialist. Those developing retinal complications like retinal holes, tears, or detachment may require intervention from a retina specialist.
