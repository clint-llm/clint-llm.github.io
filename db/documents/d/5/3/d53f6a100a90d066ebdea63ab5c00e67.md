The most significant visible structures of the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract including:

- The four cm-long anorectal canal

- The midpoint of the anorectal canal known as the dentate line (the transition between the distal squamous and proximal columnar epithelium)

- The anal glands

- Longitudinal mucosal folds of the columns of Morgagni which terminate in small crypts (of consequence since they can become obstructed and subsequently infected).

Hemorrhoids are clusters of vascular, connective, and smooth muscle tissue which exist in the left lateral, right anterior, and right posterior portion of the anal canal. While internal hemorrhoids drain into the middle and superior rectal veins, patients with portal hypertension nonetheless do not have an increased incidence of varies. Since internal hemorrhoids lie above the dentate line, they have visceral innervation and are not painful, but they may become symptomatic due to bleeding and/or prolapse from the rectal canal. Severely prolapsed internal hemorrhoids may be painful if strangulated, and secondarily ischemic Conversely, external hemorrhoids emerge inferior to the dentate line and have somatic innervation from the perianal skin and can cause significant discomfort. Anoscopy can be useful to characterize the presence of enlarged internal hemorrhoids, but external hemorrhoids may preclude anoscopy due to discomfort.
