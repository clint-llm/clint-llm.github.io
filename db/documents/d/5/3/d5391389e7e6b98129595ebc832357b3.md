Diagnosis of infectious endocarditis has its basis on modified Duke criteria; therefore, studies of microorganism and echocardiography are necessary for a definitive diagnosis. Whereas definitive diagnosis for NBTE is only genuinely possible pathologically, yet valvular vegetations on echocardiography without systemic infection serve strong evidence for NBTE. The majority of endocarditis patients develop silent cerebral embolism. However, neurological sequelae are a poor prognostic factor. Recommendations are that physicians should perform rapid neurologic screening physical examinations bedside, including mental status, i.e., patients orientation, the function of cranial nerves, motor system, and sensation. For unstable patients, a CT scan without contrast is the test of choice. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) is preferable to conventional MRI due to its advantages in detecting acute onset ischemic lesions, smaller lesions as well as differentiating acute/chronic lesions. For patients presenting headache, neck stiffness, and fever, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study is necessary for further investigation for central nervous system infection such as meningitis and brain abscess.
