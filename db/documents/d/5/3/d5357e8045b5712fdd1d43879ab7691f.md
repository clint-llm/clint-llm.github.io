The exact mechanism of action of 9vHPV is unknown since HPV only affects humans, which makes it challenging to study. Nevertheless, the belief is that the vaccine works by activating the humoral response. 9vHPV is synthetically manufactured from the oncogenic protein subunit component L1 virus-like particles (VLP) of the HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58.

A 2016 immunogenicity study reports that the inactive HPV L1 VLPs in the vaccine produce neutralizing antibodies against HPV types eliciting a strong humoral immune response to protect against the diseases and dysplastic lesions caused by HPV. The same study reported that antibody titers for 9vHPV are 10 to 100-fold greater than antibody titers produced by natural infection. Thus, the vaccine's efficacy appears to be mediated via humoral response mechanisms.
