A cardiac team with interventional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, non-invasive cardiologists, and cardiac anesthesiologists are crucial to ensure the best potential outcome of this complex procedure. This team should be experienced in treating RVOT interventions. In addition, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) facilities should be considered in the event of significant instability or deterioration, although the need for ECMO support with this procedure is quite rare. Pediatric or interventional cardiologists with expertise in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and echocardiography are extremely helpful for pre-procedure assessment and planning. Nurses need to be available for patient care pre- and post-procedure, including assessing vitals, baseline laboratory tests, confirming the patientâ€™s ABO-Rh blood group, determining baseline renal function, and maintaining hydration. Cardiac catheterization nurses need to ensure the availability of blood in case of conduit tear and/or PA bleeding or perforation. Post-procedure, frequent monitoring of the site of the catheterization, and assessing patients for complications is required.
