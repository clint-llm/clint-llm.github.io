The neurosurgeon should be extremely careful while operating in the region of the superior sagittal sinus. While doing craniotomy over the sinus, it is desirable to place bur holes on either side straddling the sinus and dissect it carefully from the overlying bone before completing the craniotomy. Bleeding from the sinus can be life-threatening.
