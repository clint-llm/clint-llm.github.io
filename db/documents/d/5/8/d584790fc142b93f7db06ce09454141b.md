Amyloidosis affects multiple body organs and systems. Chronic deposition of amyloidosis leads to restrictive cardiomyopathy. Initially, cardiac involvement may cause angina, orthostatic hypotension or arrhythmias. Congestive heart failure accounts for the death of about 40% of patients that have primary systemic amyloidosis.

Macroglossia can cause painful dysphagia. Infiltration of amyloid into blood vessels can cause leg or jaw claudication. Amyloid deposition in the skin can result in loss of scalp hair. Gastrointestinal tract infiltration with amyloid leads to hemorrhage that can cause malabsorption or can be fatal.
