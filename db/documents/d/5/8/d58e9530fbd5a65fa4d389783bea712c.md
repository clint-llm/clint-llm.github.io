There is no specific treatment for patients due to the early onset of cerebral damage during embryonal development. However, patients benefit from rehabilitation, especially with early intervention. This approach has demonstrated to improve prognosis as well as social adaptation.

During the neonatal period, physical therapy should be started in the first week of life to help with any difficulty in swallowing and suction. Breastfeeding is still possible, and intensive care is rarely necessary.

Physical therapy, psychomotricity, and speech therapy are suggested interventions for psychomotor and speech retardation. Patients often have sensorineural deafness; therefore, audiometric examinations should take place in all children. Other helpful treatments include surgery, a special diet, and healthy routines.

Families should be involved in the care of the patient. They should receive information about the disease and available support groups.

Genetic counseling services should be offered for subsequent pregnancies.
