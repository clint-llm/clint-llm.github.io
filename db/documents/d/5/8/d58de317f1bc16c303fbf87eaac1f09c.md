The thyroid gland is the first endocrine gland that develops during fetal embryology, which starts between the third and fourth gestational weeks. The primary origin of the thyroid gland is the endoderm, which gives rise to theÂ median (the significant portion of each lateral lobe, isthmus and thyroglossal duct with pyramidal lobe), and the two lateral anlages which contain c-cells, solid nests cells and portions of the lateral thyroid.
