Detection of retrograde flow of stomach acid into the upper aerodigestive tract is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of LPR. This is accomplished by monitoring pH via nasal catheter for 24 hours. Various methods may be used, including up to three probes that test pH continuously just above the lower esophageal sphincter, below the upper esophageal sphincter, and in the pharynx. Pathologic reflux is considered present when there is a pH of less than 4.0 for at least 1% of the study time.
