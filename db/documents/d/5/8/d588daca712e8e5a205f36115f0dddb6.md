Fosphenytoin has a 100% bioavailability and begins its conversion into phenytoin immediately upon entering circulation. Its half-life for the conversion is 10 to 15 minutes. Measurement of plasma phenytoin levels is recommended only after the complete conversion of the drug due to the cross-reactivity of fosphenytoin in the immunoassay.

Similarly, monitoring depends on the activated drug and includes therapeutic drug monitoring of serum phenytoin. Saliva level may be an option for monitoring, reflecting free phenytoin serum levels. Continuous monitoring of EKG, blood pressure, and respiratory functions during IV administration and up to 20 minutes afterward is also recommended.
