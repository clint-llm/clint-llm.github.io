There are currently 2 different methods to identify xanthochromia in the CSF. In the United States, visual detection is still the method of choice. A CSF sample is spun down in a centrifuge, and the supernatant is visually inspected with the naked eye for yellow color.Â This is accomplished by holding a vial of water next to a vial of supernatant against a white backdrop.

The second and perhaps more reliable way to test for xanthochromia is the use of spectrophotometry.
