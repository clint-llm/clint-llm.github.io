Curriculum refers to all the planned educational experiences that allow students to reach specific learning goals and objectives. It is also definable as activities that shape students' behavior. An educational curriculum's main components are content, teaching and learning strategies; assessment processes; and evaluation processes.

Simulation provides a learning environment that allows learners to integrate theoretical knowledge by participating in realistic clinical scenarios. Also, simulation offers the opportunity to meet learning objectives during debriefing.

Medical simulation has been shown to improve clinical competence across all levels in medical education. One of the main advantages of utilizing simulation in clinical training is substituting real patients for mannequins or task trainers. This substitution decreases the chances of harming patients when practicing procedures or clinical skills. Simulation is especially useful in this instance since clinical skill acquisition depends to a greater extent on practicing over theoretical learning.
