Donepezil is not recommended for patients with known hypersensitivity to donepezil hydrochloride or piperidine derivatives.

**Warnings/Precautions**

- Donepezil can cause QT interval prolongation, and its use requires caution in patients at risk of prolonged cardiac repolarization. It can also cause bradycardia and/or heart blocks, and using this agent merits caution in patients with symptomatic bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, and cardiac conduction abnormalities.

- Cholinesterase inhibitors can increase gastric acid secretion. Therefore, caution is necessary for patients at risk of ulcer disease, and symptoms of GI bleeding require monitoring.

- Donepezil and other cholinomimetic agents can trigger seizures, and clinicians should exercise caution in patients with a history of seizure disorder.

- Cholinomimetic agents like donepezil can cause or worsen bladder outflow obstruction,Â and their use requires caution in patients with a history of prostatic hyperplasia.

- It can exaggerate succinylcholine-induced muscle relaxation during anesthesia.

- Because of its cholinomimetic properties, it should be prescribed with caution to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease.

- Use donepezil with caution in patients at risk for rhabdomyolysis. Risk factors include a history of muscular disorders, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and concomitant use of medications associated with rhabdomyolysis.
