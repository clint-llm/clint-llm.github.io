Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays are the preferred methods to detect microdeletions of chromosome 22q11, but fluorescence in-situ hybridization can be used as well.

Hypocalcemia is a common finding and requires close monitoring.

Thrombocytopenia with increased platelet size can be seen in patients with velocardial facial syndrome when the GPIBB gene is deleted, resulting in decreased expression of GPIb-IX-V on the platelet surface.

As patients age, hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism often develop.
