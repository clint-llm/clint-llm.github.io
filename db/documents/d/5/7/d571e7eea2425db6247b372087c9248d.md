Aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) is a variant of peripheral artery disease affecting the infrarenal aorta and iliac arteries. Similar to other arterial diseases, aortoiliac occlusive disease obstructs blood flow to distal organs through narrowed lumens or by embolization of plaques. The presentation of AOID can range from asymptomatic to limb-threatening emergencies. Obstructive lesions are usually present in the infrarenal aorta, common iliac artery, internal iliac (hypogastric) artery, external iliac artery, or combinations of any of these vessels. Many risk factors exist for the development of the AIOD, and recognition of these factors enables providers to prescribe medical treatment that may relieve symptoms as well as prolong life. With the discovery of prosthetic graft materials for aortic replacement, surgical treatment of AIOD became available to patients in the 1960s.
