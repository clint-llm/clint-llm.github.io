An interpolated flap is a two-stage technique in which the base of the flap is not directly adjacent to the recipient defect. These flaps are used when insufficient tissue or mobility in nearby skin prevents the coverage of a surgical defect with primary closure or an adjacent flap.

Examples of interpolated flaps include:

- Paramedian forehead flap

- Melolabial flap

- Postauricular flap

- Deltopectoral flap

- Waltzing flaps
