Endometrial hyperplasia is a common disorder due to exposure to exogenous or endogenous estrogen along with a relative deficiency of progesterone. It is a precursor of endometrial carcinoma, which is one of the commonest gynecological malignancies. To avoid the development of endometrial carcinoma, it is important that clinician keeps a high vigil for the signs and symptoms of endometrial hyperplasia. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and management of endometrial hyperplasia.
