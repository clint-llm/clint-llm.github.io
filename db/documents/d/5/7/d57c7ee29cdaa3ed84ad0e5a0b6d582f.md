The diagnosis and management of HOCM is with an interprofessional team that consists of a cardiologist, electrophysiologist, cardiac surgeon and an internist. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner usually play a role in follow up after treatment. The treatment of HOCM is based on the severity of symptoms.  Mild disease is treated with lifestyle modifications.  Patients should be strongly advised to avoid strenuous exercise and heavy lifting.  First lime medical treatment for symptomatic HOCM is beta blockers though cardiac selective calcium channel blockers may be used. ACE inhibitors and nitrates should be avoided as these medications decrease afterload which would lead to worsening LV outflow tract obstruction. The pharmacist must educate the patient on the importance of medication compliance.

Surgical intervention is reserved for patients who are resistant to lifestyle and medical management or those who have outflow gradient of 50mmhg or more. Septal myectomy is the surgical treatment of choice in young healthy patients.  Alcohol septal ablation is a newer percutaneous technique usually limited to older patients for whom an open procedure would be considered risky. The outlook for patients are treated is good but those who fail to comply with medical or surgical therapy have a very high risk of sudden death. Because the disorder also runs in families, siblings and other family members should be screened for the disorder.
