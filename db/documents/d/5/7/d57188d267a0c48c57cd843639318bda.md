The most common adverse effects experienced with linezolid use include decreased platelets, hemoglobin, and white blood cell counts, headache, nausea, diarrhea, elevated pancreatic enzymes, elevated liver function tests, and neuropathy.

Warnings associated with linezolid include duration-related myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia), serotonin syndrome, hypoglycemia; caution in patients on insulin or hypoglycemic drugs, seizures, lactic acidosis, hypertension when used with adrenergic drugs, and irreversible peripheral and optic neuropathy when used for 28 days or greater; reports exist of blurred vision in patients receiving shorter courses of linezolid. Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial infection, including Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis. CDAD can occur greater than two months postantibiotic treatment.

Lactic acidosis may also occur with use; therefore, evaluate patients who develop recurrent nausea and vomiting, unexplained acidosis, or low bicarbonate concentrations.
