The nurse should be aware of the early symptoms of measles, such as Koplik spots, procedures to be done if the presence of measles is confirmed, and should know how to handle the patient. She should have a thorough knowledge of the disease and should be able to physically examine the child for symptoms of measles and assess the family’s hygiene practices to prevent the spread of the disease. The ability of the nurses to quickly assess the child with Koplik spots may save lives by decreasing the spread of this highly communicable disease  (measles). Nurses should be aware of the current recommendations for vaccinations.
