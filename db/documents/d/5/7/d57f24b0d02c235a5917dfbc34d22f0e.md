Mast cell pathology is characterized by the signs and symptoms of mast cell degranulation. The most well known is the type I immediate hypersensitivity reaction IgE that bind harmless antigens, circulate throughout the body, and bind to the Fc receptor on mast cells. Upon encountering the specified antigen, IgE receptor crosslinking results in cell degranulation. The release of mediators can lead to a wide variety of effects, including edema, vasodilation, mucous secretion, and bronchoconstriction. Clinically, this can present as allergic rhinitis, asthma, urticaria, anaphylaxis, and angioedema.

Mastocytosis is the result of an abnormal polyclonal proliferation of mast cells due to an activating mutation of the KIT receptor. An increase in inflammatory mediators explains the symptoms of pruritus, hypotension, flushing, and gastrointestinal (GI) upset. Cutaneous mastocytosis (CM), which affects the skin only, is more commonly seen in children. In the skin, mastocytosis may present with a hyperpigmented macule due to the stimulation of melanocytes by the same stem cell factor that promotes mast cell proliferation. One type of CM is maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis/urticaria pigmentosa. Other variants include diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis, cutaneous mastocytoma, and telangiectasia macularis eruptive perstans.

Systemic mastocytosis can affect nearly any organ in addition to possible skin involvement and is seen in more commonly in adults. The systemic involvement can be indolent or well differentiated.  The indolent form is indolent systemic mastocytosis.  The well-differentiated form is known as well-differentiated systemic mastocytosis. The skin, GI tract, and bone marrow are most commonly affected. Invasion of a specific organ can lead to organ dysfunction.

Mast cells and their mediators are common targets for pharmaceuticals. Antihistamines block histamine from interacting with its receptor and are widely used to treat type I hypersensitivity reactions. Cromolyn sodium is a mast cell stabilizer that is thought to act on both chloride channels and signaling proteins in the cell membrane to inhibit degranulation.
