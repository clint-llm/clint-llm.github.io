Complications of cognitive impairment include the inability to perform daily tasks of living, increased risk for infection, behavioral disturbances (hallucinations and psychosis with severe dementia), frequent falls, increased mortality, and personality changes.

As dementia progresses, individuals with cognitive impairment experience difficulties eating and swallowing and are at risk for aspiration. Functional disability can also restrict the patient from using utensils correctly, and likewise, depression can limit food intake.

Worsening agitation can be problematic to the patient as well as the caregivers. The possibility of environmental factors must be investigated first before any intervention. Excessive noise, uncomfortable temperature, and restraints can escalate behavioral disturbance.

Another common factor is unrecognized pain, as individuals with advanced cognitive impairment or dementia may not be able to verbally express discomfort. Addressing any potentiating factor is the key treatment.

Constant supervision and frequent assistance with activities and dealing with hallucinations, paranoia, and anger from the patient can contribute to caregiver burnout.
