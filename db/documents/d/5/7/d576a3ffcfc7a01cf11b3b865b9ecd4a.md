In the majority of cases, there are no medical sequelae to umbilical hernias. No tests are recommended, a thorough physical exam is sufficient to make the diagnosis and to discuss the common course of the condition with concerned parents. Although pediatric umbilical hernias are a common entity in healthy infants, they are also associated with some specific conditions, which the pediatrician or the pediatric surgeon should keep in mind when evaluating a patient. Pediatric umbilical hernias are seen more often in common autosomal trisomies (e.g., Trisomy 21 and 18), metabolic disorders (e.g., hypothyroidism, mucopolysaccharidoses) and some dysmorphic syndromes (e.g., Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Marfan syndrome). For this reason, it is important to distinguish healthy patients with an innocent finding of an isolated umbilical hernia, from patients with an umbilical hernia and other syndromic features, for example, macroglossia or hypotonia, the latter group warranting further evaluation.
