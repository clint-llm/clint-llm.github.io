The hamstring muscle complex receives vascular supply from the perforating branches of the deep femoral artery, also known as the profunda femoris artery. The profunda femoris artery is a branch of the femoral artery.

In general, the deep veins of the thigh share the same name as the major arteries they follow.Â The femoral vein is responsible for significant venous drainage of the thigh. It accompanies the femoral artery and receives additional venous drainage from the profunda femoris vein. Like the femoral artery, the femoral vein transitions to the external iliac vein at the level of the inguinal ligament.

The lymphatic drainage of the thigh also mirrors the arterial supply and eventually drains into the lumbar lymphatic trunks and cisterna chyli.
