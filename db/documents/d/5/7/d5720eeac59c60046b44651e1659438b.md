Arterial catheterization and monitoring are, in many cases, the standard of care for critically ill patients. The procedure is prevalent in the medical and surgical intensive care units and the operating room in both the adult and pediatric populations. Arterial catheterization allows for continuous blood pressure and mean arterial pressure monitoring and facilitates frequent blood gas sampling.

However, complications, including catheter-related infections, loss of distal blood flow, and the availability of other modalities for hemodynamic monitoring, have decreased the overall frequency of arterial catheterization; the placement of arterial catheters should not be considered routine in the management of critically ill pediatric patients.
