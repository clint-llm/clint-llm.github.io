The diaphragm has many other roles besides respiration. It acts as a barrier between the thoracic and abdominal cavity and prevents herniation of abdominal organs into the chest cavity.

Both penetrating and blunt trauma can injure the diaphragm. A tear or rupture of the diaphragm is often a difficult diagnosis. Options for diagnosis include laparoscopy, thoracoscopy or a CT scan. Irrespective of the size of the tear, the muscle must be repaired as soon as possible to prevent herniation of abdominal organs.

The diaphragm is also involved in hiccups. When the muscle is irritated, it can result in sudden contractions which can be uncomfortable. Most hiccups are short-lived, but in rare cases, hiccups may last for a day. If the hiccups persist, they can interfere with breathing.
