A GBEF of < 35% after a 3-minute infusion is considered abnormal. However, the symptoms of a few patients did not resolve after cholecystectomy. Previous studies show that those with such false positive GBEF received unnecessary cholecystectomy.

Various researchers, over the years, studied different doses and infusion times for the CCK test. The challenge of using this important test is to find the correct combination of dose and time, which provides the least variability.  Following more robust studies, the Hepatobiliary Practice Guideline of the Society of Nuclear Medicine recommends that a 60-minute infusion of CCK  at the rate of 0.02 mcg/kg be considered the standard method where GBEF of >38% is normal.

Chronic cholecystitis is the diagnosis when the GBEF is 6%, with the infusion of 0.01 mcg/kg of CCK over 3 minutes. There is significant variability in the GBEF when using this technique since different doses, and infusion rates can yield false-positive results.

An abnormal response to CCK stimulation by the sphincter of Oddi is also observable in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
