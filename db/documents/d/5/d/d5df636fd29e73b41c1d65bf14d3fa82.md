Pulmonary sequestration is thought to account for less than 6 percent of congenital lung malformations. In this condition, there is a nonfunctional segment or lobe of dysplastic lung tissue that does not communicate with the rest of the tracheobronchial tree and receives an anomalous vascular supply. Apart from incidental diagnosis on computed tomographic chest scans, the most common clinical presentation of intralobar sequestration is recurrent pneumonia in a localized segment of the lung. Alternative presentations include persistent cough, back pain, hemoptysis, or persistent exertional dyspnea. This activity explains when this condition should be considered on differential diagnosis, articulates how to properly evaluate for this condition, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of pulmonary sequestration.
- Review the typical presentation of a patient with intralobar pulmonary sequestration and compare it to that of a patient with extralobar pulmonary sequestration.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for pulmonary sequestration. 
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the detection of pulmonary sequestration.
