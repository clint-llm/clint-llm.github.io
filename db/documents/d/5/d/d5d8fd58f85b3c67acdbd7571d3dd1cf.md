Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is an intravascular imaging modality primarily used in interventional cardiology to characterize lesion morphology, quantify plaque burden, guide stent sizing, assess stent expansion, and identify procedural complications. This activity reviews the role of IVUS and its indications and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with coronary artery disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the technique for performing intravenous ultrasound.
- Describe the indications for intravenous ultrasound.
- Explain the clinical utility of intravenous ultrasound.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis of coronary artery disease using intravenous ultrasound.
