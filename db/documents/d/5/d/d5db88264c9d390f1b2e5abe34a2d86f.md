There are 58 unique known RTKs that subdivide into 20 subfamilies. All have an extracellular region with ligand-binding domains, a single transmembrane alpha-helix, and a cytoplasmic region consisting of a juxtamembrane domain, a tyrosine kinase domain (TKD), and a C-terminal tail. The ligand-binding domains of the extracellular region vary based on receptor subfamily. For the majority of RTKs, the ligand that is bound is a soluble growth factor peptide. Exceptions include the ephrin (Eph) family of receptors, whose ligands are membrane-bound ephrins on nearby cells, and discoidin receptors, activated by collagen fibers.

The intracellular signaling pathways associated with RTKs are triggered when adaptor proteins (e.g., Grb2) or protein kinases bind to phosphotyrosines on the RTK or its associated docking protein and become phosphorylated. A discussion of how ligand binding results in these phosphotyrosine-binding sites is in the “Mechanism” section. Phosphotyrosine binding is permitted by the Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains located on the adaptor proteins and protein kinases. Adaptor proteins also contain Src homology 3 (SH3) or WW domains that target polyproline regions on protein kinases and guanine nucleotide exchange factors. These allow for the formation of signaling complexes and further protein kinase activation. RTKs utilize several signaling pathways, including MAPK/ERK, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and PLCG1/PKC. These pathways regulate the transcription of numerous genes whose products promote cell differentiation, cell cycle progression, and cytoskeletal alteration and inhibit cell senescence and apoptosis. Interestingly, RTK signaling occurs in endosomes as well as at the cell surface, with different signaling pathways recruited depending on the location of the receptor.

Regulation of the activity of RTKs and their downstream pathways is critical, given the vital cellular processes they modulate. Negative feedback mechanisms are varied and occur at different levels in the signaling networks. The simplest example is the direct activation of protein tyrosine phosphatases, which dephosphorylate the tyrosine residues on active RTKs. In some RTKs, like epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), downstream effector kinases PKC and MAPK phosphorylate threonine residues in the juxtamembrane region, inhibiting high-affinity ligand binding. In the MAPK/ERK pathway specifically, MAPK phosphorylation of the upstream docking protein Gab1 and protein kinase Sos impairs their ability to interact with other proteins, while phosphorylation of upstream Raf kinase dampens its enzyme activity. All these mechanisms serve to inhibit or terminate the cellular response to RTK activation. Alternatively, RTK activity can undergo attenuation by removing receptors from the cell surface. Active RTKs recruit Cbl, a ubiquitin ligase that tags the receptors for endocytosis and degradation via ubiquitination.
