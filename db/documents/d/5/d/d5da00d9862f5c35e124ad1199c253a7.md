There is a paucity of histopathologic reports regarding Frey syndrome in the literature. An interesting example was published by Redleaf and McCabe of the University of Iowa, wherein they describe a rare case of Frey syndrome of the external auditory canal.

A 36-year-old patient had presented with a 6-month history of left watery otorrhea, eventually determined to be perspiration, that occurred only with eating. Resection of the canal skin with split-thickness skin graft reconstruction led to the resolution of the symptoms. Histopathologic analysis of the canal skin after hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed marked thickening (4.2 mm compared to 0.8 mm for normal bony canal skin) with hyperplasia and hypertrophy of sweat glands, which are not present in normal bony canal skin. This finding was postulated to be a result of aberrant parasympathetic influence.
