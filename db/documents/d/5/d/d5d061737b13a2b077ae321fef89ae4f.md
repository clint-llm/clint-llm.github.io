The trigeminal nerve (CN V) is responsible for sensory innervation of the face. The trigeminal nerve splits off into three main branches. The three branches that originate from the trigeminal nerve are the ophthalmic nerve (CN V1), the maxillary nerve (CN V2), and the mandibular nerve (CN V3). These nerves will provide sensory innervation to their respective territories. The trigeminal nerve also provides motor innervation to the muscles used in mastication. The maxillary nerve and the mandibular nerve will provide motor innervation to the muscles used for mastication. Each muscle that is involved in mastication receives a nerve that branches from the maxillary nerve or the mandibular nerve. For example, the mylohyoid muscle contributes to chewing, speaking, and swallowing. This muscle receives innervation from a nerve called the mylohyoid nerve. The mylohyoid nerve is one of the branches of the inferior alveolar nerve (branch of the mandibular nerve).
