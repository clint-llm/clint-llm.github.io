The presentation of SC is relatively nonspecific. Patients can be asymptomatic, and when symptomatic, patients typically will present with joint pain as a chief complaint. In association with swelling, reduced range of motion, and occasionally crepitus and mechanical locking.

Symptoms are usually worse with activity but can also present at rest. Patients may less commonly report instability, joint effusions, or evidence of involvement of the surrounding neurovascular structures.
