Hantaviruses are single-stranded, negative sense RNA viruses in the family Bunyaviridae. These viruses are associated with both hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in other parts of the world, notably Europe and East Asia. This activity illustrates the presentation, evaluation, and management of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.
- Describe the typical presentation of a patient with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.
- Describe the treatment and management options available for hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome and improve patient outcomes.
