Retinal pattern dystrophies are a group of diseases characterized by various patterns of pigment deposition, primarily in the macula. Various forms of mutation in the RDS/peripherin gene form the genetic basis for these dystrophies. It is critical to distinguish pattern dystrophies from age-related macular degeneration by utilizing a complete workup including fluorescein angiography, fundus autofluorescence, electroretinogram, and electrooculogram.

While most patients will experience a slowly progressive course with good visual acuity, a few will have a more rapid course causing a decline in central vision. There is no treatment for the pigment deposition; however, low vision aids are available for those few. Additionally, a minority of patients may experience complications such as macular holes or choroidal neovascularization, necessitating treatment with vitrectomy or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections.

It is important to refer patients suspected of retinal pattern dystrophy to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and testing so that the diagnosis can be confirmed, the patient appropriately followed, age-related macular degeneration ruled out, and complications managed should they arise.

Due to the complexity of diagnosis and potentially devastating consequences of complications such as choroidal neovascularization, the healthcare professional's consultation with ophthalmology should be done promptly in cases of suspected pattern dystrophy.
