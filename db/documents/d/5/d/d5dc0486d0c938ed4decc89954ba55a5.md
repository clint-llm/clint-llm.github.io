The innervation of the penis is derived from sacral nerve roots S2 through S4 via the pudendal nerve, which runs in the pudendal canal with the pudendal artery. The pudendal nerve divides within the pudendal canal to give terminal branches the dorsal penile nerves and the perineal branch.

The dorsal nerve on each side passes under the inferior ramus of the pubis, deep to the suspensory ligament, and each lies in its own space, which rarely communicates. These then continue directly within Buck’s fascia on the penis next to the dorsal vessels. The frenulum of the penis, in addition to receiving supply from the dorsal penile nerves, also receives innervation from a branch of the perineal nerve.
