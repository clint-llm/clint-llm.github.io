H2RAs decrease gastric acid secretion by reversibly binding to histamine H2 receptors located on gastric parietal cells, thereby inhibiting the binding and activity of the endogenous ligand histamine. H2 blockers thus function as competitive antagonists. Normally, after a meal, gastrin stimulates histamine release from enterochromaffin-like cells, which then binds to histamine H2 receptors on gastric parietal cells and leads to gastric acid release. This increase in gastric acid release occurs through the activation of adenylate cyclase, which raises intracellular cAMP levels. cAMP then activates protein kinase A (PKA), which, among other functions, phosphorylates proteins involved in the movement ofÂ  H+/K+ ATPase transporters to the plasma membrane. The increase of H+/K+ ATPase transporters at the plasma membrane allows for the secretion of more acid from parietal cells.

By blocking the histamine receptor and thus histamine stimulation of parietal cell acid secretion, H2RAs suppress both stimulated and basal gastric acid secretion induced by histamine.
