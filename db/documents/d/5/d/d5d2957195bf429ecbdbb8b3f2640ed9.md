Prognosis is good in ALD synthase deficiency and PHA AD when identified early and promptly treated. Many children can be weaned off medications, and some go into remission as they grow. Older children who are inadequately treated have retarded growth or failure to thrive but adequately treated grow normally and have a good catch up growth. PHA AR patients do not as a rule improve and will need close monitoring. PHA III patients will be cured once their primary renal infection or obstruction is resolved.

Diligent management of medications causing HA will reduce morbidity considerably. Most patients with HA post-adrenalectomy for Conn syndrome resolve early, while some at high-risk need surveillance.
