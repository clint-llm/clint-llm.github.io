There are no absolute contraindications for the use of these vitreous substitutes. However, few relative contraindications do exist.

**Gas**should be avoided in patients who want toair travel in the next few days because there is a significant change in bubble size with a change in the altitude. There is rapid expansion in bubble size and sudden IOP rise during the rapid ascent of the airplane (2000Â to 3000 feet per minute). This can cause severe ocular pain; and lead to central retinal artery occlusion, choroidal ischemia, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and permanent visual loss. Any volume is unsafe for air travel as some eyes may have a compromised outflow facility.

**SO**may predispose to keratopathy and/ or glaucoma aniridia.

**PFCL**may be avoided in eyes with RD due tocongenital cavitary anomalies of the ONH like the morning glory syndrome as it can migrate to the subretinal or the subarachnoid space.
