There is no specific treatment for CL or preventing the progression of the disease. Skin manifestations do not tend toÂ improve spontaneously. They can be treated by plastic surgery, which provides significant improvement, whatever the associated extracutaneous manifestations. Interventions are usually not complicated because of the absence of disorders concerning cicatrization, hemostasis, or dermal fragility, contrasting with Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. However, their results are transient, and relapse is the rule. Botulinum toxin has been used for acquired forms and localized ones. The involvement of other internal organs requires an interprofessional approach.
