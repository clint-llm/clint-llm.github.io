Sweat testing with QPIT is a quick, painless, safe, and reliable test used for CF diagnosis. The electrical stimulation is painless and does not cause discomfort. For safety reasons, the iontophoretic current source needs to be battery powered. Inspection for current control and leakage must be periodically performed by biomedical engineering according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. After a positive result, either a second testing sample is collected, or genetic testing is performed to confirm the diagnosis. Testing is only performed at CFF accredited cystic fibrosis centers. Other methods of measuring CTFR function, including measuring the total osmolality, conductivity, and sodium or potassium levels of sweat are not recommended for the diagnosis.

Further information about sweat testing for patients and families is available via the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.
