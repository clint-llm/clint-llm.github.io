Acne fulminans usually has a very sudden onset, and the acne often is ulcerating. Patients may complain of fever and pain in multiple joints. They typically provide a history that the conventional antibiotics used for treating acne did not work. Most patients mention that they did have acne in the past.

Acne fulminans is similar to acne conglobata with numerous inflammatory nodules on the trunk. The nodules often are painful to touch, ulcerated, hemorrhagic, and covered with crusts. Unlike acne conglobata, there are cysts and acutely inflamed lesions, but there are no polyporous comedones. Painful splenomegaly and erythema nodosum may be associated with systemic symptoms.

Patients with acne fulminans who have systemic symptoms may have a stooped posture due to bone and joint pain. The inflammatory arthralgia usually affects more than one joint, typically the knees, hips, and pelvis.
