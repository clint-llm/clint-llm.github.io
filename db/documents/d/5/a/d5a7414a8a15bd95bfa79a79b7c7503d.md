Macrosomia is commonly encountered during obstetric practice. It is associated with a higher likelihood of obstetric as well as neonatal complications. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as global epidemics. This activity aims at reviewing the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of pregnant women with macrosomia and highlights the role of obesity and diabetes with other risk factors in the pathogenesis of fetal macrosomia. It also emphasizes the importance of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology and epidemiology of fetal macrosomia.
- Outline an appropriate algorithm for a detailed history and physical evaluation of pregnant women presenting with fetal macrosomia.
- Summarize the various treatment and management options available for fetal macrosomia.
- Review some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication among the interprofessional team to advance pregnancies complicated by fetal macrosomia and improve maternal and neonatal outcomes.
