Calcified coronary lesions can cause significant hindrance to percutaneous interventions; such challenging plaques have conventionally been treated with high-pressure balloon expansion and possible atherectomy. However, these therapies are known not to be able to target all lesions successfully.

IVL provides significant advantages to earlier balloon-based interventions; the device does not require further training and is performable by a majority of interventional cardiologists, balloon opening pressure is low which reduces the risk of vascular injury, possible reduction in distal embolization potential, circumferential plaque targeting and a decrease in bias while passing the guidewire.

IVL is associated with the potential to cause significant fractures in most calcified lesions of patients who require coronary revascularization. Further, the device can be used with remarkable success and a small incidence of complications. The use of IVL has the potential to optimize stent expansion by allowing more effective vessel lumen dilatation.
