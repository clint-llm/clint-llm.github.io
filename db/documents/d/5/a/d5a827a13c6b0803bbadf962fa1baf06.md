**Osteosarcoma**

Osteosarcomas of the jaw present with swelling, as opposed to the pain often seen in osteosarcoma of the axial skeleton.

**Fibrous Dysplasia**

Fibrous dysplasia presents as painless, asymmetric bony expansion in children and adolescents. Its onset tends to occur with periods of high skeletal growth and will often stabilize as skeletal maturity is obtained.

**Central Giant Cell Granuloma**

Central giant cell granuloma may be indolent, causing a painless bony swelling.

**Osteoma**

Osteomas are slow-growing lesions that can remain asymptomatic for years. This means that they can be incidental findings on imaging. Depending on their location and size, they can cause distortion of form and function. They can lead to trismus, malocclusion, and occasionally pain; aesthetically, they can cause facial asymmetry and prominent swellings.

**Osteochondroma**

As these lesions commonly occur in the mandibular condyle or coronoid process, symptoms are related to temporomandibular joint dysfunction.

**Osteoblastoma**

Often patients will show minimal symptoms of osteoblastoma, and swelling with fluctuating, dull-pain related to bone expansion may be experienced. The duration of symptoms varies from months to years.

Osteoblastomas are classically felt to have limited growth potential, not exceeding 4cm. The exception to this is an aggressive osteoblastoma seen in younger individuals.
