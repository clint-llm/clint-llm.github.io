History and physical exam findings for anhidrosis will differ between the various underlying etiologies. A thorough history should be obtained, including past medical history, medications, medical treatments (i.e., radiation therapy), and family history. A careful and detailed history will yield clues to a potential diagnosis.

A patient may complain of heat intolerance, fatigue, drowsiness, or inability to concentrate in warm environments. A patient with central/neuropathic anhidrosis may have accompanying neurological symptoms such as ptosis and miosis in Horner syndrome. Although very rare, a patient with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis will present with self-mutilation.

Those with anhidrosis due to destruction will have the physical exam findings of the underlying etiology, such as scarring from a prior burn or sclerotic changes as in morphea.

Anhidrosis caused by obstruction will likewise have the physical exam findings associated with the underlying etiology, such as psoriatic plaques or lamellar ichthyosis.
