Contraindications for submandibular gland excision include the presence of a malignant neoplasm or suspicion of a malignant neoplasm. In this case, a submandibular gland excision alone is inappropriate. Co-morbid medical conditions may be a contraindication for submandibular gland excision if the patient cannot tolerate the procedure safely. This procedure is performed under general anesthesia in the vast majority of cases though it has been performed under local anesthesia in very select circumstances.
