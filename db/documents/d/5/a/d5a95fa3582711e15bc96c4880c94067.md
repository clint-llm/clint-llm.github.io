Gluteus maximus function is testable in the clinical setting. The test begins with the patient in the prone position with the lower limb straight. Next, the patient tightens the buttocks as much as possible and extends their hip while the examiner palpates the gluteus maximus and feels for contraction.

Gluteus maximus dysfunction is most likely due to inferior gluteal nerve dysfunction; this would cause difficulty with the patient rising from a seated position or climbing stairs and losing hip extension. The most common cause of inferior gluteal nerve dysfunction is posterior hip dislocation.
