The delivery of mechanical ventilation in the prone position in intensive care unit (ICU) patients has been shown to improve oxygenation in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Outside the ICU, prone positioning may be necessary during surgical procedures, particularly involving the posterior anatomical structures, to ease access.

According to the 2010 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and emergency cardiovascular critical care (ECC), it may be reasonable for providers to initiate CPR while in a prone position if the patient cannot be placed in a supine position.
