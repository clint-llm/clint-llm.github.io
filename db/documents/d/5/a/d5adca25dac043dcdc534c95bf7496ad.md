Any patient presenting with exudative retinal detachment should not only receive treatment solely by an ophthalmologist in isolation, but it also requires a multispecialty evaluation by a chest physician, radiologist, infectious disease expert, rheumatologist, gastroenterologist, endocrinologist, and the neurologist.

These patients can then be followed by their primary clinicians, who should ensure correct dosing on the medication management aspect of the condition. Nursing will be the first department to come in contact with the patients on follow-up and can assess the treatment progress as well as evaluate compliance with both medication and lifestyle measures, and report any issue to the primary care physician. This collaborative, interprofessional team approach to care can ensure optimal patient outcomes.
