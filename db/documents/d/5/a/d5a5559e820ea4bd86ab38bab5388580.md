- Recently administered gastrointestinal contrast or radionuclides

- Pregnancy

- Severe degenerative changes or fracture deformity in the measurement area

- Implants, hardware, devices, or other foreign material in the measurement area

- The patient’s inability to attain the correct position and/or remain motionless for the measurement
