The initial designs of the constrained RTSA prosthesis were not successful and had to be withdrawn because of the high failure rate.

The large size of the glenoid hemisphere causes medialization of the center of rotation. The bigger humeral neck-shaft ankle lowers the center of rotation and the proximal humerus, which increases the deltoid tension. The common problems associated with the newer prosthesis design were scapular notching, bony impingement, and polyethylene wear.

Currently, there are various models of RTSA available in the market which vary in design.

- A cementless glenoid base plate; is seated on the prepared glenoid and fixed by multidirectional screws.

- The modular glenosphere; is usually half of a sphere and is secured on top of the glenoid base plate.

- The humeral stem; is inserted into the prepared humerus. Two types of stems are available either cemented stem or cementless press-fit stem.

- The humeral cup; is fitted on top of the humeral stem. It is designed to allow the concave insert to be secured on top of it.

- A concave polyethylene insert is fitted on top of the humeral cup. It is concave and articulates with the geosphere.
