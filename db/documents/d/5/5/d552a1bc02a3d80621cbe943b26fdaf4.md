Abnormalities of the fallopian tubes have been implicated in up to one-third of infertility cases. Causes that may negatively impact fallopian tube structure or function include congenital absence or malformation, infections such as Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhea, genital tuberculosis, and endometriosis adhesions, causing tubal distortion. As such, a history of recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease related to these infections or a history of intra-abdominal surgery leading to adhesions correlates with a higher risk of tubal factor infertility. An increased number of past infections also correlates with increased severity of damage to the fallopian tubes.

Tubal occlusion investigation can be by hysterosalpingography or hysteroscopy. Interventions for occlusion specific to the fallopian tube include selective salpingography, recanalization, re-anastomosis, and neosalpingostomy.
