Patients treated non surgically may be followed by the primary care clinicians but all patients undergoing surgery must be followed by the surgeon, as complications are not uncommon.

Interprofessional communications between the treatment team consisting of the nurse practitioner, physician assistant, nursing, pharmacy, and physicians and the radiologist are therefore crucial to enhance timely diagnosis and successful treatment.
