Mild cases warrant a referral to physical therapy for pain reduction and strengthening exercises to the weak muscles coupled with a range of motion (ROM) to the ankle to prevent contractures. If EMG shows complete loss of neural continuity along with evidence of neurotmesis or axonotmesis, an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) is indicated. The purpose of the brace is to maintain the foot in neutral during the toe-off phase of the gait cycle. Periodic skin checks are necessary since the anesthetic foot can develop pressure ulcers at the contact points with the brace. A shoe wide enough to accommodate the brace is necessary.

Tibialis posterior tendon transfer or peroneal or tibial nerve transfer can be useful for patients with foot drop leading to high steppage gait.

A home exercise program should be an integral part of therapy.
