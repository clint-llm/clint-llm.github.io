GLAD lesions disrupt the labrum and the underlying glenoid cartilage within the glenohumeral (GH) joint. The GH joint itself is formed by the articulation of the humeral head within the glenoid fossa of the scapula, a synovial ball and socket joint. The fossa is lined by articular cartilage and surrounded at its margin by a fibrocartilaginous rim: the labrum.

The anteroinferior GH ligament and anteroinferior labrum together form the anterior labroligamentous complex. This provides an important restraint to anterior dislocation and is considered the most essential soft tissue structure in maintaining anterior shoulder stability.

GLAD lesions typically arise when the humeral head impactsÂ the glenoid fossa due to forceful adduction. There may be a shear force in addition. This causes a superficial tear to the labrum along its anterior-inferior aspect and a variable degree of underlying cartilage damage. This may include a focal cartilage defect, a more substantial flap tear, or even a loose chondral body.

Classically, the integrity of the anterior labroligamentous complex is preserved, which explains why the shoulder joint remains stable in these cases.
