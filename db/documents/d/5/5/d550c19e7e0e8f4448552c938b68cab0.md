The posterior thigh is a functional unit of the lower body that helps to connect the pelvis to the knee. It plays a significant role in the lower limb, pelvis, and locomotor system biomechanics.

The posterior thigh has wide functions, such as the dependency of the kinetic chain to perform agonist-antagonist movements. The three muscles of the posterior thigh stabilize the knee and help to stabilize the pelvis.
