A team of pediatricians, gynecologists, and pediatric urologists are needed for the evaluation and treatment of imperforate hymen. In the case of an imperforate hymen, early diagnosis will prevent both short-term and long-term complications that may otherwise have a delayed, advanced presentation that may include acute kidney injury and even peritonitis.

Prompt diagnosis and treatment optimize both short-term symptom management and long-term reproductive potential while minimizing urologic complications. The positive impact on the patient from earlier diagnosis and treatment includes relief of suffering from pelvic pain, decreased morbidity related to infertility complications, and resolution of urinary tract obstruction. The successful surgical treatment promotes patency of the vaginal canal and prevents post-operative infection to reduce the risk of hospitalization or further procedures that bear morbidity to the pediatric patient.
