Although CVI is a well-known precipitant for VLU development, ulceration occurs rarely (5.1%) for unclear reasons.

At a cellular level, mast cell degranulation, leukocyte recruitment, increased matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors and prostacyclin, the acquisition of a non-contractile secretory phenotype by smooth muscle cells, and fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts participate in vein wall remodeling and varix formation. The proinflammatory microenvironment is maintained by M1 macrophages, mainly through the release of IL-1α, IFN-γ, and TGF-β1. Ultimately, chronic inflammation and incompetent blood flow favor thrombus formation, causing further fibrosis and valvular destruction.

The majority of risk factors for the development of VLUs are non-modifiable, and patients often present more than one. These involve a family history of CVI, advanced age, female sex, previous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, multiparity, lipodermatosclerosis, musculoskeletal and joint disease.

Genetics traits may be an additional predisposing factor, apparently presenting as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance.

Compared with healing VLUs, the gene expression profile of non-healing VLUs showed upregulation of secreted frizzled-related protein 4, branched-chain aminotransferase 1, dermatopontin, cytochrome P450, and 17 B hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase genes, which are involved in inflammation control, Wnt signaling, cell growth, extracellular matrix assembly, and steroidogenesis.
