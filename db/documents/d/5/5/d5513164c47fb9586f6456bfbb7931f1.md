Agoraphobia itself is associated with significant distress and impairment in life. In severe cases, it can cause individuals to become completely home-bound and dependent on others for anything that requires leaving oneâ€™s home. This can lead to self-medication with non-prescription medications or other substances. The DSM-5 states that remission rates without treatment are quite low, with averages estimated at about 10%.

Agoraphobia is also associated with an increased risk of developing comorbid major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), and substance use disorders.
