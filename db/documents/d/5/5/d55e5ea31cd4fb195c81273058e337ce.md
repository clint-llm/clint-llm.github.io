The extensor carpi ulnaris gets its vascular supply primarily from the ulnar artery, which branches off the brachial artery near the antecubital fossa and supplies the medial aspect of the forearm. Due to the muscle's location in the posterior compartment of the forearm, it also receives some blood supply from the posterior interosseous artery, a posterior branch of the radial artery that runs between the superficial and deep extensor muscle groups, supplying both.

The lymphatic drainage of the upper limb consists of both superficial and deep lymphatic vessels. The superficial lymphatic vessels of the hand and forearm ascend the arm along with the superficial veins, such as the basilic vein, and enter the cubital lymph nodes near the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Superficial lymphatic vessels traveling more proximally to the cephalic vein primarily drain into the apical axillary lymph nodes, though the deltopectoral lymph nodes are another potential drainage site. The deep lymphatic vessels of the arm and forearm follow the deep veins and end up in the humeral axillary lymph nodes and, eventually, the subclavian lymphatic trunk.
