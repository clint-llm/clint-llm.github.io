The main adverse effects can be metabolic abnormalities, infection risk, or associated venous access.

**Venous Access:**It is associated with the insertion of the central line catheter.

- Pneumothorax

- Air embolism

- Bleeding

- Venous thrombosis

- Vascular injury

**Catheter Site Infections**

- Central line-associated bloodstream infection(CLABSI)

- Local skin infection at insertion or exit site

**Metabolic Abnormalities**

- Refeeding syndrome in chronic alcoholic patients and in patients who have nothing-by-mouth status (NPO) for more than 7 to 10 days

- Hyperglycemia

- Sudden discontinuation can lead to hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is correctable with 50% dextrose.

- Serum electrolyte abnormalities

- Wernicke’s encephalopathy

- Parenteral-associated cholestasis

Due to safety concerns and the complexity of administration, parenteral nutrition is considered high risk by the ISMP(Institute for Safe Medication Practice).
