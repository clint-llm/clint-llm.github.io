The lesions of congenital milia do not require any particular treatment since these lesions tend to resolve spontaneously. The other forms of primary milia, along with secondary milia, may not resolve on their own, and they could be treated withÂ simple surgical interventions such as evacuation, with a tiny incision with a scalpel blade and tangential pressure applied with a comedone extractor or curette. Other treatment options for multiple milia include topical retinoids and electrodesiccation or electrocautery.
