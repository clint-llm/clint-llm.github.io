Transient global amnesia (TGA) is acute onset anterograde amnesia that is temporary and usually occurs in middle-aged and older individuals. It is often precipitated by particularly strenuous activity, high-stress events, or coitus, but it can be seen with migraines. Studies have been inconclusive as to whether there are risk factors for the development of transient global amnesia, though some have suggested an association with a history of prior heart disease, migraine, or hyperlipidemia. Patients often present with repetitive questioning and total anterograde memory loss that resolves within 24 hours. While there may be disorientation with respect to other people and location, the patients do not lose self-awareness. The symptoms, once resolved, rarely recur and no other neurological deficits present with this condition. The diagnosis is largely a diagnosis of exclusion. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients transient global amnesia and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify risk factors for transient global amnesia. 
- List the differential diagnosis of transient global amnesia. 
- Describe the evaluation of transient global amnesia. 
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by transient global amnesia.
