The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition includes 10 separate classes of drugs of abuse, which include alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics, stimulants, and tobacco, and other substances. These drugs produce such an intense activation of the reward system that the individuals using them may neglect activities that were once routine. This activity reviews the abuse of drugs and alcohol in the United States and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in helping curb abuse and treat addiction.
