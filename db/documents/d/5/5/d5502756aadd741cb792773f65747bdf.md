As stated in previous sections, complications from acute urinary retention are from the underlying causes and treatments. They include infection, renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, stricture of the urethra, bladder neck dilation, and detrusor muscle dysfunction. The treatment via catheterization for bladder decompression can result in adverse events such as hematuria, which occurs between 2 to 16 percent of the patients but is rarely significant. This complication usually resolves with irrigation.
