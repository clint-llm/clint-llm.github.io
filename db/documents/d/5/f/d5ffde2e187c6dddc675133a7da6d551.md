The neurohypophysis is made of the axons arising predominantly from magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. They form the hypothalamohypophyseal tract and these axons terminate near the sinusoids of the posterior lobe. The neurosecretory granules mostly contain oxytocin or vasopressin. The axon terminals are supported by pituicytes, which express the Thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1Â and demonstrate only patchy GFAP and S100 expression.
