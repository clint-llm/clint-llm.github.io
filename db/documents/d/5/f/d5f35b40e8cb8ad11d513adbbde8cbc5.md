A malfunctioning gallbladder causes cholecystitis. The liver makes bile, which travels down the bile duct, to be stored in the gallbladder. After eating certain foods, especially spicy or greasy foods, the gallbladder is stimulated to empty the bile out of the gallbladder, through the cystic duct, down the bile duct into the duodenum. This process aids in food digestion. If the gallbladder is improperly functioning, the bile may notÂ empty completely, which may lead to stone formation. Gallstones can cause mechanical blockage of the cystic duct. The gallbladder also serves to concentrate bile and reabsorb water from the bile. The gallbladder can store up to 1500 mL of bile and can distend if there is an outlet obstruction. If this outlet obstruction is complete, usually from an impacted gallstone in the cystic duct, the bile salts will get reabsorbed by the gallbladder mucosa over time and be replaced by clear, watery mucus. Other etiologies of gallbladder mucocele include anything that causes a blockage of the cystic duct or distal biliary tree. Neoplasms, including gallbladder polyps and tumors, can result in hydrops. Congenital strictures, gallbladder parasites, and external compression from liver disease or tumors can also cause gallbladder mucoceles. Other factors that can lead to hydrops include anything that increases the risk of cholecystitis, such as drastic weight reduction, prolonged TPN, gastric surgeries with disruption of the vagus nerve, critical illness, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypercalcemia, and biliary conditions such as Caroli disease. Patients with acute acalculous cholecystitis can also form gallbladder mucoceles. The mechanism is the same as that of mechanical cystic duct obstructions. However, this is a functional condition resulting in a non-emptying, distended gallbladder where biliary mucus replaces bile salts.
