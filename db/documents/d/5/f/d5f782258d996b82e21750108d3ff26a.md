When patients develop ascites from whatever cause, the treatment usually involves a team of healthcare professionals, including nurses, pharmacists, physicians, and other allied healthcare workers. These patients not only need to be treated for the acute infection but also the primary disorder causing the fluid build-up. The patients are often emaciated and need a dietary consultation. A physical therapy consult is required in order to increase mobility and muscle function. The pharmacist must ensure that the patient is on no medications that can worsen liver or renal function and abstain from alcohol use. The nurse has to monitor the patient's abdomen circumference, body weight, and vital signs regularly to make sure that the treatment is working. The family has to be educated on the signs and symptoms of bacterial peritonitis and when to bring the patient back to the hospital. There is a small margin for errors, and any delay in seeking help can lead to mortality.

**Outcomes**

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis carries a mortality rate of 30 to 70% in patients with end-stage liver and kidney disease. The mortality rates are lower in children with nephrosis. Recently the mortality rates have shown a slight decrease because of earlier diagnosis and advances in treatment. For the patient who develops septic shock secondary to bacterial peritonitis, the mortality increases each hour until antibiotic therapy is started.
