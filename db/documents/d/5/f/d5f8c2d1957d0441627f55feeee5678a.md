Beckwith-Weidemann syndrome (BWS) is a heterogeneous syndrome that could affect one or multiple systems. Classic features may or may not be obvious at birth. The etiology of BWS is complex. Most cases are sporadic molecular alterations of genes in the chromosome 11p15 region. The index of suspicion should be high when evaluating a case of BWS, with strong consideration of the use of genetic/molecular testing to confirm the diagnosis. Anticipatory guidance of the complications is fundamental in the care for these patients, with special consideration of a tumor protocol surveillance given the high risk of developing embryonal tumors during infancy and childhood. Early diagnosis and a holistic management approach with a multidisciplinary team are also indispensable to ensure a good prognosis for the patient.
