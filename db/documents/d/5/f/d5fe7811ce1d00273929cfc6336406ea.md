Here is the technique:

- 0.4 to 0.8 mL methylprednisolone is injected using a 25-gauge spinal needle through the anteroinferior anesthetized region into the middle ear space until full.

- Consider a secondary perforation, known as a borehole, made on the tympanic membrane to relieve pressure. At the same time, the medication is being injected, avoiding barotrauma to the round window. Alternatively, a pressure-equalization tube (grommet) can be placed for patients requiring regular intratympanic medication.

- Following administration, the patient remains supine with injected ear up and avoids swallowing, yawning, or speaking for 20Â to 30 minutes to facilitate steroid passage across the round window membrane and prevent leakage into the eustachian tube.
