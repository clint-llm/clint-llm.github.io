Patients often present with the symptoms of irritation in the eye, lacrimation, foreign body sensation, cosmetic blemish, and various functional problems, which include diminution of vision and difficulty in the fitting of contact lens.

Detailed history including age, sex, occupation, exposure to irritants like sun, smoke, and dust should be taken. Any previous treatment history and family history of pterygium are to be asked. General physical examination and systemic examination to exclude the presence of collagen-vascular or mucocutaneous disorders should be carried out.

History should be taken to classify the pterygium into (a) primary pterygium (b) recurrent pterygium.

Old textbooks define malignant pterygium as a recurrent pterygium with symblepharon formation and restrictions of ocular movements. However, pterygium is a non-malignant condition and must be differentiated from malignant conditions like ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) by clinical features, impression cytology, and/or histopathology.
