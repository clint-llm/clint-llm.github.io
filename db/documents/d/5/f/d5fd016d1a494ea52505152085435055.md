Initial laboratory testing should include serum chemistry (particularly sodium, potassium, glucose, and calcium), complete blood count with differential, cortisol level, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), aldosterone, renin, and thyroid function.

Although a reliable diagnosis of underlying adrenal insufficiency is not possible during the initial period of fulminant adrenal crisis, a measurement of blood ACTH and cortisol during the crisis (before treatment with corticosteroids is given)  is often enough to make a preliminary diagnosis. Providers should not delay treatment pending these results. Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease) is characterized by low cortisol and high ACTH. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is characterized by low cortisol and low to normal ACTH. Workup and treatment for other suspected underlying etiologies on the differential should happen simultaneously.

An EKG may show peaked T waves from hyperkalemia or short QT interval from hypercalcemia.
