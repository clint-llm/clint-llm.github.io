**Creatinine
**

Preanalytical issues such as high-protein intake and increased muscle bulk may lead to elevated creatinine levels, but it is not representative of the actual renal function in an individual. Likewise, serum creatinine as a marker of renal function is often unreliable in those with decreased muscle bulk such as the elderly, amputees, and individuals affected by muscular dystrophy. Creatinine is commonly measured on automated analyzers using either a colorimetric reaction known as the Jaffe reaction or an enzymatic assay. The Jaffe reaction involves the formation of an alkaline picrate. It is subject to negative (for example, bilirubin) and positive interferences (for example, ketones and proteins). Various modifications to the Jaffe reaction have been made to overcome some of these issues.

**BUN**

Serum urea/BUN concentrations may also be raised in the presence of a high-protein diet or with patients using oral corticosteroids.

**Urine Albumin and Protein
**

Urine albumin or protein may be increased in the presence of conditions not related to renal disease, for example, posture, fever, and exercise. Furthermore, in the presence of a urinary tract infection, urine protein levels may be raised without any intrinsic renal pathology present.
