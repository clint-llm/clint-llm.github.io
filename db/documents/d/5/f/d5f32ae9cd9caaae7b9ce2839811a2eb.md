This disease is recurrent, chronic, and difficult to treat. The prognosis depends on early diagnosis and the response to treatment. If allowed to run its course without intervention, this disease may, in severe cases, cause corneal perforations and ulcers. A detailed history and physical exam will be the key to diagnosis. CT scans may assist in diagnosing but should not be used to rule out giant fornix syndrome.

Mild disease appears to be effectively curable within weeks if treated with systemic antibiotics and high dose antibiotic/steroid combination eye drops. Mild to moderate disease can also be treated similarly but may require life-long use of a low dose antibiotic/steroid combination eye drop to prevent reoccurrence.Â Mild, moderate, and possibly severe disease can potentially be treated or cured in weeks with aggressive use of povidone-iodine washes and manual disruption of the coagulum using a cotton swab in conjunction with antibiotics and steroids.
