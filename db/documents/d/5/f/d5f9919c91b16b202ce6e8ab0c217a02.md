In a recent institutional review, patients were found to have a 3-year and 5-year survival of 55% and 35%, respectively. Median survival has been noted at just 7 months. Good prognostic factors have been found to be age (younger than 50 years), localized tumor stage, and anatomical site (trunk). The reason for increased survival in patients with angiosarcomas of the trunk is unclear.
