Sonography of the pelvis is the first resort and primary evaluation technique for any suspected pelvic pathology after clinical examination. Portable ultrasound machines (PUM) and office ultrasound machines have revolutionized gynecology and obstetrics practice.

No radiation exposure, real-time imaging, the dynamic vascular study of the organs, three dimensional and four-dimensional sonography has given an edge to sonography imaging over various other imaging and diagnostic techniques. Various commonly practiced pelvic sonography techniques are transabdominal, transvaginal, transperineal, and endosonography. Extension of routine pelvic sonography like sonohysterosalpingography, Doppler ultrasound, and three-dimensional and four-dimensional ultrasound have widened the scope of pelvic sonography for various indications over other imaging modalities.

The ultrasound features and signs are based on parameters like the amount of transmission, absorption, the reflection of sound waves, and the angle of reflection. Every tissue has its sound reflection characteristics depending on the size, depth, shape, content, and margins of the organ. The amount of transmission, absorption, and reflection of sound waves is based on these tissue characteristics, which determine normal and abnormal ultrasound image patterns. When there is a complete reflection of sound waves from a structure, it appears hyperechoic (white-bright).

When a structure allows partial penetration of sound waves and partial reflection, the structures take various shades of grey scales in ultrasound images. When there is a complete transmission of sound waves through water, it appears anechoic (black-dark). Hence in transabdominal ultrasound, a full bladder scanning is performed, which allows complete penetration of sound waves to its posterior pelvic structures and displaces the bowel laterally, allowing complete evaluation of pelvic organs. With this understanding, we review the radiological features of the pelvic structures.
