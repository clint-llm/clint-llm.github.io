Oxytocin is indicated and approved by the FDA for two specific time frames in the obstetric world: antepartum and postpartum. In the antepartum period, exogenous oxytocin is FDA-approved for strengthening uterine contractions with the aim of successful vaginal delivery of the fetus. There are three situations during the antepartum period, which indicate the use of oxytocin. These include mothers with preeclampsia, maternal diabetes, premature rupture of the membranes, mothers with inactive uteri that require stimulation into labor, and mothers with inevitable or incomplete abortions in their second trimester. Postpartum, oxytocin is FDA-approved when it is time to deliver the placenta during the third stage of labor and control postpartum hemorrhage. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of oxytocin so providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes where oxytocin has therapeutic benefit.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for the therapeutic use of oxytocin.
- Describe the mechanism of action of oxytocin that gives it its therapeutic effects.
- Review the potential adverse events and contraindications to using oxytocin.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients who might benefit from therapy with oxytocin.
