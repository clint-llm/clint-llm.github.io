There have been no reported cases of malignant transformation of granular parakeratosis. Patients with granular parakeratosis may develop secondary overlying bacterial infections, especially in patients with symptomatic pruritic lesions that become impetiginized with scratching. Granular parakeratosis has been found to be concomitantly present with other common skin conditions such as tinea corporis.
