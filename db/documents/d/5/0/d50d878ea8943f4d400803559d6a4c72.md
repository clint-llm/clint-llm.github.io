Depending upon the type of imaging study a patient is undergoing, patients are encouraged to follow specific instructions to optimize results. Patients are usually required to avoid any consumption by mouth after midnight before myocardial perfusion imaging study to minimize the possibility of increased gastric metabolic activity interfering with the evaluation of the inferior wall. Additionally, caffeine, other sympathomimetic medications, nitroglycerine, or beta-blockers should be held to optimize evaluation for coronary artery disease. Jewelry and other metal objects should not be worn to avoid any potential imaging artifacts. For exercise stress testing, patients are encouraged to wear comfortable clothing and shoes.
