Primary clinicians should screen all patients for alcohol abuse and intravenous drug use. Patients should be educated regarding the harmful effects of intravenous drug use, an overdose of medications like acetaminophen, and excessive alcohol consumption. Resources for rehabilitation for these should be offered. High-risk patients should be screened annually for viral hepatitis.
