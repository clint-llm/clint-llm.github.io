Aspergillus infections are best managed by an interprofessional team because of their seriousness. In immunocompromised people, the infection can rapidly turn fatal. In patients with prior lung disease or those who are immunocompromised, it is recommended that one consult with an infectious disease expert for management. The outcomes after an aspergillusÂ infection depend on the patient's comorbidity and immune status. In healthy people, the outcomes are good but in immunocompromised patients, the outcomes are guarded.
