Addison disease is an acquired primary adrenal insufficiency, a rare but potentially life-threatening endocrine disorder that results from bilateral adrenal cortex destruction leading to decreased production of adrenocortical hormones, including cortisol, aldosterone, and androgens. Addison disease's insidious course of action usually presents with glucocorticoid deficiency followed by mineralocorticoid; however, it can present acutely,  often triggered by intercurrent illness. The term Addison disease is used when there is a primary adrenal insufficiency.

The most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency is autoimmune adrenalitis (Addison disease), associated with increased levels of 21-hydroxylase antibodies.
