Harlequin syndrome is a rare dysautonomic syndrome first reported by lance et al. in 1988.

It is a benign self-resolutive syndrome. However, the sudden dramatic, colorful presentation of this condition can bring a lot of distress and anxiety to the patient and families. Familiarisation with this syndrome helps the clinicians identify the condition and appropriately direct patient care.
