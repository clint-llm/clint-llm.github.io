NF1 associated OPG is generally considered to have a better prognosis. However, this appears to be driven primarily by patient selection bias and tumor location. Many OPGs show little to no progression over time and may remain asymptomatic for the patient’s entire lifetime. These are often found incidentally in patients with NF1 but are almost always symptomatic in sporadic cases.

An excellent detailed review of the literature by Jonathan Dutton has shown that when all patients with optic pathway gliomas in all locations and with all forms of treatment (including observation) are considered, tumor recurrence or progression occurs in 38% of cases.

Spontaneous regression of optic gliomas is rare but has been reported.
