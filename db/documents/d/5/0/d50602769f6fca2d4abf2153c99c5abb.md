Onychomycosis is a common infection that is increasing in incidence. In the United States, Trichophyton rubrum was initially thought to be a culture contaminant, but since the advent of international travel to Asia, T. rubrum has become the dominant causative organism in the United States. At least half of abnormal toenails are mycotic. Prevalence estimates range from 1% to 8%, and the incidence is increasing. It has been reported that patients are genetically susceptible to dermatophyte infections in an autosomal dominant pattern. Risk factors include aging, diabetes, tinea pedis, psoriasis, immunodeficiency, and living with family members who have onychomycosis.
