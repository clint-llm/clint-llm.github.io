Lyme carditis has been reported in 1 to 5% of diagnosed patients with Lyme disease. The most prominent manifestations are conduction system disturbances involving the AV node. The early identification and proper treatment with antibiotics is a clue to lower the risk of cardiovascular complications, avoid sequela, and shorten the duration of the disease. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Lyme carditis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Lyme carditis. 
- Describe the screening indications for Lyme carditis. 
- Summarize the management considerations for patients with Lyme carditis.
