CSF is chiefly produced by the choroid plexus, which is located within the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles. It travels through the ventricular system from the lateral ventricle to the third ventricle via the foramen of Monro, from third to the fourth ventricle via the cerebral aqueduct or aqueduct of Sylvius. It leaves the fourth ventricle through two lateral foramina of Luschka and median foramen of Magendie to enter basal cisterns, and part of it continues to flow around the spinal cord and in the central canal of the spinal cord.

The main sites of CSF absorption are arachnoid granulations that projects into dural venous sinuses, especially superior sagittal sinus. CSF is absorbed into the venous sinuses and enters systemic circulation. The average CSF volume is approximately 150 ml, and the daily production is about 500ml. This means that the total CSF volume is replaced three times per 24hours.

CFS flows slowly from sites of production to the sites of absorption according to the “bulk flow” model. Any physical or functional obstruction within the ventricular system, subarachnoid space, or venous sinuses can be a reason for developing hydrocephalus. An obstructive lesion or gliosis can block CSF flow within the ventricular system. Inflammation or scarring of subarachnoid space or elevated venous pressure within the venous sinuses can impair CSF absorption into the systemic circulation.

According to the Monro-Kellie doctrine, the total volume of the brain, CSF, and blood within the skull is constant. An increase in one compartment must accompany a decrease in volume in another compartment; otherwise, the pressure within the head will be increased, as happens in hydrocephalus. Increased ICP results in transependymal extravasation of CSF into the brain tissue causing brain damage and pressure-induced atrophy.
