Glycopyrrolate's primary mechanism of action is the blockage of acetylcholine's effects at the parasympathetic sites in various tissues. This blockage primarily occurs in the central nervous system, smooth muscle, and secretory glands. It also reduces the rate of salivation by preventing the stimulation of the acetylcholine receptors themselves. Glycopyrrolate does not cross the blood-brain barrier or the placenta. It has a slower diffusion rate relative to other anticholinergic drugs such as atropineÂ and scopolamine.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Glycopyrrolate exhibits onset of action within 1 minute when given intravenously and an elimination half-life of approximately 50 minutes. Glycopyrrolate undergoes urinary excretion and elimination. It differs from atropine in being a quaternary amine and has both cyclopentane and pyridine moieties in the compound.
