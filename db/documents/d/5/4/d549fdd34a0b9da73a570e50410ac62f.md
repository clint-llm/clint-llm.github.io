Arthrocentesis is a procedure performed to aspirate synovial fluid from a joint cavity. It has both diagnostic and therapeutic utilization. While arthrocentesis is deemed to be a minor surgical procedure, there is always potential to injure blood vessels, nerves, and tendons. Thus, the procedure should only be performed by clinicians with knowledge of the anatomy of the joint. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, complications, and technique involved in performing knee arthrocentesis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the technique involved in performing knee arthrocentesis.
- Review the indications for knee arthrocentesis.
- Summarize the complications of knee arthrocentesis.
- Explain the importance of enhancing care coordination among interprofessional team members to ensure the correct and safe performance of arthrocentesis and thereby improve patient outcomes.
