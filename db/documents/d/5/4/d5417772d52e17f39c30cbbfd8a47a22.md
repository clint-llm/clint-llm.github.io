Over 150000 people undergo amputations of the lower extremity in the United States each year.

This activity will focus on amputations at the level of the femur and distally; it will cover above-knee, through-knee,Â and below-knee amputations. In addition, it will describe the technique for certain foot amputations (Syme, Chopart, Boyd), but the reader is encouraged to seek further in-depth text for review of these techniques. Amputations are procedures that are performed surgically although on rare occasions and limited settings can be performed employing cryoamputation.
