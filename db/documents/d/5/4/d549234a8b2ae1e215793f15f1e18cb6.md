Fine motor disability is differentiated from gross motor disability and is reflected in the way in which clinicians separately test fine motor ability compared with gross motor ability. Gross motor ability is tested classically in a myotomal or nerve distribution fashion whereby the patient is asked to perform a simple motor task that indicates to the clinician intact innervation.

Fine motor control, conversely, is assessed by a clinician asking the patient to perform tasks that require subtle coordinated movement, therefore, testing the intact integrated function of various neuromuscular structures as previously mentioned. Examples frequently used in a clinic setting may include unbuttoning a shirt, picking up a coin, or the drawing of a shape such as a spiral.

Handwriting- Legibility and speed of writing have been used in children and adults as a way of determining fine motor ability in patients.

Nine-hole peg test- This tests the ability of an individual to remove and replace 9 small pegs into 9 small holes. This is the current gold standard test for assessing manual dexterity in multiple sclerosis.
