In summary, by knowing the functions of the fibers of the geniculate ganglion and how they project to the various parts of the head, it is possible to estimate the location of the injury to the facial nerve. For example, a patient that presents with a peripheral hemiface palsy and mentions a weakened taste sensation would probably have a lesion at the level of the ganglion. Another case would be a patient with signs of HZO, this patient that would probably display the characteristic herpetiform rash through the sensory distribution of the facial nerve at the ear.
