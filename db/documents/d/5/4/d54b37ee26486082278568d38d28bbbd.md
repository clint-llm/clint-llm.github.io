**Dorsal Scapular Artery**

The dorsal scapular artery is the predominant blood supply of the levator scapulae muscle. The origin is currently in dispute in the literature. The origin most frequently cited is the subclavian artery, with the second most common being a branch of the thyrocervical trunk.

**Anatomic Variation**

Anatomic variation of the subclavian artery has implications for failed supraclavicular brachial plexus blocks. Supraclavicular brachial plexus blocks are useful for analgesia and anesthesia of the upper limb. Kohli et al. present a case of a variant branch of the subclavian artery visualized on ultrasound. They hypothesized it could be the dorsal scapular artery passing through the brachial plexus nerve bundle.

**Lymphatics**

Generally, the shoulder blade is associated with the axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes. The lymph nodes from the right scapula drain into the right lymphatic duct. The left scapula drains directly into the thoracic duct.
