Monitoring therapeutic levels of IV dantrolene is unnecessary. When treating a patient, the endpoints of therapy are when the symptoms of malignant hyperthermia (hypercarbia, hyperthermia, tachycardia, rigidity, etc.) have subsided. When using the lyophilized form of dantrolene, large volumes of sterile water are administered with the medication. Although mannitol is included with the dantrolene, monitoring fluid status and output is paramount to the ongoing care a resuscitation of these patients.

For those taking the oral capsule for muscle spasticity, liver function tests require monitoring, and dantrolene should be discontinued if signs and symptoms of liver injury appear. These include elevated LFTs, jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, etc. These symptoms typically resolve upon the discontinuation of dantrolene. If dantrolene is to be reinstated, per recommendations, the patient should be inpatient, and the drug initiated in very small doses with gradual increases.
