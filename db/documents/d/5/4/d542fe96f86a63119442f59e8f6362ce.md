Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the passage of abnormally large volumes of urine (diabetes) that is dilute (hypotonic) and devoid of taste from dissolved solutes (i.e., insipid). They belong to a group of inherited or acquired disorders of polyuria and polydipsia. This is associated with insufficient arginine vasopressin (AVP) or antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion or renal response to AVP, resulting in hypotonic polyuria and compensatory/underlying polydipsia.
