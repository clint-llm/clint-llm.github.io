Airway assessment is essential in medical practice, ensuring the safety of patients undergoing surgery, trauma care, or treatment in critical care settings. Several techniques and methods have been proposed and refined over the years, offering clinicians an array of tools for this vital task.

One fundamental approach in airway assessment is the predictive physical examination. Predictors like the Mallampati score, thyromental distance, sternomental distance, and neck mobility have proven helpful in identifying potentially difficult airways.

The continued evolution of technology has ushered in a new era of airway assessment techniques. Ultrasound, for instance, has emerged as a promising tool for assessing the airway. It offers noninvasive, real-time imaging of the airway anatomy, which is particularly useful for predicting difficult intubations.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have found use in airway assessment. ML algorithms can integrate multiple patient variables, offering more accurate predictions than traditional assessment methods.
