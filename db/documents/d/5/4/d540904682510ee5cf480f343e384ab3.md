Treatment and prevention of cellulitis requires an interprofessional approach with the patient, healthcare provider, pharmacist, and wound care nurses. The pharmacist ideally will have a board specialty in infectious disease to assist and work with the clinician on the best antibiotic selection. The majority of patients can have management as outpatients. Patients needing inpatient treatment with parenteral antibiotics, require collaboration with multiple members of the healthcare team: physician or advanced practice provider to correctly diagnosis the severity and type of cellulitis (purulent vs. nonpurulent), nurses to help demarcate the area of erythema and monitor for worsening or improving symptoms, and pharmacist to assist with parenteral dosing and monitoring of potentially renally toxic antibiotics such as vancomycin. The wound care nurse should educate the patient on maintaining good skincare, extremity elevation, and remain ambulatory - to prevent deep vein thrombosis. The pharmacist and nurse should both counsel the patient regarding medication compliance to ensure treatment success.

A collaborative interprofessional team approach is needed for patient education to ensure successful treatment as well as patient education to prevent recurrent infections.
