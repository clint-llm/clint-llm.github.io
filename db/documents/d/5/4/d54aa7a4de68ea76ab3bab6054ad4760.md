Patient positioning in brain CT scan

The patient is a supine position on the CT table, and the tube rotates around the patients. Patients’ head should place in the head holder. To prevent motion artifacts, patients should be as comfortable and immobile as they can. To prevent unnecessary irradiation to the patient’s head and neck, especially to the lens of the eye, head CT performs in an angle parallel to the base of the skull called glabellomeatal. Brain CT starts from this point and moves superiorly. Brain CT is performable with, without, or with and without IV contrast enhancement.

Patient positioning in brain MRI

To perform MRI, initially ask the patient about pacemakers, metallic foreign body, aneurysm clips, implantable devices, etc. Evaluate the patients for any previous allergy to contrast media if gadolinium will be used and explain all the risk and the benefits of possible contrast allergy. Check the patient’s renal function if using gadolinium. Gadolinium is only an option in patients if their GFR is over 30. Request the patient to remove all metal objects, including any jewelry, keys, hearing aid devices, etc. Evaluate the patient for previous claustrophobia and provide a chaperone or sedation for claustrophobic patients. Patients' positioning is supine, the receiver coil placed around the head, and the patient immobilized using cushions. Cushions under the knee are an option for extra patient comfort. Locate the laser beam over the glabella.
