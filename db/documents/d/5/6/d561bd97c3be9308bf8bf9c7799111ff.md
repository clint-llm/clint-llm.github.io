An auricular hematoma is typically diagnosed after a detailed history and physical. Ultrasound can be utilized to evaluate ear swelling and to rule out an auricular abscess. If significant trauma has occurred, there is concern for a foreign body or an abscess or it is determined that it is important to evaluate middle or inner ear structures, CT or MRI can be ordered. CT and MRI should not be used routinely to evaluated auricular hematomas.

If there is evidence of erythema, warmth to the area, diffuse pain on palpation of cartilage, evidence of external auditory canal swelling, or drainage, then the diagnosis of auricular hematoma is less likely. Typically, hearing is not affected by isolated auricular trauma and if the patient has subjective hearing loss, then expanding the differential diagnosis is waranted. In summary, auricular hematomas are generallyÂ a clinical diagnosis.
