Antiviral therapy hastens the resolution of lesions, decreases acute pain and helps to prevent post-herpetic neuralgia especially in elderly patients. Acyclovir 800 mg, five times daily for five days, valacyclovir 1 gm three times daily for five days, and famciclovir 500 mg three times daily for seven days are the antiviral drugs used to treat herpes zoster. Topical antibiotic creams like mupirocin or soframycin help to prevent secondary bacterial infection. Analgesics help to relieve the pain. Occasionally, severe pain may require an opioid medication. Topical lidocaine and nerve blocks may also reduce pain.

Post-herpetic neuralgia commonly occurs in elderly patients, and once the lesions have crusted, they can use topical capsaicin and Emla cream.
