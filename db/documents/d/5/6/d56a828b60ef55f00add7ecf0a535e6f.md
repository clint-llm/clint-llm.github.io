M cells have apical microfolds on electron microscopy (hence their alternate name, "microfold cells"). These apical microfolds are poorly organized villi that have unique adhesion molecules to grab and sample luminal macromolecules. They have a unique intraepithelial invagination (or "pocket") on the basolateral surface can also been seen via electron microscopy. These invaginations allow for macrophages and other immune cells to process the engulfed macromolecules.
