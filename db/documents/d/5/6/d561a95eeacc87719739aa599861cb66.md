Hepatic granulomas may be classified into four main variants, namely, caseating, non-caseating, fibrin-ring, and lipogranulomas. Tuberculous granulomas and other infectious granulomas usually have necrotic centers that appear “cheese-like” and are hence called caseating. Sarcoidosis is classically characterized by noncaseating granulomas. Fibrin-ring variants are epithelioid cells in an encircling fibrin ring with a central vacuole. These fibrin-ring granulomas are seen in infections, may be drug-induced, or in Hodgkin lymphoma. Lipogranulomas are characterized by a central lipid vacuole and are seen in mineral oil ingestion or hepatic steatosis. In PBC, granulomas are present surrounding the damaged bile ducts. Granulomas in Q fever are typically characterized by an eosinophilic fibrinoid ring with a central clear space enclosing a fat vacuole. The presence of abundant eosinophils may suggest a drug-induced reaction. However, they are also seen in parasitic infections as well as Hodgkin’s disease.
