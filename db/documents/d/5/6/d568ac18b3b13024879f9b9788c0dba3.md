Retinal traction detachment (RTD) or tractional retinal detachment (TRD) is defined as the separation of the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) due to the traction caused by proliferative membranes present over the retinal surface or vitreous. The proliferative membranes can result from different etiologies of proliferative retinopathies, the most common being proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), which is a complication of prolonged and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

The detached retina takes a concave shape in contrast to the convex shape of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). In contrast to RRD, which is caused by one or more retinal breaks, RTDs are caused by tractional forces, and there is no retinal break in the area of RTD.
