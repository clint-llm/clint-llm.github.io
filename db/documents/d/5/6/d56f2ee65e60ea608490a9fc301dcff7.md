Interprofessional communication is critical between a technologist, the radiologist, and the ordering provider in the following scenarios:

- An ordering provider requests for non-standard projections and views

- Non-standard views were provided due to technical factors related to the patient (patient movement, non-compliance, or altered anatomy)

- Technical factors outside the control of the technologist, such as in the setting of trauma where expedited images are required to evaluate for life-threatening diagnoses (such as pneumothorax)

- Technical factors outside the control of the technologist relating to the x-ray machine (i.e., an apparatus/machine-related image degradation)

- A radiologist requires additional views to evaluate further a pathology that is limited in evaluation with standard views.

- Appropriate clinical history provided to the radiology department is essential to ensure the correct examination is performed with the appropriate views and aides the radiologist to focus examination to pertinent findings and assign the appropriate differential diagnosis to those findings. For example, providing the radiologist with chronicity and location of symptoms, any significant medical history such as recent trauma or surgical procedures, and the presence of any chronic illnesses to include malignancy will result in a more useful and accurate radiology report. This does not mean that the provided history needs to be a verbose summary of the patient's entire medical history. An example of an appropriate, complete radiology request could be something like "55-year-old male with a 6-week history of atraumatic shoulder pain and history of multiple myeloma" or "25-year-old male with acute penetrating injury to the ball of the foot with concern for a retained foreign body".

- Documented communication and understanding of critical results from the radiologist to the ordering provider in cases of life-threatening conditions is a vital part of the patient's imaging evaluation. Examples would include pulmonary embolism, acute stroke, or pneumothorax. Equally important is the communication of urgent results such as a new diagnosis of malignancy, ectopic pregnancy, ovarian or testicular torsion, which require referral to subspecialists for timely patient treatments.

The difficulty of communication between non-medical radiology staff and other healthcare team members is a known limitation in delivering healthcare, especially when relating to oral and written inter-professional communication.
