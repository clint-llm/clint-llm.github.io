In general, distal ulna fractures have good prognoses when appropriately managed. Many contributing factors play a role, and the best outcomes are achieved when treatment is individualized to meet patient needs. Xiao et al. in 2021 reported the best postoperative range of motion results with simple cast immobilization. Grip strength had the best prognosis when K-wire stabilization of the distal ulna fracture was performed. However, there were no differences in patient satisfaction or long-term function.

**Ulnar Styloid Fractures**

Ulnar styloid fractures generally have good outcomes without surgical intervention. Kim et al., 2010 demonstrated successful nonoperative management of ulnar styloid base fractures, including those with displacement more significant than 2 mm.

**Non-styloid Distal Ulnar Fractures**

Non-styloid distal ulnar fractures more often require operative intervention to obtain satisfactory outcomes compared to styloid fractures.
