It is important to discuss expected outcomes after excisional biopsies with the patient. Educate the patient about the expectant scar, wound care instructions, potential complications with healing or infection, and provide information for how the patient should seek help should complications arise. Additionally, the practitioner should not neglect to inform the patient on how long to expect to wait before receiving the biopsy result and arrange proper follow up for the patient depending on the biopsy findings.

Careful coordination is required between all members of the healthcare team to optimize patient outcomes and provide optimal patient care. Coordination between the practitioner who performed the biopsy, the pathologist who is examining the obtained specimen, and all coordinating medical staff is paramount. Any concerning findings should be communicated in the medical record and directly if appropriate between practitioners. [Level V]
