The successful septal reduction is defined as a >50% reduction in LVOT peak gradient. Continuous improvement in gradient is expected along with cardiac remodeling over a period of few years. ASA avoids the anxiety related to the surgery, reduces the recovery time and residual discomfort associated with surgery.  However, between 5 to 15% of patients may fail ASA therapy. Repeat ASA can be performed in patients with suitable anatomy and inadequate reduction of LVOT gradient. The meta-analysis published by Agrawal et al. showed ASA and SM had similar mortality rates and functional capacity post-intervention.  However, an increased rate of conduction abnormalities and higher LVOT gradient requiring reintervention was noted in the ASA group.
