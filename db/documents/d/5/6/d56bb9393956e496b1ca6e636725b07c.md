The hip joint is formed predominantly from mesoderm and begins to come into existence between weeks 4 to 6 gestational age. During week 7, cartilage precursor cells start to form the bony components of the hip joint: the acetabulum and the head of the femur. Hip joint development is mostly complete by the eleventh week of gestation.
