Tibia fractures are common injuries. The subcutaneous nature of the tibia makes it more prone to open injury. The musculature about the lower leg divides into four compartments separated by fascial tissue. Radiographs are essential in the initial evaluation of the fractures.  In the case of injury or fracture of the lower extremity, the fascial tissue may have to be released by fasciotomies to prevent the sequelae of compartment syndrome.  Treatment methods can be non-operative for minimally displaced fractures although operative fixation for displaced and open fractures is preferred.
