One of the most common surgical procedures related to the trigeminal nerve is a surgical intervention for trigeminal neuralgia. The types of surgical interventions for trigeminal neuralgia are divided into two categories: non-destructive and destructive. The goal of non-destructive surgery is to alleviate nerve compression by removing any structure that may be impinging on the nerve, typically the superior cerebellar artery, via a microvascular decompression. Destructive procedures include percutaneous rhizotomy and stereotactic radiosurgery toÂ disrupt the trigeminal nerve completely so that the nerve no longer transmits pain. A destructive procedure results in the irreversible loss of sensation of the affected side of the face within the ablated nerve distribution.
