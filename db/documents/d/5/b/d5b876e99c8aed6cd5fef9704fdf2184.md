The anatomic resection of an entire lobe of a lung is called a lobectomy. It is usually done with the help of the video scope and with less than an 8 cm incision. Although done for several benign and malignant pulmonary conditions, lung cancer remains the most common indication. This activity reviews indications, surgical anatomy, surgical technique, and perioperative management of patients undergoing lobectomy by the healthcare team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the thoracic surgical anatomy. 
- Review the equipment, personnel, preparation, and techniques of lobectomy.
- Summarize the complications of the lobectomy procedure. 
- Explain the importance of interprofessional management when performing a lobectomy.
