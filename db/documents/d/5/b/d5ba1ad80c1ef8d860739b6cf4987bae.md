At the time of diagnostic DM onset in patients, the literature reports about 10% to 20% of patients being concomitantly diagnosed with PN. However, studies analyzing patients with DM at an increasing duration of stages of the disease in terms of chronicity report increasing prevalence rates for the DM and PN association. After five years, 26% have peripheral neuropathy, and 41% of patients with diabetes have neuropathy at ten years.Â The literature reports that 50% to 66% of patients with DM will eventually develop PN during their lifetime.

Clinically, about half of patients with diabetic PN can present with asymmetric sensory changes.
