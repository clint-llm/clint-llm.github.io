The mutation of the RAS/MAPK pathway involved Noonan syndrome classifies NS as RASopathy. RASopathies are genetic syndromes that involve germline mutations in the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. These syndromes include cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC), Costello syndrome, Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and LEOPARD syndrome. The Ras/MAPK pathway is needed for cell division, proliferation, differentiation, and migration. It is vital for healthy development.

The most common mutation in Noonan syndrome occurs in the PTPN11 gene. A smaller portion of mutations occurs in SOS1, RAF1, RIT1. Mutations in PTPN11 can be inherited, autosomal dominant, or occur de novo through sporadic mutation. The mutations involved in Noonan syndrome are considered a gain of function mutation, causing inappropriate prolongation of the RAS/MAPK signaling. The prolongation of the RAS/MAPK pathway gives way to the pleomorphic characteristics found in Noonan syndrome.
