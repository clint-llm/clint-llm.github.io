The patient should be placed in either the supine or lateral position. Typically, the procedure site is selected within the region of the thorax spanning from the 4 toÂ 7 intercostal space. The chosen insertion site needs to be immediately cephalad of the rib to avoid direct trauma to the neurovascular bundle, which is located inferior to each rib.

If placed in the lateral position, the patient should be lying with the operative site in the dependent position (down). In this position, the posterior axillary line or a site 8 to 10 cm lateral from midline is identified as the insertion site.

If the procedure is to be performed on the patient in the supine position, the anterior or mid-axillary line is used to identify the needle insertion site. The operative area is cleaned with antiseptic, and a sterile drape or towels are placed to prevent contamination.
