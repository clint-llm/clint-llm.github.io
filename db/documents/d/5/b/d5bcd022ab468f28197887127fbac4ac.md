Patient refusal and inability to co-operate and obey commands are absolute contra-indications for awake craniotomy. Patient cooperation is necessary to evaluate their language, memory, and motor skills.

Relative contra-indications of awake craniotomy include obese patients, patients with a history of obstructive sleep apnea, difficult airways, and patients with chronic cough. Resection resulting in large blood loss is also not done under an awake craniotomy.
