Alveoli are classically described as a cluster of grapes, with each alveolus being a separate entity from the ones surrounding it. However, recent histologic research revealed that the actual structure is quite different and much more complicated.Â Numerous connections exist between alveoli, resulting in a complex system of airflow within the distal airways. Their shape is polygonal with flat sides rather than spherical, and each alveolus shares a common wall with its neighbors. They more likely resemble foam or froth than balloons.
