The superficial and deep volar arterial arches are both accompanied by a pair of venae comitantes which are called the superficial and deep palmar venous arches. These veins drain deoxygenated blood from the hand and fingers corresponding to the branches of the arterial arch. The common palmar digital veins receive blood from the proper palmar digital veins and drain into the superficial palmar venous arch. These veins ultimately drain to the radial vein. The palmar metacarpal veins, which receives blood from the metacarpal region of the palm, drains into the deep palmar venous arch. Some branches of the palmar metacarpal veins also drain into the dorsal metacarpal veins and end in the radial veins as well as the superficial veins on the dorsum of the wrist.

Similarly, lymphatic drainage of the hand divides into superficial and deep lymphatic vessels. The superficial lymphatic vessels lie near the major superficial veins, while the deep lymphatic vessels follow major deep veins.
