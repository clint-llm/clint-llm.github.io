Iron overload occurs when there are excess stores of iron in the body. Primary iron overload is often inherited. Secondary iron overload usually arises from causes such as transfusion, hemolysis, or excessive parenteral and/or dietary consumption of iron. Excess iron is deposited into organs throughout the body, which can lead to damage to the organs. Organs that commonly become damaged due to iron deposition are the liver, heart, and endocrine glands. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of iron overload and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the recommended management of iron overload.
- Outline the typical presentation for a patient with iron overload.
- Review the pathophysiology of iron overload.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with iron overload.
