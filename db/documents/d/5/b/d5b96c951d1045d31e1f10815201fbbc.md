**Combination Therapy**

Tang et al. studied a group of women with overactive bladder treated with sacral neuromodulation and tolterodine (an M2 and M3 antimuscarinic agent). After three months, the combination therapy was significantly superior to treatment by tolterodine alone for daily average single voided volume, a daily maximum single volume of urination, first desire to void, and maximum cystometric capacity (the volume that the bladder musculature can tolerate before the patient experiences a strong, uncontrollable desire to urinate).

**Alternate Treatment: Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS/PTNM)**

Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is another form of neuromodulation targeting the tibial nerve. It is performed by placing a needle connected to a low voltage stimulator cephalad to the medial malleolus in the foot to gently stimulate the tibial nerve. A portion of the electrical stimulation reaches the sacral nerves, which control bladder function. Patients often describe the treatment as a "tingling" or "pulsing" of the foot or ankle and are typically painless. Treatment sessions last for 30 minutes weekly. While symptomatic improvement can begin as early as the second session, many patients require multiple treatments before they experience a benefit. This requires that the patient commit to complete the full, initial twelve-weekly treatment regimen, at which point the clinical results are evaluated. Subsequent treatments may be needed intermittently to sustain the symptomatic benefit.

PTNS can significantly improve urinary frequency, urgency, urge incontinence, and nocturia, with studies showing a benefit in 60% to 80% of the patients who try it.

**Alternate Treatment: Chemical Denervation of the Detrusor Using the Onabotulinum A Toxin**

The FDA has approved botulinum toxin for therapeutic use.

A cost-effectiveness comparison of sacral neuromodulation compared to onabotulinum A toxin in managing refractory overactive bladder problems, was recently published. It looks across multiple healthcare systems in five different countries over five and ten-year periods. Unfortunately, many of the available studies are sponsored by industry, which might impact the results. While the overall costs are roughly similar, botulinum toxin appeared to be more cost-effective in the short term, while the longer-term studies tended to favor sacral neuromodulation.

**Pelvic Pain**

Several studies suggest symptom improvement of pelvic pain, such as interstitial cystitis with SNM. In a study by Siegel et al., it was found that SNM reduced pain in 9 out of 10 patients with interstitial cystitis at 19 months of follow-up. The average pain on a scale of 0 to 10 was reduced from 9.7 at baseline to 4.4 at the end of the study, with a decreasing trend in hours of pain.

While the precise mechanisms of action of sacral neuromodulation for pelvic pain still need to be elucidated, most research supports the theory of afferent signaling modulation to achieve symptomatic improvement. There seem to be several distinct mechanisms for symptom relief, and therapy likely functions differently for each clinical indication.

**Future Use**

Some spinal cord injured patients appear to have benefitted from the early use of sacral neuromodulation in preventing bladder functional deterioration. Detrusor overactivity and incontinence were prevented while bowel function, erectile activity, and a normal bladder capacity were maintained.

Despite these encouraging results, the early use of sacral neuromodulation to change the course of a spinal cord injury and help preserve bladder function is still considered investigational.

**Summary**

Ultimately, sacral neuromodulation provides a reasonable, safe, efficacious, and reversible alternative to other therapies for refractory overactive bladder, nonobstructive urinary retention, and fecal incontinence.
