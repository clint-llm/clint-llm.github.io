The gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone belongs to the family of RFamide related peptides (RFRPs). All RFRPs carry an LPXRF-amide (X represents L or Q) motif at their C termini.

- Inhibiting gonadotropin synthesis and release

- Decreasing the activity of GnRH neurons (to inhibit their effects on gonadotropes)

- Inhibiting reproductive behaviors by its actions on GnRH-II neurons

- Acting in an autocrine/paracrine manner in the gonads.
