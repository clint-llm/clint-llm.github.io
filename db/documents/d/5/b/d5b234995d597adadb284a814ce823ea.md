**NPPV Circuit Components**

- NIV device: While CPAP is delivered using a continuous flow, BPAP is typically produced using two modes: Spontaneous or spontaneous/timed (S/T). Spontaneous mode is where the machine augments the patient's spontaneous breaths, whereas S/T mode includes a backup rate slightly below the patient's respiratory rate. Newer versions of NPPV devices were developed to add more monitoring features and ventilatory assistance, such as averaged volume-assured pressure support (AVAPS). The AVAPS device delivers a constant tidal pressure-volume to patients and uses a specific algorithm that automatically calculates the pressure changes needed to maintain an optimal tidal volume. In addition, AVAPS can be combined with auto–expiratory positive airway pressure (AVAPS-AE) to maintain a patient's upper airway patency.
