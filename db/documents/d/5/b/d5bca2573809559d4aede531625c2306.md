The calcaneus is surrounded by and receives its blood supply from a superficial network of arteries called the calcaneal anastomosis, which is formed by branches of the posterior tibial and fibular arteries. Much of the lymphatic flow follows the vasculature and flows up the leg through the popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes before passing through the thoracic duct.
