Besides the potential complications mentioned before about the sampling procedure, other legal, medical, psychological, and ethical issues are associated with molecular testing.

Genetic counseling is a service that involves a multidisciplinary team headed by the genetic counselor and several other professionals. As the first step, clinical identification of a suspected disease is necessary to narrow and direct molecular testing. Information about the potential disease, the procedure of the molecular testing, and its potential results require explanation to the patient. Legal issues such as informed consent, especially in children that cannot give it, must be covered.

Finally, NGS technologies are applied to genetic counseling. The results' complexity is higher than those obtained with traditional genetic tests. Considerable information is generated and available for sharing, and ethical issues are implied in divulging it. All these aspects must be considered, informed, and explained to every patient subjected to genetic testing.
