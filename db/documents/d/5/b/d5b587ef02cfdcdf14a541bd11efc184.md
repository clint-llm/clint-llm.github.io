Though many of the symptoms of MAOI toxicity are nonspecific, much of the suspicion for MAOI toxicity will come from the patient history. A complete list of medications, supplements, both current and recently discontinued, should be obtained as there can be significant latency between ingestions and development of symptomatology. Signs of MAOI toxicity are non-specific as well. Mild signs include agitation, diaphoresis, tachycardia and mild temperature elevation. Signs of moderate disease include altered mental status, tachypnea, vomiting, dysrhythmias, hyperthermia, and hypertension. Severe signs include severe hyperthermia, seizures, central nervous system (CNS) depression, coma, cardiorespiratory depression, muscle rigidity and myoclonus. Though similar to other hyperthermic toxidromes, there are a few ways in which MAOI toxicity can be distinguished. MAOI toxicity can present with diaphoresis whereas an anticholinergic syndrome should have dry skin. Additionally, MAOI toxicity is much more likely to present with generalized or ocular clonus than neuroleptic malignant syndrome. A "ping-pong" gaze has also been described in MAOI toxicity
