Trisomy 13 results from the nondisjunction of homologous chromosomes during gametogenesis, characterized by three copies of chromosome 13 in somatic and germ cell lines.

A less phenotypically challenging trisomy can occur in a translocation. These translocations originate from two acrocentric breaks in the juxtacentromeric regions (usually chromosomes 13 and 14). The phenotypic expression will depend on the balance of the translocation. Balanced Robertsonian translocations will be less severe than those with an altered genetic quantity, as seen in unbalanced translocations.
