Higher than recommended dosing, for example, based on total body weight, may cause prolonged paralysis beyond the time required for surgery; this may manifest with generalized weakness, decreased respiratory reserve, and even apnea.

Reversal of the NMBD can be done with anticholinesterase medications such as neostigmine or edrophonium. These anticholinesterase medications must be accompanied by an anticholinergic drug such as glycopyrrolate or atropine to block the ACH activity at the muscarinic receptors. Rocuronium and vecuronium specifically can be reversed with sugammadex, a selective relaxant binding agent (SRBA), offering a more rapid onset of reversal than neostigmine and without the muscarinic side effects. However, sugammadex may interfere with the efficacy of oral contraceptives, and an alternative form of contraception is recommended for the week following administration.
