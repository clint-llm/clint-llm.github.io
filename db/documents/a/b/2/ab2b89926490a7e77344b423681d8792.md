The exact incidence and prevalence of RN are not known. It is primarily a disorder of childhood or early adulthood and is more common in females than males. VUR may be a familial disorder affecting 20% of infants who have a parent with a family history of VUR, compared with a 1% to 2% frequency of VUR in the general population.

The incidence of ESRD from RN is unknown in the worldwide adult population. About 12% of patients in Europe requiring treatment for ESRD may have RN. In a study of 127 adults (mean age of 41 years) with a diagnosis of VUR in childhood, 35% had unilateral renal scarring, 24% had bilateral renal scarring, 24% had albuminuria, and 11% had hypertension. In the patients with bilateral renal scars, 83% had reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

In pregnant females with VUR, approximately 40% of the offspring will have the condition, and testing of offspring is highly recommended.
