NMBA has several adverse effects associated with its use.

**Depolarizing NMBA**

Succinylcholine administration correlates to a significant rise in serum potassium. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid the use of succinylcholine in patients with chronic renal disease, burn patients, patients with crush injuries, and rhabdomyolysis. Elevated potassium levels can lead to fatal arrhythmias.

Succinylcholine is also associated with bradycardia especially in the pediatric population. The stimulation of the nicotinic receptor activates a muscarinic receptor that produces bradycardia. The effect can be blunted by administering atropine or glycopyrrolate.

The use of succinylcholine carries associations with increased intracranial pressure and intraocular pressure. The administration of adequate age-appropriate sedation can minimize this unwanted side effect.

Another side effect of succinylcholine is malignant hyperthermia; this is a pharmacogenetic disorder that occurs with the use of volatile inhalation anesthetic agents and succinylcholine. Clinically it can manifest with hypercarbia, hyperventilation hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, and metabolic acidosis. The condition has correlated with the mutation in the RYR1 and CACNA1S genes.

Other side effects of succinylcholine include jaw rigidity, hypersalivation, and hypersensitive reaction

**Non-depolarizing NMBA**

Benzylisoquinolinium, mivacurium, atracurium, cisatracurium, and doxacurium can cause histamine release when administered, which can cause bronchospasm, hypotension, and tachycardia from peripheral vasodilation.

Laudanosine which is a metabolite of atracurium and is -atracurium can accumulate in the central nervous system (CNS) causing a seizure.

**Amino Steroids**

Vecuronium, and rocuronium. Prolonged infusion of amino steroids with concurrent administration of steroids can lead to profound muscular weakness which is otherwise known as critical illness polyneuropathy.

Certain conditions can prolong the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents

- Hypothermia

- Metabolic derangements

- Hypercalcemia

- Hypermagnesemia

- Hypokalemia

- Hypothermia

- Respiratory acidosis

- Metabolic alkalosis
