Nitrous oxide is an odorless, colorless, non-flammable gas. While nitrous oxide is not flammable, it will support combustion to the same extent as oxygen. It leads to a state of euphoria, explaining its nickname, ‘laughing gas.’ Nitrous oxide is the least potent inhalational anesthetic. Compared to other anesthetic agents, nitrous oxide causes minimal effects on respiration and hemodynamics. It cannot be a sole anesthetic agent and is often combined with a more potent and volatile anesthetic. The combination of analgesic and anesthetic effects makes nitrous oxide a valuable adjunct. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of nitrous oxide, so providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes in anesthesia and other conditions where nitrous oxide has therapeutic benefits.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the indications for using nitrous oxide.
- Describe the mechanism of action of nitrous oxide.
- Identify the contraindications and adverse events associated with nitrous oxide.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who can benefit from the administration of nitrous oxide.
