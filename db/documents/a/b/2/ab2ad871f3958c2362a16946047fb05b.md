Approach to anemia includes identification of the type of anemia:

1. Complete blood count (CBC) including differential

2. Calculate the corrected reticulocyte count = percent reticulocytes x (patient's HCT/normal HCT)

For normal HCT, use 45% in men and 40% in women

If result > 2, this suggests hemolysis or acute blood loss, while results < 2 suggests hypoproliferation.

3. After calculating the reticulocyte count, check the MCV.

- MCV (<80 fl) 

- Iron deficiency- decreased serum iron, percent saturation of iron, with increased total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin levels, and soluble transferrin receptor 
- Lead poisoning- basophilic stippling on the peripheral blood smear, ringed sideroblasts in bone marrow, elevated lead levels 
- AOCD- may be normocytic
- Thalassemia- RBC count may be normal/high, low MCV, target cells, and basophilic stippling are on peripheral smear. Alpha thalassemia is differentiated from beta-thalassemia by a normal Hgb electrophoresis in alpha thalassemia.  Elevated Hgb A2/HgbF is seen in the beta-thalassemia trait.
- Sideroblastic anemia- elevated serum iron and transferrin with ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow

- MCV (90-100fl)

- Renal failure: BUN/Creatinine 
- Aplastic anemia- ask for drug exposure, check for infections (EBV, hepatitis, CMV, HIV), test for hematologic malignancies and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)
- Myelofibrosis/myelophthisis- check bone marrow biopsy 
- Multiple myeloma- serum and urine electrophoresis 
- Pure red cell aplasia- test for Parvovirus B19, exclude thymoma

- MCV (>100 fl)

- B12/folate levels- B12 and folate deficiency can be differentiated by an elevated methylmalonic and homocysteine level in B12 deficiency and only an elevated homocysteine level in folate deficiency. Methylmalonic levels are relatively normal.  
- MDS- hyposegmented PMNs on peripheral smear, bone marrow biopsy 
- Hypothyroidism- TSH, free T4
- Liver disease- check liver function 
- Alcohol- assess alcohol intake 
- Drugs

Steps to evaluate for hemolytic anemia

1) Confirm the presence of hemolysis- elevated LDH, corrected reticulocyte count >2%, elevated indirect bilirubin and decreased/low haptoglobin

2) Determine extra vs. intravascular hemolysis-

- Extravascular

- Spherocytes present
- Urine hemosiderin negative
- Urine hemoglobin negative

- Intravascular

- Urine hemosiderin elevated
- Urine hemoglobin elevated

3) Examine the peripheral blood smear

- Spherocytes: immune hemolytic anemia (Direct antiglobulin test DAT+) vs. hereditary spherocytosis (DAT-)

- Bite cells: G6PD deficiency

- Target cells: hemoglobinopathy or liver disease

- Schistocytes: TTP/HUS, DIC, prosthetic valve, malignant HTN

- Acanthocytes: liver disease

- Parasitic inclusions: malaria, babesiosis, bartonellosis

4) If spherocytes +, check if DAT is +

- DAT(+): Immune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)

- DAT (-): Hereditary spherocytosis

Other investigations that might be warranted include esophagogastroduodenoscopy for the determination of an upper GI bleed, colonoscopy for the determination of a lower GI bleed, and imaging studies if malignancy, or internal hemorrhage is suspected. If a menstruating woman has heavy vaginal bleeding, evaluate the presence of fibroids with a pelvic ultrasound.
