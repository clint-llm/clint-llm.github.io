Prognosis of cataract depends upon multiple factors such as:

- The degree of visual impairment

- Type of cataract

- Timing of intervention

- Mode of intervention

- Quality of life

- UnilateralÂ or bilateral involvement of the eye

- Presence of another systemic disease

In most cases, surgery restores vision very effectively. The presence of another systemic disease, time of intervention, and mode of surgery can be instrumental in determining the visual outcome. Recent studies reveal that in most of the cases, the prognosis is excellent after surgery almost 70 to 80%. Most patients show excellent results after surgery if they strictly follow postoperative instructions and medication regimens advised by their ophthalmologist.
