At present clinicians do not have a consensus on the definition of ACLF. Also, we do not have a satisfactory understanding of the pathophysiology, use of a prognostic scoring system, or universal guidelines on the management of ACLF. Subsequent studies to better understand ACLF are vital. In the future, we should be able to accurately determine appropriate interventions and management strategies to help clinicians ascertain the best approach to divert resources based on cost-effective and evidence-based medicine.
