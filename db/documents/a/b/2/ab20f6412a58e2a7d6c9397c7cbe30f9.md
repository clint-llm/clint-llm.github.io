Inspiratory muscle training exercises have few complications.  Exercises can be modified through duration and intensity depending on the frailty of the patient. The focus should be on the quality of the slow deep breath with the goal of achieving at least 500 ccs of inspiratory volume for each breath. The patient should be educated on the after-effects that can be caused by deep breathing, such as coughing.
