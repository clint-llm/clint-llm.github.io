The levator palpebrae superioris typically has one muscle belly. However, bipartite variances occur, and occasionally a bipartite muscle belly may be absent, resulting in an off-center unipartite levator palpebrae superioris. Also, accessory muscle slips may form. One accessory muscle slip variation is known as the "levator-trochlear muscle." Accessory muscle slips often receive their innervation from the oculomotor nerve.

Regarding lymphatic drainage, occasionally, lymph would drain into an accessory or secondary preauricular/parotid lymph node or bypass this node and traverse directly to the deep cervical node.
