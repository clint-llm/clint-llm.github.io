KCN has been traditionally classified as a non-inflammatory disease. With the exception of the significant loss of vision, other classic signs of inflammation (such as heat, redness, swelling, pain) are not usually present.

Clinical findings that are associated with KCN are, by order of importance, the asymmetrical thinning of the corneal stroma and the highly irregular corneal topography, which is often (wrongly) reported as steep astigmatism. Other clinical findings that can be observed biomicroscopically include the Fleischer iron rings, Munson sign, Rizzuti sign,Â and/or Vogt striae.
