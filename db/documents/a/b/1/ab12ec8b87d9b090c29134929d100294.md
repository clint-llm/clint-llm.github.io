Evaluation of the liver starts with clinical assessment and laboratory workup. Radiological evaluation in the form of abdominal ultrasound accompanied by hepatic Doppler could give the physician a complete picture of the patient's liver condition with a non-invasive procedure. Doppler can detect early hepatic focal lesions and be part of the liver ultrasound screening process in high-risk individuals or post-operative hepatic procedures such as TIPS and liver transplantation.

Hepatic Doppler also can detect portal hypertension and guide further management to include prophylactic band ligation or early medical therapy before the condition deteriorates.

Although sonographers and radiologists mainly conduct hepatic Doppler exams, it offers a real-time evaluation of the liver. Doppler can also be an essential part of the hepatic assessment by gastroenterologists and surgeons. As part of their training and practice, such subspecialists are familiar with abdominal ultrasound and hepatic Doppler.
