The etiology of Bertolotti syndrome remains equivocal. There have been numerous reported instances of family members all suffering from lumbosacral transitional vertebrae, suggesting a possible underlying genetic component. The formation of an LSTV is thought to be associated, in part, with mutations in the HOX10/HOX11 genes. HOX genes, also known as homeobox genes, are responsible for the segmentation of the vertebral column into individual levels.

Additionally, the formation of the lumbosacral junction is influenced by biomechanical factors such as how an individual's body weight is transmitted across the SI joints. At this time, Bertolotti syndrome is considered to have a multifactorial etiology that requires further investigation.
