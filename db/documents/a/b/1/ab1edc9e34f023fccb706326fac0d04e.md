The Edinger-Westphal (EW) nucleus, which is part of the oculomotor nuclear complex (ONC), was first described in the literature in the 17th century.****– and, in fact, it subdivides into the EW preganglionic (EWpg) population and the EW nucleus centrally projecting (EWcp) population. However, the accepted nomenclature for these two groups varies.

The EWpg is what is thought of as the classic ONC—sending parasympathetic nerve fibers toward the eye. It is located in the midbrain immediately dorsal to the oculomotor nucleus near the level of the superior colliculus, which is why it is often included in the overarching term oculomotor complex.
