Rotator cuff tendonitis is a clinical entity consisting of a wide range of clinical symptoms ranging in severity from mild shoulder impingement and can advance in the long-term setting to progressive partial-thickness cuff tears (PTTs) and/or full-thickness cuff tears (FTTs). Evaluation and treatment are best with an interprofessional team. Primary care providers, radiologists, and physical therapists are often involved. Consultation with sports medicine providers, orthopedists, and physiatrists may be needed. Orthopedic nurses provide education, monitor response, and document findings for the team.

When clinicians are working up acute or chronic shoulder pain, it is imperative to correlate the clinical examination with radiographic imaging, MRI, and response to nonoperative treatment modalities. The latter consists of physical therapy, NSAIDs, rest/activity modification, and injections. Surgical management is considered after impingement symptoms fail to resolve or worsen after all other management modalities are exhausted. Referral to an orthopedic surgeon should be considered, especially with long-standing persistent symptoms. After surgery, enrollment in a physical therapy program to regain joint mobility and muscle strength are highly recommended. With proper treatment, the outcomes for most patients are good.
