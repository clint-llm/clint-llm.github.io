Patients should receive treatment according to their clinical manifestations and diagnoses. For patients with infectious endocarditis, proper antibiotic treatment for native (NVE) or prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is the key to reducing mortality and morbidity. Management for neurological sequelae in endocarditis varies. Here, we discuss treatment respectively as below,

- **Ischemic stroke:**Currently, large trials of management for ischemic stroke in endocarditis are lacking. Initiating early antibiotic treatment not only adequately control infection but also leads to less embolism and mortality rate. European Society of Cardiology recommended that warfarin replaced by heparin in PVE and cardiac surgery within 72 hours, if not contraindicated, reduce the rate of embolism

- **Intracranial hemorrhage:**Intracranial hemorrhages (ICH) in endocarditis, including NBTE and infectious endocarditis, can be categorized into three mechanisms: (1) hemorrhage after ischaemic stroke (2) ruptured mycotic aneurysm, or (3) undetermined etiology. Once ICH occurs, all anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents should be discontinued for a minimum of two weeks; patients should also have treatment per guideline, i.e., blood pressure control, intracranial pressure management, the reversal of anticoagulation, deep venous thrombus prevention, prevention of aspiration pneumonia, seizure management, etc. Surgery in patients with ICH in endocarditis depends on the site of lesion and the clinical course.

- **CNS infection (Meningitis, Brain abscess):**Brain abscess occurs mostly in critically-ill patients. Pneumococci account for 70% of bacterial meningitis in patients with infective endocarditis even though pneumococci is the causative pathogen in less than two percent of infectious endocarditis. Early effective antibiotic therapy in infectious endocarditis reduces CNS infection. Adequate antibiotic coverage and adjunctive intravenous glucocorticoids in some instances may reduce the following neurological complications from CNS infection.

The role of cardiac surgery at an early stage to prevent embolism remains controversial and indications for early surgery to prevent embolism differ among studies. Overall, management for endocarditis patients with neurological sequelae requires a multidisciplinary team, including infectious disease, cardiology, neurology, neurology surgery, and cardiac surgery specialists to implement optimal treatment for patients.
