Consent is taken from the patient, or parent/guardian in case of minors, after explaining the nature of the procedure and the possible complications of surgery.

**Preoperative Evaluation**

A detailed history, including ocular and systemic complaints and history of any previous treatment, is taken. If ectopia lentis is suspected due to any heritable disease such as Marfan syndrome or homocystinuria, a thorough systemic workup is done, and a necessary interprofessional opinion is warranted. A complete ophthalmological examination is performed, including uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination to assess the anterior segment, tonometry, keratometry, posterior segment evaluation, and ultrasound B scan if the posterior segment is not visible. The IOL power is calculated using appropriate formulas.

**Anesthesia**

Surgery is done under peribulbar block if the patient is cooperative or under general anesthesia if the patient is not cooperative or has other systemic issues.
