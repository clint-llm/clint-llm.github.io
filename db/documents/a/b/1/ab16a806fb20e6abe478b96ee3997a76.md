Diagnosing polypharmacy and optimizing medication regimens is a critical element in the comprehensive care of elderly patients. This will help to reduce preventable ADEs like falls, drug-drug interactions, impaired cognition, hip fractures, rate of hospitalizations, and overall health care costs. It will improve the patient's overall health status, quality of life, and satisfaction of the patient and caregiver. However, the potential benefits of medical therapies to treat the disease, cure it, slow the progression, and reduce the symptoms should not be undermined.

If used appropriately, medical therapies can improve quality of life, prevent recurrent hospital admissions, and decrease morbidity. Therefore, it is a significant challenge for prescribers to find the optimal benefit and risk from these therapies. Building strategies to reduce polypharmacy, developing easy tools, identifying barriers, and educating the health care practitioners will possibly achieve success in mitigating polypharmacy.
