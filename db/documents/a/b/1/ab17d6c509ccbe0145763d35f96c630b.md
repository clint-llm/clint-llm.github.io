The disease presentation can range from mild influenza-like illness to moderate and finally into a debilitating disease process. Patients who develop symptoms do so generally after an incubation period of seven days. The hallmark of this disease process is fever which has a somewhat comparable fever pattern to malaria. Fever can present in four common ways, with the episodic form being the most common. These include an isolated febrile episode to febrile episodes lasting four to five days, three to five recurrent febrile episodes lasting five days with asymptomatic periods in between, and persistent febrile episodes for two to six weeks.

The febrile period recurring every five days is where the term "quintan fever" is derived, including the name of the bacteria causing the disease, B. quintana. Other presenting symptoms include non-specific influenza-like symptoms, which include malaise, fever, headache, dizziness, bone pain (most commonly affecting shins), nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.

Common physical examination findings include a febrile patient with temperatures generally greater than 38.4 degrees Celsius (101.1 Fahrenheit), palpable splenomegaly, and a maculopapular rash noted mainly in the truncal area.
