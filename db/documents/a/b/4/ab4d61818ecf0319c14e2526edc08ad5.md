Catecholamine synthesis within the adrenal medulla is controlled by the serum concentration of the amino acid tyrosine. Tyrosine undergoes hydroxylation via tyrosine hydroxylase to form DOPA, which then undergoes decarboxylation to dopamine. Dopamine may be secreted into the bloodstream or undergo further hydroxylation to norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Norepinephrine can be secreted into the bloodstreamÂ or further modified by a methyltransferase to epinephrine (adrenaline) and then secreted. Glucocorticoids notably upregulate methyltransferase activity to increase epinephrine production. Degradation of catecholamines to their metabolites occurs either by monoamine oxidase (MAO) located in the outer mitochondrial membrane of the cell and/or by catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) found within the cytosol of the cell. MAO and COMT catabolize norepinephrine and epinephrine to vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), and dopamine to homovanillic acid (HVA). VMA and HVA are excreted in urine.
