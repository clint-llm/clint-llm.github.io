Fahr disease is reported to commonly affect people in their 40s and 50s. Patients are usually in good health in their youth and tend to develop this progressive neurodegenerative disease later in adulthood. The prevalence of this disease is more or less unknown due to insufficient investigations of first-degree relatives of the patients.
