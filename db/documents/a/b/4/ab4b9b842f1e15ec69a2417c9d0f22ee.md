Braxton hicks contractions are fairly common and it is important for the emergency department physician labor & delivery nurse and nurse practitioner to be aware that this is not true labor. If there is any doubt, the obstetrician should be consulted. However, at the same time, the onus is on the healthcare workers to rule out true labor. Other organic disorders like appendicitis, urinary tract infection or cholecystitis must also be ruled out. With the right education, patients with braxtonÂ hicks contraction will not needlessly rush to the ED every time they sense a contraction.
