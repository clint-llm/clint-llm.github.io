Phenytoin is available in oral and parenteral formulations. Intramuscular administration is not recommended due to its erratic absorption and local reaction. The drug is slowly administered intravenously directly into a large central or peripheral vein through an IV catheter less than 20 gauge, not exceeding a rate of 50 mg/minute. It requires dilution with sodium chloride. Crystals will form when diluted with dextrose solution.

Due to its poor solubility, parenteral phenytoin is available in a solution of propylene glycol and alcohol, which are responsible for some of the adverse effects of its intravenous administration. Fosphenytoin underwent development as a water-soluble prodrug of phenytoin, devoid of these compounds, which is only available in an injection formulation and may be administered intravenously or intramuscularly.
