The TFLÂ is innervated by the superior gluteal nerve, L4, L5, and S1. The superior gluteal nerve is formed from the anterior rami of L4-S1. It runs with the superior gluteal artery and vein, passing superior to the piriformis before exiting the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. It runs anterior to the gluteus maximus muscle before ending at the gluteus minimus and TFL muscles.
