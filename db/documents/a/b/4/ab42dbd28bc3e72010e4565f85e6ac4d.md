Timely communication by all members of the interprofessional team is crucial to proper patient care. In the discussion of breast cysts and their evaluation, it is important for proper communication between the pathologist and the managing clinician to ensure that the patient is well cared for. In addition, personal patient concerns about breast cysts or breast masses, in general, are common. It is important for primary clinicians to have honest and open communication with their patients to ensure that no concerning breast symptoms are missed.  Finally, proper communication between the referring clinician and the surgeon is important to facilitate the timely treatment of the breast cyst. While the vast majority of these breast cysts are benign, it is in the patient’s best interest to have the cyst addressed promptly to ensure no underlying malignancy exists.
