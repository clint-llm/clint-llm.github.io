EMS providers may receive some information from dispatch about a 911 call prior to arriving on the scene, but this is often inaccurate or incomplete. A history and physical by providers is essential to determine appropriate treatment and transport destination. Many factors including severity of distress and scene safety will play a specific role in determining the depth into which EMS providers will be able to go, but ideally, a basic story of inciting events, overall timeline, and patient medical history are obtainable. If a patient is incapacitated, family members or other witnesses may be able to provide some third-party accounts. The physical exam is arguably more important than history, especially in cases where the victim is unable to speak to the providers themselves and will be discussed further in the following section. Specific things to note on scene that may be beneficial to in-hospital providers later on include amount of blood loss (in cases of gunshot wounds, stab wounds, amputations, etc.), extraction times (in cases of motor vehicle accidents or structural collapse), and any changes in patient mental status or vital signs while on route.
