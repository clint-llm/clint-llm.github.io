The history and physical exam for patients with markedly elevated blood pressure should focus on determining whether or not the patient has signs of target organ damage. Symptoms warranting further evaluation include a headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, vomiting, or vision changes.

The physical exam starts with an accurate blood pressure reading, with a properly-sized cuff placed on a bare upper arm. If a properly-sized cuff is not available due to large arm circumference, wrist measurement may be the most accurate but should be interpreted with caution due to lack of data compared to invasive measurements. Blood pressure should be measured in both the lying and the standing position (to assess volume depletion). It should also be taken in both arms as a significant difference between both arms may indicate aortic dissection.

Other physical exam signs should be carefully evaluated. Signs of heart failure, such as elevated jugular venous distention, rales on lung auscultation, or a gallop on heart auscultation, indicate that the patient may be actively experiencing a hypertensive emergency rather than urgency. A detailed neurologic exam, including cerebellar testing, is also essential to rule out central nervous system impairment. Finally, fundoscopy showing papilledema may be a significant finding mandating more aggressive therapy.

The history and physical examination establish the nature, gravity, and management of the hypertensive crisis. Therefore, the history should revolve around the presence of end-organ damage, the circumstances leading to hypertension, and any identifiable cause.

The severity and duration of the patient’s preexisting hypertension should be assessed, as well as their medication history. The details of antihypertensive treatment and compliance, the use of over-the-counter options such as sympathomimetic agents, and the use of illicit drugs, for instance, cocaine, are crucial points of the medication history. Additionally, it is essential to elicit information regarding the presence or absence of previous end-organ dysfunction, especially renal and cerebrovascular disease. In women, determining the date they had their last menstrual period is important, as hypertension affects 10% of pregnancies.
