**Medication-overuse headache (MOH)**is a common neurologic disorder with enormous disability and suffering and plays a significant role in the transformation from episodic to chronic headache disorders. Multiple terms have been used to describe MOH, such as analgesic rebound headache, drug-induced headache, or medication-misuse headache. Patients with established primary headache disorders like migraine or tension-type headaches overuse medication for their acute headaches and inadvertently increase the frequency and intensity of their headaches. In this manner, a vicious cycle of further drug consumption and increased headache frequency develops, transforming the treatment for their headache to the actual cause of their disease (MOH). Patients prone to headaches who take analgesics for other conditions can also develop MOH.

Recognition of MOH was as early as in the 1930s when physicians observed prolongation of headaches associated with ergotamine-overuse.evolutive migraine.
