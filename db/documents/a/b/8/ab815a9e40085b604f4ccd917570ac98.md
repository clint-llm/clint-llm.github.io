- Peptic ulcer

- Chronic atrophic gastritis (loss of appropriate glands resulting mainly from long-standing H. pylori infection)

- Gastric metaplasia/dysplasia

- Gastric cancer (adenocarcinoma)

- Iron-deficiency anemia (chronic gastritis and early stages of gastric autoimmunity)

- Vitamin B12 deficiency (autoimmune gastritis)

- Gastric bleeding

- Achlorhydria (autoimmune gastritis, chronic gastritis)

- Gastric perforation

- Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma

- Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) (previously referred to as gastric carcinoid; complicates autoimmune gastritis)

- Autoimmune gastritis predisposes to the development of both gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric type 1 NET
- The development of NET in these patients is related to mucosal atrophy and hyperplasia of immature mucus neck cells
- The enhanced differentiation of immature precursor neck cells into histamine-producing enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells secondary to hypergastrinemia is the process

- Vitamin C, vitamin D, folic acid, zinc, magnesium, and calcium deficiency (atrophic autoimmune gastritis)
