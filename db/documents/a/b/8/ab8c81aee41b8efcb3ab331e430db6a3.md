Due to extracellular concentrations of chloride being lower than intracellular levels in the developing brain, GABA has an excitatory role in the fetal and neonatal brain. When GABA-A receptors open chloride channels in the developing brain, the cell becomes hypopolarized and thus more likely to fire an action potential. Consequently, drugs that increase GABA signaling have been reported to be of limited efficacy in the treatment of seizures in preterm neonates.
