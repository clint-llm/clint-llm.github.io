Multiple hypotheses have been proposed over the years to describe the pathophysiology of clubbing. The initial hypothesis suggests that clubbing is a result of peripheral deposition of clumped platelets and mega-karyocytes which are otherwise sequestered by pulmonary vasculature.

Numerous other signaling proteins are thought to be associated with digital clubbing including prostaglandins, bradykinin, ferritin, adenosine nucleotides, interleukin-6, von Willebrand factor, serum transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), tumor necrosis factor-a, growth hormone, epidermal growth factor.

Shunting of blood past the capillary bed of either the lung or the liver, which suggests that a lack of metabolism of angiogenic factors that bypass a critical organ may be involved.
