Nitisinone, or 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-cyclohexane-1,3-dione (NTBC), was first approved by the U.S (United States) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1), in 2002. It was first discovered as a triketone molecule part of herbicidal weed killers.

HT-1 is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), the last enzyme in the tyrosine degradation pathway.

HT-1 complications arise from the accumulation of tyrosine and intermediate products fumarylacetoacetate (FAA) and maleylacetoacetate (MAA). FAA deposition in renal tubules and hepatocytes precipitates end-organ damage. Intermediate by-products, FAA and MAA, are further broken down into toxic metabolites, succinylacetoacetate (SAA) and succinylacetone (SA), in patients with HT-1.

Subsequent elevations of SAA and SA further exacerbate liver and kidney toxicity. Rickets, cognitive impairments, jaundice, vomiting, persistent irritability, and renal tubular dysfunction are among the most common symptoms caused by HT-1.

SA can also lead to a decrease in heme synthesis due to the inhibition of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), the enzyme necessary to catalyze the conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen. This causes an accumulation of aminolevulinic acid (ALA). This same step in heme synthesis is inhibited by lead. Therefore, it would not be unusual for a patient with HT-1 to have porphyria-type symptoms similar to lead poisoning.

Succinylacetone is a reliable screening marker analyzed in patient blood, helpful in the diagnosis and screening of HT-1. Succinylacetone is also the preferred marker when monitoring disease treatment's effect.

Non-FDA-approved indications for NTBC use include the management of alkaptonuria.

Recent studies suggest NTBC therapy may be more beneficial in treating patients with alkaptonuria than in those with HT-1. A more recent study investigated nitisinone's effectiveness in treating alkaptonuria by comparing a 2 mg dose of nitisinone to a 10 mg dose of nitisinone. The results indicated that nitisinone 10 mg slows the progressive disease course of alkaptonuria and leads to a more significant decrease in urine and serum HGA levels. The study also highlighted the increased likelihood of developing adverse effects with a higher dose of nitisinone compared to the lower amount and the benefit of concurrent adherence to a low-protein diet.

More recently, nitisinone has been explored for its potential use in improving regional hypopigmentation in patients with albinism. Multiple subtypes of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) exist, and mutations in the tyrosinase gene cause this inherited disorder. A deficiency in tyrosinase leads to a decrease in melanin synthesis. This lack of melanin gives patients with OCA the typical presentation of a lack of pigmentation of the skin, eyes, and hair follicles.

One group of researchers tested the efficacy of nitisinone therapy in treating five patients with OCA-1B. Their results concluded that nitisinone might prove beneficial in increasing the pigmentation of the skin and hair in patients with OCA-1B.
