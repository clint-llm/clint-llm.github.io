Malignant mesothelioma is a rare growth of mesothelial cells strongly associated with asbestos exposure. Mesothelial cells form the lining layers of the viscera. Mesothelioma can occur at any mesothelial layer such as the peritoneum or pericardium. The pleural layer is by far the most commonly affected, giving rise to malignant pleural mesothelioma. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology and presentation of malignant mesotheloma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of malignant mesothelioma.
- Review the workup of a patient with suspected malignant mesothelioma.
- Summarize the treatment options for malignant mesothelioma.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by malignant mesothelioma.
