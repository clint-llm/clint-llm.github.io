Treatment ofÂ collagen vascular disease-associated interstitial lung disease is geared towards the underlying connective tissue disease. Corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and antifibrosis medications have been employed with variable efficacy. Oxygen therapy improves breathing, facilitates exercise, prevents complications of hypoxia and pulmonary arterial hypertension, and fosters well-being. Physical rehabilitation may help improve mobility and achieve activities of daily living. Lung transplantation may be an option for patients with advanced and irreversible disease.
