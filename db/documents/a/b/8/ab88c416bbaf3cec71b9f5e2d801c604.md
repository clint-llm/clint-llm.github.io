Treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage with nimodipine is best carried out when under the direction of an interprofessional healthcare team. A cardiologist or internal medicine specialist will most frequently initiate the treatment. Nurses often administer and monitor nimodipine treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the neurosurgical floor. Neuro-intensivists and neurosurgeons play a crucial role in managing complex cases of SAH. Before initiating nimodipine, all practitioners should consult a pharmacist on dosing and drug interactions. Interprofessional coordination of effort will permit the healthcare team to obtain optimal outcomes with minimal adverse events. [Level 5] A recent study has shown that early and aggressive care of SAH leads to substantial improvement in survival and favorable outcomes.

When administering nimodipine, it is essential to be aware that it can produce hypotension. After administration, careful blood pressure monitoring is necessary, especially in patients using concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors and antihypertensive medicines. In patients who cannot be fed orally, medication administration is possible after extracting the contents in a syringe and feeding through a nasogastric tube. It should be labeled and kept separate to avoid its administration intravenously.
