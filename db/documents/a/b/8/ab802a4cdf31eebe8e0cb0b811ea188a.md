Meningocele is one of the common congenital neural tube defects. Meningocele is the simplest form of open neural tube defects characterized by cystic dilatation of meninges containing cerebrospinal fluid without any neural tissue. The prognosis of patients with meningocele is excellent with simple surgical repair of the meninges. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of Meningocoele and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of meningocele.
- Review the risk factors for developing neural tube defects. 
- Summarize the epidemiology of neural tube defects.
- Outline treatment considerations for patients with meningocele.
