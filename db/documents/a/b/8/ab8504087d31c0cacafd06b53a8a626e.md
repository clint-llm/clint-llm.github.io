As discussed previously, there are various etiologies for this localization. However, the most common etiology is vascular disease, either small vessel or atheromatous branch occlusion. The mainstay treatment of lacunar strokes is antiplatelet therapy and control of vascular risk factors for secondary prevention. Antiplatelet and statin therapy should commence on admission. Control of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and smoking cessation are as per the AHA/Stroke guidelines.
