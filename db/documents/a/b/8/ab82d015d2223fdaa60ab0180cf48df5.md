Blunt or penetrating trauma causes traumatic hyphemas to the orbit.Â Tears in the vessels of the ciliary body and iris result in bleeding. Blunt forces applied to the anterior globe create an instantaneous increase in intraocular pressure, producing a shearing force across the ciliary body and iris.

Spontaneous hyphemas often occur in patients whose medical conditions predispose them to ischemia, neovascularization, or vascular abnormalities. These patients will typically have a spontaneous vessel leak. As expected, it is more common in patients with diabetes, eye tumors, clotting disorders, sickle cell, and those on anticoagulants.
