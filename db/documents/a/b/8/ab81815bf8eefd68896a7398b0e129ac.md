PulmonaryÂ compliance, a measure of the expansion of the lung, is critical to the proper function of the respiratory system. Lung compliance can be calculated by dividing volume by pressure. Factors affecting lung compliance include elasticity from the elastin in connective tissue and surface tension, which is decreased by surfactant production. Lung compliance participates in the lung-chest wall system by opposing the outward pull of chest wall compliance. The net compliance (lung-chest wall system) allows the lungs to achieve appropriate functional residual capacity, the volume remaining after passive expiration.
