The styloglossus muscle receives its blood supply from the sublingual branch of the lingual artery. The lingual artery is a direct branch of the external carotid artery; it takes off from the external carotid at the level of the greater horn of the hyoid bone

Venous drainage of the tongue is via deep lingual veins and a single dorsal lingual vein; these vessels drain into the sublingual vein, which in turn empties directly into the internal jugular vein.

Lymphatic drainage of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is to the submental and submandibular lymph nodes, emptying into the deep cervical chain of lymph nodes. The posterior third of the tongue drains directly into the deep cervical lymph nodes.
