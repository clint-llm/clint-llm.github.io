The treatment of triplane ankle fractures depends on the amount of fracture fragment displacement and degree of articular step-off visualized on CT. Nondisplaced and minimally displaced (less than 2 mm) injuries can effectively undergo management with long leg cast immobilization.

Surgery is reserved for triplane fractures with over 2 mm of displacement or injuries that lost reduction during attempted nonoperative management. Fixation is typically achieved with one or two screws placed parallel to the physis. Screw placement can be in the metaphysis, epiphysis, or both depending on the fracture pattern. Screw types utilized for fixation vary widely no evidence suggesting the superiority of cannulated versus non-cannulated or fully threaded versus partially threaded screw fixation in triplane ankle fractures. Congruity of the articular surface must be restored to optimize outcomes.

Several clinicians' preferred technique includes percutaneous reduction via small incisions and fixation with one or two non-cannulated partially threaded 3.5 mm screws placed parallel to the physis. The epiphyseal fracture is usually amenable to anterolateral to posteromedial placed screws, while the metaphyseal fragment usually gets captured with direct anterior to posterior based screws. Care is also necessary to ensure all screw threads are past the fracture if using partially threaded screws. [Level 5]
