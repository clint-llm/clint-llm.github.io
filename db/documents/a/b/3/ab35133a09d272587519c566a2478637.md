The fibroblast is one of the most abundant cell types present in the stroma. It has a variety of functions and composes the basic framework for tissues and organs. Under homeostasis, this cell is responsible for maintaining the extracellular matrix (ECM). During stress, fibroblasts adapt to their environment and have the ability to respond and send local signals. In times of injury, the fibroblast can transform phenotypes and synthesize the building blocks necessary to replace wounded tissue. During pathologic states, the extracellular matrix gets generated in excessive quantities, and collagen is deposited in a dysregulated manner often causing irreversible organ dysfunction or disfiguring appearance.
