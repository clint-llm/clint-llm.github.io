If performed by an experienced hand and microsurgeon, viability rates of replants should be at least 80% following replantation. Motion at the affected joints depends on the level of amputation, mechanism of amputation, and compliance with postoperative therapy. Patients should receive counsel before surgery that the motion in replanted digits averages only approximately 50% of normal. Furthermore, patients undergoing replantation average ten days in the hospital and approximately seven months of time off of work. In general, the best results come from replantation of the thumb, hand, distal forearm, and fingers distal to the insertion of the flexor digitorum superficialisÂ (Zone 1).
