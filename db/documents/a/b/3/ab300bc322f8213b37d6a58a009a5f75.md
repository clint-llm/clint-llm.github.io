Given that current simulation education literature supports the use of role-playing, volunteer patients, and standardized patients as ESPs, educators must judge which will be the best fit for their educational goals, learner groups, and budget.  Formative learning may be a better fit for the more cost-effective peer role-players and VEPs. Summative high-stakes testing environments or high-level simulation research may require the use of specially trained SPs to play ESP roles.

While peers are readily available for role-playing, volunteers may not be as invested in the simulation learning as paid SPs. Literature does not mention this when discussing the use of volunteers, so this concern may be mitigated by careful selection of VEPs such that they are also invested in the learning objectives. Studies indicated equal educational quality and achievement of learning objectives in all groups: role-playing ESPs, VEPs, and SPs as ESPs.

Psychological safety should also be a consideration when choosing among the groups of ESPs available for use, with consideration for both the psychological safety of learners and the ESPs themselves.  Emotionally charged simulations, such as breaking bad news, may require the use of specially trained SPs as ESPs.
