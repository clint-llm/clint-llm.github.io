In a normal gait, the subtalar joint is a pronating and supinating joint. When the foot is in the stance phase, the leg normally internally rotates, and in the toe-off phase, the leg externally rotates due to the closed chain movement. In a subtalar coalition, this unique miter torque converter movement gets lost, leading to increased stress on the neighboring joints especially the ankle joint and talonavicular joints leading to ligamentous laxity in the ankle joint and beaking at the talar neck leading to traction spurs. A primary impingement caused by the presence of an accessory facet in a pediatric or young adult rigid flatfoot deformity may cause peroneal spasm.
