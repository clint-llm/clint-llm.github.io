# Continuing Education Activity

Obesity represents a significant and increasing worldwide health problem associated with increased morbidity and mortality, primarily due to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Physical activity (PA) and exercise training are commonly used strategies to promote and maintain weight loss in patients with obesity or who are overweight. This is often in combination with calorie restriction, medication, or bariatric surgical intervention. This article reviews the evidence and clinical approach to physical activity for the maintenance of weight loss.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the physiology of weight loss and weight loss maintenance in patients with obesity or who are overweight.
- Outline the clinical evidence for physical activity in weight loss and weight loss maintenance in patients with obesity or who are overweight.
- Summarize key patient counseling points when advising physical activity to maintain weight loss patients with obesity or who are overweight.
- Explain the importance of accurate counseling by the interprofessional team for maintaining weight loss in patients with obesity or who are overweight.

# Introduction

Obesity is a significant and increasing health problem worldwide.

In simplest terms, weight change depends on the balance between energy intake and energy expenditure. However, this relationship is non-linear and involves many variables such as body mass composition, energy partition, and energy storage.

Weight change in patients with obesity is a complex multifactorial problem. Weight loss itself decreases the energy required and thus expenditure to perform equivalent PA activities after weight loss. Negative feedback circuits have been shown to influence food intake by increasing appetite and decreasing satiety.

Weight loss is the primary treatment for patients with obesity. While some improvement in cardiovascular risk has been demonstrated with a weight loss of 2 to 3%, clinical guidelines recommend a weight loss of 5% to 10% over 6 months to produce significant improvements in cardiovascular risk factors.

# Function

In 2001, the American College of Sports Medicine recommended at least 150 minutes of PA per week to promote and maintain weight loss. However, they advised that 200 to 300 minutes of PA per week would be more effective in maintaining weight loss. This would correlate to 60 minutes of walking per day.

Multiple large trials have shown that the volume of PA is directly associated with successful maintenance of weight loss.et al. (2004) examined 1079 patients in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) at 1 and 3-year intervals following diet and lifestyle modification. Mean PA levels were 224 and 247 minutes, and weight loss goals were reached in 49% and 37% of patients at 1 and 3 years respectively.et al. (2011) used data from The Action for heath for Diabetes (Look AHEAD) study containing 5145 patients with DM to show a direct correlation between the amount of PA and weight loss over 4 years. Patients in the highest quartile of PA completed a mean 287 minutes of exercise per week and showed significant weight loss and maintenance of weight loss after 3 years.  However, successful maintenance of weight loss was shown in only 25% of the starting cohort after 3 years. Predictors of unsuccessful weight loss included poor adherence to PA and diet programs.et al. (2003) showed that high-intensity PA (approximately 75 minutes per day) improved maintenance of weight loss compared to lower intensity PA (~35 minutes per day).

Key protective factors for weight loss maintenance include adherence to high levels of PA, low calorie and low-fat diets, and self-monitoring of weight, diet, and exercise. Conversely, poor adherence to PA and dietary programs was associated with failure to maintain weight loss. The effectiveness of PA in the maintenance of weight loss is limited by patient adherence, thus becoming a complex issue comprising physical, physiological, and behavioral aspects.

There are several limitations of research into weight loss maintenance. The large studies rely on self-reporting of PA levels rather than direct monitoring. Prescribed PA had poor adherence in most studies, and self-reported adherence remains a key predictor of successful maintenance of weight loss.

PA, independent of calorie restriction, is an effective method for weight loss and weight loss maintenance.

Patients seeking to lose weight without changing dietary habits should be counseled that 225 to 400 minutes of exercise per week could be required, and even then, there is no guarantee of weight loss. This is especially true in patients with a high-calorie intake.

There is less evidence for weight loss in PA alone, rather than in conjunction with calorie restriction. High PA levels alone were shown to improve weight loss in the 1 and 2 Midwest Exercise Trial (MET 1) and (MET 2). MET 1 (131 patients) demonstrated significant weight loss associated with increased PA levels in male but not female patients.

Predictors of successful weight loss and weight loss maintenance include adherence to PA programs, diet control, and self-monitoring of weight, diet, and exercise programs. Whilst maintenance of weight loss is difficult, successful maintenance at 1 year is a good predictor of consistent maintenance into the future.

Independent of weight loss, PA effectively improves cardiovascular fitness and reduces cardiovascular risk factors, thereby reducing the morbidity and mortality of obesity.

# Issues of Concern

Maintenance of weight loss in patients with obesity or who are overweight is difficult due to the physical and psychological effort required to maintain a sustained calorie deficit over long periods. While increasing PA levels have been shown to improve weight loss and weight maintenance, it is associated with worse patient adherence, restricting the effectiveness of programs. The recommended 200-300 minutes of exercise a week remains a large commitment for patients.

Poor adherence is common after long periods of intensive diet and PA programs with an apparent lack of results. Unrealistic goal setting, including prescription of unsustainable PA or calorie restriction levels, often leads to poor patient adherence, lack of results, and subsequent disillusionment and mistrust.

Patients with obesity or who are overweight, especially those with other co-morbidities, may find PA difficult. Walking is often recommended as an accessible form of PA. However, patients with an ongoing musculoskeletal disorder or other disabling comorbidities may not be able to walk for the necessary time to promote significant energy expenditure.

The psychological component of maintaining a significant weight loss is crucial. Mood and eating disorders can greatly impact patients’ weight and can be a limiting factor in successful weight loss. Management of eating disorders or body dysmorphia by appropriate specialists is essential to promote weight loss and weight loss maintenance. In addition, effective management of concordant mental health issues by appropriate specialist consultation can promote successful maintenance of weight loss. et al. describe its negative effects on mental health. They advised careful consideration of the possible negative psychological and emotional effects that regular self-weighing can have on patients before recommending self-monitoring.

# Clinical Significance

High levels of PA have been shown to significantly improve maintenance of weight loss in patients with obesity or who are overweight. However, the clinical application of this fact is significantly more complex. Patients should be counseled that >250 minutes of exercise a week, in addition to calorie restriction, will help maintain weight loss.

Increased self-monitoring and patient responsibility are good predictors of adherence to PA programs and weight loss maintenance.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Maintenance of weight loss in patients with obesity or who are overweight remains a difficult objective. Clinicians should utilize a multidisciplinary approach to gain maximum benefit for the patient. Treatment should involve input from medical, nutrition, and physical therapy experts to provide detailed and patient-oriented PA and diet plans.

In cases where weight loss maintenance has been unsuccessful with diet and exercise plans, referral for assessment of bariatric surgery may be appropriate.

Increased PA has been shown to improve weight loss and maintenance of weight loss when combined with calorie restriction.

Little evidence from well-designed randomized controlled trials shows PA will promote maintenance of weight loss independently of calorie restriction. However, several prospective cohort studies have produced results that indicate PA is beneficial in weight loss maintenance.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

PA is effective in promoting weight loss maintenance in patients with obesity or who are overweight. However, maintaining patient adherence and commitment to PA programs alongside calorie restriction programs requires consistent input from a multidisciplinary healthcare team. Consistent, realistic counseling from medical, nursing and allied health professionals is the best way to avoid unrealistic patient expectations and resulting disillusionment and lack of adherence. Early involvement of behavioral and eating disorder specialists, motivational interviewing, and physical therapy assessment has been shown to promote weight loss maintenance.

Maintaining weight loss in patients with obesity or who are overweight has been repeatedly demonstrated as extremely difficult. This is compounded by both the physiological response from the body to calorie restriction and the physical and mental effort required to maintain sustained PA and diet programs. Therefore, a consistent, combined, multidisciplinary approach is required to give patients the optimum support to maintain weight loss.
