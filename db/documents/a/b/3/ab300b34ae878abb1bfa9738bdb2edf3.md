There are seven extraocular muscles within the ocular orbit

- Levator palpebrae superioris and superior tarsal muscle: levator palpebrae superioris innervated by the oculomotor nerve; superior tarsal muscle innervated by the sympathetic nervous system; both elevate the upper eyelid

- Superior rectus: innervated by the oculomotor nerve; the primary function is the elevation of the eyeball.

- Inferior rectus: innervated by the oculomotor nerve; the primary function is depression of the eyeball.

- Medial rectus: innervated by the oculomotor nerve; the primary function is adduction of the eyeball.

- Lateral rectus: innervated by the abducens nerve; the primary function is the abduction of the eyeball.

- Superior oblique: innervated by the trochlear nerve; the primary function is depression, abduction, and medial rotation of the eyeball.

- Inferior oblique: innervated by the oculomotor nerve; the primary function is elevation, abduction, and lateral rotation of the eyeball.
