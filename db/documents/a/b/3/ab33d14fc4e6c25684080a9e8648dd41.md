Lymphomatoid papulosis accounts for about 12% of cutaneous lymphomas. It may occur at any age but, on average, earlier than CD30+ anaplastic large-cell lymphomas. It is less exceptional in children. In large series, the mean age of onset varies between 35 and 45 years. The male-to-female ratio is approximately 1 to 5.
