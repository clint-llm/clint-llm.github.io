In the absence of organic causes, encopresis is secondary to overflow, and therefore results from the presence of constipation. Withholding of stool creates a vicious circle of accumulation of feces and hardening of the fecal mass in the rectosigmoid colon. Finally, feces leak between the solid fecal mass and rectal wall and come out through the anal canal when the sphincter muscles are relaxed. The volume of fecal matter that leaks out is usually small and, most of the time, just stain the underwear. There are different reasons why a child may withhold stool or avoid defecation.

Stool withholding may be an intentional behavior to avoid unpleasant sensations and associations with defecation. It may be due to a painful bowel movement that is caused by a stool that was larger or harder than normal, an anal fissure, or a perianal infection. The child may be reluctant to use the toilet at school due to limited time, lack of privacy, or concern about restroom cleanliness, choosing instead to withhold stool until coming home. A child may not want to have an interruption in an enjoyable activity to have a bowel movement. Finally, stool withholding may be a learned avoidance behavior that is less intentional or even unconscious due to repeated painful bowel movements.

Incontinence of feces can occur during the day as well as at night time. Nocturnal incontinence is considered an indicator of severe fecal impaction in the rectum. On the other hand, children with non-retentive encopresis pass stools into inappropriate places without evidence of stool retention. The majority of them have a complete evacuation of bowel, not just staining of the underwear as in retentive incontinence. In research studies, colonic transit time appears within normal limits; however, it has been shown that there is some limitation of the relaxation on external sphincter during the defecation.

Risk factors for functional encopresis are low socioeconomic background, unhygienic toilets, living in an urban area or war-affected zone, hospitalization of the child for another illness, and bullying at school. Psychological and behavioral problems such as aggressive behavior, depression, social withdrawal, anxiety, disruptive and oppositional behavior, and poor school and social performances were noted in one-third of children with functional encopresis.
