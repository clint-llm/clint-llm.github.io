Temporal lobe epilepsy characteristically presents with seizure activity originating in either the medial or lateral temporal lobes. The seizures can either be focal aware seizures, focal seizures with impaired awareness, and there can also be seizure activity which originates in the temporal lobe but extends to involve both cerebral hemispheres, commonly manifesting as focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. Chronic memory impairment is a common finding in individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy.

Symptoms of temporal lobe epilepsy include the following:

- Focal aware seizures: classically referred to as "auras," these phenomena include special sensory symptoms such as occurring in auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and visceral systems. They may also manifest with autonomic, somatosensory, and cognitive events such as "deja vu," and "jamais vu." Emotional symptoms, such as fear or anxiety, are also possible.

- Focal impaired awareness seizures: sometimes, a focal aware seizure may progress to a loss of consciousness. During this progression, the patient may display a motionless stare, dilated pupils, and automatisms such as in the facial-oral musculature or unilateral dystonic limb posturing may present.

- Focal seizures may extend to involve both cerebral hemispheres and frequently manifest with bilateral tonic-clonic convulsions.

- Both (2) and (3) above may be associated with a postictal period, which may manifest with confusion, aphasia, and/or amnesia.

Inter-ictal symptoms are non-specific in the majority of cases. Occasionally, patients may manifest with a change in the prosody of speech and flattening of the contralateral nasolabial fold with emotional incitement.
