Lymphadenopathy can be seen in various conditions such as infection, autoimmune disorders, and malignancies. Patients with lymphadenopathy should undergo proper workups. A definitive diagnosis requires a biopsy with histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations. It is prudent to obtain adequate tissue for histopathologic analysis, particularly for patients with suspected Hodgkin lymphoma, to yield a definitive diagnosis.
