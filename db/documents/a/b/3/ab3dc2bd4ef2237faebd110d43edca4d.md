The most important differential diagnosis may be seborrheic dermatitis since many patients have a long history of scalp scaling, often diagnosed initially as seborrheic dermatitis. Sudden onset of patchy hair loss on the scalp may be diagnosed as alopecia areata, but when only partial hair loss, perifollicular erythema, and scaling are present within the patch, lichen planopilaris should be the main diagnostic suspect.
