During the third week of development, the human embryo undergoes a process known as gastrulation. This developmental period is when the embryo divides into three primary germ cell layers: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.  The ectoderm layer, with the aid of the mesoderm layer, undergoes a process known as neurulation. Neurulation is the term given to the embryonic formation of the human nervous system, and therefore the frontal cortex.

Neurulation begins with the notochord, a portion of the mesoderm, sending signals to the overlying ectoderm. The portion of the ectoderm receiving signals from the notochord, known as the neuroectoderm, then uses these signals to fold and thicken, eventually forming the neural tube. The neural tube goes on to grow in two directions, cephalad and caudad, with the most cephalad region forming the adult frontal cortex. Brain development begins with the formation of three primary vesicles: the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.  The forebrain then goes on to develop into two secondary vesicles: the telencephalon and diencephalon. The telencephalon later becomes the basal ganglia and cerebral hemispheres, and thus the frontal cortex.
