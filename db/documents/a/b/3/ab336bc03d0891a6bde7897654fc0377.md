Class A KPC is the most common cpCRE. It is endemic to regions in China, India, Saudi Arabia, Greece, Columbia, and Brazil, but rare in the United States, Australia, and France.

Molecular testing has been the most effective way of understanding the epidemiology and spread of cpCRE. It can identify specific strains of CRE and map their range within a hospital or across the world. Though uncommon, regional genetic drift in carbapenemase genes may hinder the molecular identification of CRE strains, which could cause phenotypic resistance that is missed by assays that detect specific gene sequences.

Patients usually acquire cpCRE infections in the hospital and long term care facilities.
