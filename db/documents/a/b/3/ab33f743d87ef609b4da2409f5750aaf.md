Patients shall be educated about the importance of these general instructions:

- Avoidance of the causal allergen is mandatory. Its removal results in gradual improvement.

- Consider the use of allergen-free skin-care products.

- Sun avoidance is recommended. This entails using broad-spectrum sunscreens, appropriate clothes, and avoiding peak hours of sunlight.

- Treatment should not be discontinued promptly since several months are needed before the effect becomes apparent.
