Factors that may trigger or exacerbate generalized pustular psoriasis include:

**Infections**

Viral or bacterial infections are common exacerbating factors, reported in 12 of 16 patients with known generalized pustular psoriasis in one series.

**Drugs**

The most important drug provocation is by corticosteroids. There is substantial evidence that withdrawal of systemic corticosteroid therapy can precipitate generalized pustular psoriasis, and topical therapy with potent corticosteroids under occlusion has also been implicated. There are reports of the induction of disease on withdrawal of ciclosporin. Other systemic drugs have also occasionally been implicated including terbinafine, propranolol, bupropion, lithium, phenylbutazone, salicylates, and potassium iodide. Coal tar and dithranol may provoke pustulation if applied injudiciously when the disease is unstable.

**Psychological Stress**

Many individuals report deterioration at times of psychological stress.

**Hypocalcemia**

Hypocalcemia may arise as a consequence of generalized pustular psoriasis, but triggering of active disease by hypocalcemia caused by hypoparathyroidism also has been reported.

**Pregnancy**

Pregnancy has been recognized as one of the risk factors.
