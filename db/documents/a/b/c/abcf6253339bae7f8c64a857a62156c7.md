Migraine is one of the common types of headache disorder that can present with a wide variety of symptoms. The word migraine derives from the Latin word ‘hemicrania,’ meaning ‘half skull.’ The term ‘migraine’ was first used by the Greek physician, Galenus of Pergamon. Migraine auras are the sensory symptoms (neurologic, gastrointestinal, and autonomic) that can occur before or during a migraine episode. These symptoms can include flashes of light, blind spots, or tingling in the hands or face. Migraine without aura accounts for 70% of patients with migraine headaches.
