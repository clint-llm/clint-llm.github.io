As with any illness, a full and detailed history collection accompanied by an appropriate physical exam is the most important aspect of any medical evaluation. The diagnosis of a cough is an obvious clinical observation. A cough is a symptom rather than a diagnosis of disease. As such, many patients present for evaluation of the secondary or underlying effects of cough rather than a cough itself. Essential components of the history-taking session should include:

- Details about duration

- Cigarette smoking

- Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors

- Weight loss

- Occupation

- Diurnal variation

- Relieving factors

- Aggravating factors

- Productive with sputum or nonproductive, if productive, what is the color of phlegm

- Associated hemoptysis

- Associated fever

- Associated shortness of breath

- Presence of an upper respiratory tract infection at the onset of a cough

Otherwise, a systemic approach should be used to identify any coexisting illness, which may be the origin or compounding factor of a cough. Interestingly, one study in 1996 found that the character and timing of a cough and the presence or absence of sputum production aid in the further specification of a differential diagnosis. Specific findings that are common and may be found with any complaint of a cough include malaise, fatigue, insomnia, lifestyle changes, musculoskeletal chest pain, hoarseness, excessive perspiration, urinary incontinence, syncope, cardiac dysrhythmias, headache, subconjunctival hemorrhage, inguinal herniation, or gastroesophageal reflux. The specific complaints should tailor the focus of a clinical physical exam and diagnostic workup to elucidate the exact etiology.
