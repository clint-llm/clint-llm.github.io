Given the difficulty with diagnosis, patients may present after months of dealing with persistent pain and weakness without an identified cause or after failing to improve with treatment of co-morbid findings on exam or imaging, e.g., rotator cuff strains, osteoarthritis, and labral pathology. However, once a diagnosis of SSN injury is confirmed, treatment can start.

Non-operative management can be effective for patients who have isolated suprascapular neuropathy without co-morbid pathology, e.g., of the intra-articular shoulder or rotator cuff pathology.

If there is an identified pathology causing compression of the nerve or have not improved with 6-12 months of the above conservative management, surgical intervention is warranted. Some surgeons contend that surgical intervention should be performed immediately upon diagnosis because patients have likely had the symptoms for at least six months leading up to the presentation.
