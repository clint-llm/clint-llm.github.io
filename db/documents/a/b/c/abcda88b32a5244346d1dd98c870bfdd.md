Reported pertussis cases are increasing in the United States and worldwide. The prevalence of pertussis in the United States sharply declined from 150,000 to 250,000 cases per year in the prevaccination era to 1010 cases reported in 1976. Since then, pertussis has been on the rise, which is partially attributed to waning adolescent and adult immunity. Although pertussis largely remains a pediatric disease, with 38% of cases occurring in infants younger than 6 months and 71% of cases occurring in children younger than 5 years, adolescents and adults can also contract the disease and are likely contributing to the increasing number of both adult and pediatric cases seen over the past three decades. Worldwide, there are over 24 million cases annually, with greater than 160,000 deaths. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported over 48,000 cases in the United States in 2012, the most recent year for which this data is available. Due to difficulty in diagnosis, the CDC estimates likely underreporting.
