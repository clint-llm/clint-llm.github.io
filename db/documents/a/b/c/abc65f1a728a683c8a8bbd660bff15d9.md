The exact prevalence of cervicitis is difficult to determine due to the lack of a standard definition and variation by population. Since sexual activity is the main risk factor for the infectious causes, it may affect about 30%-40% of the patients seen in sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics.

The highest incidence is in sexually active women aged 15Â to 24.

It was demonstrated by Taylor et al. that 61% of women enrolled in a randomized trial were negative for chlamydia, Neisseria, trichomonas, or mycoplasma by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT).
