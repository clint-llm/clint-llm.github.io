The histopathological features of urticaria include interstitial edema involving the upper and mid-dermis, mixed inflammatory perivascular infiltrates, and dilated venules and lymphatic vessels that permit leakage of serum into the surrounding tissue.

Angioedema shares similar features, but they are observed deeper within the lower dermis and subcutaneous tissue.

A biopsy of involved skin for histology is not a routine aspect of the workup for CSU; however, it can be considered when the rash is atypical. Leukocytoclasis and vasculitis are not seen with CSU and must prompt consideration of alternate diagnoses.
