Examination findings include serpiginous white lines indicating mite burrowing. Common sites of mite burrowing include intertriginous areas, axillae, umbilicus, between digits, the beltline, nipples, buttocks, areolae of female breasts, flexural surfaces of the wrists or on the penile shaft. Type IV hypersensitivity reactions to the mite, eggs, or excrement may occur, forming erythematous papules. The itching associated with scabies gives way to scratching, encrustation, and possible impetiginization

Secondary bacterial infections commonly occur following tunneling by the mites. Impetigo is especially common since a synergistic relationship between the scabies mite and Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria exists. Burrowing mites release complement inhibiting proteins that prevent the opsonization of S. pyogenes, which allows the bacteria to proliferate and evade the immune system

Not all individuals exhibit classic manifestations of scabies infestations, which can make the infection challenging to diagnose. Patients may only have subtle signs and may not demonstrate the typical clues, which include a history of exposure, severe pruritis at night, or close contacts with a similar presentation
