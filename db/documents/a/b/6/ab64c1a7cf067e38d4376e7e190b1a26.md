Small-intestinal malignancies are mainly diagnosed in the fifth or sixth decade of life. The patients with small bowel adenocarcinoma are significantly younger with more advanced stages of cancer at the time of diagnosis than those with colorectal cancer.****In contrast, Colon Cancer accounts for the third most common cause of cancer-related death in the USA. The exact epidemiology and rate of incidence vary with each type of malignancy.

**Sarcoma**

- The most common type is GIST tumors—higher incidence rates in individuals around age 65 with reported male predominance. Sarcomas overall, however, are most commonly found in children as an oncologic process.

**Adenocarcinoma**

- Generally present in patients aged 50 to 70 years old with male predominance identified.

****Neuroendocrine Tumors****

- Generally present in patients aged 50 to 70, with most cases presenting in patients over 65 years old. Studies have shown no gender predilection for NETs of the small intestine or rectum, but NETs of the stomach, appendix, and colon affected women more commonly than men.

**Lymphoma**

- Out of all gastrointestinal tract lymphomas, small bowel accounts for approximately 9 to 10% of cases in total. The majority of the patients are between 60 to 70 years of age, with a strong male predominance (60% vs. 40%).
