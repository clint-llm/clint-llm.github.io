The most commonly seen complication of a concussion is a post-concussion syndrome (PCS) characterized by persistent symptoms lasting weeks to months after the initial injury. The median duration of symptoms in one study was seven months.

One of the most feared and concerning complications of a concussion, although rare, is a second-impact syndrome.  Second-impact syndrome (SIS) involves a repeat blow or injury to the head before the complete resolution of the initial concussion, resulting in usually rapid, severe swelling of the brain.

Research on the long-term consequences of a concussion is still limited. Of greatest concern is the potential for the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). This condition is characterized by slow, progressive neurodegeneration due to repeated head trauma and tau protein deposition.
