Clinical Toxocariasis is a product of Toxocara species migration through tissues. Toxocara canis primarily infects canids (dogs, foxes, and wolves), whereas T. cati primarily infects felids (cats). T. cati is thought to more frequently cause severe human disease. Children are more prone to infection via the fecal-oral route as they are more likely to consume Toxocara eggs by ingesting soil or other contaminated substances. Epidemiologic studies have found that public parks with community sandboxes have particularly high egg burdens, placing children frequenting these areas at risk.
