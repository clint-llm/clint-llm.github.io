Peptic ulcer disease is characterized by discontinuation in the inner lining of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract because of gastric acid secretion or pepsin. It extends into the muscularis propria layer of the gastric epithelium. It usually occurs in the stomach and proximal duodenum. It may involve the lower esophagus, distal duodenum, or jejunum. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of peptic ulcer disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of peptic ulcer disease.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with peptic ulcer disease.
- Summarize the treatment options for peptic ulcer disease.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by peptic ulcer disease.
