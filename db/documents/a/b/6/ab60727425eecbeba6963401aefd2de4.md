In poikilocytosis, RBCs are irregularly shaped and may be unable to carry enough oxygen. Subsequently, the patient will manifest fatigue, pale skin, shortness of breath, palpitations, and weakness. The main feature of poikilocytosis is having 10 percent or more abnormally-shaped RBCs. External stressors have the propensity to magnify the signs and symptoms of the erythrocyte's illness. For example, sickle cell disease commonly presents as (when exposed to cold, dehydration, hypoxia) sickle cell crisis (hemolytic, aplastic, sequestration), acute chest syndrome, vaso-occlusive crisis, and autosplenectomy.

Anemia due to increased intravascular hemolysis can present as an indirect hyperbilirubinemia. The sclera and skin may appear jaundiced in hemolysis; the urine may be discolored. The most difficult part of the exam is that the symptoms can be admixed with other, nonspecific findings.
