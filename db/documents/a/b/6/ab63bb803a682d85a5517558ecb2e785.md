Dupilumab is the most effective and safe immunomodulating therapy available for treating moderate-to-severe symptoms associated with atopic dermatitis, including itching, poor sleep quality, anxiety, and depression. The evidence from an increasing number of trials suggests that the benefits of dupilumab far outweigh its side effects.

Since no concrete literature-based evidence suggest that dupilumab is contraindicated during pregnancy or lactation, shared decision-making among healthcare team members and patients is paramount for ensuring safe and effective treatment plans. It is crucial that patients receive significant education on their treatment options, including discussing the benefits and risks to maternal and fetal health, and that patient's individual values and preferences are taken into consideration.

Both pharmacists and nurses need to have easy and direct access to the prescriber so any patient concerns regarding dupilumab use can be addressed immediately. Uniform communication among healthcare team members is pivotal to obtaining optimal therapeutic results for dupilumab use with minimal adverse events. [Level 1]
