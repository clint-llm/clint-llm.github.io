**History**

There are no clinical findings specific for aortic injury. However, hypotension, external evidence of trauma, and altered mental status are common.

The symptoms may include the following:

- Chest pain: Usually retro-sternal, or intra-scapular pain

- Difficulty breathing or swallowing

- Dysphagia, stridor, or a hoarse voice, may occur due to pressure from a mediastinal hematoma.

Be aware that symptoms may not reliably predict aortic injury.

**Physical Examination**

- Usually, no clinical signs of traumatic aortic injury are present in patients with aortic injury

- Steering wheel marks or seatbelt signs may be present.

- A discrepancy may exist between the blood pressures in each arm. Upper-extremity hypertension

- Femoral pulses may be diminished or absent

- Pseudo-coarctation: Increased blood pressure in upper extremities and lower blood pressure in the lower extremities

- A new heart murmur not previously present
