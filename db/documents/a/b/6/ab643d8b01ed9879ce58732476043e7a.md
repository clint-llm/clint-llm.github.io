The red reflex is elicited in the Br√ºckner test, a pediatric screening tool often used by primary care doctors and pediatricians to detect abnormalities of the eyes and ocular diseases.

A red reflex should appear red, orange, or yellow and be symmetric across both pupils. Eliciting a normal red reflex requires transmission through a transparent optical media, including the tear film, cornea, aqueous humor, lens, and vitreous body.

**Technique**

The red reflex test uses an ophthalmoscope or retinoscope, with the examiner standing approximately 1 to 2 feet away from the patient.
