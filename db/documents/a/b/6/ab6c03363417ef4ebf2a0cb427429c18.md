It is important to understand how cardiac physiology is intertwined with other organ systems and how pathophysiology relates back to simple gross physiology. Cardiac physiology is one of the most important pieces of medical knowledge in healthcare. The cardiovascular system is constantly adapting to maintain homeostasis in the body, specifically to maintain oxygen perfusion of tissues. The heart will adapt via multiple variables such as heart rate, stroke volume, preload, afterload, diastole, and systole. This article defines these terms and extrapolates them into a working model of cardiac physiology.
