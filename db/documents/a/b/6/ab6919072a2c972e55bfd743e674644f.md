Abetalipoproteinemia is a relatively rare genetic and acquired disorder that is characterized by acanthocytic red blood cells, fat malabsorption, spinocerebellar degeneration, and pigmented retinopathy. The condition is associated with very high morbidity, and thus it is vital to have an integrated pathway of management with close interaction with a number of health professionals. Besides a gastroenterologist, an interprofessional approach is essential if one is to improve outcomes:

- Ophthalmologist to regularly assess for retinal degeneration and ophthalmoplegia

- Internist to assess the cholesterol profile and the abetalipoproteinemia.

- Neurologist: to assess and monitor the patient for spinocerebellar degeneration

- Hematologist to assess the anemia and acanthocytosis

- Pharmacist to determine the need for pyridoxine and total parenteral nutrition or supplementation with vitamins

- Dietitian to assess the patient for failure to thrive, assess malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and the need to change diet

- Genetic counseling for patients and their first-degree relatives

- Social worker and nurse to assess the patients for nutritional needs, failure to thrive, and referral to a specialist.

**Evidence-based Medicine**

Because of the rarity of the disorder, there is a lack of randomized clinical trials on the long-term benefits of vitamins. However, small case series and anecdotal reports indicate that when patients are diagnosed and referred early to a clinic that specializes in the management of this lipid disorder, the outcomes are improved.
