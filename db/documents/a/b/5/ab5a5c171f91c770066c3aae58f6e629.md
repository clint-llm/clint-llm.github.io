Tracheostomy is a procedure where an artificial airway is established surgically or percutaneously in the cervical trachea. The term “tracheostomy” has evolved to refer to both the procedure as well as the clinical condition of having a tracheostomy tube. The first documented tracheostomy (or tracheotomy) was performed in the 15th century.

In 1976, Dr. Frost wrote an interesting historical account on the development of tracheostomy through the ages, covering five main stages filled with drama and fear that eventually culminated in a routinely performed procedure in modern medicine.

Over 83,000 tracheostomies were placed in the United States in 1999.

With the increasing number of patients with tracheostomy, safe caring requires knowledge and competencies in dealing with routine care, weaning, decannulation, as well as tracheostomy-related emergencies. Tracheostomy tube change is part of routine care, but complications may occur more frequently in the absence of competence and a robust system of tracheostomy care.

This article aims to provide a basic understanding of the tracheostomy procedure and its relevant anatomy, thereby explaining the principles behind tracheostomy care with a primary focus on changing the tracheostomy tube.
