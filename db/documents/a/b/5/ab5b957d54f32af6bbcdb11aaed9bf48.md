In patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, urinalysis shows large amounts of protein and casts (hyaline and broad waxy), although red blood cell (RBC) casts are usually absent. In advanced cases, broad casts may be evident. Serum creatinine (SCr) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) are usually within the reference range in the early stages. Features of nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria >3.5 g/day, serum albumin <30 g/L, with or without edema) may or may not be present.

In idiopathic FSGS, investigations for an underlying etiology are usually negative. Such conditions include the following:

- Systemic lupus erythematosus (antinuclear antibody/anti-DNA titers, serum complement C4/C3 levels)

- Hepatitis B or C infection

- Vasculitis (serum protein electrophoresis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titers)

In patients suspected to have secondary FSGS, the following should be obtained:

- HIV antibody, CD4, and viral load

- Serology for hepatitis B and C

- Parvovirus testing

FSGS in morbidly obese patients is diagnosed by excluding other causes.Â The common features in obesity-related FSGS include glomerular hyperfiltration and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

**Histologic Findings**

A kidney biopsy is the mostÂ diagnostic modality in FSGS, like in many other glomerulopathies.Â The characteristic finding in FSGS is segmental solidification of the glomeruli, typically in the perihilar region and occasionally in the peripheral areas, such as the tubular pole.

In HIV-associated FSGS, electron microscopy of the kidney shows tubuloreticular inclusions in mesangial and endothelial cells, an indirect indication of viral disease.

**Ultrasonography**

Earlier in the course of illness, ultrasonography will reveal normal or enlarged kidneys with increased echogenicity, indicating diffuse intrinsic medical renal disease.
