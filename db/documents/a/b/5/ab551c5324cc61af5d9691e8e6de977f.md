Evaluation of bilirubinuria is performed using a standard urinalysis. In the urine, a chemical strip with a diazonium salt that reacts with bilirubin is used to produce a red azo dye, with the saturation corresponding to theÂ bilirubin value. False negatives can be associated with urinary nitrates, acidic urine with a pH below 5.5, antibiotic use, which decreases the intestinal flora, oxidation by vitamin C, (as bilirubin will not react with the diazonium salts). False positives can be associated with highly colored substances that can mask the results such as phenazopyridine, indicans, chlorpromazine, or etodolac metabolites which cause reddish discoloration of urine. There is no definitive approach for bilirubinuria, A suggested algorithm approach to positive urine bilirubin can be summarized in the diagram below in figure 1.
