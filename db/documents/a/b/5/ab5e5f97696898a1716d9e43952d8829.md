MZL represents about 10%Â to 15% of all non-Hodgkin Lymphomas, of which EMZLs comprise about two-thirds of cases in the western world. The stomach is the most common site, followed by ocular adnexa, lung, and salivary glands. It is usually seen in adults with the median age of diagnosis greater than 60 years.

In the United States, EMZLs comprise 5 to 10 percent of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma and comprise up to half of the lymphomas in organs such as the stomach, ocular adnexa, and lung.

Gender disparities are seen by the site of involvement, where men have common involvement of the stomach, small intestine, and skin, and women have involvement of the salivary gland, soft tissue, and thyroid gland.
