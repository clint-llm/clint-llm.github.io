When it comes to weight loss, therapy can be divided into either surgical or conservative treatment. The latter refers to behavioral modification in the form of increased physical activity and alterations in diet. While this usually leads to an average of 10% short-term weight loss, it is difficult for patients to maintain. Surgical weight loss has been defined as the most effective and long-lasting form of weight reduction.

**Adjustable Gastric Band (AGB)**

The adjustable gastric band is typically performed laparoscopically and is a restrictive procedure, meaning that weight loss is induced by reducing the amount of food that can be taken in at one time.

**Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG)**

Another bariatric surgery that falls into the restrictive category is sleeve gastrectomy.

**Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB)**

Combining both restrictive and malabsorptive aspects of weight loss surgery, RYGB is another common bariatric surgery. It involves the (laparoscopic) creation of a 20-30mL gastric pouch using the cardia of the stomach, separating it from the remaining stomach, pylorus, and proximal small bowel.

**Biliopancreatic Diversion (BPD)/ Duodenal Switch (DS)**

BPD and DS are less commonly performed bariatric surgeries that are a combination of restrictive and malabsorptive. These result in the greatest weight loss but also have the greatest postop mortality rate of 1.1%.

**Post-Operative Care following Bariatric Surgery**

The trend for bariatric surgeries has been to perform them laparoscopically as it is associated with decreased hospital length of stay, wound complications, and post-op pain in addition to improved surgical cosmesis. Furthermore, laparoscopic surgery reduces the risk of post-op venous thromboembolism (VTE) which has been identified as a frequent cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality. With that being said, all patients are placed on an aggressive VTE prevention regimen following surgical intervention. Early ambulation (within 4-6hours post-surgery), sequential compression devices (SCD’s), and pre- and post-op low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin are essential.

As far as oral intake is concerned, patients are typically started on a bariatric clear liquid diet within the first 24 hours post-op as long as they are tolerating water and there are no clinical signs of staple line or anastomotic leak.

**Nutritional Consequences of Bariatric Surgery**

As patients continue to thrive at home following surgery, their diet is advanced to solids with a goal of approximately 1200 calories and 60-120 grams of protein per day. While protein malnutrition is rare following bariatric surgery (with the exception of BPD/DS), many patients do experience intolerance to protein-dense foods and should be monitored for such. Vitamin supplementation is also recommended upon discharge and patients are often provided multivitamin regimens including additional iron, calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B with routine monitoring and further customization of supplements based on patient’s labs and clinical status.

As mentioned previously, the vitamin deficiencies seen after weight loss surgery include iron (33% to 55% of patients) calcium and vitamin D (24% to 60%), vitamin B12 (24% to 70%), and thiamine (less than 5%). Following RYGB, the most frequent nutritional deficiency is iron and B12 depletion which is seen in up to 60% and 70% of patients respectively. Iron deficiency is due to the duodenum and proximal jejunum being bypassed as they both serve as iron absorption sites. As for B12, it is typically absorbed within the terminal ileum after binding with intrinsic factor (IF), a substance secreted by the parietal cells of the gastric antrum. resecting the gastric antrum during RYGB, there is delayed mixing of IF and B12 resulting in poor absorption at the terminal ileum and deficiency.

Anatomically, restrictive procedures, such as SG, can put patients at higher risk for dehydration due to early satiety. As such, patients are instructed to take sips of liquids throughout the day. In regards to malabsorptive procedures, patients may have the unpleasant side effect of increased flatulence, bloating, and loose, foul-smelling stools due to fat and starch malabsorption.

**Anticipated Weight Loss**

Following bariatric surgery, patients can expect to see the largest drop in weight within the first year with the most rapid weight loss occurring within the first three months. It is not uncommon for patients to regain approximately 1/3 of their initial weight loss over the subsequent 2 to 6 years; however, weight typically stabilizes between years 6-15 following surgery.

In general, interventions that involve less GI tract rearrangement (ie restrictive procedures) tend to have less weight reduction; however, these patients also suffer less long-term and perioperative problems. Most weight is shed after BPD/DS which boasts 83% of excess weight lost (EWL) at 3 years.
