Drug-induced valvular heart disease (DIVHD) is a condition involving changes in the morphology and functionality of valvular leaflets secondary to exposure to various types of medications. DIVHD is mainly diagnosed by echocardiographic changes in the population at risk and was first associated with ergot alkaloids in the mid-1960s after echocardiographic changes were found in patients using these types of medications. It has been well documented that these medications produce the proliferation of valvular interstitial cells and subsequent insufficiency of the heart valves by stimulating 5-HT2B receptors. This activity explains when this condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis, articulates how to properly evaluate for this condition, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the drugs that can cause heart disease.
- Describe the pathophysiology of drug-induced heart disease.
- Summarize the treatment for drug-induced heart disease.
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of drug-induced heart disease.
