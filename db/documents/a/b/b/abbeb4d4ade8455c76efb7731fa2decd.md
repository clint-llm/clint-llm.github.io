Ginkgo is one of the most common dietary supplements used in the United States. Healthcare providers often overlook inquiry about the use of herbal medicine. Due to ginkgo's several side effects and extensive interactions with other medications, it is important to educate the healthcare team (nurse practitioner, pharmacist, primary care provider, nursing staff) to incorporate the habit of asking patients about over-the-counter supplements and keep toxicity/interactions of these supplements with patient's other medications as potential causes of patient's presentation in their differentials. Patients should be educated by the team, including the clinician, nurse, and pharmacist about the possible side effects and interactions of ginkgo and encouraged to disclose such information with their healthcare providers. The pharmacist should also review their medication profile and caution if there are any possible interactions, alerting the patient's clinician and/or nurse as well. Such an interprofessional healthcare team approach to ginkgo or any supplement can contribute to optimal patient outcomes if all providers are involved and communicating a consistent message.
