A periodontal abscess is described as a localized accumulation of pus within the gingival wall of a periodontal pocket. More prevalent in patients with previous periodontal pockets,

Two etiologies explain the development of this entity: periodontitis-related and non-periodontitis-related. Abscesses of periodontitis-related origin usually appear as an exacerbation of the untreated periodontal disease or during periodontal treatment. Abscesses of non-periodontitis-related origin frequently develop due to the impaction of foreign objects, such as a piece of dental floss, or abnormalities of the root anatomy.

The treatment of periodontal abscesses includes drainage, mechanical debridement, and mouth rinses, reserving antibiotic therapy for some cases.
