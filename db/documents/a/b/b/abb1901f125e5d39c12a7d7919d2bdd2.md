The nursing staff provides preoperative and postoperative care. They also perform proper dilation of the patient's eye with topical phenylephrine, tropicamide, or cycloplegics such as homatropine 2% or cyclopentolate 1%. If allergy to any topical drop has previously been documented, it must be avoided.

Vital parameters have to be recorded. Pulse, blood pressure, and blood sugarÂ must be monitored. In the case of peribulbar anesthesia, a xylocaine sensitivity test may be done. Asthmatic patients or those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may need nebulization before surgery.

Perioperative use of an oxygen concentrator may be required in such patients. Proper positioning on the operating table, easing the patient's anxiety, and sometimes use of anxiolytics or mild sedatives may be done by the anesthesia team and the nursing staff.
