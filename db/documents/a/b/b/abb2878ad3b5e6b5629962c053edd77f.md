Airway monitors are useful adjuncts to the physical exam and clinical scenario of each patient. Signs and symptoms such as difficulty speaking, leaning forward in a tripod position, drooling, accessory muscle use, increased work of breathing, nasal flaring, tachypnea, declining mental status, cyanosis, or increasing FiO2 demand are all indicators that a patient will require a secured airway via endotracheal intubation.

Limitations to history and physical may occur with obtunded or altered patients, or in the pediatric population. Should a patient be unable to provide a history, other modalities must be used to assess their airway. Vital signs and labs are good adjuncts that may lead a practitioner to believe a patient is impending respiratory failure. An arterial blood gas, while invasive, provides reliable information and can be used toÂ target management. Physical exam findings confirming endotracheal intubation using breath sounds assumes adequate aeration of lung fields but may be misleading in patients with underlying lung pathology. Waveform capnography continues to be the gold standard confirming proper placement of ETT.
