The three main principles of WALANT are pain control with lidocaine, bleeding control with epinephrine, and anxiety control with technique and ambiance (Ilyas, FORE lecture 2018).

Inject the patient while they sit upright to avoid a potential vasovagal response.

- Carpal tunnel release - 10 ml injection 5 mm proximal to wrist crease and 5 mm ulnar to the median nerve, and an additional 10 ml injected deep to the incision site

- Trigger finger - 4 ml injection into subcutaneous tissue just deep to the incision site. Avoid injection into the sheath.

- Finger sensory block - 2 ml injection into the dorsal or volar aspect of proximal phalanx distal to finger-palm crease

- Metacarpal fractures - 40 ml circumferentially around metacarpal

- Dupuytren's contracture - 10 ml injection into palm, 2 ml into proximal phalanx, 2 ml middle phalanx

- ORIF distal radius - 5 ml injection into distal radius fracture. 10 ml into volar or dorsal distal radius. Use a more concentrated 1:40,000 1% lidocaine-epinephrine as it is a procedure that requires more hemostasis.Â For volar plating, inject 5 l into the pronator quadratus. For dorsal plating, inject 5 ml beneath the extensor retinaculum
