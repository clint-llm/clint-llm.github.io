Helicopter-based emergency medical services (HEMS) evolved from rudimentary transportation-only services to advanced, critical-care capable units that offer some of the most advanced pre-hospital care available. HEMS offers many benefits including the ability to expeditiously access rural or remote locations, provide multiple advanced crew configurations, and intervene when ground-based units are not available. However, HEMS utilization must be weighed against the disadvantages of rotor-wing flight including the inherent risk of crashes with subsequent injury or death of the crew or patients.  Other considerations for HEMS use include changes in physiology associated with flight, cost, and expenditure of a limited resource. Given the risks and benefits of HEMS, certain guidelines should be considered to determine the need for HEMS response. Establishing the indications and contraindications for HEMS can greatly reduce the stress on requesting providers during already stressful patient encounters. As always, guidelines should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment on a case-by-case basis.
