Reed-Sternberg cells are the hallmark tumor cells of Hodgkin lymphoma. They represent less than 1% of the tumor tissue, while the majority of cells in the tissue include T cells, B cells, eosinophils, macrophages, and plasma cells

The most well known infectiousÂ disease with the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells is infectious mononucleosis due to infection with EBV. EBV infected B cells acquire the morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics of Reed-Sternberg cells, although the mechanism of this process is still an enigma.
