Meningitis during the neonatal period is a potentially devastating condition with dire long-term consequences. Despite advances in preventive and critical care medicine, bacterial meningitis continues to have an adverse outcome rate of 20 to 60% among its survivors.

The immature immune system of neonates, especially preterm, puts them at high risk for bacterial meningitis. Their exposure during the peripartum period puts them at risk for unique bacterial and viral pathogens. The major pathogens in industrialized countries are group B Streptococcus, gram-negative rods, with Escherichia coli being the most common, and Listeria monocytogenes.
