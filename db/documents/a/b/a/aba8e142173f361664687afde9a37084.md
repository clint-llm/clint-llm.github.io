Warthin tumor is a relatively frequent and benign neoplasm of the major salivary glands. It is histologically characterized by a dense lymphoid stroma and a double layer of oncocytic epithelium with a papillary and cystic architectural pattern. Its etiology remains uncertain. This activity reviews the epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, evaluation, and treatment of Warthin tumor and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in assessing and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Warthin tumor.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of Warthin tumor.
- Outline the treatment modalities available for Warthin tumor.
- Describe the strategies for the interprofessional team necessary for the successful management of Warthin tumors.
