Transcranial Doppler is a technique that can be used in various ways for various indications. An important part of this is the technologist performing the exam. They are critical to deriving the benefit from this exam because if it is not performed properly and to the highest standard, patient outcomes will not be optimal. Clear and open communication between the technologist and the physician is also paramount for clear, precise, and effective results. To further improve patient outcomes, the technologist must understand critical results so the physician can be notified promptly and minimize delay in care.
