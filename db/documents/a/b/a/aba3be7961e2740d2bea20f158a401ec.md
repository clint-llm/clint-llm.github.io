In 71% of untreated cases, BP resolves completely without treatment. Treatment with corticosteroids has been found to increase the likelihood of improved nerve recovery. Â Recurrence does occur, and one study found a recurrence rate of 12%.

Risk factors associated with poor outcomes include 1) complete paralysis 2) age more than 60 and 3) decreased salivation or taste on the ipsilateral side. The longer the recovery, the more likely that residual sequelae may develop.

A recurrence rate of 5-15% has been reported.
