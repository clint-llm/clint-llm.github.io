There is no consensus in the literature whether an alteration of the tone of QL may be the primary cause of back pain.

It is likely that since the twelfth thoracic, ilioinguinal, and iliohypogastric nerves pass and give branches to the QL, the possibility exists that in cases of inflammation of the nervous tissue due to a limited excursion (entrapment), these tissues can produce a syndrome that mimics low-back pain.

Trigger points can involve the QL. This condition could also mimic a painful syndrome of the lumbar area.

Another cause of low back pain, combined with the anatomical presence of QL, is the emergence of a heterotopic ossification or myositis ossificans.

One mustÂ consider that it is difficult for a single muscle to cause pain, except with direct trauma. All the muscles interconnect as a function of the fascial system, and in a contractile area with altered function, it will lead to functional difficulty in all the surrounding muscular regions.
