Patients will have features of acute hepatic decompensation. Also common are prolonged INR greater than or equal to 1.5, often elevated bilirubin and aminotransferases, thrombocytopenia with anemia, hypoglycemia, elevated ammonia, features of acute renal injury (with elevated serum creatinine), and abnormal electrolytes (hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia).

Any imaging to support the clinical examination findings and ascertain infection or any organ involvement or organ failure may be required. Imaging of the brain, chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be considered. Abdominal imaging to determine the presence of features of portal hypertension, hepatocellular carcinoma, vascular thrombosis, lymph nodes, and spleen is vital. Abdominal sonogram with Doppler could be considered in patients with concomitant renal injury and vascular thrombosis. Brain imaging (CT or MRI) is helpful to rule out organic etiology of altered mental status, while chest imaging will help rule out pulmonary edema or pneumonia.

Grading ACLF helps clinicians assess the prognosis, the usefulness of which has been validated in various studies. ACLF is stratified into 3 grades based on its severity:

Grade-1 ACLF is defined as:

- Single renal failure

- Single liver, coagulation, circulatory, or lung failure that is associated with a serum creatinine level of 1.5 to 1.9 mg/dL and/or hepatic encephalopathy grade 1 or grade 2

- A single brain failure with a serum creatinine level of 1.5 to 1.9 mg/dl

Grade-2 ACLF is diagnosed when there are 2 organ failures of any combination.

Grade-3 ACLF is diagnosed when there are three or more organ failures of any combination.
