# Continuing Education Activity

Erythema ab igne is a rash characterized by a reticulated pattern of erythema and hyperpigmentation. It is caused by repeated exposure to direct heat or infrared radiation, often from occupational exposure or the use of heating pads. While the rash is most often benign, its presence can indicate chronic inflammation or, less commonly, systemic illness and should prompt further investigation. Furthermore, careful inspection of the rash may yield evidence of pre-malignant transformation and should prompt referral for biopsy. This activity explains when this condition should be considered, articulates how to properly evaluate for this condition, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of erythema ab igne.
- Describe the presentation of erythema ab igne.
- Summarize the treatment of erythema ab igne.
- Explain the role of the interprofessional team in collaborating to optimize evaluation, management, and care of patients with erythema ab igne.

# Introduction

Erythema ab igne (EAI) is a cutaneous rash related to chronic long-term heat exposure under the level of heat required for thermal burns.

There are many reports of exposure to a variety of other electronics; however, the main uniting feature is that they all imply chronic exposure to a heat source, including virtual headsets and space heaters, which has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Patients will often report a history of some external source of contact, which will lead to vasodilation that is reticulated, which corresponds to the venous plexus pattern of the disease process.

Finally, the use of space heaters will often appear on the anterior legs.

# Etiology

The rash is nearly always associated with an external heating source, which is why it is classified as a chronic environmental dermatosis.

Although the direct cause of erythema ab igne is external heat exposure, the cause of rashes in unique areas may be more descriptive. For instance, some people have EAI in areas of direct heat exposure from space heaters or heating pads, such as on the anterior legs or the lower back.

# Epidemiology

Historically, erythema ab igne affects women more often than men and has been reported to be in a 10:1 distribution; however, this is likely older data representing older causes of EAI, such as coal fires and other household issues exposures that women may have had more exposure to traditionally. Newer data suggests still that women are about twice as likely to have erythema ab igne, and it is more likely to appear on the anterior legs.

Although it can appear at any age, a previous study noted that the average age was 28.6 +/- 10.4 years.

# Pathophysiology

Erythema ab igne occurs from repeated exposure to direct heat or infrared radiation, usually developing over the course of weeks to years at temperatures that are insufficient to cause significant thermal burns.

The deposition of hemosiderin and melanin may be a reaction pattern from blood vessels, where some capillaries have shown endothelial cell changes.

# Histopathology

Changes in the skin at the microscopic level typically occur from cumulative and prolonged exposure to infrared radiation. Initial changes may show epidermal atrophy, vasodilation, and deposition of hemosiderin/melanin in the dermal layer. The presence of melanin may be related to melanocyte activation. Additionally, there may be dermal capillaries with enlarged endothelial cells. Later changes may also show focal hyperkeratosis or dyskeratosis with squamous atypia, which may be consistent with changes seen in actinic keratosis or other pre-malignant lesions.

# History and Physical

Patients may seek medical care for this dermatosis, but it often occurs as an incidental finding on a physical exam. Patients are usually asymptomatic, but some may complain that the affected area burns, itches, or stings.

Historical findings should focus on contact with any heat source in the area of the rash. On physical exam, the skin will initially present as easily-blanching macular erythema broadly in one area. This will ultimately evolve into the classic reticulated (net-like) dusky hyperpigmentation that is non-blanching.

# Evaluation

Erythema ab igne is mostly a clinical diagnosis that raises suspicion, given the relevant history and characteristic skin manifestations. Long-standing disease in the presence of ulcerations, hyperkeratosis, or bullae should prompt further evaluation by a dermatologist, as this finding can be associated with the malignant transformation of squamous cell carcinoma.

In ambiguous cases, a biopsy should be considered, particularly as this may mimic or mask underlying skin cancer, such as basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma; it may even mask cutaneous metastases of internal malignancy, like colonic adenocarcinoma.

# Treatment / Management

The primary treatment of this disease entity is the removal of the offending heat source.

If epidermal atypia is suspected, regular skin examinations are recommended, particularly as EAI may be associated with squamous atypia and malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma.

# Differential Diagnosis

Erythema ab igne should be a consideration in the differential diagnosis for dyspigmented reticular dermatoses.

- Livedo reticularis

- Livedoid vasculitis

- Poikiloderma atrophicans vascular

- Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma

- Dermatomyositis

- Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita

- Genodermatoses

- Angiosarcoma

- Vasculitis

- Bullous disease

A key feature that can distinguish erythema ab igne from other reticular rashes is its presentation in the setting of chronic heat exposure, as livedo reticularis and cutis marmorata are often present with exposure to cold and other rashes present without a history of heat exposure altogether.

# Prognosis

Erythema ab igne holds a favorable prognosis by removing the offending heat source, and repeated exposures are limited. If prolonged exposure continues, there is a risk of permanent dyschromia of the skin and the potential for transformation into pre-malignant or malignant skin lesions

# Complications

Complications are rare; however, malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in the literature, with signs of hyperkeratosis or ulceration occurring as secondary, premalignant changes.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patient education on heat as a cause of this disease is essential for the treatment and to prevent a recurrence. Patients diagnosed with this disease due to occupational exposure need specific guidance on how to prevent exposure and optimize outcomes. In patients with chronic pain, alternative therapies for pain relief should be advised to avoid repetitive exposures.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

An interprofessional team approach to erythema ab igne that includes clinicians, specialists (particularly dermatologists), and nursing staff is recommended. Erythema ab igne is a preventable skin dermatosis, and the importance of patient education is critical in preventing disease progression. Most of these patients will present to the primary care provider or nurse practitioner. Nurses can counsel the patient on preventative measures and coordinate with pharmacy consult in those instances where medication is necessary. Accurate record-keeping by all interprofessional care team members will ensure that everyone on the case has the same accurate patient data; this is another aspect of communication between team members. The interprofessional approach will yield the best results with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]

Heating pads and water bottles are commonly used to manage chronic pain and can potentially lead to the development of erythema ab igne. Clinicians should be aware of the presentation of erythema ab igne and other mimicking conditions such as livedo reticularis, cutis marmorata, and physical abuse. Providers should be aware of the risks for malignant transformation in areas of repeated heat exposure. Furthermore, a careful history should be obtained to rule out other systemic symptoms that could be indicative of other more serious pathologies causing the patient’s chronic pain. Long-standing erythema ab igne in the presence of other secondary changes such as ulceration or hyperkeratosis should prompt a dermatologist referral for biopsy and further management.
