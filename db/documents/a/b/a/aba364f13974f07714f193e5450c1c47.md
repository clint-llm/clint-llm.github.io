Management varies with the age, severity, and functional status of patients:

- Mild disease: subtle restriction, avoid contact sports, treated for any fractures

- Moderate to Severe disease: rehabilitation and orthopedic interventions, management of acute fractures and scoliosis

- Severe disease: an intramedullary rod with osteotomy used to correct severe bowing of long bones

**Medical Management**

Medical management can take a number of forms, as listed below.

- Sex hormones, sodium fluoride, calcium, calcitonin, magnesium oxide, and vitamins C and D - attempted in the past with no or mixed results

- Bisphosphonates (intravenous pamidronate, oral alendronate) have been demonstrated to be useful (decrease fracture risk, improve bone mineral density as well as ambulatory status) through their ability to reduce the osteoclastic resorption of bone in children with OI

- Gene therapy and cell transplantation (to correct defective COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes) are still not widely available, but experimental studies in animals showed promising results

- Sclerostin antibody medication (romosozumab) has been used in animal models with beneficial effects on the skeleton, but there are no human studies reported yet

- Denosumab has been proven to help with bone quality in small-scale studies, but it is not yet approved for wide use in OI patients; ongoing studies are looking into more details of this treatment

- Anabolic bone therapy with teriparatide was also tried in a small study and showed an increase in the bone density of the OI-treated patients compared to the placebo group, but this medication is also not officially approved for use in this population

- An antibody to transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) is one of the latest medical treatments studied in animal models with OI, and it has also offered some promising results

**Orthopedic Management**

The goals focus on ways to ameliorate patient functional status, prevent deformity and disability, correct deformities, and monitor for complications.

1. Orthotic treatment: orthosis, walking aids, wheelchairs

2. Management of long bone fractures

3. Management of long bone deformities includes:

- In infants and children:  

- Closed osteoclasis without intramedullary fixation
- Closed osteoclasis with percutaneous intramedullary fixation
- Open osteotomy with internal fixation (Sofield and Millar procedure) - Rush nail, Williams rod

- In young adult patients:

- External fixation with circular or uniplanar constructs with osteotomy.

4. Prophylactic intramedullary rod for children who repeatedly fracture their long bones. Different types of rods according to bone size and skeletal maturity are used:

- Osteotomy and fixation with telescoping rod (Bailey-Dubow rod, Sheffield rod, Fassier-Duval rod)

- Osteotomy and fixation with a non-telescoping rod (Kirschner wire, Steinmann pin, Williams rod, push rod, other fixed-length rods)

5. Management of spinal deformities: basilar invagination, kyphoscoliosis, spinal fractures
