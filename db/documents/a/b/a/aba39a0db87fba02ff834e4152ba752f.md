Renal leiomyosarcoma (LMS) carries a poor prognosis with a median overall survival of 25 months. Among soft-tissue sarcomas, the stage is the most important prognostic factor. Other factors include histological subtype, grade, age of the patient, and gender.Â The rate of local recurrence and the risk of metastasis is determined by the grade of tumor and inferior vena cava extension.
