Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are the most common congenital cardiac anomaly in children and the second most common congenital abnormality in adults, second only to bicuspid aortic valves. The main mechanism of hemodynamic compromise in ventricular septal defects occurs due to abnormal communication between the right and left ventricles and shunt formation. This activity reviews the presentation and pathophysiology of ventricular septal defects and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with congenital heart defects.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of ventricular septal defects.
- Review the presentation of ventricular septal defects.
- Outline the treatment options for ventricular septal defects.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with a ventricular septal defect.
