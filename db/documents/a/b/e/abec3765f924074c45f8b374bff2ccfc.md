Aortic valve replacement is one of the most commonly performed procedures in patients with aortic stenosis. Mechanical aortic valves are the most durable and last long-term, thus reducing the need for re-operation. The mechanical aortic valve requires life-long anticoagulation. Initially, frequent follow-up with a cardiologist to adjust the INR is required, followed by interval follow-up to assess complications. To prevent thrombus formation, the INR should be maintained between 2Â and 3. Patients with atrial fibrillation may need a higher INR. The ideal test to assess the function of a mechanical valve is an echocardiogram. Blood work usually reveals anemia in patients with mechanical aortic valves.
