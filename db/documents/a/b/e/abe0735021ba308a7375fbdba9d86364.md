A thorough evaluation of a patient with bulimia nervosa should include the following:

- A comprehensive metabolic panel, including electrolytes, liver function tests, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and calcium.

- Complete blood count with differential. Consider obtaining a vitamin B12 level.

- Urinalysis.

- If severe, also obtain serum magnesium and phosphorous as well as the electrocardiogram.

- Female patients should undergo a pregnancy test. Female patients with secondary amenorrhea should have testing for luteinizing hormone, prolactin, beta-HCG, and a follicle-stimulating hormone to assess for other potential contributors to amenorrhea.

- Lab tests are available to test for stool or urine bisacodyl, emodin, aloe-emodin, and rhein. However, a positive test for a stool or urine laxative is not necessary to establish the diagnosis.

Laboratory abnormalities associated with bulimia nervosa include hypokalemia (including hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis), hyponatremia, and transaminitis.
