Lactic acid is produced in physiologically normal processes, and as a common finding in disease states. When increased production is comorbid with decreased clearance, the severity of the clinical course escalates. Importantly, the effects of severely elevated levels of lactic acid can have profound hemodynamic consequences and can lead to death. Serum lactate levels can be both a marker for risk as well as a therapeutic target. The higher the level and the longer the time to normalization of elevated serum lactate, the greater the risk of death. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of lactic acidosis, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiologies of lactic acidosis.
- Outline the presentation of lactic acidosis and the examination findings that can confirm its diagnosis, including necessary lab work.
- Summarize the available treatment and management strategies for lactic acidosis.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by lactic acidosis.
