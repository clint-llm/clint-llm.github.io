Per the manufacturer's label, active pathological bleeding and severe hypersensitivity reaction to apixaban, for example, an anaphylactic reaction, are the contraindications to using apixaban.

**Box Warning**

Premature discontinuation of oral anticoagulant medicines, including apixaban, can increase the risk of thrombotic adverse events and spinal/epidural hematoma. Clinicians should monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. Urgent treatment is necessary if neurological compromise is noted.
