Patients with reversible causes of coma, such as hypoglycemia, may be discharged after the appropriate intervention and with consideration of a safe home environment. Patients with persistent coma need hospital admission with ongoing monitoring, supportive care, and targeted care to the underlying cause of coma. The etiology of the coma determines the admission service.

Patients with traumatic coma will need monitoring, interventions as needed for mass lesions, and supportive care to prevent secondary injury. Prognosis is difficult and may become clear only after a period of observation. Outcomes of patients with post-cardiac arrest coma have improved significantly with the advent of therapeutic hypothermia. With the use of therapeutic hypothermia ability to judge outcomes must be delayed for several days. The prognosis of patients presenting with non-traumatic coma depends largely on both the etiology of coma and the level of consciousness on admission. One single-center study of patients with non-traumatic coma found a hospital mortality rate of 26.5% and accumulated two-year mortality of 43%. Mortality from poisonings was less than 15% while mortality from malignancy-related presentations was almost 90%. They found that a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 3-6 at presentation was associated with a higher hospital mortality rate than a GCS of 7-10.
