Doxorubicin is a frequently used chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of many solid tumors and requires the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team to be effective. While the drug is effective, it does have one serious adverse effect. This team includes primary care clinicians who refer patients to the oncologist who will need to perform a cardiac screen test on patients with risk factors for heart disease. The oncology specialty nurses will assist in all aspects of care, work with the patient on regimen compliance, and answer questions. Pharmacists can also weigh in with dosing, medication reconciliation, and patient counseling. The reason is that doxorubicin can cause irreversible cardiomyopathy what may occur at any time after treatment. With this interprofessional approach, patients stand the best chance at a positive outcome while avoiding potential adverse effects. [Level 5]

Baseline (pre-treatment) and regular monitoring of cardiac function through echocardiography or multi-gated radionuclide angiography (MUGA scan) are recommended for patients undergoing treatment with doxorubicin. The prescribing clinician would do well to include an oncology board-certified pharmacist Patients who exhibit a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction during doxorubicin treatment should have the drug discontinued. Oncology nurses can also be beneficial in verifying therapy effectiveness and watching for adverse events. Since higher cumulative doxorubicin doses are a risk factor for the development of cardiomyopathy, dose limitation is advocated to reduce cardiotoxicity.
