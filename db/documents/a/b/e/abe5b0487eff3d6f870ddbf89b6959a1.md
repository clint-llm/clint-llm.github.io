Latanoprost is one of the prostaglandin analogs, considered the first-line management of open-angle glaucoma. Multiple randomized control trials have proven its efficacy in lowering IOP in primary open-angle glaucoma,Â which is similar to travoprost, and bimatoprost, but the tolerability of latanoprost may be better (Level I).

An interprofessional team approach is needed to provide comprehensive and collaborative care for the patient. The ophthalmology-trained nurse and the pharmacist play a crucial role in assisting the clinician in achieving this goal. The nurse can assist the clinician in educating the patient about the indication and expected outcomes of latanoprost therapy and the need for following up on IOP testing. The pharmacist can help the team by educating the patient about proper dosing, administration, storage, and adverse effects of the drug to ensure its efficacy. Collaboration and communication across these disciplines in an interprofessional team approach can achieve the best outcomes with latanoprost therapy. [Level V]
