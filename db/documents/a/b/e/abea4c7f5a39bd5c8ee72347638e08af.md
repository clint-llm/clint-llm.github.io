Following are the sclerosing agents that can be used as chemicals for chemical pleurodesis:

- Talc

- Tetracyclines (minocycline, doxycycline)

- Silver nitrate

- Iodopovidone

- Bleomycin

- Corynebacterium parvum with parenteral methylprednisolone acetate

- Erythromycin

- Fluorouracil

- Interferon beta

- Autologous blood

- Mitomycin C

- Cisplatin

- Cytarabine

- Doxorubicin

- Etoposide

- Bevacizumab (intravenous or intrapleural)

- Streptococcus pyogenes A3 (OK-432)

The choice among these agents is determined by several factors, including local expertise, availability of individual agents, and the underlying process for which chemical pleurodesis is needed. The sclerosing agent is delivered via a chest tube, which varies from large bore (e.g., 24 French) or a small bore (e. g. 12 French) into the pleural cavity. The other equipment required for pleurodesis besides sclerosing agent include:

- A patent intercostal drain with three-way stopper attached

- 25ml of 1% lignocaine injection

- Sterile gloves

- 50ml of sterile saline

- 50 and 20 ml syringes

- Premedication with some analgesic other than NSAIDs
