Managing holiday heart syndrome requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that includes a nurse, laboratory technologist, pharmacist, and a number of physicians in different specialties, including psychiatry and cardiology. Without proper management, the morbidity and mortality from holiday heart syndrome are high. The moment the triage nurse has admitted  a patient with an arrhythmia and excessive alcohol use, the emergency department clinician is responsible for coordinating the care, which includes the following:

- Ordering alcohol levels in blood and urine, or other metabolites

- Monitor the patient for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression, suicidal ideations, signs and symptoms of heart failure, and alcohol withdrawal

- Monitor and replete thiamine before giving glucose in patients with alcohol use disorder to avoid neurologic deficits

- Consult with the pharmacist about the initiation of CIWA protocol in at-risk individuals

- Consult with a pharmacist about starting a benzodiazepine if a tremor or seizure history is present

- Consult with a nutritionist if the patient appears malnourished

- Consult with a toxicologist and nephrologist on further management, which may include dialysis

- Consult with the cardiologist regarding arrhythmia management

- Consult with the intensivist about ICU care and monitoring while in the hospital

- Review medication reconciliation, as many drugs interact with alcohol

The management of holiday heart syndrome does not stop in the emergency department. Once the patient is stabilized, one has to determine how and why the patient ingested large amounts of alcohol. Consult with a mental health counselor if this was intentional and assess risk factors for self-harm. [Level 1] Further, the possibility of addiction and withdrawal symptoms is a consideration. Only by working as an interprofessional team can the morbidity of alcohol ingestion be decreased. [Level 5]
