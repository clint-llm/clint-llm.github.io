The oculomotor nerve (the third cranial nerve; CN III) has three main motor functions:

- Innervation to the pupil and lens (autonomic, parasympathetic)

- Innervation to the upper eyelid (somatic)

- Innervation of the eye muscles that allow for visual tracking and gaze fixation (somatic)

Like all other nerve fibers in the human body, the oculomotor nerve can become impaired in disease states which can lead to lifelong impairment in normal vision. Dysfunction can also be indicative of more serious underlying diseases, such as an aneurysm or a neoplasm.
