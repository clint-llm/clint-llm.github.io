Explosions are unique in their ability to inflict acute injuries on many people at the same time, resulting in high levels of mortality and morbidity. The type and severity of the impact depends on many factors though the principle mechanism driving the extent of injuries is the amount of kinetic energy released over a short period of time. Other factors involved include when and where the event took place, the number of people in the area, the material in the area, whether the explosion was nuclear, mechanical, or chemical, how far the victim was from the explosion, and what protection was available, if any. This activity describes the evaluation and management of victims of explosions and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the principle mechanism driving the extent of blast injuries.
- Describe the pathophysiology of blast injuries.
- Discuss the history and physical that is conducted with a blast injury.
- Describe the evaluation and management of victims of explosions and the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.
