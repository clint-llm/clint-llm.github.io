Most cases of idiopathic cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis are mild and resolve with supportive measures such as leg elevation, rest, compression stockings, and antihistamines. In more chronic or resistant cases, a 4-6 week tapering dose of corticosteroids can be used.  Rarely, immunosuppressive steroid-sparing agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, dapsone, cyclophosphamide, and intravenous immunoglobulin may be needed.

If an offending drug has been identified, withdrawal of the drug is crucial in the resolution of the vasculitis.  In cases of leukocytoclastic vasculitis associated with an infection, treatment of the infection usually results in the resolution of the vasculitis. Similarly, malignancy-associated leukocytoclastic vasculitis improves with treatment of the malignancy.  When leukocytoclastic vasculitis is associated with an underlying connective tissue disease or an autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis, better control of the underlying disease by an escalation of the immunosuppressive therapy may be needed to treat the leukocytoclastic vasculitis and prevent relapses.  Mild cases of HSP usually do not require corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents, and skin rash and arthralgia usually respond to NSAIDs.  High-dose corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents may be indicated in cases of severe renal involvement or systemic involvement.
