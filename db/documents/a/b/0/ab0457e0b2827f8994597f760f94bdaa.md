The prognosis of CON depends on the pathophysiology (vascular insufficiency or axonal damage) and the time between presentation and treatment.

The recovery of visual symptoms is usually correlated with the length of time to decompress. The consensus in the literature is that the earlier the decompression, the better the outcome. Complete visual recovery has been seen as early as one week.

It is important to emphasize that prognosis of visual recovery varies given the etiology causing the optic nerve compression. For tumoral etiologies, negative predictive factors for visual improvement are the severity of visual loss, disc atrophy, recurrent tumor resection, an extension to the cavernous sinus, hard consistency of the tumor, absence of arachnoid plane, extensive tumor resection, and longer duration of visual loss. Overall, 60% of patients with tumors will experienceÂ some improvement after optic nerve decompression.
