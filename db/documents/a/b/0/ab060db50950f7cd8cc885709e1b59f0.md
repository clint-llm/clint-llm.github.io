The history will be vital in determining the etiology of the water hammer pulse. For example, alcohol abuse in a patient with the water hammer pulse sign could lead to the diagnosis of cirrhosis. Getting a detailed extracardiac history can help diagnose conditions such as anemia, thyrotoxicosis, fever, pregnancy, cirrhosis, Marfan, rheumatological disorders, and syphilis. A detailed cardiac history, especially regarding congenital heart diseases, will be necessary when suspecting long-term valvular or septal defects.

The fundamental principle of eliciting the water hammer pulse is to elevate the patient's arm above the heart and to palpate the patient's forearm with the examiner's palm. The first step is to place the patient in a supine position at a slight recline. With the examiner’s hand wrapped around the patient’s wrist, the radial pulse is palpated. The patient’s arm is then raised above the patient’s head. The water hammer pulse will feel like a tapping impulse through the patient’s forearm due to the rapid emptying of blood from the arm during diastole, with the help of gravity's effects.
