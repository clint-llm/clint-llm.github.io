The rhomboids are a collective group of muscles formed by the rhomboid major and minor. The rhomboids are important in upper limb movement and stability of both the shoulder girdle and scapula. Both rhomboids receive innervation from the dorsal scapular nerve, andÂ their vascular supply the dorsal scapular artery. Variants in rhomboid musculature have been found but are very rare. While surgeries of the rhomboid musculature are infrequent, winged scapula and rhomboid palsy are clinical pathologies associated with the rhomboids.
