When observed by an electron microscope, Leydig cells are clustered in small numbers forming cords, and they share a thin common basal lamina. Adjacent cells have small canaliculi between them, characterized by rudimentary desmosomes and microvillus processes. Nuclei appear as rounded with clumps of chromatin and prominent nucleoli. The most prominent organelle is the agranular or smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Microscopic examination also reveals many mitochondria, which are elongated and have clear tubular cristae.
