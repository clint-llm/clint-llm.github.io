On a biochemical level, blood flow generates the expression of many molecules and proteins in endothelial cells. For example, the passage of blood fluids stimulates the production of a protein (proximal promoter element of 160-bp), which binds to transcription factors such as myocyte enhancer factor 2a and 2c (MEF2a, MEF2c); this path will allow the production of Kr√ºppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), a transcription factor that protects the structure of the vessel and its function. KLF2 promotes the production of many other molecules:

- eNOS or endothelial nitric oxide synthase

- Prostaglandins

- EDN1 or endothelin-1

- Interleukins

- Chemokines
