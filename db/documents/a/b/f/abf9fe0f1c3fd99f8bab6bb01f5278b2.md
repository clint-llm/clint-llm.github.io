Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that classically presents in a deaf child with recurrent syncopal episodes. It is a form of a prolonged QT syndrome that is characterized by a QTc greater than 500 msec and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Cardiovascular complications are managed with beta-blockade (preferably with nadolol) and ICD evaluation. Hearing loss is treated with cochlear implantation. Differential diagnoses of JLNS include Romano-Ward syndrome, Timothy syndrome, Andersen Tawil syndrome, and acquired causes such as electrolyte abnormalities and drugs.
