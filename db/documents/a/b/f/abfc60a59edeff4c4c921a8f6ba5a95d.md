Digoxin is a well-known cardiac glycoside and one of the oldest drugs used today in cardiovascular medicine. It has wide-ranging beneficial effects and continues to play an important role in the contemporary management of appropriately selected patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Although considered safe, digoxin has a narrow therapeutic window, and its proper dosing requires the clinician to be mindful of various patient characteristics including age, gender, kidney function and concomitant use of other drugs to avoid potentially life-threatening toxicity. This activity reviews digitalis toxicity, its pathophysiology, presentation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of digitalis toxicity.
- Discuss the history and physical findings expected in a patient with digitalis toxicity.
- List the treatment and management options available for digitalis toxicity.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care in patients with digitalis toxicity.
