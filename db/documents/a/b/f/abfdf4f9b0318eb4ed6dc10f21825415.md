As the majority of patients are asymptomatic, treatment is usually conservative. Serial transthoracic echocardiography can assess for stability. If a patient remains asymptomatic and the cyst has not enlarged in size, continued surveillance and conservative management generally merit consideration.

If the patient becomes symptomatic or the cyst appears to be enlarging, the patient may become a candidate for surgery, mainly to prevent life-threatening emergencies and compressive effects. In the minority of those patients that become symptomatic, the patient can become a minimally invasive surgical candidate at the surgeon's discretion. These procedures can include percutaneous aspiration (recommended by the European Society of Cardiology) or ablation/ethanol sclerosis.

Recurrence rates of pericardial cyst after aspiration is about 33%. There are no available data regarding the adhesion formation or recurrence after alcohol sclerosis. Otherwise, surgical options include surgical resection of the cyst via thoracotomy, sternotomy, VATS, or mediastinoscopy.
