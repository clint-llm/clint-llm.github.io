Sleep disorders linked to the circadian rhythm are often overlooked and can have detrimental effects on the human body. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders typically manifest as a misalignment between a person’s sleep timeline and the physical/social 24-hour environmental cycle. The 2 more prevalent sleep disorders of circadian rhythms are advanced sleep phase (early onset, common in elders) and delayed sleep phase (later onset, common in adolescents). These 2 diagnoses often get misdiagnosed as insomnia or excessive sleepiness but are distinctly different disorders resulting from disruptions in the synchronization of the sleep/wake cycle. People prone to developing circadian rhythm sleep disorders include individuals who work evening shifts or have irregular shift schedules and the blind. Blind individuals are susceptible to develop these types of disorders because of their body’s inability to perceive light, and therefore, establish circadian rhythms. While blind individuals do have a pathway in the brain that functions as their body clock, roughly half of blind individuals experience non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder, during which their sleep cycles get later every night, jumps around, or results in waking up later in the day.
