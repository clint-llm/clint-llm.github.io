The development of the arteries of the upper limb is in close relation with upper limb development. It initiates towards the end of the fourth week with the activation of mesenchymal cells from the lateral mesoderm. This activation results in the formation of the upper limb buds, formed by a mass of mesenchymal cells covered by ectoderm. This mass of mesenchyme remains undifferentiated until later in development when it is ready to differentiate into bone, cartilage, and blood vessels.

The anterior humeral circumflex artery develops from the branches of the axis artery, that comes from the lateral branch of the seventh intersegmental artery. The axis artery grows at the same rate as the upper limb, and it forms the axillary and brachial arteries from its proximal part.
