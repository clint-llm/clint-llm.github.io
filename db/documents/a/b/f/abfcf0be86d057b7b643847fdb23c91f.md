Lead encephalopathy is an entirely avoidable condition. Educating patients on proper avoidance techniques is key. For children, eliminating lead at home is critical. For adults with occupational exposures, proper education on personal protective equipment and methods to lower exposure are important. In all confirmed cases of lead intoxication, the CDC recommends investigation as to the source of exposure, if possible, in order to limit further exposure.
