Prolactin-secreting tumors of the pituitary gland are called prolactinomas. It is the most common secretory tumor of the pituitary gland accounting for up to 40% of total pituitary adenomas. Prolactinomas cause a wide variety of symptoms, either due to mass effect of the tumor or due to hypersecretion of prolactin. Based on the size of the tumors, prolactinomas can be classified as micro prolactinoma (smaller than 10 mm), macroprolactinoma (larger than 10 mm), or giant prolactinoma (larger than 4 cm). Hyperprolactinemia is not always due to prolactinoma, and other causes like pregnancy, drugs, hypothyroidism, and pituitary stalk effect due to other pituitary tumors should be considered in the differential.
