The cornerstone of treatment for CO poisoning is supplemental oxygen that should be initiated as soon as possible and continued throughout treatment. Patients with significant poisoning demonstrated by transient loss of consciousness, cardiac ischemia, mental status changes, tachycardia, and or hypotension, along with elevated carboxyhemoglobin levels should be treated emergently with hyperbaric oxygen. Although present in every state, only several hundred hyperbaric oxygen centers currently exist in the United States of America. The best outcomes occur when patients receive their first treatment within 6 hours of the poisoning event. Most hyperbaric physicians prescribe 3 treatments in the first 24 hours and then reassess the patient's symptoms and response before continuing daily treatments. Despite hyperbaric therapy, up to 40% of patients can still develop chronic, neurocognitive impairment, and hence, patients should be scheduled for neuropsychological evaluation approximately 1 to 2 months after recovery.

Alternate, more easily accessible, and useful therapies are still lacking. However, case reports and animal model studies are underway. These study therapies such as lung phototherapy.
