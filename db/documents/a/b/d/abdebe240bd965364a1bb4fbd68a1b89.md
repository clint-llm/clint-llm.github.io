Few contraindications exist to the use of aprepitant or fosaprepitant.

- Prior hypersensitivity reactions and the co-administration of pimozide or cisapride are the commonly cited drug reactions of pimozide.Â Pimozide is a CYP3A4 substrate, and inhibition of CYP3A4 by aprepitant can increase plasma levels of pimozide, increasing the risk of QT prolongation.

- Relative contraindications include medications that get metabolized via CYP3A4 metabolism and have narrow therapeutic indexes, as the decreased metabolism of these medications may cause toxicity.
