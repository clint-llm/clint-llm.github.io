Ivabradine is FDA-approved in the United States for use in patients with symptoms due to stable heart failure and an ejection fraction of 35% or less to reduce their risk of hospital admission for worsening heart failure. The management of patients with heart failure is usually by an interprofessional team that includes a cardiologist, intensivist, internist, nephrologist, pulmonologist, family clinician, nursing staff, and pharmacist. Healthcare providers who prescribe ivabradine should monitor the patient's heart rate regularly. The drug can cause bradycardia, and concomitant beta-blocker agents are not recommended.
