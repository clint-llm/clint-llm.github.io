The management of LCH is with an interprofessional team that includes oncology nurses. The key is to make an early diagnosis.Healthcare workers need to be aware that the rash is the most common presentation. In children, the rash may be misdiagnosed as seborrhea or atopic dermatitis but will not respond to typical treatment for these disorders. The rash of LCH ranges from a single lesion to widespread involvement. Characteristics include scaly papules, nodules, or plaques and can resemble seborrheic dermatitis. One may distinguish LCH by the presence of petechiae, bloody crusting, or firmly indurated nodules.

The outcomes of LCH depend on its presentation. Those with disseminated disease will die within 24-48 months. Those with localized disease do have a better prognosis but the quality of life is reduced.
