Scleroderma is a rare connective tissue disorder with unknown and complex pathogenesis. Scleroderma can be divided into two forms, localized scleroderma (morphea, linear scleroderma, and scleroderma en coup de sabre), or Systemic sclerosis, which can further be classified as either limited systemic sclerosis (formerly known as the CREST syndrome comprising of calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) or diffuse systemic sclerosis based on clinical and serological criteria. This activity addresses the presentation, evaluation, and management of systemic sclerosis and examines the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of the affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the presentation of limited scleroderma and systemic sclerosis. 
- Identify the most common cause of death in patients with scleroderma. 
- Summarize the management of limited scleroderma and systemic scleroderma. 
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by systemic sclerosis.
