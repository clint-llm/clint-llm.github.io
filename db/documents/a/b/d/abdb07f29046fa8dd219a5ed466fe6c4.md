Additionally, due to its non-selective inhibition of TTR proteins, it should be noted that inotersen treatment may lead to reduced vitamin A serum levels. As such, patients who are undergoing inotersen treatment should be given vitamin A supplementation in order to maintain adequate vitamin A status. It should also be noted that patients should be cognizant of vitamin A deficiency symptoms such as night blindness so that they may report them to their healthcare provider.
