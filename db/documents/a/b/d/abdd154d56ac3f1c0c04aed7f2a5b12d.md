Pathologically, lobar pneumonia is the acute exudative inflammation of a lung lobe. It has the following four advanced stages if left untreated:

- **Congestion:**In this stage, pulmonary parenchyma is not fully consolidated, and microscopically, the alveoli have serous exudates, pathogens, few neutrophils, and macrophages.

- **Red hepatization:**In this stage, the lobe becomes consolidated, firm, and liver-like. Microscopically, there are fibrin, serous exudate, pathogens, neutrophils, and macrophages. The capillaries are congested, and the alveolar walls are thickened.

- **Gray hepatization:**The lobe is still liver-like in consistency but gray in color due to suppurative and exudate-filled alveoli.

- **Resolution:**After a week, it starts resolving as lymphatic drainage or a productive cough clears the exudate.
