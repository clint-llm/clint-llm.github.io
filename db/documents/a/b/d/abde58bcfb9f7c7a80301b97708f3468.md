Doppler peripheral venous duplex US requires very little preparation. The patient should be positioned in Trendelenburg, prone, or lateral decubitus orientations for optimal visualization of the affected area and patient comfort. Clothing and overlying medical support devices should be removed if safe and with the intent to protect the patient's privacy at all times. The US machine is generally positioned at a comfortable distance from the patient but allows the sonographer to adjust the technique as needed.
