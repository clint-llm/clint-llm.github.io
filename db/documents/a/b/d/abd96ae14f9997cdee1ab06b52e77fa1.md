Abrasions range from a break in the epithelial lining to damage to the deeper structures, including nerves, blood vessels, muscles, tendons,Â organs, and even bone.

Forensic investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of the injury and the antemortem or postmortem nature of the wound. The presence of vital reactions, including hemorrhage, cell infiltration, granulation tissue, etc., are indicative of the antemortem quality of an abrasion.
