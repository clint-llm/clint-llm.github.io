Acetyl-CoA and aspartic acid form NAA. It is believed to be the second most common free amino acid in the brain. It is found in neurons, where mitochondria synthesize it and then transfer it to oligodendrocytes through axo-glial contact zones. These axo-glial contact zones are formed between the innermost oligodendrocyte plasma membrane and the axonal membrane. NAA is converted to N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) within neurons. It is subsequently transported to astrocytes, which hydrolyze it to NAA and glutamate. The NAA is then finally taken up by oligodendrocytes which are the primary location of aspartoacylase.

The aspartoacylase enzyme catalyzes the conversion of NAA to aspartate (aspartic acid) and acetate. Therefore, deficiency of this catalyst leads to accumulation of NAA in the brain. Levels of NAA are markedly increased in the patient's plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. Abnormal myelination and the associated prominent swollen and vacuolated astrocytes are the fundamental hallmarks of aspartoacylase deficiency. These effects justify the name spongiform leukodystrophy. However, the precise mechanism by which accumulated NAA causes the pathogenesis of this spongiform degeneration remains uncertain.
