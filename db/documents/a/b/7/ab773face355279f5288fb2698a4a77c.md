In the last 50 years in the United States, clinicians have seen a rise in diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and coronary artery disease. An estimated 2000 people die of heart disease every day in the United States. Around 30% of US adults are hypertensive.

Although there have been several advancements in the scientific world regarding new medications and cutting-edge diagnostic techniques, the rate of these diseases has multiplied many times. This increase has been steep, particularly in the last 20 years. Due to this trend, major organizations, including the American Heart Association, National Institutes of Health, and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, have all started looking at an integrative approach to managing this growing epidemic. Diagnostic testing and medications are still the mainstays of patient management. However, the importance of diet, exercise, stress reduction, and lifestyle habits cannot be ignored.
