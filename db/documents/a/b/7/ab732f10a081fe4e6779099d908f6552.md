While traumatic facial palsy is typically a straightforward diagnosis to determine from the patient's history, the clinical picture may be clouded in some cases. Viral facial palsy, such as Bell's palsy, zoster sine herpete/Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and COVID-associated facial paralysis may all occur coincidentally with trauma - the first two in particular, which may be more likely to occur in times of physiological stress. In some cases, a cerebrovascular accident may also accompany major trauma, causing facial paralysis in the absence of an actual facial nerve injury.

Facial nerve barotrauma may be challenging to identify as well, especially when it occurs in conjunction with hearing loss and if a history of diving or high-altitude travel is not elucidated. Lastly, when an infant is born with facial weakness, determining the difference between birth trauma and congenital palsy requires a nuanced physical examination. Typically, birth trauma will result in unilateral hemifacial weakness due to either unilateral stretching of the main trunk of the facial nerve or temporal bone trauma. Congenital facial paralysis, in contrast, will generally present with either a unilateral segmental weakness (e.g., congenital unilateral lower lip palsy) or bilateral facial weakness with or without other cranial neuropathies, such as in the case of Möbius syndrome.
