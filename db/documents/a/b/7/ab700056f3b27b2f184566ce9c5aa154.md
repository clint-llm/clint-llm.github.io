Aortic regurgitation is the inadequate closure of the aortic valve during diastole that results in reverse blood flow through the aortic valve. This condition can occur as a native valvular disease or as a result of aortic root dilatation. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of aortic regurgitation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of aortic regurgitation.
- Outline the physical exam findings of aortic regurgitation.
- Explain the treatment options for aortic regurgitation.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication between interprofessional team members in order to optimize outcomes for patients with aortic regurgitation.
