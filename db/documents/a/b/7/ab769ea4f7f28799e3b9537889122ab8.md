Calcium carbonate, chemically CaCO3, is a resonance-stabilized inorganic salt therapeutically used as a food additive, a dietary supplement, an antacid, and a phosphate binder. Calcium carbonate is among the most abundant compounds found in the earth's crust and is commonly found in organic substances, such as egg and oyster shells, crustaceans exoskeletons, and dark leafy greens, such as broccoli and kale.

Calcium carbonate is indicated for low serum calcium conditions, such as osteoporosis, osteomalacia, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, DiGeorge syndrome, kidney dysfunction, pancreatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, Fanconi syndrome, pregnancy, nursing mothers, post-menopausal women, and while using certain medications.

- Rifampin (antibiotic)

- Loop-diuretics

- Anti-seizure medications (phenytoin and phenobarbital)

- Bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate, zoledronic acid, and risedronate)

- Calcitonin

- Chloroquine

- Corticosteroids

- Plicamycin

- Citrate use during apheresis (anticoagulant)

As an antacid, calcium carbonate is indicated for heartburn caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), NSAID upper gastrointestinal mucosal damage, duodenal and gastric ulcers, biliary reflux, stress gastritis exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, bile acid-mediated diarrhea, Non-ulcer dyspepsia, and urinary alkalization.

Calcium carbonate is also indicated for use in treating hyperphosphatemia seen in chronic kidney disease, as a phosphate binder, as a way of treating overdose by causing urinary alkalization, and as a prophylactic treatment in pregnant patients before birth to prevent aspiration pneumonitis.

New research suggests that the indications for calcium carbonate may also include cancer treatment by using calcium supplements to treat colorectal adenomas and using rare-earth-doped calcium carbonate with cerium to kill tumor cells via X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy.
