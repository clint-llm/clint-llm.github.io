Examine the external auditory canals bilaterally using an otoscope to ensure no obstruction, infection, or cerumen impaction is present. Elevate the patient's head to a 30-degree angle; this places the horizontal semilunar canal in a vertical plane, optimizing its stimulation. Place the catch basin beneath the ear being irrigated.

If using electro- or video-oculography, attach the electrodes or place goggles over the eyes. Advise the patient of the procedure and instruct them to perform an “alerting” exercise when the irrigation begins; for example, counting serial sevens out loud, naming animals, or listing words that begin with the same letter.
