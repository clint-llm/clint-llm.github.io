Pectoral implant placement is a procedure that can be associated with many complications, of which one is a poor cosmetic outcome and patient dissatisfaction with the result, which can lead to prolonged patient and surgeon distress, and lead to an increase in healthcare costs. It is, therefore, imperative to identify the risk factors for patient dissatisfaction and perform a thorough assessment of the patient before any surgery. A team approach is an ideal way to limit the complications of this procedure. Prior to surgery, the patient should have the following done:

- Psychological evaluation to ensure reasonable patient expectations and an optimized aesthetic result

- Fully informed consent is necessary when discussing the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure to make an informed decision, and also be made aware of the expected postoperative course and limitations following the procedure.

- Seen by an anesthesiologist to ensure the patient is safe for general anesthesia
