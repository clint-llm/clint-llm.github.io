Clinically, the abdomen is roughly divided into nine regions by two sagittal planes from the midclavicular lines to the mid inguinal lines, and two transverse planes, one at the subcostal line and one at the iliac tubercles. The umbilicus serves at the center of the nine regions. Each region and its associated organs are detailed below:

- Right hypochondrium: liver, gallbladder

- Epigastrium: stomach, liver, pancreas, duodenum, adrenal glands

- Left hypochondrium: spleen, colon, pancreas

- Right lumber region: ascending colon, right kidney

- Umbilical region: navel, small intestine

- Left lumbar legion: descending colon, left kidney

- Right iliac fossa: appendix, cecum

- Hypogastric: Urinary bladder, sigmoid colon, female reproductive

- Left iliac fossa: descending colon, sigmoid colon

Surgically, the portal triad within the hepatoduodenal ligament is of considerable significance and includes the proper hepatic artery, common bile duct, and portal vein. The Pringle maneuver is when pressure is applied to this ligament to control hemorrhage.
