Of utmost importance to correct vertebral column development is proper gene expression and cell signaling that allows each vertebra to take the appropriate shape in the anterior-posterior and cranio-caudal direction. One of these genes, known as Hox, is responsible for the proper orientation of the vertebrae in the cranio-caudal direction.SHH gene is another gene found to play an essential role in anterior-posterior development and ventral neural tube and somite patterning.
