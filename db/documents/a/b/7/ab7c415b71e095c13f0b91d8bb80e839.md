Tuberculosis is a preventable and treatable infectious disease. Having said that, it's still one of the major contributors to morbidity and mortality in developing countries where we are still struggling to provide adequate access to care. Other challenges include lack of awareness, delayed diagnosis, poor accessibility to medication and vaccination as well as medication adherence. DOTS (Direct Observed Therapy) proposed by WHO has been very effective in recent years to improve adherence to the treatment in tuberculosis patients.
