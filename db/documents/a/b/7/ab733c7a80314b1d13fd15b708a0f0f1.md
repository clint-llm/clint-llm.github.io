Cricoarytenoid arthritis (CA) occurs as a systemic manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis.  Symptoms of CA include pharyngeal fullness when swallowing and speaking, hoarseness, and dyspnea. It can be a cause of recurrent upper airway obstruction in rheumatoid arthritis. On endolaryngoscopy, adducted vocals cords are a significant finding. The laryngoscopic findings include myositis of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles, mucosal edema, hyperemia, swelling and inflammation of the interarytenoid mucosa, arytenoids, and aryepiglottic folds and epiglottis, and immobility of the cricoarytenoid joint.

Additionally, arytenoid chondritis develops following trauma to the mucosa of the arytenoid cartilage or due to invasion of bacteria into the cartilage.
