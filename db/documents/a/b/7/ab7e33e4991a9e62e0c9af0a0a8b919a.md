Cutaneous angiosarcoma can initially appear as a “spreading bruise,” or a raised purple-red papule, eventually developing tissue infiltration, edema, tumor fungation, ulceration, and even hemorrhage due to increasing tumor size. The second most common location is in a lymphedematous upper extremity secondary to radical mastectomy, known as the Stewart Treves tumor. Median size lesions range from 3 to 6 cm, while untreated angiosarcomas can grow to 20 cm or larger. Although originally described in patients after a radical mastectomy, this syndrome can occur in the following:

- The setting of congenital or hereditary lymphatic malformations, for example, Turner syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Milroy disease, lymphedema praecox, and lymphedema tarda

- Chronic infections

- Chronic venous stasis

- Morbid obesity

- Malignant obstruction

- Surgical procedures that disrupt the lymphatic flow

Patients most commonly present complaining of pain or discomfort. The range of time for the progression of chronic lymphedema to develop angiosarcoma is between 4 to more than 50 years.
