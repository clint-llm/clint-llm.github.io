The differential diagnosis of CMTC includes physiological cutis marmorata, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, Sturge-Weber syndrome, Adams-Oliver syndrome, Bockenheimer disease, and reticular hemangioma syndrome, among other disorders with a similar cutaneous presentation.

Bodenheimer disease (diffuse phlebectasia) presents with diffuse large and painful venous ectasias, usually affecting one limb in contrast to CMTC. This disorder usually has an onset at childhood with gradual progression.
