# Continuing Education Activity

Spasticity, which is sometimes referred to as tightness or stiffness, is a motor disorder marked by a velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone or tonic stretch reflexes associated with hypertonia. The presentation of spasticity is variable. In some cases, manifestations are subtle, and in others, muscle tone is increased to the point that joints become immobilized. This activity describes the evaluation and management of spasticity and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiologic basis of spasticity.

- Identify the causes of spasticity. 
- Explain treatment considerations for spasticity. 
- Describe how enhanced coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid recognition of spasticity and subsequently improve its evaluation, enhancing detection of pathology and allowing for treatment when indicated.

# Introduction

Spasticity is a motor disorder marked by a velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone or tonic stretch reflexes associated with hypertonia.

Colloquially, it is often referred to as “tightness” or “stiffness.”  Spasticity can present variably in a clinical setting, sometimes with a subtle neurological manifestation and, other times, with severely increased muscle tone leading to immobility of joints.

# Etiology

Spasticity is considered to be a positive sign of the upper motor neuron syndrome (UMNS), which refers to motor behaviors resulting from lesions proximal to the alpha motor neuron, therefore within the spinal cord or brain. Other positive features of UMNS include exaggerated muscle stretch reflexes and up-going plantar reflexes. Negative features include motor weakness, slowed movement, loss of dexterity, or selective motor control. A UMN injury leads to loss of inhibition downstream and hypersensitivity of the reflex arc within the spinal cord.

# Epidemiology

Of the diseases mentioned, spasticity affects approximately 35% of those with stroke, more than 90% with CP, about 50% of TBI patients, 40% of SCI patients, and between 37% and 78% of MS patients.

# History and Physical

A patient may present with new-onset spasticity after suffering from a stroke, SCI, or TBI. On the other hand, they may have been diagnosed with MS years ago or have had CP since infancy and present with new or worsening of pre-existing spasticity. On physical exam, hallmark findings include high muscle tone in muscle groups such as the shoulder adductors; elbow, wrist, and finger flexors; and forearm pronators.

Spasticity is frequently graded using the modified Ashworth scale, which is graded 0 to 4.

**Ashworth Scale**

- Zero is defined as no increase in tone.

- 1 is a “catch and release,” or minimal resistance towards end-of-range of motion (ROM).

- 1+ is similar to a grade of 1, but with a catch that is followed by resistance through less than half of ROM.

- 2 is increased muscle tone through the majority of ROM while still able to move the affected part.

- 3 is difficult passive movement throughout the majority of ROM.

- 4 presents with the affected part in rigid flexion or extension.

**Tardieu Scale**

- Velocity to stretch is graded from V1 (as slow as possible) to V3 (as fast as possible).

- Muscle reaction is graded from 0 (no resistance through passive movement) to 5 (joint being immobile).

- The spasticity angle is graded as R1 (angle of catch at velocity V2 or 3) or R2 (full range of motion when the muscle is at rest and tested at V1 velocity).

**Penn Spasm Frequency Scale**

- 0 is no spasms.

- 1 is no spontaneous spasms; only elicited through vigorous sensory and motor stimulation.

- 2 is occasional spontaneous spasms and easily induced spasms, occurring less than once per hour.

- 3 is spasms occurring between 1 and 10 times per hour.

- 4 is more than 10 spasms per hour.

# Evaluation

Clinicians may be presented with a patient who has (1) new-onset spasticity as an initial symptom of an underlying neurological illness or (2) as existing spasticity that has worsened as a result of the progression of the known chronic neurologic condition or an aggravating factor. When evaluating a patient with new spasticity, the clinician must obtain a history and progression of the symptoms, including any motor weakness, altered sensation, pain, bladder and/or bowel dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction. Additionally, a complete history should include family history, travel history, diet, and any compromised immunity. The physical exam should include a neurological evaluation of muscle tone, motor power, reflexes, and sensation.

For a patient with worsening of chronic spasticity, which is often a more common reason for consultation than new onset spasticity, a clinician must evaluate for any triggers, disease progression, and the possibility of a new disease. Triggers may include skin, visceral, drug-related, or device-related issues. Skin issues may present as ulcers, ingrown toenails, boils, and infections. Visceral issues include constipation, urinary tract infections, or calculi. Rapid withdrawal of antispasmodic agents can lead to worsening spasticity. Lastly, poor seating, an ill-fitting orthotic, or failure of an intrathecal baclofen pump can all be device-related triggers. Spasticity also can be worsened by other noxious stimuli such as infections, injuries, deep vein thromboses (DVT), or stress.

# Treatment / Management

When considering treatment for spasticity, the clinician must take into account the etiology of the spasticity, the timing of onset, medical comorbidities, the patient’s support system, and the overall goals of management. As with other conditions, treatment options follow a stepwise approach, starting with more conservative routes and extending to more invasive surgical procedures. One of the initial treatment approaches involves identifying and avoiding noxious stimuli, such as infection, pain, DVT, heterotopic ossification, pressure ulcers, urinary retention or stones, and ingrown toenails. Next, it is crucial to implement physical modalities and therapeutics, such as stretching, splinting, serial casting, heat and cold modalities, direct tendon pressure, functional electrical stimulation, vibration, and biofeedback.

**Baclofen:**This functions as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist at GABA receptors, thereby increasing the overall inhibitory effects within the reflex pathway.

**Tizanidine:**This drug is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, chemically related to clonidine. Its mechanism of action is to enhance presynaptic inhibition of the spinal reflex. Its side effects include sedation and drowsiness in up to 50% of patients, liver damage, hypotension, dry mouth, bradycardia, and dizziness. Clinical trials have shown tizanidine to be as effective as oral baclofen or diazepam but with better overall tolerability.

**Dantrolene Sodium:**This is unique to spasticity treatment when compared to other agents because it acts peripherally at the level of the muscle by blocking the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

**Diazepam:**This functions by facilitating GABA’s effects on GABA receptors, leading overall to membrane hyperpolarization and decreased firing of neurons. Its net effect is increased presynaptic inhibition and reduced reflexes.

In addition to oral agents, spasticity can be managed with local interventions, such as diagnostic nerve blocks, chemical neurolysis, chemodenervation with botulinum toxin, and motor point blocks. These procedures are the typical choice for treatment of focal spasticity or when the systemic effects of the oral agents mentioned above are prohibitive at required treatment doses.

**Diagnostic Nerve Blocks:**A local anesthetic is injected perineurally using electrostimulation as guidance to block nerve conduction for a few hours. This temporary measure allows the clinician to plan for more permanent interventions such as chemoneurolysis, botulinum toxin, or possible surgery because seeing the temporary reduction in spasticity allows for assessment of potential benefits to be obtained from longer-lasting procedures. These local anesthetics function by blocking the voltage-gated sodium channels on the axon, thereby preventing the depolarization of the axon membrane and interrupting the travel of the signal along the axon. Local anesthetics should not be injected through infected skin or skin that cannot be properly cleaned. Common agents used include lidocaine and bupivacaine.

**Chemoneurolysis:**Chemical neurolytic agents function for anywhere between months and years. These agents cause demyelination and axonal destruction via protein denaturation and axonal necrosis.

**Chemodenervation with Botulinum Toxin:**This is another treatment option. The FDA has approved three type A toxins, onabotulinumtoxin A, incobotulinumtoxin A, and abobotulinumtoxin A, and one type B toxin, rimabotuinumtoxin B, for clinical use.Clostridium botulinum in the form of one heavy and one light chain. The light chain is the active portion, and once it enters the host cell cytoplasm, it cleaves to the host protein SNAP-25, which is responsible for fusion. Once cleaved, SNAP-25 is not able to fuse vesicles. Thus, the overall effect is to prevent the exocytosis of acetylcholine-containing vesicles into the nerve terminal cleft, causing chemical denervation. Botulinum toxin is contraindicated in patients with a known sensitivity if there is evidence of infection at the planned injection site. The toxin should be used with caution if a patient is undergoing concurrent treatment with aminoglycoside or spectinomycin antibiotics. Patients with an underlying neuromuscular disease, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, or peripheral motor neuropathic disease, are at increased risk of severe reactions including respiratory depression or dysphagia. As above, electrical stimulation, EMG, or ultrasound are all methods to localize the muscle in question.

**Intrathecal Baclofen Pump:**Another management option is an intrathecal baclofen (ITB) pump. This device allows for direct delivery of baclofen into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the intrathecal space. This allows a patient to receive a high concentration of the medication directly to the spine while decreasing the CNS risks associated with high oral doses of baclofen, with a ratio of 100:1 for the baclofen concentration at the spinal cord level when administered intrathecally versus orally.

Symptoms of baclofen overdose include hypotonia or severe weakness, somnolence, nausea/vomiting, hypotension, respiratory depression, and seizures. Symptoms of baclofen withdrawal include fever, nausea, hyperthermia, dizziness, insomnia, pruritis, hallucinations, altered mental status, and exaggerated rebound spasticity.

ITB pump is indicated for patients with generalized spasticity who either cannot tolerate or lack response to more conservative agents (oral, nerve blocks, etc.).

**Surgery:**The most invasive management options are surgical. These include orthopedic surgeries such as tendon lengthening, tendon transfer procedures (such as the split anterior tibial tendon transfer known as SPLATT) as well as neurosurgical procedures such as sectioning at the level of a peripheral nerve (neurectomy), central electrical stimulators, rhizotomy, and neuroablative procedures.

# Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnoses for spasticity include contractures, rigidity, and catatonia. A contracture is defined as a decreased elasticity of a muscle, tendon, ligament, joint capsule, and skin, leading to increased resistance during the passive stretch, similar to spasticity. However, the difference between the two is that contractures do now show any velocity-dependent changes with movement or limb positioning.  Rigidity is most commonly associated with basal ganglia injuries.  Rigidity, unlike spasticity, exhibits high tone that is non-selective and affects all muscles surrounding a particular joint equally.  Similar to a contracture, rigidity is unaffected by the speed of movement and is constant throughout the range of movement. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric disorder in which the patient exhibits abnormal posturing; the increase in muscle tone seen here is dependent on the force applied to the muscle in question. Unlike spasticity, catatonia frequently presents with concomitant signs such as stupor, impulsivity, perseveration, staring, grimacing, echolalia, echopraxia, and withdrawal.

# Prognosis

The prognosis of spasticity can vary tremendously from patient to patient. If a patient’s spasticity responds well to treatment, whether physical modalities, therapy, or pharmacological intervention, the patient may carry a favorable prognosis in terms of managing the spasticity symptomatically. Additionally, as previously mentioned, spasticity may carry with it certain benefits for the patient, such as helping the patient with ambulation thereby preventing DVTs, maintaining muscle bulk, weight-bearing, and in turn preventing osteoporosis.

# Complications

Complications of spasticity can vary. In a severe state, spasticity can interfere with daily function. It can cause extreme discomfort or pain for the patient and interfere with hygiene and the caregiver’s ability to provide care. This, in turn, can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can lead to infection and sepsis. It also can lead to bone fractures, subluxation, dislocation, and increased the risk of heterotopic ossification.

# Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care

Rehabilitation frequently plays a critical role in managing a patient’s spasticity. Apart from pharmacological interventions, it is important to address using the physical modalities and therapeutics mentioned earlier. It is crucial to involve the patient, the family, and any other caregivers in managing spasticity and to agree on the intended goals of treatment and management. It is crucial to identify and avoid potential noxious stimuli while maintaining consistent stretching and range of motion exercises.

# Consultations

Depending on the clinical scenario, a clinician may consider referral to services such as neurology or physiatry.  If a patient presents with new-onset spasticity or spasticity that appears to worsen without any specific triggers, this may warrant a neurology consultation. A physiatrist consultation should be considered if the patient has failed to improve with their anti-spasticity medications or their spasticity is significant enough to affect their posture, mobility, and overall care.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients should be educated on maintaining a daily stretching and range of motion program. In addition to the patient, the family and caregivers should be educated about proper positioning, daily skin inspection, an adequate and regular bowel/bladder regimen, avoiding noxious stimuli, and identifying signs of infection and pain.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Spasticity is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes nurses, pharmacists and therapists. When considering treatment for spasticity, the clinician must take into account the etiology of the spasticity, the timing of onset, medical comorbidities, the patient’s support system, and the overall goals of management. As with other conditions, treatment options follow a stepwise approach, starting with more conservative routes and extending to more invasive surgical procedures.

The outcomes in chronic cases are guarded.
