Pancytopenia incidence frequently has a bi-modal presentation in children and adults in the 3rd and 4th decades. Literature has reported a between 1.4 and 2.6 to 1 male to female predominance. While conditions such as multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome are more prevalent in older patients, acute leukemia and parvovirus B19 infection are more common in younger patients.

In North America, the most common etiologies are myeloid neoplasms (acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplasia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, and precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia), followed by aplastic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, and HIV infections.

Geographic and sociocultural influences determine the significant pancytopenia causes, especially for megaloblastic anemia.

A study from 2013 in India showed that the most common causes are hypersplenism, infections, myelosuppression (cancer, chemotherapy, drug toxicity, or radiotherapy), and megaloblastic anemia.
