# Definition/Introduction

In the field of medicine, the treatment for most conditions uses various pharmacological medications. For each of these individual medications, the route of administration, appropriate dosage, and frequency of use are determined by the medication’s pharmacokinetics (PK). PK is the relationship between an administered dose of a drug and its measured concentration within the body. An individual medication’s PK is governed by how it moves within the body through absorption, bioavailability, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.

The characteristics that define an individual medication’s PK can help determine the loading dose. While a patient is taking a specific drug to achieve the therapeutic benefit, the drug must reach a certain steady-state concentration.

A loading dose is typically calculated through the following formula:

**LD=(Volume of Distribution X Concentration Steady State)/Bioavailability**

For this formula, concentration steady-state is defined as the therapeutic concentration of medication in the body, while bioavailability is the fraction of an administered dose that reaches systemic circulation. The volume of distribution is typically calculated as follows:

**Vd=Dose of medication given/Concentration in the Plasma**

The calculation of loading dose should not be confused with maintenance dose, which is the dose required to maintain steady-state concentration. This calculation is:

**MD=(Concentration Steady State X Clearance X Dosing Interval)/Bioavailability**

Clearance can be determined using the known half-life of a medication, which is the length of time required for a dose to reach 50% of its initial plasma concentration. Clearance can ultimately be determined through:

**CL=(0.693 X Vd)/ Half-life**

# Issues of Concern

When prescribing a loading dose of a new medication, there are many factors that a clinician has to consider. Through the formulas above, the loading dose of any drug is influenced by many of the PK variables.

Bioavailability is typically affected by the route of administration of the medication. Each medication typically has a route that provides the best bioavailability. For example, in one study, researchers found that sublingual administration of misoprostol had significantly higher bioavailability compared to oral administration.

Besides, various physiological factors can affect the concentration and pharmacokinetics of medication. One study found that the clearance of ciprofloxacin significantly decreases with age and worsening kidney function.

# Clinical Significance

A medication’s loading dose has many vital clinical applications. In emergency circumstances, drugs need to reach therapeutic concentration rapidly, often requiring a loading dose. For example, studies have found that a loading dose of levetiracetam is essential for adequate treatment of status epilepticus.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

Using pharmacological therapy to treat a patients underlying condition is common in today's medical field. Although these therapies can be beneficial, they can also cause significant harm to the patient. One study found that almost 11% of prescriptions have errors, and 16% of these errors result in harm towards the patient.

- Having an open line of communication between all clinicians and specialties

- Ensure clinicians and pharmacists work together to ensure proper dosing and medication choice

- Order drug blood concentrations when available.

- Educate family and patient about potential adverse drug reactions

- Ensure appropriate specialties are involved with the care of a patient when deemed appropriate

Interdisciplinary efforts become even more essential when a situation with a patient becomes more critically ill, requiring higher levels of care. By working in an interdisciplinary team, patient outcomes can potentially improve, and medication errors avoided.
