Biopsy alone is not sufficient to diagnose actinic prurigo, but histopathology can help aid diagnosis and exclude other disease processes with similar presentations. Skin biopsies will show hyperkeratosis, spongiosis, and acanthosis in the epidermis with lymphocytic perivascular infiltration in the dermis. A lip biopsy will show lymphoid germinal centers in the lamina propria, which can help distinguish actinic prurigo from the polymorphous light eruption. Studies have also described an infiltration of eosinophils and mast cells in the underlying mucosa of affected lesions, which correlate with a delayed type-IVb hypersensitive response.
