Medial epicondyle apophysitis results from repetitive valgus stress of the ulnar collateral ligament exerting traction on the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Excessive stress on this kinetic chain causes injury at the weakest point â€“ the open apophysis, which is five times weaker than the UCL. With repetitive, highly forceful valgus stress, as seen in baseball pitching or another overhead throwing, particularly in the late cocking phase of the throw, the apophysis can get inflamed and partially separate from the distal humerus. Continued stresses on this weakened connection can complicate the injury with an acute avulsion fracture.
