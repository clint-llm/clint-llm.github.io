While MNTI is rare, it should be included in a differential diagnosis in the evaluation of a rapidly growing pigmented mass in the head and neck. Although neural crest-derived neoplasms may produce vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), high levels of urinary levels of VMA are inconsistent; however, they are supportive of the MNTI diagnosis. A cohort study of 18 patients demonstrated that VMA is present in males only.

Radiographically, MNTI appears as a hypodense lesion on computed tomography (CT) scans. However, the melanin component of the soft tissue in MNTI will appear as a hyperdense finding. Enlargement of the lesion will lead to the destruction of the bony structures, and this will appear as a "sun-burst" result on the imaging. Therefore, a CT scan is a good choice to determine the extent of the neoplasm for surgical planning.

On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MNTI typically presents as an increase in the T1 signal due to the presence of melanin. However, the common description of MNTI on MRI is a hypointense well-demarcated mass on T1-weighted and T2-weighted. MRI is helpful as it can show the involvement of soft tissues.

A definitive diagnosis is obtained by biopsy and immunohistochemical tests to differentiate MNTI from other neoplasms that share similar characteristics.
