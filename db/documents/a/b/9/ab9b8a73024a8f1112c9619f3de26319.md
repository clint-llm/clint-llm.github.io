The mechanism of action for cannabidiol, especially its anticonvulsant effect, has not been fully elucidated. It is known to have a low affinity for cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, where it can exert both antagonist and agonist effects. It is a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor and allosteric modulation of opioid receptors, specifically mu and delta. Researchers postulate that the pharmacological effects of CBD could involve agonizing PPARgama and affecting intracellular calcium release.

CBD metabolism occurs in the liver and intestines. Smoking bioavailability is approximately 31%. CBD’s half-life after oromucosal spray is between 1.4 and 10.9 hours, 2 and 5 days after chronic oral consumption, and 31 hours after smoking. CBD will achieve a maximum plasma concentration between 0 and 4 hrs.
