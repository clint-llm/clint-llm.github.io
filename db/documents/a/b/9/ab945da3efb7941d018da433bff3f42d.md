In extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), shockwaves are generated by a lithotripter and are focused on the stones to disintegrate them. Lithotripters are divided based on the underlying mechanism of shockwave generation. There are currently three types of shock wave generators: electrohydraulic, electromagnetic, and piezoelectric.

Electrohydraulic generators produce a vaporization bubble. The bubble produces a high-energy pressure wave by expanding and then immediately collapsing. The shock wave is then focused after hitting a reflector.

Electromagnetic generators produce a magnetic field. A shock wave is generated when the magnetic field causes membrane repulsion. It is focused on stone with a reflector or acoustic lens.

Piezoelectric generators utilize the piezoelectric effect to generate shockwaves. Current is passed through crystals that make the crystals vibrate. This steady speed vibration is used to generate shockwaves.
