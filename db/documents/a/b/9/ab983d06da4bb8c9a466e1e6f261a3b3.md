Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can result from increased production or decreased excretion of bilirubin.

The causes of increased production of unconjugated bilirubin are:

- **Polycythemia**- increased number of red blood cells leads to an increase in their turnover.

- **Hemolysis**- varied causes such as erythroblastosis fetalis, hemolytic disease of the newborn, and abnormalities of the red cell itself such as hereditary spherocytosis, elliptocytosis, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency; and hemoglobinopathies, such as alpha and beta thalassemias.

- **Birth Injuries**- cephalohematoma, subgaleal hemorrhage, or peripheral ecchymoses from birth trauma.

The causes of decreased excretion are:

- **Hypoalbuminemia**- as the unconjugated bilirubin is lipid-soluble, it is normally bound to albumin; a decrease in the albumin level leads to an increase in free unconjugated bilirubin level.

- **Hereditary Bilirubin Conjugation Defects**- Crigler-Najjar syndrome and Gilbert syndrome are due to the deficiency of the enzyme uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UDGPT), which conjugates the bilirubin in the liver cells.

- 
**Disruption or Obstruction in the Biliary System**

- **Breast Milk Jaundice**- glucuronidase enzyme in the breast milk deconjugates bilirubin into unconjugated bilirubin.

In the United States kernicterus registry, 56% had abnormalities known to increase the bilirubin concentration in the blood.Â Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency was diagnosed in 21.3%, severe hemolytic processes were recognized in 20.5%, birth trauma was identified in 15%, and other causes such as galactosemia, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, and sepsis were diagnosed in 7%. However, no etiology was identified in 43.4% of the infants.
