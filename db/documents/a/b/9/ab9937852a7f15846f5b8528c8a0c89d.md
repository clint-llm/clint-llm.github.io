WE is a serious medical disorder which carries an enormous morbidity and mortality. Even when the condition is managed with thiamine, the global confusion usually improves rapidly, but the ataxia and ophthalmoplegia may persist for some time. Patients who minimal or neurological signs have the best outcomes with thiamine supplement. However, survivors of WE may develop korsakoff psychosis and require long-term institutionalization. Of these, less than 10% will recover to be discharged from long-term care. A significant number of patients will have long-term neurological deficits like ataxia, nystagmus and korsakoff syndrome, which seriously diminishes the quality of life. Unfortunately, there are no long-term follow-up studies and anecdotal reports indicate that many of these patients do die prematurely.
