The differential diagnosis for a young male (before fourth decade) with polyarthralgia is more inclined towards rheumatologic conditions like SLE, sarcoid arthritis, scleroderma, or gout. If associated with signs and symptoms of infection, gonococcal joint infection is high on the differential. Rheumatoid arthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica usually affect the older population (after the fourth decade). Based on the distribution of the joints, duration of symptoms, and association with other organ systems the classification of polyarthralgia is very broad and makes for a very challenging diagnosis. The most common differentials for a patient presenting with polyarthralgia are Rheumatoid arthritis, Lupus, Lyme, Septic arthritis, Gonorrheal joint arthritis, or Gout.
