Efavirenz is available by prescription only, and it is available as an oral capsule and an oral tablet. It is also available as a component of two combination drugs: efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and efavirenz, lamivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. The capsules are available as 200 mg and 50 mg, while the tablets are 600 mg.Â The recommended adult dose is 600 mg per day, but there has been data showing that 400 mg per day yields equivalent outcomes with fewer side effects.

The manufacturer recommends no renal dose adjustments. No dose adjustments are necessary for mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A), but caution is advisable. Efavirenz is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C).

Efavirenz dosing should be on an empty stomach, as increased efavirenz serum concentrations occur when taken with food. Increased serum concentrations can lead to increased adverse effects.
