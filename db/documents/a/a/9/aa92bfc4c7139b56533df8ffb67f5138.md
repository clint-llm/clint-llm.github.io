**Primary Cardiac Tumors**

**Benign Tumors**

1. Myxoma

- The most common benign tumor in adults. More frequently found in the left atrium (80%), followed by the right atrium and occasionally in the ventricles.

- They characteristically arise around the interatrial septum next to the fossa ovalis membrane.

- They are more common in women and often appear in the sixth decade of life.

- The majority of the cardiac myxomas are sporadic but familial cases have been described.

- Macroscopically, two basic gross subtypes have been described: solid and villous. Tumors of the solid type may be globular or elongated, with a smooth, shiny, and sometimes undulant surface. Tumors of the villous type have irregular, often friable papillary surfaces.

- Histologically, the one defining characteristic is the presence of the so-called myxoma cell (or lepidic cell), a cytologically bland cell with eosinophilic cytoplasm and an oval or round nucleus. These stellate, ovoid or plump spindle cells may occur singly or in groups. The cells are typically within a myxoid matrix rich in mucopolysaccharides. Large thick-walled vessels are often present near the stalk or the base of the lesion.

- Due to the lack of strong structure, embolization is common.

2. Lipomas

- The second most frequent primary cardiac mass. Represent 0.5% of cardiac tumors

- More frequently present in the sub-endocardium and sub-epicardium of the left ventricle, right atrium, or interatrial septum

- Macroscopically, lipomas are yellow, soft, smooth, well-circumscribed, encapsulated solitary masses.

- Microscopically, the tumors consist of white fat with a fibrous capsule and some fibrous septa; the fat cells have minimal to no atypia.

- Lipomas are mostly asymptomatic, but depending on their location, they can produce arrhythmias or conduction system disease and heart failure symptoms.

3. Papillary fibroelastoma

- Also known as endocardial papilloma

- Most frequent tumor of the valves (75%) with the most common location in the aortic valve followed by the mitral valve

- Derived from the endocardial cells; 95% found in the left-sided chambers

- More common in men and diagnoses at 6th to 7th decade of life

- Macroscopically, papillary fibroelastomas often have a round, whitish appearance and soft consistency. When placed in solution, multiple delicate fronds unfurl, giving the tumor a "sea anemone-like" appearance. The tumors range from 2 to 50 mm and are usually attached to the endocardium by a single stalk.

- Microscopically, papillary fibroelastomas consist of narrow avascular papillary fronds that often exhibit complex branching patterns. Histologically, the collagen and elastic fiber arrangement are reminiscent of the tendinous cords of the atrioventricular valves.

- Embolization is common. Valvular insufficiency or obstruction are also present. Heart failure symptoms and a new murmur in the physical exam are also typical findings.

4. Rhabdomyomas

- The most common cardiac tumor in children often occurring before the first year of life. Over 86% of cardiac rhabdomyomas have been reported in association with tuberous sclerosis.

- It can be multiple and most commonly affects the ventricles.

- Macroscopically, rhabdomyomas are well-defined, unencapsulated, whitish, or grayish nodular masses that range in size from millimeters to several centimeters.

- Microscopically, rhabdomyomas are well-demarcated nodules of enlarged vacuolated cells with clear cytoplasm because of glycogen deposits. A characteristic feature is the so-called spider cell appearance.

- Symptoms are secondary to obstruction of the cardiac chambers and conduction system disturbance as heart block or ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

- Most of these tumors regress spontaneously after birth, and resection is rarely necessary, except in cases of obstruction or arrhythmias.

5. Fibromas:

- The second most frequent cardiac tumor found in childhood, with a slight male predominance.

- Are intramural tumor, mostly in the left ventricular, septum

- Macroscopically, cardiac fibromas are well-circumscribed, firm, usually solitary white masses grossly resembling fibromatosis or uterine leiomyomas. Their appearance on cut section is typically whorled.

- Microscopically, cardiac fibroma is composed of monomorphic fibroblasts that demonstrate little or no atypia. The margins infiltrate into the cardiac muscle.

- The signs and symptoms correlate with heart failure symptoms, increase the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.

**Malignant Tumors**

**Cardiac Sarcomas**

Angiosarcoma

- Most common primary malignant tumor with an increasing incidence in the fourth decade of life.

- The right atrial chamber is the most frequent location

- Macroscopically, angiosarcomas are typically dark brown or black hemorrhagic masses with infiltrating borders.

- Microscopically,  angiosarcoma typically infiltrates cardiac muscle without distinct margins. The vascular channels are irregular, anastomosing, and sinusoidal, with pleomorphic lining cells showing frequent mitotic figures.

- The prognosis of patients with angiosarcoma is poor.

**Secondary Cardiac Tumors**

- Metastatic involvement of the heart is frequent, and this may come from the direct invasion of the tumor from the mediastinum or hematogenous spread.

- Suspicion for cardiac metastasis or tumor extension needs clarification in patients with new findings suggestive of heart failure or valvular disease.

- Pericardial effusion is one of the most common findings in patients with malignancy extending to the heart.

- Histologically the cardiac mass will be determined by the underlying malignancy causing the cardiac tumor.
