The diagnosis and management of vasovagal syncope is very difficult because the differential is enormous. The symptom complex is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the primary provider, nurse practitioner, cardiologist, endocrinologist, emergency department physician, and an internist.

Typically, vasovagal syncope is treated conservatively. When known and avoidable, patients are instructed to avoid triggers. Patients are alsoÂ instructed to drink more fluids to improve their volume status (and therefore their preload) and to change positions slowly. Patients are educated as to the "warning signs" of a vasovagal event and instructed to place themselves in a supine position should they feel an event coming. This often prevents actual syncope and reduces traumatic risk from falling. In refractory or disabling cases and cases of prolonged asystole, cardiac pacing is a therapeutic option.
