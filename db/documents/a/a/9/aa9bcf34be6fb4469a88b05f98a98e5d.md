Serum TSH level is used to screen for primary hypothyroidism in most patients. In overt hypothyroidism, TSH levels are elevated, and free T4 levels are low. In subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH levels are elevated, and free T4 levels are normal.

Central hypothyroidism is of pituitary or hypothalamic origin. TSH produced can be biologically inactive and can affect the levels of bioactive TSH, hence diagnosis of central hypothyroidism should be based on free T4 rather than TSH.

Labs should include evaluation for autoimmune thyroid diseases with levels of anti-thyroid antibodies: the thyroid peroxidase antibodies and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies. Particularly in patients with thyroid nodules, fine-needle aspiration biopsy should be considered.

Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and thyroid peroxidase antibody positivity have a greater risk of developing overt hypothyroidism

T3 levels are not a reliable or recommended test. Hospitalized patients should undergo TSH testing only when thyroid dysfunction is suspected.

On labs, hyperlipidemia, elevated serum CK, elevated hepatic enzymes, anemia can be present.

BUN, creatinine, and uric acid levels can also be elevated.
