It is vital that, as an interprofessional medical team, the entire staff works to ensure that parental consent is obtained and documented correctly. It may be beneficial for organizations to monitor that consent is quickly collected and uploaded to the EMR. Clinicians should also document the discussion and receipt of verbal consent. Even if the signed paper is uploaded to the EMR, it should still be recorded by the clinician. Nurses and allied health professionals can assist in this role by double-checking documentation and making sure the patient and parents understand the consent they are signing. These steps are imperative to providing excellent medical care.

In an emergency setting without the ability to obtain medical consent, the entire team should be educated on their duty to continue with the minor's care. Staff members are not to hesitate and delay emergency treatment. While the essential team is working with the emergent minor, another team member should be monitoring the ability to locate the parents. It is crucial to ensure that a team member is calling parents or guardians and trying their best to obtain consent and notify the parents of their child's state.
