Patients with a known phosgene exposure of less than 50 mcg/ min are cleared from evaluation by a healthcare facility. Patients with exposures of 50 to 150 mcg/min, unknown exposure concentration, or respiratory symptoms should seek evaluation at a healthcare facility.[13]

After evaluation by a healthcare professional, patients with no signs of toxicity or pulmonary edema may be discharged with precautions after 8 hours of observation. If the discussed criteria are not met after 8 hours, additional medical monitoring is warranted before discharge. Severe injury is predicted by the onset of pulmonary edema within 2 to 6 hours. Patients who develop pulmonary edema should be considered for transfer to an ECMO facility, given the potential for refractory ARDS. Assuming survival from the initial insult, phosgene toxicity has a favorable prognosis, with a return to baseline expected within one to two years.
