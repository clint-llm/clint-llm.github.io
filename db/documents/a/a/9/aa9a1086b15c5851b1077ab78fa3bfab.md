Investigations should include routine laboratories, including thyroid function tests.

Computed tomogram (CT) of the brain may reveal a mass in the 4th ventricle. Most medulloblastomas are contrast-enhancing. Hydrocephalus is common in most patients.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed in all patients as it demonstrates the anatomy better than CT scan. MRI is often used to detect post-surgical residual disease. Spinal MRI is also useful for detecting metastatic spinal lesions.

Other tests include audiometry prior to starting cisplatin treatment. Echocardiogram and pulmonary function tests are obtained as a baseline prior to the start of chemotherapy.

A lumbar puncture may reveal leptomeningeal tumor spread. But despite a positive MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be normal. Prior to a lumbar puncture, fundoscopy is done. Following surgery, lumbar puncture is delayed for at least 2 weeks because the surgery may have caused tumor dissemination, leading to a false-positive result.
