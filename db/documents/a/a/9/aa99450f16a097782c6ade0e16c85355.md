Pott puffy tumor is a rare but critical diagnosis because if untreated, it can be lethal. Parents need to monitor patients' signs/symptoms when episodes of sinusitis are present. Patients presenting recurrent episodes of sinusitis with associated headache, febrile episodes, purulent rhinorrhea, or forehead swelling should be more than enough to take the patient to the emergency department for evaluation and management. Rapid recognition of PPT for emergent treatment is crucial for an optimal outcome.
