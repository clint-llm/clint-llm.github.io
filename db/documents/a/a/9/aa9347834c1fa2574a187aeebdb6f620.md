Antidepressants including duloxetine may increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults who have a major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders. Close observation and routine follow-up by the healthcare team is essential in ensuring medication compliance and patient safety.

When a patient is started on duloxetine therapy, all the interprofessional team members, including clinicians, mid-level practitioners, specialists, nurses, social workers, and pharmacists, should be involved in patient care. The pharmacist should perform a thorough medication reconciliation to preclude any drug interactions and verify that dosing is appropriate. A psychiatric health specialist nurse will assist with patient counseling regarding administration and monitor the patient on follow-up visits. If there are any warning symptoms or concerns, the pharmacist and nurse should inform the prescriber promptly. Any social workers or other mental health counselors also need to be included in the sharing of information. This type of interprofessional team approach can ensure optimal patient outcomes with minimal adverse events.
