Various specimens may need to be collected for nuclear medicine scans. In vitro methods for blood samples include drawing blood from the patient, commonly in the arm. The blood is then mixed with the appropriate radiotracer. Depending on the radiotracer, information can be obtained from the blood sample, or the sample needs to be injected back into the patient.

Another common use of in vitro nuclear medicine includes a urea breath test. A patient will ingest a radiotracer pill and breath through a straw into a balloon to capture air from the lungs. The air is then assessed for increased labeled 14CO2 in the patientâ€™s breath.

There are less common uses of in vitro nuclear medicine. Some of these processes include the need to collect fluid and tissue samples. Any specimen collection must be completed through a sterile process.
