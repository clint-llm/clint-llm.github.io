The ‘hidden’ existence of a malignant tumor in the peritoneum is responsible for increased fatality in patients of PC. Therefore, practical methods for early and timely diagnosis are required to prevent surgeries of unresectable tumors and harm from un-necessary chemotherapy drugs.

Techniques for diagnosing PC are crucial as most tumors are often discovered incidentally during the surgeries. It includes:

**CT Scan**

CT scan is the foremost modality used in patients presenting with abdominal pain and distension. In some cases, a preliminary test like Ultrasound (USG) is done. The USG is, however, unable to detect malignant granulations less than 2 cm in size. In PC, ultrasonographic features include ascites which is echo-free or have low-level echoes, and hyperechogenic nodules representing cell deposition in the peritoneum. Adhesion of bowel loops, omental matting, and lymphadenopathy can also be seen.

CT scans can detect granulations of size as small as 5mm.

The CT scan findings in EOPPC are similar together with normal ovaries and the absence of the primary tumor. Chiou et al. reported that common CT scan findings in primary PC are ascites (82%), peritoneal nodules (73%), omental caking (64%), and pelvic mass (36%).

In MPM, the CT scan identifies a solid, heterogeneous mass with irregular margins. It shows ascites in 60-100% of cases. The MPM usually lacks lymph nodes and distant metastasis.

The leiomyosarcomas show a contrast-enhanced heterogeneous solid and cystic mass with septations, necrosis, and calcifications.

The scan in the DSCRT demonstrates a well enhanced lobulated mass comprising of necrosis, hemorrhage, and fibrous components, usually in retrovesical or rectouterine space.

Hence, the CT scan is the primary diagnostic modality and also helps in guiding the interventional radiologists for conducting biopsies and surgeons for performing cytoreductive surgeries.

**MRI Scan**

Gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced MRI is better than the helical CT scan for visualization of small peritoneal carcinomatosis. The detection sensitivity of MRI is 84% for tumors of all sizes as compared to 54% for CT scans. The sensitivity is further increased for tumors with dimensions less than 1 cm (85-90%).

- The primary site of metastasis.

- The morphology of the main tumor as solid, cystic, or mixed.

- The quantity of ascites.

- The presence/absence of peritoneal dissemination.

- Diffuse or nodular spread.

- The lymphadenopathy and lymph nodes involved.

- Distant sites of metastasis if present or not.

**PET Scan**

The mainstay of imaging modalities for PC is CT scans and MRIs. However, small peritoneal implants are not visible by them. In such cases, FDG PET-CT scan (2-[Fluorine 18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography) has the potential to improve the detection. It identifies malignant cells due to their increased glucose metabolism. This method helps in early detection, staging, monitoring treatment response, and long-term follow up.

**Invasive Techniques**

The resemblance in radiological appearances of neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions is responsible for establishing the requirement of invasive techniques. For example, the histological type and subtypes of the tumor can only be differentiated on biopsy. In PC, invasive procedures include:

1. Abdominal percutaneous paracentesis.

2. Diagnostic laparoscopy.

**1. Paracentesis**

**Ascitic fluid analysis**

In PC, ascites is exudative with high protein (2.5 mg/dl), elevated LDH (400 SU), and low glucose (40 mg/dl). The frank bloody ascites are seen in peritoneal carcinomatosis in only 10% cases, and blood-tinged (RBC >10,000 mm) ascites are seen in 8.3% of cases.

**Tumor Markers**

To assess the effectiveness of tumor markers in diagnosing the malignancy, a study to determine the correlation of tumor markers in serum and ascites was done. Tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA 19-9, CA-125, CYFRA (cytokeratin fragments) were studied and reported to be highly correlated in both ascites and serum. Also, CA-125, CEA, and CYFRA are produced by normal epithelial cells and thus can be found in certain benign conditions. CYFRA was the only tumor marker found in higher quantities in malignant conditions. Still, no benefit of measuring the tumor markers in ascites than in serum was found for diagnosis.

**Cytology**

Cytology is positive in first specimens in 83% of cases of malignant-related ascites, and yield increases to 93% and 97% if two and three samples are sent respectively.

**2. Laparoscopy**

Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that provides direct visualization for a directed peritoneal lavage and tumor identification with a sensitivity of 100%. Biopsy of suspected lesions are taken during laparoscopy, and histological diagnosis is made. It is a useful tool for staging the tumor. It also prevents extensive procedures like open laparotomies by differentiating an unresectable tumor from operatable ones. It is done by calculating PCI (peritoneal carcinomatosis index), which assesses the spread of tumors in thirteen abdominal regions and each of which gets a score of 3. The total score ranges from 0-39. The higher the PCI score, the worse the prognosis. It also predicts the response of surgery in PC patients.
