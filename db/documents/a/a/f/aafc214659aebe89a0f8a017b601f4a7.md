Another identified cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is an autosomal dominant condition known as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). The usual treatment of MEN1 in the context of primary hyperparathyroidism is surgical removal, but this is complicated when the parathyroid gland is ectopic. Ectopic parathyroid glands are more common in MEN1 patients than sporadically hyper-parathyroid patients.
