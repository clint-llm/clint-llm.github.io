The most common etiology resulting in Klumpke palsy is a hyper-abduction trauma to the arm that has enough intensity to traction the lower brachial plexus. Trauma during birth can cause brachial plexus injuries, but again hyper-abduction and traction forces to the upper extremity are usually present. A compression injury has similar signs and symptoms, for example, an apical lung tumor gets to a size where it presses on the cervical sympathetic ganglia or C8 to T1 nerve root. If there is a sympathetic involvement, Horner syndrome may present.
