Cheilitis granulomatosa (CG) is a rare granulomatous disorder characterized by a recurrent firm swelling of one or both lips. This is called the cheilitis granulomatosa of Miescher (CGM) when it occurs in isolation. It is called Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) if the classical triad of recurrent or persistent orofacial edema, plicated or fissured tongue (lingua plicata), and relapsing peripheral facial nerve paralysis is present. Cheilitis granulomatosa has many differential diagnoses that merit ruling out. This activity describes the evaluation and management of cheilitis granulomatosa and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of cheilitis granulomatosa.
- Explain how cheilitis granulomatosa is diagnosed.
- Review the therapeutic options available for cheilitis granulomatosa.
- Summarize a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to enhance the care of patients affected by cheilitis granulomatosa.
