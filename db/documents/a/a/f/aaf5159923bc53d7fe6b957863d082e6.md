Two neurons form the neurological synapse, or in some instances, a neuron and an anatomical structure. This review will focus on 2 neurons composing the synapse. Neurons initially develop from the embryonic neural tube, which has 3 layers:

- The ventricular zone, which surrounds the central canal of the tube. This tube will eventually become the ependyma.

- The intermediate zone, which is formed by dividing cells of the ventricular zone.  This zone stretches from the outermost portion of the ventricular zone to the outermost layer of the neural tube, known as the pial layer.

- The marginal zone, which is formed by extensions of the nerve cells of the intermediate zone.

The intermediate zone will go on to form the gray matter, while the nerve processes that make up the marginal zone will become white matter once myelinated.

The neurons must then differentiate from their precursors. The order in which they do this is based upon their size, with the largest neurons (motor neurons) differentiating first. Around the time of birth, the smaller neurons (sensory neurons) will develop, along with glial cells. Glial cells are cells that will aid in the differentiation of the neurons and will facilitate their growth in the direction of their target locations. Later, glial cells will participate in the reuptake of excess neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft.
