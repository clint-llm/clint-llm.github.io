The etiology of CG is still unknown. Several etiologies of different orders have been proposed including genetic, inflammatory, allergic, and microbial. There is not a clear etiological mechanism.

The postulated etiological factors include:

- Genetic predisposition: Genetic origin has been suggested considering some cases with involvement of other family members; however, it remains unproven, and no HLA association has been found in patients with CG compared to the general population.

- Immunologic factors: CG is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by a predominant T helper 1-mediated immune response. The main anomaly is most likely a local alteration of innate immunity of lip mucosa in response to various antigens whose insufficient purification leads to a persistent granulomatous reaction.

- Allergic factors: Allergy to dental materials, foodstuffs, and food additives, has been suspected, but the causal relationship is not well established.

- Microbial factors: Several microbial agents have been incriminated, as eventual factors of deregulation of the immune response. Studies have included especially Mycobacterium tuberculosis and paratuberculosis, Borrelia burgdorferi, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans. Nevertheless, with conflicting results, the role of these microbes in the pathogenesis of CG remains uncertain.

- Hypersensitivity to ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation.

- As part of the spectrum of Crohn's disease: Although early studies suggested that CG may represent an extra-intestinal variant of Crohn's disease with overt gastrointestinal disease developing much later, the fact that CG is found in less than 1% of patients with Crohn's disease cannot be ignored.
