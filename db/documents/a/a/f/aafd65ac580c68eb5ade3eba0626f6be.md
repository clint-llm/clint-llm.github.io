Intrathecal morphine is usually only administered by an oncologist, anesthesiologist, or a pain specialist.Â Typically, intrathecal morphine is more likely to benefit patients with nociceptive or neuropathic pain that is well localized and responsive to systemic opioids. This pain may or may not be cancer-related. Additionally, intrathecal opiates should be avoided or minimized in patients with pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, or substance abuse. Intrathecal administration of morphine through implantable pumps should be carefully considered and likely avoided in patients with cancer-related pain whose life expectancy is less than three months as it takes time to reach a suitable dosing regimen, and this must be weighed against the risks of the pump.

The use of intrathecal morphine requires an interprofessional healthcare team. The clinician (including pain specialists or oncologists) will initiate treatment with intrathecal morphine, but a pharmacist should also have involvement to verify appropriate dosing and should also check for potential drug interactions (e.g., CYP3A4 agonists/antagonists). Nursing administering the drug should understand proper administration and dosing, as well as the signs of toxicity, and report any concerns to the clinician promptly. This type of interprofessional team approach optimizes intrathecal morphine administration, results, and safety, leading to better patient outcomes for pain control. [Level 5]
