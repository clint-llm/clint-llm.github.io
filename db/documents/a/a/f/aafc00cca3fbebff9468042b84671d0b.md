In all major trauma patients, especially MVA, assault, and sports injury, the clinician should be highly suspicious because there is a very high chance of missing laryngeal injury.

The most common presentation is hoarseness (85%), followed by dysphagia (52%).

- Group I: minor laryngeal edema or lacerations

- Group II: demonstrable edema or hematomas without exposed cartilage

- Group III: massive edema or mucosal lacerations with exposed cartilage or displaced cartilaginous fractures or vocal fold immobility

- Group IV: destabilization of laryngeal structure, including the disruption of the anterior commissure, more than two unstable displaced fracture or severe mucosal injury

- Group V complete laryngotracheal separation.

Another classification system based on anatomical site, mode, the structure involved, and degree is as follows:

- Supraglottic: epiglottic hematoma/ avulsion, hyoid bone fracture, thyroid cartilage fracture, arytenoid dislocation or degloving, endolaryngeal edema, and airway obstruction.

- Glottic injuries: hoarseness generally associated with fracture of thyroid cartilage resulting in vocal cords edema, endolaryngeal lacerations, avulsion of vocal cord from the anterior commissure

- Subglottic: Cricoid cartilage and cervical trachea involved causing profound airway compromise. Complete cricotracheal disruption with acute airway obstruction can cause rapid death unless the airway stabilizes rapidly.

Verschueren, Bell,Â et al. modified Schaefer's classification to add endoscopic and imaging findings and create a management guideline.
