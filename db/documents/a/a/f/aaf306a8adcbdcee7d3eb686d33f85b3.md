Imipramine blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Since imipramine is a tertiary amine, it has a greater affinity for serotonin, and it has more anticholinergic side effects, which can prove helpful in treating enuresis. Imipramine blocks D-2 receptors. Additionally, imipramine and other tricyclics have different effects on other receptors. It blocks antimuscarinic receptors, thus, producing anticholinergic adverse effects. It also blocks alpha 1 and 2 adrenergic and H1 receptors.
