The treatment of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma management is similar to other indolent small B cell lymphomas. An interprofessional team that includes oncology nurses is recommended for treating and monitoring these patients. Asymptomatic patients are usually managed by close observation, and symptomatic patients are managed by single-agent rituximab therapy without maintenance. Treatment of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia depends on the extent of end-organ involvement and symptoms. Asymptomatic patients are managed by close follow-up every 1 to 2 months including serial IgM measurements and assessment of serum viscosity. Symptomatic patients are managed by chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or an autologous bone marrow stem cell transplant.

Even though lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma is a low-grade lymphoma, survival rates have not improved drastically over the past few decades. Symptomatic patients undergoing chemotherapy still develop a number of adverse effects which affect the quality of life.
