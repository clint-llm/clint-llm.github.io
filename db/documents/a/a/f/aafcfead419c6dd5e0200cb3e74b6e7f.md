Pars planitis is chronic intermediate uveitis for which no systemic disease or associated infection has been found. Patients with pars planitis present with minimal symptoms, but may report floaters or blurry vision. In most cases, there is no photophobia or pain. Occasionally, however, patients may present with sudden loss of vision due to retinal detachment or acute vitreous hemorrhage. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of pars planitis and examines the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the presenting features of pars planitis.
- Review the typical presentation of pars planitis.
- Summarize the treatment options for pars planitis.
- Identify the need for enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional teams to improve outcomes for patients with pars planitis.
