Leukotrienes (LTs) are a group of inflammatory mediators that belong to the eicosanoid family. Their synthesis, primarily by leukocytes, is spurred by a variety of immunologic and nonimmunologic stimuli, including antigens, immune complexes, complement, cytokines, osmotic challenges, and pollutants, among others. These molecules collectively serve a variety of purposes aimed at furthering the inflammatory cascade via alterations in vascular permeability, effects on leukocytes, and constriction of smooth muscle. Most notably, the bronchoconstriction that results from the action of leukotrienes plays a vital role in the pathophysiology of asthma, which creates opportunity in the utilization of targeted pharmacotherapy to treat asthma and similar diseases.
