Periodontal abscesses characteristically demonstrate the rapid destruction of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. They can significantly influence the prognosis of a tooth and may lead to tooth loss; this is particularly true for patients who already have moderate to severe attachment loss.

A retrospective study on the frequency of tooth loss due to periodontal abscess found that 45% of teeth with a periodontal abscess were extracted during supportive therapy.

Furthermore, teeth with repeated abscess formation have a very poor prognosis.

The evidence suggests that there are poorer outcomes for teeth with existing periodontal disease. Due to the rapid destructive nature of the disease, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to improving the prognosis.
