Osborne’s band has been implicated in both tractional ulnar neuritis and ulnar entrapment leading to cubital tunnel syndrome. The band lies on the roof of the cubital tunnel, making it a prime location for compression injuries when the elbow is in flexion, as this reduces the space of the tunnel and increases the length of the band. There are four different places at which ulnar entrapment can occur. These are: the fibrous canal on the medial aspect of the arm, also known as arcade of Struthers, the fibrous canal at the wrist, also known as Guyon’s canal, the retro epicondylar groove at the elbow, and finally the aponeurosis between the muscle heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscles – Osborne’s band.

When taking a comprehensive history of someone with ulnar nerve entrapment, the historian should seek an understanding of whether or not an injury precipitated the patient's symptoms. If so, when was the onset of injury, what measures the patient has taken to alleviate their symptoms, and most importantly, in what way has functionality been reduced due to his/her symptoms?
