Laboratory analysis will typically show leukocytosis and is this alone is unable to aid the clinician in diagnosing the organism that caused a patient’s pneumonia. Chest radiograph, however, can aid the physician in narrowing their differential diagnosis to include K. pneumoniae as a cause for the patient’s condition. Pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae typically causes a lobar infiltrate in the posterior aspect of the right upper lung. K. pneumoniae infections rarely cause lung abscesses in those with pneumonia but can commonly be associated with empyema. Another non-specific sign of K. pneumoniae on a chest radiograph is the bulging fissure sign. This is related to the large amount of infection and inflammation that the organism can cause. Although these are findings can be used to aid the clinician in narrowing their differential diagnosis, they should not be thought of as indicative of pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae. In the setting of pneumonia, infection with K. pneumoniae is confirmed by either sputum culture analysis or blood culture analysis.
