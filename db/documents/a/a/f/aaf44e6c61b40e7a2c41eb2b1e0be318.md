**PMDD Assessment Scales**

- Premenstrual Symptom Screening Tool (PSST): A questionnaire used to diagnose PMDD with 19 items that allow the patient to rate the severity of their symptoms.

- Calendar of Premenstrual Experiences (COPE): Includes 22 symptoms grouped into 4 categories: mood reactivity, autonomic/ cognitive, appetitive, and related to fluid retention.

- Visual Analogue Scale (VAS): Steiner et al. used this scale in 1999 to rate each of the 4 core symptoms of PMDD: mood swings, irritability, tension, and depression. The scale consisted of a 100 mm vertical line labeled 0 or “no symptom” at the left end and 100 or “severe” at the right.

- Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP): This scale consists of 24 items, out of which 21 items are grouped into 11 distinct symptoms and 3 functional impairment items. The items are rated from 1 (not at all) to 6 (extreme).

- Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS): Deorte et al. used PROMIS computerized adaptive testing (PROMIS CAT) to detect premenstrual symptoms of depression, anxiety, and fatigue; the results of the study provided encouraging evidence for the utility of PROMIS instruments for the measurement of effective premenstrual symptoms.
