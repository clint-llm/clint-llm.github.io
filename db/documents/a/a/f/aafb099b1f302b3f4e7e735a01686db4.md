A four-stage classification scheme based on rotatory displacement has been developed:

- Type I - Simple rotatory displacement with an intact transverse ligament

- Type II - Anterior displacement of C1 on C2 of 3 to 5 mm with one lateral mass serving as a pivot point and a deficiency of the transverse ligament

- Type III - Anterior displacement exceeding 5 mm

- Type IV - Posterior displacement of C1 on C2

Type III and type IV are highly unstable, and emergent treatment is recommended.

The**Wang classification**is the most useful system that aids in dichotomizing the patients based on their imaging characteristics and their patterns of reducibility following traction. The instability (type I) and reducible dislocation (type II) variants can be managed with the posterior-only approach. However, the irreducible dislocation (type III) and bony dislocations (type IV) require ventral decompression before the posterior fusion.
