All interprofessional healthcare team members, including the nurse anesthetist, anesthesiologist, emergency medicine physician, and critical care specialist, who use neuromuscular blockers, must closely monitor all patients. These agents are usually administered to intubated patients, and hence, airway maintenance and respiratory support are vital. Muscle strength should undergo a regular assessment to determine if the drug's action has diminished. Pharmacists should also verify the agents and dosing when ordered outside the operating room and ensure no potential drug interactions exist with the patient's current medication profile. It is prudent to assign one individual whose sole responsibility is monitoring the patient's vitals and other signs associated with NMBD use. This would be the anesthesia provider inside the operating room. Any issues need to be reported to the surgeon or anesthesiologist immediately. Only through this type of collaborative care can the interprofessional healthcare team ensure that these agents are used safely and appropriately to direct patient outcomes optimally. [Level 5]
