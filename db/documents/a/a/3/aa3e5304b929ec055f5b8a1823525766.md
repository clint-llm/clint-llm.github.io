A range of simulation modalities exists, from low-fidelity  ‘bench models’ to high-fidelity virtual reality simulators.****Fidelity is defined as the accuracy with which a simulation modality represents reality. High fidelity models have been shown to be effective learning tools.

Formative simulation training may be enhanced through self-regulatory learning (SRL); this would also offer a practical strategy to tackle a lack of expert availability. SRL comprises self-awareness, proactiveness to obtain information that will fill gaps in knowledge and internal motivation to monitor and reflect on self-performance, overlapping with key adult learning principles. Increasing the availability of low-fidelity models with high psychological fidelity, such as sawbones, will allow junior orthopedic trainees to practice basic skills such as instrument handling, drilling, and screw insertion in a cost-effective manner.

Current trainee progression is based on an annual review of competence progression (ARCP) following evaluations from colleagues and trainers via Work-Based Assessments (WBAs). WBAs facilitate the provision of regular feedback; however, they have been shown to have a potentially adverse effect on training opportunities due to time taken to carry out and a negative or no overall impact on training.
