Phase III clinical trials involving patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis who were suffering from uremic pruritus involved a study design. Patients received intravenous difelikefalin at weight-based doses of 1.0 mcg per kg three times a week into the venous circuit of their dialysis machine for twelve weeks. This study demonstrated the following most common adverse side effects:

- Diarrhea

- Vomiting

- Dizziness

A double-blind, randomized study assessed the potential of difelikefalin to cause respiratory depression in healthy patients compared to placebo. The lowest observed respiratory rate in study subjects in both groups was 14 breaths per minute. This respiratory rate is well above the 10 breaths per minute respiratory rate, which qualified as respiratory depression for this study. Additionally, no significant differences in pulse oximetry readings were observed in subjects receiving placebo versus those receiving IV difelikefalin. This study utilized supratherapeutic intravenous doses of  1.0 mcg per kg and then 5.0 mcg per kg. The following adverse effects were reported in 20 to 60% of participants:

- Paresthesia

- Hypoesthesia

- Somnolence

When these adverse effects were experienced by study subjects, the persistence of the symptom ranged from less than one minute to less than ninety minutes and did not require any intervention.
