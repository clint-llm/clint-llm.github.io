A normal heartbeat consists of a sequential contraction of atria followed by ventricles in a series of cardiac cycle events. The succession of 3 such regular heartbeats displaying identical waveform leads to a steady rhythm. The stimulus for each heartbeat commonly originates from the sinus node in the right atria, hence the name sinus rhythm. Abnormal heart rate or rhythm, which is not physiologically justified, is known as arrhythmia. Arrhythmias are almost always pathological except sinus arrhythmia, which is physiological. As the name suggests, sinus arrhythmia originates from the sinus node, but the regularity between each heartbeat varies with inspiration and expiration. All pathological arrhythmia can be further classified based on heart rate into tachyarrhythmia (fast), bradyarrhythmia (slow), or tachy-brady (fast-slow) arrhythmia.

All tachyarrhythmia originating above the ventricles, including atria and atrioventricular node (AV node), are grouped under supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).

The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology further classified AF as follows:

- Paroxysmal AF: intermittentÂ in nature, terminating spontaneously or within 7 days of treatment.

- Persistent AF: Failure to terminate in 7 days

- Long-lasting AF: AF lasting for more than 12 months

- Permanent AF: Persistent AF where rhythm strategy is no longer pursued

**Other Types of AF**

- Lone AF: Lone AF is used to describe patients younger than 60 years with no other concomitant heart disease and structurally normal heart on an echocardiogram.

- Non-Valvular AF: Defines whether AF is related to valvular disease, replacement, or repair. It is much more difficult to convert valvular AF into sinus rhythm.
