Fresh frozen plasma is contraindicated when coagulopathy can be corrected more effectively with specific therapy and when blood volume can be adequately replaced with other volume expanders. More specific treatments that merit consideration before fresh frozen plasma administration include vitamin K, cryoprecipitated antihemophilic factor, prothrombin complex concentrates, or specific coagulation factor concentrates like factor VII. In the absence of coagulation deficiencies and active bleeding, fresh frozen plasma should not be used as a volume expander. FreshÂ frozen plasma is contraindicated for the reversal of anticoagulation induced by heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors, or direct factor Xa inhibitors because fresh frozen plasma does not effectively reverse anticoagulation induced by these medications. Antidotes to reverse direct oral anticoagulants are better options.
