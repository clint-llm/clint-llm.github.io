Patients should avoid exposure to the antigen that may be associated with a hypersensitivity reaction. In cases of an occupational hazard, appropriate precautions at the worksite or changing the nature of the work must be considered. Medication-associated reactions can be avoided by a careful review of the drug allergy list and related side-effect. The patients must familiarize themselves with the brand and generic name of the offending medication. Medications with similar compositions should also be avoided to prevent hypersensitivity reactions. It is vital to emphasize that repeated exposure to the triggering agent can lead to worsening disease.
