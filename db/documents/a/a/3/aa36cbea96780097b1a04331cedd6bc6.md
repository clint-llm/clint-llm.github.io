**CSF Leak**Typically caused by violating the macula cribrosa on the medial wall of the vestibule and allowing CSF penetration into the vestibule from the internal auditory canal.

**Facial Nerve Injury**is possible as neuroepithelial elements of the vestibule, as well as the PSC, lie medial to the course of the facial nerve. Great care must be taken when dissecting these areas, and powered instrumentation should be avoided for this portion of the procedure.

**Disabling Chronic Disequilibrium**is a rare unfortunate complication.

**Cochlear Ossification**and the subsequent inability to rehabilitate hearing by cochlear implantation could be considered a less frequently acknowledged complication of labyrinthectomy. Cochlear patency is typically preserved for many years after labyrinthectomy.
