The excretion of mercury is dependent on its original form. Elemental and inorganic salts are primarily excreted through the kidney and minimally through the GI tract with a total half-life of 30 to 60 days. Excretion of organic mercury compounds is primarily fecal, with enterohepatic recirculation leading to a longer half-life of approximately 70 days.
