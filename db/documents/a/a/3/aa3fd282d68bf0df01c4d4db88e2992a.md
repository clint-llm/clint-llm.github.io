The pathologic process of hidradenitis suppurativa begins when a defective hair follicle becomes occluded and ruptures, spilling its contents, including keratin and bacteria, into the surrounding dermis. A chemotactic inflammatory response by surrounding neutrophils and lymphocytes can lead to abscess formation and subsequent destruction of the pilosebaceous unit and other adjacent structures. Other possible contributors to pathology include abnormal antimicrobial peptides, abnormal secretion of apocrine glands, abnormal invaginations of the epidermis leading to tract formation, and deficient numbers of sebaceous glands.

Immunological abnormalities have also been observed. Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and various interleukins, have been detected in the lesions of hidradenitis suppurativa and provide possible targets for emerging treatments. Bacteria do not appear to be causative. Aspirate from an unruptured lesion typically yields a sterile culture. However, bacterial infection and colonization during the process can secondarily worsen hidradenitis suppurativa.
