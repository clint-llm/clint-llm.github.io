The incidence of viral encephalitis is 3.5 to 7.5 per 100,000 people, with the highest incidence in the young and elderly. The epidemiology of certain viral causes of encephalitis has changed through time. For example, vaccination has led to a decrease in the incidence of encephalitis due to mumps and measles. On the other hand, EBV and CMV encephalitis are seen more frequently now because they occur in immunocompromised individuals, such as AIDS, transplant, and chemotherapy patients. Other important epidemiologic factors include the time of the year, geography, and animal or insect exposure. For instance, arboviruses (i.e., eastern equine, western equine, St. Louis, Venezuelan equine, Zika, and West Nile)Â cause disease during the summer months when mosquitos are active. St. Louis encephalitis is primarily seen in the Midwest and South, whereas tick-borne encephalitis occurs mainly in the North-Central and the Northeastern United States.

The transmission to the brain is via hematogeneous spread.

In the US, herpes simplex is the most common cause of encephalitis. Individuals who work in the warm humid environments are at risk for arboviruses because of the presence of mosquitoes.
