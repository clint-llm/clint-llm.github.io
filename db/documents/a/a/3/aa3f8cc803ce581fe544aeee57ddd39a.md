Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) or "Fatty Liver" corresponds to the presence of macrovesicular changes without inflammation (steatosis) and lobular inflammation in the absence of significant alcohol use. It can be divided into two subgroups: NAFL (Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver) or simply Steatosis and NASH (Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis). NAFL is defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis with no evidence of hepatocellular injury in the form of ballooning of the hepatocytes. This activity reviews the cause of fatty liver and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the causes of fatty liver. 
- Describe the pathophysiology of fatty liver.
- Summarize the treatment of fatty liver.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by fatty liver.
