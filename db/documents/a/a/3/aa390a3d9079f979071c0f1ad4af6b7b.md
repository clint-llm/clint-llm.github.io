The list of differentials of lip swelling are many, including:

- Acquired angioedema due to C1 deficiency

- Hereditary angioedema

- Glandular cheilitis

- Dental abscess

- Crohn's disease

- Cutaneous manifestation of various granulomatous disorders including sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, leishmaniasis, leprosy, Wegener granulomatosis

The histopathology of angioedema is not granulomatous. Moreover, some conditions often have a family history and episodic bouts of abdominal pain. A dental abscess can be ruled out with a thorough dental examination and swabs. Differentiation from other granulomatous disorders has been discussed above.
