Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia (PCP), now referred to as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, is a fungal infection that most commonly affect the immunocompromised and, in some cases, can be severely life-threatening. Typically, patients at risk are those with underlying disease states that alter host immunity, such as cancer, HIV, transplant recipients, or those taking immunosuppressive therapies and medications. Patients presenting with PCP may show signs of fever, cough, dyspnea, and, in severe cases, respiratory failure. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of pneumocystis jiroveci.
- Review the workup of a patient with pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.
- Summarize the treatment options for pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.
