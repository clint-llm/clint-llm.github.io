There are several steps involved in the pathogenesis of pseudomyxoma peritonei. Initially, tumor cells originating from the mucinous epithelium of the appendix continuously produce mucus into the appendiceal lumen and form a mucocele, which eventually ruptures. Free-floating mucinous epithelial tumor cells then implant in various parts of peritoneal cavity following the intraperitoneal fluid current and gravity, thanks to their absence of adhesive properties. It is termed as the so-called ‘redistribution phenomenon.’

Mobile organs such as the small bowel and its mesentery are usually less likely to be involved compared to more fixed parts such as antrum, duodenojejunal flexure, ligament of Treitz, ileocecal and rectosigmoid region, early in the disease process. But in the end-stage disease, the entire peritoneal cavity could be engulfed.
