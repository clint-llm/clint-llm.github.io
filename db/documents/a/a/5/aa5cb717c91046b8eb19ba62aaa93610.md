Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a part of a spectrum of diseases that arise as a result of abnormal enzymes in the biosynthesis of heme. It is caused by the deficiency of the uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase (UROD) enzyme and should be differentiated from other porphyrias. PCT is a non-fatal condition presenting mainly with skin manifestations, provided it has been diagnosed appropriately and managed in a timely and regular manner. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of porphyria cutanea tarda and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify and explain the etiology of porphyria cutanea tarda.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with porphyria cutanea tarda.
- Summarize the management considerations for patients with porphyria cutanea tarda.
