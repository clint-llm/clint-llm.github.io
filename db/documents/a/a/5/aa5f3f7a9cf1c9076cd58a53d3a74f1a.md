A thymoma is a malignant epithelial tumor most commonly found in the prevascular mediastinum. It also can be found in the neck, pulmonary hilum, thyroid, lung, pleura, or pericardium. In gross examination; it is a well-circumscribed, tan, firm mass that ranges in size from microscopic to over 30 cm in diameter. It is lobulated with bands of fibrous stroma and, at times, cystic changes.

Thymic carcinomas lack a lobulated architecture in contrast to thymomas. They possess the cytoarchitectural features of carcinoma and lack immature T cell lymphocytes. Thymic carcinomas and thymomas can be synchronous. Thymomas at times can develop into carcinomas; however, they often take 10 to 14 years to do so. Grossly they are large, firm, infiltrating masses with numerous areas of cystic change and necrosis. Fifteen percent or less are encapsulated.
