The SVC is part of the low-pressure venous system containing thin walls susceptible to damage by a variety of pathologic mechanisms. These mechanisms can be divided into three categories which are compromised vessel anatomy, impaired venous flow, and diminished vessel wall integrity. These mechanisms often coexist in patients presenting with SVC syndrome. Extrinsic compression and obstruction of the SVC by a mass in the mediastinum is the most common cause of SVC syndrome. This is often associated with malignancy; however, there are a variety of nonmalignant masses as well as dilation of the overlying aorta that can cause compression. A growing proportion of SVC syndromes are now associated with occlusive venous thrombus formation that compromises venous flow back to the heart. The increasing use of indwelling intravascular devices such as catheters and pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) leads have played a major role in this growth. Resultant venous wall inflammation, fibrosis, and eventual thrombus lead to stenosis of the vessel itself.
