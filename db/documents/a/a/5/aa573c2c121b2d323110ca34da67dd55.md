Glimepiride is an insulin secretagogue and, like other sulfonylureas, is only effective in patients with residual pancreatic beta-cell activity. They act at ATP-dependent potassium channels on the cell membrane ofÂ pancreatic beta cells, causing iatrogenic depolarization by preventing potassium from exiting the cell. The depolarization activates voltage-dependent calcium channels on the cell membrane, leading to a rise in intracellular calcium and subsequent exocytosis of insulin into the bloodstream.
