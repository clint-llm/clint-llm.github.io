Patients with cerebellar infarction often present with vague symptoms.Â Clinical presentations can often be atypical or overlap, in particular with hemorrhagic infarcts. A high index of suspicion and adequate diagnostic skill is required to make a timely diagnosis and provide adequate treatment. When the disease is suspected, a specialized team of interprofessional clinicians and providers should be called to evaluate the case promptly and determine if emergent treatment is indicated.
