An episiotomy is a procedure developed to augment difficult vaginal deliveries while controlling for and avoiding potentially dangerous perineal lacerations during the delivery process. This activity outlines the clinical indications for episiotomy and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in ensuring proper use, understanding current recommendations, and caring for patients who undergo episiotomy. This includes, but is not limited to, history, different techniques, personnel, and post episiotomy care as it relates to all members of the healthcare team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for an episiotomy.
- Describe the anatomy in perineal tears and review the technique for an episiotomy.
- Review the evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of episiotomy.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to understand the utility of episiotomy better and improve outcomes for women and their families.
