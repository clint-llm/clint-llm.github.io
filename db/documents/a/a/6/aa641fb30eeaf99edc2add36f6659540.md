Patients with superficial thrombophlebitis typically present with a reddened, warm, inflamed, tender area overlying the track of a superficial vein. There is often a palpable cord. Some surrounding edema or associated pruritis may occur. Significant swelling of the limb is more commonly associated with DVT and should only be attributed to SVT after DVT has been excluded.

A careful history is critical to identify risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Initial presentation in patients older than 40 years without other risk factors should prompt consideration of underlying malignancy.
