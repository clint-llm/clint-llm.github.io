Idiopathic Harlequin syndrome is a benign self-limiting condition that typically resolves within minutes to hours when the trigger subsides. Treatment is often not necessary given the auto-resolutive nature of the syndrome. However, sudden dramatic facial discoloration may bring apprehension and anxiety among the patient and caretakers. Reassurance and counseling are the cornerstones of the management of this syndrome.

Harlequin face following regional anesthesia is primarily due to local anesthetic block of the thoracic sympathetic nerves. This usually subsides with the regression of the block over time. Head up position, lowering or stopping the local anesthetic infusion facilitates the regression. However, it signifies blockade of the T2 fibers and should be considered a warning sign of cephalad spread of the block, if not intentional.

Harlequin face resulting from compressive or retraction injury during neck surgeries may last for hours to days before complete resolution. However, injuries resulting in the complete transection of T2-T4 fibers may lead to permanent facial discoloration, which may be socially embarrassing and require treatment. Stellate ganglion block on the contralateral side is performed as a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure to block hyperemia and flushing over the intact side.

Responsive patients might benefit from repetitive stellate ganglion blockade or botulinum toxin injection.
