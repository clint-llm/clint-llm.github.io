Muscle biopsy in rhabdomyolysis is a necessary test when suspected metabolic myopathies. The timing of muscle biopsy is crucial in the identification of appropriate diseases. Excessive muscle fiber necrosis (hematoxylin and eosin stain) is associated with rhabdomyolysis, and obtaining a biopsy during acute injury may miss an underlying myopathy. The current literature recommends muscle biopsy only after complete recovery from rhabdomyolysis. EFNS panel of muscle specialists patients with muscle pain, weakness with 2 to 3 times CPK elevation, myoglobinuria, hypertrophic or atrophic muscles, and EMG suggestive of myopathy can undergo muscle biopsy at the time of presentation.

Kidney biopsy in patients with acute kidney injury from rhabdomyolysis shows multiple lesions. The earliest findings with tubular changes can be seen as early as 1 hour to 12 hours with light microscopies like dilated bowman space with the ruptured membrane at the glomerulus and reduced glomerular tufts with flattened podocytes. Significant necrosis with loss of microvilli and reduction in basal infolding is seen in the proximal convoluted tubule. Electron microscopy clearly shows electron-dense casts occupying the entire distal, tubular lumen.
