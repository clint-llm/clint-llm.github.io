Biopsies of the bulla or erosions, seen in drug-induced pemphigus vulgaris, can be visualized under light microscopy to show the separation of keratinocytes above the basal cell layer of the epidermis. Vesicles may also be seen containing separated keratinocytes in the suprabasal epidermis. In pemphigus foliaceus, the skin lesions are more superficial, and acantholysis and vesicle formation are seen in the granular layer of the epidermis. Direct immunofluorescence staining may reveal IgG antibodies to the Dsg1 and Dsg3 on the intercellular and transmembrane domains of keratinocytes within the epidermis. Analysis of the patient's serum using ELISA technique may also be used to identify IgG autoantibodies to the target antigens Dsg1 and/or Dsg3, which are present in the desmosomes of keratinocytes.
