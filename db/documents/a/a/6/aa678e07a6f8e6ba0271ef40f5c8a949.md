Leukemia cutis is rare, and the exact data on incidence and demographic predilections do not exist. However, children with congenital leukemia are prone to develop leukemia cutis, ranging from 25% to 30% of cases.

Majority of skin lesions occur in patients already diagnosed with leukemia (55% to 77%), cutaneous lesions may appear at the presentation of systemic leukemia (23% to 44%), or even precede the development of leukemia in the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow in 2% to 3% of cases.
