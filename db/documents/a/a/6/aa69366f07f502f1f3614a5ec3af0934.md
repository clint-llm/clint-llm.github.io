Complications with eyelid colobomas often cause decreased vision in the affected eye. Exposure keratopathy develops because the corneal surface cannot stay lubricated without eyelid coverage, and the tear film evaporates away. This can cause corneal epithelial breakdown, which allows for infectious keratitis. The abnormalities in the eyelid can lead to an alteration in the corneal curvature, causing astigmatism. If the astigmatism is not corrected, amblyopia can develop.

Amblyopia is highly associated with strabismus, which can also commonly be seen with eyelid coloboma.
