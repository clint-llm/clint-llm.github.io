Volvulus occurs when a loop of intestine twists around itself and the mesentery that supports it, causing bowel obstruction. Symptoms include abdominal distension, pain, vomiting, constipation, and bloody stools. The onset of symptoms may be insidious or sudden. The mesentery becomes so tightly twisted that blood supply becomes cut off, resulting in an ischemic bowel. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of colonic volvulus, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for developing volvulus.
- Summarize the complications associated with volvulus.
- Explain the common physical examination findings associated with volvulus.
- Describe the importance of coordination among the interprofessional team for prompt diagnosis and treatment of volvulus to improve outcomes for the affected patients.
