There are no specific risk factors for the development of BSNS. Broadly, hazardous industrial chemicals used in textiles, furniture, and leather processing and production are risk factors for all tumors of the paranasal sinuses.

At the genetic level, fluorescence-in-situ hybridization (FISH) is remarkable for a characteristic PAX3-MAML fusion protein that leads to the development of BSNS pathology.
