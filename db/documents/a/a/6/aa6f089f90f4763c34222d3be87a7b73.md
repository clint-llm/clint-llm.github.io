**Muscle Biopsy**

Muscle biopsy often shows the following findings, which can be diagnostic:

- Perivascular and perimysial inflammatory infiltrate:Â The infiltrate in dermatomyositis is concentrated around the perivascular and interfascicular regions and consists of B cells, CD4+ T helper cells, macrophages, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. In contrast to polymyositis, CD8+ T cells and NK cells are rarely present.

- Perifascicular atrophy: Atrophy of muscle fibers, especially around the periphery of fascicles, is a hallmark histopathological feature of dermatomyositis. Degenerating and regenerating muscle fibers may be observed in the perifascicular region.

- Microangiopathy: Injury to intramuscular blood vessels takes the form of immunoglobulin and complement (C5b-C9 membrane attack complex) deposits on endomysial capillaries. A reduced capillary density and endothelial hyperplasia may be observed.

**Skin Biopsy**

Skin biopsy findings in dermatomyositis are similar to those found in systemic lupus erythematosus. Typical findings include vacuolar changes of the basal layer, increased lymphocytic infiltrate, and increased mucin deposition in the dermis.
