The pathogenesis of palmoplantar psoriasis is similar to psoriasis in that there is an interplay between genetic factors and antigenic triggers. The most commonly associated human leukocyte antigen in psoriasis is HLA-Cw6. Psoriasis is related to the psoriasis-susceptibility [PSORS1] locus on chromosome 6p21, though the relation of this gene in palmoplantar psoriasis remains unclear. PSORS1 locus. Other studies have shown possible linkages to variations in the CARD14 gene and genes in the IL-19 subfamily in palmoplantar pustulosis.

Various antigenic triggers can initiate palmoplantar psoriasis or pustulosis in genetically susceptible individuals. Triggers, including stress, smoking, irritants, friction, and trauma, can activate dendritic cells and T cells, causing IL-20 to be produced locally, accelerating keratinocyte proliferation. At the same time, IL-23 is released from lymph nodes, recruiting Th1 and Th17 to the lesions. T-cells produce numerous cytokines, including TNF-a, IL-17, and IL-22, which stimulate keratinocytes to proliferate and produce proinflammatory antimicrobial peptides and cytokines. Lastly, neutrophils are recruited to the epidermis and activate dermal fibroblasts.
