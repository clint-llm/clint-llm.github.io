The prognosis of colovesicular fistulas is largely based on the underlying etiology. The most common cause of CVF is a benign diverticular disease with a favorable prognosis. Recent publications have shown that there is little to no difference in rates of septicemia, renal failure, and mortality when comparing surgical treatment to the nonsurgical, conservative management of CVF

- Complicated diverticular disease (abscess, fistula formation, strictures, and free perforation) is associated with a higher risk of colonic malignancy. There is about a 3% to 5% incidence of concomitant malignancy in patients who have uncomplicated diverticulitis and about an 11% incidence of harboring a malignancy for complicated diverticulitis.

- Patients who have the symptomatic diverticular disease should be evaluated with colonoscopy after acute infection subsides. This is especially true for complicated diverticular cases.

- Clinicians used to be taught that patients who suffer attacks of uncomplicated diverticulitis would subsequently have an increased chance of recurrence and increased chance of complicated disease with each subsequent attack. This has been proven false. Recent analyses of data have shown that patients are more likely to have complicated diverticulitis with their first attack and with each recurrent attack risk of complicated diverticulitis decreases.

- Elective colon resection is indicated for complicated diverticulitis as they have a high recurrence rate of up to 40%. Other indications for elective sigmoidectomy are more controversial.
