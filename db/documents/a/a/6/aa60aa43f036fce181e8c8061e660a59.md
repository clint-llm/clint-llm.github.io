The difference between a skeletal and dental crossbite includes:

- Dental Evaluation: When the incisors are in edge to edge relation, and the lower incisors are retroclined, compensated Class III malocclusion must be considered. A clinical evaluation of under jet in association with  Class III molar relation should be done, along with functional evaluation.

- Functional Evaluation: An assessment of the relation between the mandible and maxilla to determine any discrepancy in centric relation (CR) or centric occlusion (CO)

- Profile evaluation: An examination of the facial proportions, chin and face positions.

- Cephalometric evaluation:  Determine the position of the maxilla and the mandible.
