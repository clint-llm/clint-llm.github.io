Management of venous thromboembolism in people with factor V Leiden mutation is the same as that of the general population, and factor V Leiden mutation will not affect the decision about which anticoagulant one should use. The choice of anticoagulant is based on some factors like patient preference, adherence to therapy, the severity of thrombosis, and drug interactions.

Generally, direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are usually used for patients with typical VTE presentations. Warfarin is preferred if there is a concern about adherence or for those who present with a submassive/massive pulmonary embolism who would benefit from maintaining INR at the high end of the therapeutic range.

The duration of VTE treatment is not different between factor V Leiden and the general population, and it depends on the risk of recurrent VTE. It is highly recommended that one continue indefinite anticoagulation for unprovoked, life-threatening venous thromboembolism, VTE at an unusual location or if it is recurrent.

Individuals with factor V Leiden homozygous mutation who undergo surgery should be treated as a high-risk group and receive prophylactic anticoagulation.
