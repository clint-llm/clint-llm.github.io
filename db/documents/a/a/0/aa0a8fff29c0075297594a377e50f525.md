The main mechanism of action of methylene blue is reducing the oxidized form of hemoglobin Fe3+ when in a state of methemoglobinemia, to Fe2+. In turn, this will increase the oxygen-binding capacity of hemoglobin and thus increase oxygen delivery to tissues. This property is also exhibited by vitamin C, which is an alternative treatment option for methemoglobinemia. Methylene blue also inhibits the enzymes endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and guanylate cyclase, decreasing the amount of cGMP needed for nitrous oxide to be released, therefore causing vasoconstriction of blood vessels via inhibition of vascular smooth muscle relaxation.Plasmodium falciparum glutathione reductase, an enzyme that prevents the formation of byproducts formed by the Plasmodium species that triggers the body's immune response.
