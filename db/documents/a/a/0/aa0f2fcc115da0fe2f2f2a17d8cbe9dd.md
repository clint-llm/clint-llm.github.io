Andreas Vesalius first suggested the name " mitral " for the left-sided atrioventricular valve, given its resemblance with bishops' "miter."

MR can further classify as mild, moderate, and severe. Severe (or moderate-severe) MR is currently only recommended for catheter management. The echocardiogram is the primary tool used to assess the structure and function of the mitral valve- systolic competence and non-restriction during diastole. Severe MR is described as having a color flow jet that may be central and large (>6 cm or >30 percent of the left atrial area) or smaller, if eccentric, encircling the left atrium. Pulmonary vein flow may show systolic blunting or systolic flow reversal, vena contracta width >/=0.5 cm measured in the parasternal long-axis view, a regurgitant volume of >/=45 mL/beat, regurgitant fraction >/=40%, and/or regurgitant orifice area >/=0.30 cm^2 according to the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association.

**Pre-procedural Anatomical Considerations**

The successful grasp of mitral valve leaflets during the procedure requires certain conditions to be met. The leaflets must be pliable and non-calcified at the grasping site, and there must be no significant clefts or perforations. Additionally, the shorter MitraClip NT and NTW require a minimal posterior leaflet length of 6 mm, while the longer MitraClip XT and XTW require a minimal posterior leaflet length of 9 mm.

Patients with an extensive flail, defined as a flail segment width of 15 mm or greater or a flail gap of 10 mm or greater, were not included in the initial clinical trials for TEER therapy, such as EVEREST II.

The EVEREST II trial only included patients with a primary regurgitant mitral jet originating from the center of the mitral valve (A2-P2 segments).

When considering TEER in secondary MR, it is important to differentiate patients with preserved LV function and annular dilation (atrial functional MR) from patients with LV dysfunction and leaflet tethering. A subgroup analysis of the COAPT trial demonstrated that patients with atrial fibrillation who underwent TEER maintained a clinical benefit; however, they had a worse prognosis compared to patients without atrial fibrillation.

Mitral Annular Calcification (MAC) is a degenerative process that predominantly affects the mitral valve annulus and is frequently associated with mitral regurgitation

Up to 35% of patients who have undergone surgical MV repair at high volume centers of excellence develop moderate to severe MR 10 yrs. after initial repair.

Pre-procedural TEE examination also helps in predicting the difficulty of repair. The following table [Table4] summarizes the predictors
