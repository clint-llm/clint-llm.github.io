The mechanism of action of gemfibrozil implies activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), generating changes in the lipid metabolism, consequently decreasing plasmatic triglyceride levels and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The PPAR-alpha produces up-regulation of the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in the adipose tissue and muscle, leading to a reduction of the triglyceride levels. Gemfibrozil can inhibit peripheral lipolysis and decrease the hepatic removal of free fatty acids, consequently reducing hepatic triglyceride production. Gemfibrozil inhibits the synthesis and increases the clearance of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) carrier apolipoprotein B, leading to decreased VLDL production. The reduction in VLDL can cause plasma triglyceride levels to decrease by 30% to 60%. It may also increase HDL-cholesterol by an unknown mechanism.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Gemfibrozil is given orally, in two divided doses, nearly 30 minutes before breakfastÂ or dinner. Gemfibrozil is mostly protein-bound (99%). It is metabolized hepatically into inactive metabolites, and it is excreted in the urine (70%) and feces (6%). The drug's half-life is approximately 1.5 hours, with a peak serum time of roughly 1 to 2 hours.
