A long-term study of patients with hemochromatosis has shown that overall longevity was related to liver cirrhosis. In patients with hemochromatosis and no liver cirrhosis, long-term survival was unaffected. This reiterates the need for early diagnosis and treatment before cirrhosis develops. Frontline healthcare providers, including physicians, physician assistants, and nurses, should be knowledgeable on this topic to help identify cases at an early stage and initiate prompt, coordinated treatment.
