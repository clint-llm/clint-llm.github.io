Diagnosis is clinical. A skin biopsy can be performed to rule out other disorders. Dermoscopic evaluation will show brown pigmentation with white scales and a pattern of sulci and gyri.

Davis et al. proposed five criteria for the diagnosis of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis.

- Clinical findings of scaling brown macules and patches, part of which appear reticulated and papillomatous

- Involvement of the upper trunk and neck

- Fungal staining is negative for fungus

- No response to antifungal treatment

- Excellent response to minocycline

Jo et al. in 2014 proposed a change to the criteria.

- Scaly brown macules and patches with some appearing reticulated and papillomatous

- Involvement of the upper trunk, neck, or flexural areas

- Negative fungal staining or no response to antifungal treatment

- Excellent response to antibiotics

Differential diagnoses to consider are acanthosis nigricans, tinea versicolor, Dowling-Degos disease, Galli-Galli disease, dyskeratosis congenita, prurigo pigmentosa, terra firma-forme dermatosis, and Darier disease.
