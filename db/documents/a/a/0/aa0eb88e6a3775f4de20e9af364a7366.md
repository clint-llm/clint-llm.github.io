Lesions should be excised for histopathologic examination. On histopathology, spiradenomas show one or more large, sharply demarcated basophilic nodules of the dermis. Two types of cells are seen in the nodules. These cells are either small, dark, basaloid cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, or larger, pale, and with ovoid nuclei. Malignant spiradenomas demonstrate increased mitotic rates, necrosis, nuclear atypia, pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, loss of nested growth patterns, and loss of the dual cell population.

Imaging studies, including MRI, CT, or ultrasound can help to determine if metastatic foci are present in the case of malignant spiradenoma.
