A dose restriction exists for simvastatin 80 mg due to a higher risk of myopathy and possible rhabdomyolysis, especially within the first 12 months of use. Therefore, the 80-mg strength is restricted for only those patients who have been on the 80-mg regimen for 12 or more months with no reported myopathy. Simvastatin 80 mg is not recommended for patients with LDL targets that are not at goal, even with simvastatin 40 mg. Recommendations are to use a high-intensity statin instead. For stable patients on the simvastatin 80-mg dose, a change of therapy is necessary if initiating an interacting medication.

*Doses are adjusted to target goal LDL levels.

**Dose Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary with simvastatin when taken concomitantly with certain pharmacotherapy. Adjustments in simvastatin strength reduce potential statin-associated toxicities, including fatigue and myopathy.
