Atypical hyperplasia lesions are usually discovered incidentally on routine screening mammograms, often during breast biopsies performed for evidence of calcifications on imaging or in conjunction with other lesions, both benign and malignant. As atypical hyperplasia is a high-risk but non-malignant lesion, it is important to discuss breast cancer risk factors, such as estrogen exposure and family history of breast cancer.

General physical exam to include focused breast exam is vital to the patient evaluation, although atypical hyperplasia itself is very unlikely to be appreciated on the physical exam due to its small size, as a solitary focus of ADH that is larger than 0.2 cm is more likely to be designated as DCIS.
