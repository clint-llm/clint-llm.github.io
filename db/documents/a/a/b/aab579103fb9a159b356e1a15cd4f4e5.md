It is crucial to keep a wide differential with any patient who presents with a complaint of tinnitus. While conducting a thorough history and physical, it is important to note the onset, laterality, duration, associated symptoms, and whether symptoms coincide with certain activities. CNV innervates the TT and tensor veli palatini (TVP) muscles. Due to the attachment of the TT muscle onto the malleus, during a spasm, the malleus is pulled anteromedially with inward movement of the tympanic membrane. This can be contrasted to otoscopic findings for stapedius myoclonus, in which movement of the posterior quadrant of the tympanic membrane has been reported. However, these otoscopic findings are subjective, not specific, and still not widely accepted. During swallowing, the TVP is activated to assist in elevating the palate. Due to this dual innervation by CNV, the TT muscle can be activated and possibly cause tinnitus in some patients. Additionally, CNV innervates the sensory component of the corneal reflex. As such, the corneal reflex can also activate the TT muscle, which can cause TT syndrome in some patients. Although theÂ physical exam is largely unremarkable, some features can lead clinicians to suspect TT syndrome. For example, while conducting an otoscopic exam, rhythmic movements of the tympanic membrane have been described at rest and even during blinking. Additionally, while considering TT syndrome as a diagnosis, palatal myoclonus must be ruled out by direct visualization of the palate and whether it coincides with reported tinnitus symptoms. Patulous Eustachian tube with a common primary complaint of autophony must also be ruled out by tubo-tympano-aerodynamography. The more definitive way of diagnosing any MEM is by tympanotomy and direct visualization of the muscle spasm. MEM is characterized as objective tinnitus, so auscultation of the ear can be helpful during a physical exam.
