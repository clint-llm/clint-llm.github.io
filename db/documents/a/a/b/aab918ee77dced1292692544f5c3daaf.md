The exact mechanism and pathophysiology are not well defined. In animal models, it was associated with air bubbles that lead to profound sensorineural hearing loss by the disruptions of the propagation of the acoustic waves traveling in the basilar membrane.

The pneumolabyrinth itself may cause severe irritation leading to severe rotational vertigo. Because the labyrinth is connected to the cochlea, fistula formation can lead to sensorineural loss and vertigo. Additionally, those fistulas that arise with cholesteatoma can cause erosion of the endochondral bone that overlies the labyrinth leading to fistulas.
