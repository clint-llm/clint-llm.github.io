The procedure started with a local anesthetic injection at the site of catheter insertion. Some IV sedative medicines are also given to help the patient relax before the procedure. After identifying the site of insertion just above the vessel in the groin, the doctor inserts an introducer into the vessel which helps with the later introduction of the catheter through the vessel into the heart. Following catheterization, the practitioner begins injecting contrast dye from the IV line to check the exact place of catheter and valve. As he or she approaches the required position, the balloon is inflated, forcing the calcified valve leaflets open. By fracturing the calcified deposits within the leaflets, the inflated balloon relieves the stenosis. After that, the practitioner deflates the balloon and removes the catheter.
