Nasal polyposis should be suspected in patients with progressive nasal obstruction, nasal and/or facial congestion, rhinorrhea, and decreased sense of smell (cardinal symptoms of CRS). Patients should be inquired about sensitivity to aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the presence of asthma (Samter's triad). Unilaterality of symptoms, history of the epistaxis, history of chronic otitis media, recurrent bronchitis, and/or pneumonia should alert the clinician about other possible etiologies.

Physical examination should include an anterior rhinoscopy, where polyps and other neoplasms can be readily visible at times. Nasal polyposis is a clinical diagnosis based on anterior rhinoscopy or a nasal endoscopic examination. Imaging studies, such as computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses (PNS CT scan), are sometimes necessary to assess the severity of the disease, and can aid in surgical planning, if indicated. The presence of nasal polyps with two cardinal symptoms confirms the diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. Presentation ranges from asymptomatic persons to patients with severely affected QOL. The latter may require the services of an otolaryngologist, as surgery may be required to begin their definitive treatment.
