**History and Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) Exam**

Before performing the actual olfactory testing, it is important to take a thorough history and perform a physical exam.

**General Concept of Olfactory Testing**

Olfactory impairment may be quantitative (= impairment of the strength) and/or qualitative (= impairment of the quality or degree of distortion). Olfactory testing primarily provides information about quantitative impairment, while history gives crucial information on qualitative impairment (such as distortion).

The general concept of olfactory testing in the clinic is that an olfactory probe is presented at the patient’s nostrils, and the response of the patient is documented. This is also referred to as psychophysical testing.

**Odor Threshold Tests**

For odor threshold tests, probes with either phenyl ethyl alcohol or n-butanol in increasing concentration are presented sequentially and typically intermixed with probes with no odor (“blanks”).

**Suprathreshold Tests of Olfaction**

Suprathreshold tests use odor concentrations that are detectable by the patient. The most common suprathreshold tests used are odor identification tests such as the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) and the odor identification test with pen-like odor dispensing devices.

Another variant of suprathreshold tests for olfaction is a test for the hedonic value of an odor.

**Tests to Screen for Gustatory Abilities**

Patients often report impairment of taste when they have an impairment of smell.

**Subjective Olfactory Self-assessment**

We do not always become aware of olfactory signals (or their absence) and their impact on our behavior.
