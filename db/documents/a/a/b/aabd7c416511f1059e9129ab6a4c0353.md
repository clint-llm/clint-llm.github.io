As mentioned, the physiology of a newborn is constantly evolving to adapt to extrauterine life. It is important to note these changes and ensure proper development at the appropriate times. For instance, it is essential for the infant, while taking its first breath, to shut down and remodel the intrauterine cardiovascular shunts present in the infant's body. Failure to do so can cause physiological imbalances, such as inadequate oxygenation of the brain. Additionally, it is important to understand what nutrition the infant lacks in the newborn period that requires supplementation. For instance, a newborn infant is deficient in vitamin K, putting it at risk for a hemorrhagic disease. To prevent this, all infants born should be given vitamin K prophylaxis.
