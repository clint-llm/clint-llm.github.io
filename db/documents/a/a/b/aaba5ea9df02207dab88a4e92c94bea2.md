Histopathology is the gold standard for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis. Early in the disease, the histopathological changes are confined to the region of the internal or external elastic lamina or adventitia or sometimes only vasa vasorum. Later in the disease, transmural inflammation with intimal thickening and marked inflammation of the inner portion of media adjacent to the internal elastic lamina are evident. In addition to the inflammatory infiltrate, other histopathological features of GCA are luminal narrowing, intimal proliferation, and disruption of the internal elastic lamina. Thrombotic changes can be seen at active sites.

Fibrinoid necrosis is not a feature of GCA and usually indicates alternate diagnoses such as ANCA-associated vasculitis. Inflammation is often segmental, leading to skip lesions. Inflammatory infiltrate typically consists of CD4+ T-cells and macrophages. Histiocytes, plasma cells, and fibroblasts are frequently present, while neutrophils and eosinophils are very rarely seen. Multinucleated giant cells are present in only 50% of the cases of GCA and are not a requirement for the diagnosis of GCA.
