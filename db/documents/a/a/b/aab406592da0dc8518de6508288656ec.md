Ubiquitination is a three-step process involving three enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3). E1 activates ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent manner, enabling its transfer onto the ubiquitin carrier enzyme, E2. Activated ubiquitin is then transferred by the ubiquitin protein ligase, E3, to a substrate protein. Monoubiquitination acts as a signal for nonproteolytic events such as endocytosis, histone regulation, DNA repair, virus budding, and nuclear export. Ubiquitin can also be attached to a target protein in polyubiquitination, where multiple ubiquitin molecules are attached to a single lysine (Lys) residue. Ubiquitin contains seven different lysine residues that can potentially be used for ubiquitin-chain extension.

Lys48-linked polyubiquitination generally is associated with the degradation of target proteins by the 26S proteasome system, whereas Lys63-linked polyubiquitination is involved in DNA repair, signal transduction, and endocytosis but not degradation. E3 ubiquitin ligases are a large family of proteins (with almost 700 in the human genome) that are known to regulate the turnover and activity of proteins with diverse functions. E3 ligases are divided into two large groups: the homology to the E6-associated protein carboxyl terminus (HECT) domain-containing E3 ligases and the Really Interesting New Gene (RING) domain-containing E3 ligases. The RING-type E3 ligases include single subunit E3 ligases (such as Cbl family E3 ligases) and multi-subunit E3 ligases (such as Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases). The 26S proteasome system is composed of 28 related protein subunits that are arranged as four heptameric staggered rings.
