The development of the BBB is a multistep process beginning with angiogenesis. Pre-existing vessels sprout into the embryonic neuroectoderm, giving rise to new vessels which exhibit many BBB properties, including the expression of TJs. Barrier properties of the BBB mature as growing vessels come into contact with pericytes and astroglia. This process includes the elaboration of TJs, decreased transcytosis, downregulation of leukocyte adhesion molecules, and increased efflux transporter expression. Sealing of inter-endothelial TJs is completed during maturation and must be maintained throughout life.

Many known cellular and molecular mechanisms mediate brain angiogenesis, with ongoing research focusing on more CNS-specific pathways (Wnt/Beta-catenin) and molecules (GPR124) as crucial in the differentiation and maturation of the BBB.
