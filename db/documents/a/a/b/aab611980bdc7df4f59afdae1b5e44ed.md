For olfactory impairment caused by damage to the olfactory neurons due to trauma, there is no specific treatment. However, olfactory neurons do have the ability to regenerate. But the time and degree of regeneration depend on the extent of damage, and there is a difference in regenerative abilities between individuals. Regeneration can span over the course of days to years, and complete recovery is not a guarantee.
