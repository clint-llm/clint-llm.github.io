Peripheral nerve injuries frequently occur as a consequence of trauma. They may arise from various mechanisms, including laceration, contusion, stretching, compression, and iatrogenic injury. Although generally not life-threatening, they can significantly affect a patient's daily activities and overall quality of life. Restoration of nerve continuity will aid in functional recovery. Autologous nerve grafting is the gold standard treatment for the reconstruction of a nerve gap. The sural nerve is a valuable source for a nerve graft of good diameter and length, being the most common donor site utilized in current medical practice. This activity aims to describe in detail the surgical technique for sural nerve harvesting.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the indications and main clinical applications for the use of an autologous nerve graft.
- Describe the pertinent anatomy of the sural nerve that will enable the reader to harvest the graft effectively and safely. 
- Outline the sural nerve graft open harvest technique in a step-by-step fashion and briefly report other harvesting methods. 
- Identify some interprofessional strategies that will benefit the patient when performing a sural nerve graft procedure.
