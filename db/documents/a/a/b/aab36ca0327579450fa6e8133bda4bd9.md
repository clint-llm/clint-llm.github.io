The diagnosis and management of infantile botulism are best done with an interprofessional team that consists of a pediatrician, nurse practitioner, primary care provider, anesthesiologist, and an infectious disease specialist. Until the diagnosis is confirmed, continue supportive care for the patient. With any patient, first assess and stabilize the airway, breathing, and circulation. Approximately 50% of infantile botulism cases will require intubation and an advanced airway regardless of whether they are treated with human BIG-IV; however, those who are not treated may require mechanical ventilation longer. As a result, a clinician should have a very low threshold to intubate a patient. This will require careful monitoring and admission to the intensive care unit. The pharmacist should make sure that the infant is on no medications that can potentiate the neuromuscular weakness

Human BIG-IV has shown to decrease the length of hospital stay and the length of mechanical ventilation. It is a single dose treatment that is infused intravenously over 30 minutes. With treatment, most infants do recover, but many may require physical therapy for months or even years. Fortunately, recurrence is very rare. Mothers should be educated on the importance of handwashing. Close communication between the clinicians is vital to avoid the high mortality of infantile botulism. [Level 5]
