When kidney biopsies are done, there is visible evidence of direct damage to the renal tubular epithelial cells by the contrast dye. One may note the presence of interstitial inflammation, cell vacuolization, and patch necrosis. ThisÂ damage to the cells is usually evident within the first 7-10 days of the injury.

Direct toxic effects of contrast media on tubular epithelial cells are characterized by the following:

- Cell vacuolization

- Interstitial inflammation

- Cellular necrosis

These characteristic changes, known as osmotic nephrosis, were noted in 22.3% of patients in a study. These patients underwent renal biopsy within 10 days of contrast exposure.
