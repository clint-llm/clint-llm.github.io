Many facilities have protocols in place to evaluate for chest pain, but at a minimum, the provider should orderÂ the following:

- Electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably in the first 10min of arrival (consider serial ECGs)

- Chest x-ray

- Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), troponin level (consider serial troponin levels 4hr apart), lipase

- Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if you are considering PE or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan if CTPA is contraindicated

- Bedside ultrasound (US) if you are considering pericardial tamponade
