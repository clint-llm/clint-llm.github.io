In adults, doses of carbamazepine exceeding 24 grams have correlated with fatal outcomes. Acute toxicity appears after 1 to 3 hours of intake and presents with neuromuscular disturbances. Patients have impaired consciousness leading to coma, tremor, restlessness, athetoid movements, psychomotor disturbances, dizziness, drowsiness, mydriasis, and nystagmus. Initially, patients experience hyperreflexia, but during intoxication, they progress into a state of hyporeflexia. Cardiac, vascular signs are generally mild with low toxicity, but with doses higher than 60 grams, severe cardiac dysfunction can occur.Â In cases of acute toxicity, respiratory depression, ECG abnormalities, tachycardia, shock, and urinary retention require monitoring and management to avoid end-organ damage. Treatment of an overdose focuses on eliminating the drug by inducing vomiting, gastric lavage, activated charcoal, and forced diuresis. Gastric lavage is indicated even after 4 hours of indigestion.
