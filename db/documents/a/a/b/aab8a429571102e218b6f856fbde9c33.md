Irrespective of underlying etiology, evaluation should include the following components:

- Assessment of best-corrected visual acuity

- Pupillary reactions

- Extraocular motility

- Confrontational visual fields

- Intraocular pressure

- External exam including assessment of preauricular lymph nodes and periorbital signs of erythema or edema

- Eyelid examination for hyperpigmentation, erythema, edema, rash/vesicles, discharge

- Discharge should be categorized as purulent, mucopurulent, mucoid, or watery – purulent discharge can reform as soon as it is cleared from the eye; mucoid discharge adheres to the eyelashes and appears sticky; watery discharge is clear and copious – if a purulent discharge is found, a culture should be sent

- Eversion of the eyelids to examine the palpebral conjunctiva, especially to evaluate for the presence of follicles, papillae, or pseudomembranes

- Examination of the bulbar and forniceal conjunctiva for injection and chemosis as well as the geographic pattern of injection

- Fluorescein staining and subsequent examination with either a Wood lamp or slit-lamp microscope or direct ophthalmoscope utilizing a cobalt blue filter to evaluate for presence and pattern of corneal abrasions, microtrauma, or epithelial defects; if a herpetic infection is suspected, particular attention to identifying dendritic/pseudodendritic lesions is necessary. More specific testing can be considered depending on underlying etiology suspicion

- Schirmer testing can evaluate tear production in suspected cases of keratoconjunctivitis sicca

- Corneal sensation testing is an option in cases of suspected herpetic viral infection which can cause decreased corneal sensitivity

- Tear osmolarity has been increasing in popularity and shows elevated tear film osmolarity in patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca

- Rapid sequence adenoviral testing is available in cases of suspected epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, however, most commonly this is a clinical diagnosis

- If keratoconjunctivitis sicca is suspected, the provider might consider initial testing for Sjogren syndrome by serum antibody testing of SS-A (anti-Ro) and SS-B (anti-La)
