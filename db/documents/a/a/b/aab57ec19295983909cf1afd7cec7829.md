Typically, pediatric foreign body ingestion is accidental, although deliberate ingestion can also occur. Most cases occur in children due to the ingestion of small objects. Children with psychological impairment are also at high risk for infesting foreign bodies.

Button/disc batteries may cause serious injury if lodged in the esophagus, nose, ear, or another orifice for even a brief period.  The highest risk is associated with larger lithium-based batteries, but all models carry some risk. Children with suspected button/disc battery ingestion should be managed urgently; a battery lodged in the esophagus should be removed without delay. Treatment algorithms for button/disc battery ingestions are widely available.

Small, powerful magnets, such as those found in some toys and games, may cause serious injury to the intestines, as the strong attraction between two or more magnets may cause them to erode through intervening tissues.

Preexisting GI tract abnormalities, such as previous surgery, strictures, fistulas, diverticula, or functional abnormalities, increases the risk of a swallowed foreign body becoming lodged at the site of the abnormality.
