Essential equipment is minimal and includes the following:

**Preoperatively**

- Local anesthetic (typically lidocaine 0.5% with epinephrine 1:200,000 and buffered with sodium bicarbonate)

- 3 cc syringe(s)

- 30 gauze needle(s)

- Antiseptic scrub

- Surgical marker

- Foil or other material for a template of defect

**Intraoperatively**

- Sterile drape

- Scalpel with #15 blade

- Toothed forceps

- Serrated scissors (for trimming away fat from graft)

- Suture scissors

- Needle holders

- Normal saline

- Sterile gauze

- Absorbable suture (for subcutaneous/deep stitches)

- Cutaneous suture (non-absorbable or absorbable)

- Ideally, an electrosurgical device should be available for hemostasis

**Postoperatively**

- Nonstick dressing

- Petrolatum-infused gauze strip or other material to form a bolster over the graft site. This may be sutured or taped securely in place to provide some pressure and to keep graft immobilized.

- Sterile ointment (author prefers sterile petrolatum to antibiotic ointment as significant numbers of patients develop allergies to bacitracin and neomycin, while their ability to decrease infection is minimal)

- Adhesive dressing, preferably hypoallergenic and stretchy.

- Additional adhesive liquid may be used to further secure dressing
