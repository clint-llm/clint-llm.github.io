Approximately one in 675 United States hospital admissions each year (50,000 cases annually) is due to osteomyelitis. Patients with diabetes, intravenous (IV) drug abusers and other immunocompromised individuals are at increased risk for osteomyelitis.

Post-traumatic osteomyelitis accounts for almost 50% of cases. Other major causes are neuropathy (mostly in diabetics) and hematogenous seeding (primarily seen in children).

Overall, resolution and healing rates for primary osteomyelitis treated with surgery and antibiotics is between 35% and 100%. It can be inferred that between 70% and 80% of patients treated for primary osteomyelitis will be cured. Long-term osteomyelitis recurrence rates can range between 20% and 30 %. When appropriate medical and surgical interventions fail, the infection progresses or recurs, or the infection is in an area associated with high morbidity and mortality, adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen treatments should be considered.
