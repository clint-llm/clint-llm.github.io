Two routes of administration, subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV), have been studied in human subjects.

Anifrolumab 300 mg IV appeared to be more efficacious as it achieved a higher Cmax and shorter Tmax. Researchers did not measure bioavailability in this study; however, there was a quantifiable serum anifrolumab concentration in the treatment groups at least 28 days after the initial dose. Serum concentrations dropped below a detectable threshold by 84 days post-dose. In the MUSE study, anifrolumab 300 or 1000 mg IV was administered every four weeks for 48 weeks to the treatment groups. Interestingly, it exhibited non-linear pharmacokinetics via trends in trough concentrations.
