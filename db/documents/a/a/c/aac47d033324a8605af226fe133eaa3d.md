The evaluation should exclude a cardiogenic source; this can be done by echocardiogram to assess any changes in left ventricular ejection fraction or acute changes in the heart's systolic or diastolic function. If the etiology is unclear from physical examination or echocardiogram, definitive evaluation is possible by assessing pulmonary capillary wedge pressure; wedge pressure of less than 18 mmHg will rule out a cardiogenic etiology. Chest imaging should be next, which, if ARDS is of concern, will show bilateral infiltrates. Arterial blood gas will reveal a PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F ratio) of less than 300 in ARDS.
