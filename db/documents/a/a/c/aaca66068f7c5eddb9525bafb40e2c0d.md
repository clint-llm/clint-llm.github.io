Pelvic exenteration is a major multi-visceral operative procedure with significant risks of morbidity and mortality. Pre-operative evaluation of the patient should proceed with the gravity of the procedure as a guide.

For patients being considered for PE related to malignancy, histologic confirmation is imperative. The evaluation has two primary goals: confirm the absence of metastatic disease and assess the patient’s fitness to withstand an extended operative procedure with significant blood loss and fluid shifts.

CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis along with PET scan are instrumental in searching for possible metastatic lesions. Open or directed biopsies are necessary for pathologic review of any suspicious abnormalities. High-resolution pelvic MRI is valuable to define the local extension of the lesion to adjacent pelvic structures.

Cystoscopy, vaginal examination, and lower GI endoscopy are usually necessary to establish a diagnosis and to determine the extent of pelvic visceral involvement.

Medical specialists play a key role in determining the patient’s cardiopulmonary reserve and optimization for pelvic exenteration. Potential extensive blood loss and fluid shifts, and surgical stress are to be anticipated. Anesthesia evaluation will determine the appropriate general and/or regional techniques to be employed. Adequate blood components should be secured and available. Along with the critical care physicians, the specialists' responsibilities will continue in the post-operative phase.

With a multi-visceral resection, multiple surgical teams are frequently required or should be on standby for all contingencies that can be anticipated. With a lead surgeon, a specific plan of surgery will be developed with the goal of completely resecting the lesion with R0 margins.

Once a surgical plan is finalized, the enterostomal therapist will need to educate and mark the patient for needed ostomies. Physical therapy should be involved with pre-conditioning and planning post-operative recovery.

Patients needing PE are frequently malnourished. Total parenteral nutrition might be indicated prior to surgery and continued with an anticipated delay for the return of adequate bowel function.

Patients undergoing pelvic exenteration are in a high-risk category for pulmonary embolism. Mechanical compression devices would be appropriate without increasing the risks of bleeding. Chemical prophylaxis should be individualized by the surgeons weighing the risks of intra-operative bleeding against the potential for a clinically significant pulmonary embolism.

Much attention is directed toward evaluating the patient's physical condition to tolerate PE. Clearly determining the potential for a curative resection is also central to the planning. The members of the caregiving team must also assess the patient's psychosocial inventory to whether pelvic exenteration with the anticipated prolonged recovery and image changes.
