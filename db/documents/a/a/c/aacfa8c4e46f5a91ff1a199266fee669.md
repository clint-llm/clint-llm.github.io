Pediatric ophthalmologists are typically the physicians who treat amblyopia, although optometrists also have experience in treatment. It is critically important that the patients are referred to a provider that has training in amblyopia treatment because mismanagement of this condition can lead to irreversible vision loss. The first provider to suspect amblyopia often will not be an ophthalmologist or optometrist. It may be a pediatrician, family doctor, nurse, or medical assistant.Â Family members spend more time with the patients and may be the first to notice preferential fixation of the non-amblyopic eye. Many cases of amblyopia will be caught during vision screenings. These screening programs are critical to catching amblyopia early.
