Howell-Jolly bodies appear in peripheral blood smears in patients with absent or deficient spleen function. They are pathognomonic for splenic dysfunction, but can be found in a long list of disorders:Â post-splenectomy, sepsis, congenital disorders, sickle cell hemoglobinopathies, alcoholism, lupus and other autoimmune disorders, and post-bone marrow transplantation. Other less common causes are gastrointestinal diseases (Celiac, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases), neoplastic disorders, splenic vascular thrombosis, amyloidosis, elderly, post-methyldopa treatment, and post-high-dose corticosteroid treatment.

Other erythrocyte inclusions exist and should be distinguished from Howell-Jolly bodies. These include basophilic stippling, Pappenheimer bodies, Heinz bodies, and Howell-Jolly body-like inclusions in neutrophils. These will be discussed further in clinical significance.
