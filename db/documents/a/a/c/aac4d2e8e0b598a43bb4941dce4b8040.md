Perinephric abscesses can cause severe illness. The severity of the disease depends on the extent of the infection and the comorbidities of the patient. The average hospital stay was 15.3 days in a Korean study of 63 patients with renal and perinephric abscesses.  Significant predictors of poor prognosis and longer hospital stay include advanced age, diabetes mellitus, abscess size, lethargy, and renal insufficiency.
