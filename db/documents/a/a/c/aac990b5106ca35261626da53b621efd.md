Neurotransmitters are endogenous chemicals that allow neurons to communicate with each other throughout the body. They enable the brain to provide a variety of functions, through the process of chemical synaptic transmission. These endogenous chemicals are integral in shaping everyday life and functions.

Chemical synaptic transmission primarily through the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic neural cells to postsynaptic receptors. Alterations in the levels of specific neurotransmitters have been observed in various neurological disorders, including Parkinson disease, schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer disease.
