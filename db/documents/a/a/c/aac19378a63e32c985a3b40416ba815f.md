The most common complications of a labyrinthine fistula are hearing loss and vertigo. Complications are also seen in post-surgical fistula repairs. These include tympanic membrane ruptures, postoperative hearing loss, and chorda tympani injuries.

Superior canal dehiscence syndrome can also arise as a complication, which is believed to be a variant of the fistula, but not caused by a true fistula (rather a communication between the superior bony canal and middle cranial fossa), may cause some unique phenomena, such as hearing oneâ€™s own voice, heartbeat, and eye movements. Pressure changes induced by performing a Valsalva maneuver with pinched nostrils (or otherwise straining) may provoke nystagmus and/or oscillopsia and vertigo.
