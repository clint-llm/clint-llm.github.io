Breast augmentation is a surgical procedure designed to enhance the size of the patient's breasts, using implants (saline or silicone) or fat transfer. The implants are placed in a retroglandular or retropectoral fashion within the breast. One possible complication after surgical augmentation using saline or silicone implants is implant rupture. This activity explains the risk factors, evaluation, and management of breast implant rupture and highlights the importance of the interprofessional team in enhancing care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical presentation of patients with breast implant rupture.
- Outline the evaluation of patients with breast implant rupture.
- Explain the treatment strategies for breast implant rupture.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and management of breast implant rupture and optimize outcomes.
