Any heart defect that leads to the development of PAH can cause Eisenmenger syndrome. This is commonly seen in atrial septal defects (ASD), ventricular septal defects (VSD), atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), but can occur in more complex lesions as well. Unrepaired Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) may also result in Eisenmenger syndrome.

Without early repair, reversal of a left-to-right shunt may result in a bidirectional or right-to-left shunt. The subsequent hypoxemia due to this shunt may not be responsive to oxygen.
