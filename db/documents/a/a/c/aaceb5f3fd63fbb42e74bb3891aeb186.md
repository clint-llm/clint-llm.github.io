The heart sits obliquely behind and slightly to the left of the sternum, with the atria more superiorly positioned in the direction of the right shoulder, and the ventricles lie anterior and inferior ending approximately at the left nipple. The right ventricle (RV) is the most anterior chamber of the heart typically at the fourth intercostal space. The right atrium sends blood to the right ventricle in a right-to-left and superior-to-inferior direction via the tricuspid valve. The left atrium simultaneously sends blood to the left ventricle (LV) in parallel via the mitral valve. The ascending aorta takes off anteriorly from the left ventricle heading behind the sternum to the right before it courses superiorly and to the patientâ€™s left.
