Ustekinumab is a well-tolerated drug with a favorable safety profile. No dose-related or cumulative toxicity was observed during follow-up studies.

There have been reports of the rapid development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in those patients treated with ustekinumab. These patients often had risk factors for developing this type of cancer, such as being older (greater than 60) and having undergone phototherapy or other immunosuppressant treatment. Patients should be monitored closely for the development of non-melanoma skin cancers.
