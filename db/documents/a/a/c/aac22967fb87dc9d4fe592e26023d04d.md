A uterine rupture is a complete division of all three layers of the uterus. Most uterine ruptures occur when the uterus is gravid in the setting of a trial of labor after cesarean delivery. Clinicians must remain vigilant for signs and symptoms of uterine rupture as it is associated with serious morbidity and mortality for both the mother and fetus. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of uterine rupture and explains the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.
