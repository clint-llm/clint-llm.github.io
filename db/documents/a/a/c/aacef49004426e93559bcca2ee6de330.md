**Vertigo**

Caloric testing is a bedside test that isolates the peripheral vestibular system and eliminates central etiologies of vertigo.

Bithermal caloric testing is typically performed when there is a high suspicion of a peripheral lesion. However, in cases with a low pretest probability of a peripheral lesion, monothermic caloric testing may be appropriate; in these circumstances, the test can be stopped when it is negative. A negative test reveals symmetric responses and is most consistent with a central etiology of vertigo.

Caloric testing offers advantages over other testing methods, such as the vestibular evoked myogenic potential and video head impulse test. Caloric testing does not require head movement and renders better compliance in patients whose symptoms worsen with movement and those with limited cervical mobility.

**Brainstem Testing**

Another indication for caloric testing is brain stem assessment in comatose patients. As described above, the VOR arc requires an intact brain stem; therefore, a lack of nystagmus could indicate a brainstem lesion.
