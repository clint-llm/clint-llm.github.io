Herpetic whitlow is typically a clinical diagnosis. Patients may report local trauma preceding infection, especially to the nail cuticle, although they often deny a history of injury. There is often exposure to the herpes virus via autogenous or exogenous contact with cold sores (herpes labialis) or genital herpes infection. Coexisting primary oral herpetic lesions suggest autoinoculation.

Patients will often experience pain and tingling in the finger before any skin changes (prodromal phase).

Vesicular fluid is clear early on but may become turbid, seropurulent, or hemorrhagic as it progresses. There should not be frank pus unless a bacterial superinfection is present. In immunocompromised patients (particularly acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with a CD4 count of less than 50), ulceration and necrosis may be seen.
