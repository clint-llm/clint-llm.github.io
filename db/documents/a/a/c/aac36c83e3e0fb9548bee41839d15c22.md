Braxton Hicks contractions are caused when the muscle fibers in the uterus tighten and relax. The exact etiology of Braxton Hicks contractions is unknown. However, there are known circumstances that trigger Braxton Hicks contractions including when the woman is veryÂ active, when the bladder is full, following sexual activity, and when the woman is dehydrated. A commonality among all these triggers is the potential for stress to the fetus, and the need for increased blood flow to the placenta to provide fetal oxygenation.
