In the perioperative arena, the clinical significance of gastric ultrasound depends on the urgency of surgery. For elective procedures, cases should be canceled or postponed if the stomach contains solids, thick liquids, or a volume of clear fluids exceeding 1.5 ml/kg.

In emergency procedures or those in which gastric emptying is unpredictable or may not improve with time (e.g., gastroparesis), the risk of aspiration and optimal timing of the case should be discussed with the patient and proceduralist. The anesthetic plan should include full aspiration precautions if the case must proceed. The patient should receive no sedation to preserve airway protective reflexes, or if sedation must be used, the airway should be protected with a rapid sequence induction and endotracheal intubation. Depending on the circumstances, the stomach should be decompressed with a nasogastric or oral gastric tube either before induction of anesthesia or following intubation.
