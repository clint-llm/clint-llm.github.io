There are few effective strategies to prevent perianal abscess in an otherwise healthy patient. Keeping the perianal area clean and dry to avoid skin breakdown can be helpful. High fiber diets may theoretically reduce the chance of anal gland blockage, but there is no real evidence to confirm that as an effective treatment. If the patient has an underlying etiology such as Crohn's or HIV, then treatment of that condition can help reduce the risk of developing a perianal abscess.
