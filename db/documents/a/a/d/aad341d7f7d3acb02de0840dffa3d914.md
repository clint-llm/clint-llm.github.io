Usual postoperative complications such as bleeding, wound infection, subcutaneous emphysema, or neurological and vascular compromise are often managed conservatively. Complications that require emergency management are airway obstruction, stent aspiration, hematoma, and pneumothorax. Airway obstruction is managed with intubation or emergency tracheostomy, while stent aspiration requires urgent bronchoscopy for foreign object removal. Management of hematoma and pneumothorax is by drainage. Mucus and secretions can also cause airway obstruction and require immediate suction. Other complications include stenosis recurrence, chronic aspiration, infection, keel extrusion, chondritis, dysphonia, granulation tissue formation, and tracheostomy dependence.
