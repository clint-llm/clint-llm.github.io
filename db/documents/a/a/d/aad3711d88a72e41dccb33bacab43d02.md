FEP is not related to sun exposure. Development of FEP may be related to activation of the Hedgehog pathway by mutation of PTCH (patched transmembrane molecule), which decreases the negative regulation of the Hedgehog pathway. This is known to occur in some basal cell carcinomas and may also play a role in the development of FEP. Ionizing radiation has also been implicated.
