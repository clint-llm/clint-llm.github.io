Hypertriglyceridemia in many cases is multifactorial, resulting from the combination of genetic factors and other causes of increased production and or impaired clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLP)s. A severe elevation of triglycerides (TG) increases a person's risk for pancreatitis and requires lowering by lifestyle change and pharmacotherapy in addition to evaluation of underlying etiology. Although statin therapy has improved atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes, residual risk remains. In this setting of residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) has been shown in many studies to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), but data does not show definite evidence that cardiovascular disease risk diminishes with the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hypertriglyceridemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the recommended management of hypertriglyceridemia.
- Outline the typical presentation for a patient with hypertriglyceridemia.
- Review the pathophysiology of hypertriglyceridemia.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with hypertriglyceridemia.
