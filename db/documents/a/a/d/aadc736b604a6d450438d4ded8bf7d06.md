Sacubitril/valsartan is the first agent to be approved in a new class of drugs called angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI). The medication is FDA-approved to treat patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with NYHA class II, III, or IV. Sacubitril/valsartan is to be used in place of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker and conjunction with other standard heart-failure treatments (beta-blocker, aldosterone antagonist). Patients must be able to tolerate ACEI or ARB before starting on sacubitril/valsartan. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring of sacubitril/valsartan, so providers can direct patient therapy in conditions where it is indicated in the treatment of patients with heart failure and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of sacubitril/valsartan.
- Summarize the indications for initiating sacubitril/valsartan therapy.
- Review the adverse event profile of sacubitril/valsartan.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance sacubitril/valsartan where it is indicated and improve patient outcomes.
