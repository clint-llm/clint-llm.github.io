In-water recompression is the appropriate procedure to initiate when traditional recompression in a dedicated chamber with full medical staff is unavailable in a reasonable time frame. This activity articulates concerns related to appropriate patient selection for in-water recompression after diving maladies and identifies those types of diving maladies likely to benefit from in-water recompression. Additionally, this activity reviews the appropriate selection of in-water recompression tables and discusses pitfalls that could contribute to increased morbidity or mortality. This activity highlights the role of medical practitioners as well as first responders in providing for decompression sickness patients in remote settings.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the unique hazards associated with in-water recompression.
- Review the procedures and operational concerns for implementing in-water recompression as they pertain to the risks to the patient.
- Outline the types of tables and dive schedules used for in-water decompression and their selection.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional teams for divers who present with atypical signs of decompression illness and risk factors for confounding common diagnoses.
