The incidence of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis has been reported as high as ten percent of all cases of deep venous thrombosis and 28% of catheter-related thrombosis.

While idiopathic thrombosis is associated with inherited thrombophilia, the precise incidence is unknown due to a lack of data. Interestingly, 25% to 30% of patients with unexplained upper extremity thrombosis will have an underlying malignancy. On the other hand, UEDVT was reported in up to two-thirds of cancer patients with central venous catheters.

The incidence of secondary subclavian thrombosis increases with advanced cardiac devices and chronic central venous catheters. Catheter-associated thrombosis is the cause of 93% of upper extremity thrombosis. The incidence is higher with peripherally inserted catheters as compared to centrally inserted. The inappropriate position of the catheter tip can also contribute to increased thrombotic events.
