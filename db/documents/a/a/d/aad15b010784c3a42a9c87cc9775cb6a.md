The management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome should focus on symptom control. It is equally important that the treatment includes the initiation of anti-microbial agents for the underlying opportunistic infection associated with the IRIS. It is also highly recommended to continue HAART unless there is evidence of severe HAART-related toxicity or IRIS with central nervous system (CNS) involvement.

Supportive management includes hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and optimization of nutritional status. Mild symptoms of IRIS, such as fever and pain, can be managed with paracetamol or with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Patients with severe lung disease causing acute hypoxic respiratory failure (e.g., pneumonitis secondary to Pneumocystis jirovecii) and CNS disease such as Cryptococcus-related CNS IRIS are likely to benefit from steroid use. For patients with severe CNS-IRIS resistant to steroids, biological agents such as TNF-alpha antagonists can be used. Patients with CMV-IRIS can benefit from Intraocular steroid administration.
