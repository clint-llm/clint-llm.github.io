The anterior fontanelle (infant) which eventually becomes the bregma can be used to assess infants on physical examination.  A bulging fontanelle can suggest increased intracranial pressure and further guide a physician to a diagnosis.

The pterion is an area on the lateral aspect of the frontal bone.  This area is a joining of four cranial bones: frontal, temporal, sphenoid, and parietal.  It is clinically significant because it overlies the middle meningeal artery, a large artery supplying the dura.  A fracture or trauma to this area should receive a thorough assessment to determine any damage to this structure.

The frontalis muscle can be of clinical significance for the field of plastic surgery when considering areas for botulinum toxin injection.  The normal use of this muscle throughout a lifespan has been known to cause horizontal wrinkles, and therefore botulinum toxin treatments to this site can limit wrinkling.

Clinical symptoms characteristic of a frontal bone fracture include, but are not limited to, the following

- Pain

- Edema

- Facial laceration

- Ecchymosis/abrasions

- Facial asymmetry

- Facial paresthesia

- Facial hematoma

- Emphysema

- Crepitation

- Diplopia
