Surferâ€™s ear or external auditory exostoses (EAE) is a slowly progressive disease caused by benign bone growth resulting from chronic cold water exposure. It is most classically associated with surfing but can be seen in any individual who is repeatedly exposed to cold water. This can include many populations, a few of which include surfers, swimmers, divers, kayakers, and sailors. Surfer's ear is usually asymptomatic but can cause symptoms such as hearing loss, recurrent infections, otorrhea, a sensation of aural fullness, and cerumen impaction. Treatment usually involves medical management but may include surgery if symptoms become severe. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of surfer's ear and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of surfer's ear.
- Explain how surfer's ear presents.
- Review the management options for surfer's ear.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by surfer's ear.
