Fluconazole is contraindicated if theÂ patient has hypersensitivity to the drug or any formulation components. Caution is recommended when administering fluconazole to patients with proarrhythmic conditions. In addition, coadministration of other drugs known to prolong the QT interval or those metabolized via the enzyme CYP3A4 is contraindicated in patients receiving fluconazole.

The oral suspension of fluconazole powder contains sucrose; therefore, caution is essential for patients with hereditary fructose, glucose/galactose malabsorption, and sucrase-isomaltase deficiency.
