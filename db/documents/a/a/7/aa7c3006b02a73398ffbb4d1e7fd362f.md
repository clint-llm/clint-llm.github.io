According to many studies that included a series of cases,  there is no definitive cause of cystitis cystica though chronic irritation, infection, or inflammation is a uniting feature among many affected individuals.

Potential causes:

- Chronic urinary tract infections (UTI), particularly infections caused by Escherichia coli

- Mechanical irritation (i.e., calculi)

- In-dwelling catheters

- Neurogenic bladders

- Chronic bladder outlet obstruction (i.e., benign prostatic hypertrophy, urothelial carcinoma, and pelvic lipomatosis)

- Bladder exstrophy is frequently associated with diffuse cystitis cystica changes in the bladder mucosa

In addition to the aforementioned conditions, nephrogenic adenoma was reported in many cases with organ transplantation and immunosuppression. It is caused by the implantation of desquamated distal renal tubular cells anywhere in the genitourinary tract, although most cases involve the urinary bladder.

In one series of 21 cases, the majority had a history of bladder augmentation surgery which causes recurrent infections and urolithiasis.
