Oxcarbazepine is a 10-keto derivative of carbamazepine, which came to the market in 2000. However, the minor structural differences between oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine have led to significant differences in the induction of metabolic pathways and the metabolism of the two medications.

Oxcarbazepine is also available as an extended-release (XR) dosage form. It is a member of a class of medications known as anticonvulsants and voltage-sensitive sodium channel antagonists. Oxcarbazepine is FDA-approved for partial seizures in adults with epilepsy or partial seizures in children with epilepsy ages 4 to 16. This medication is useful as monotherapy or adjunctive to another drug for managing seizures. Oxcarbazepine is also an option for bipolar disorder; however, this medication is not yet FDA-approved for bipolarÂ disorder. Oxcarbazepine is used off-label to treat trigeminal neuralgia

Many worldwide treatment guidelines list oxcarbazepine as a first-line or second-line treatment for focal-onset epilepsy and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
