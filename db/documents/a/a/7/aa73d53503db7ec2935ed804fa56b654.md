A plasma lipid profile should be measured in all adults older than 40 years, preferably after a 10 to 12-hour overnight fast. The lipid profile reports the total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL-cholesterol, and calculates the LDL-cholesterol by the Friedewald Equation:

- LDL-C = Total Cholesterol – VLDL(TG/5) – HDL-C

This formula (the Friedewald formula) is accurate if test results are obtained on fasting plasma and if the triglyceride level does not exceed 200 mg/dL. By convention, it cannot be used if the triglyceride level is greater than 400 mg/dL since high triglycerides alter the TG/5 or VLDL-C. Many methods can directly measure LDL-C. Secondary causes can be excluded by doing the following tests: TSH (hypothyroidism), glucose (diabetes), urinalysis and serum albumin (nephrotic syndrome), and bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (cholestasis). Ideally, if there is an abnormal lipid profile (high cholesterol), the test should be repeated within 2 weeks to confirm the diagnosis before embarking on lifelong therapy.

**Screening recommendations:**

- Men older than 35

- Women older than 45

- Presence of diabetes

- Tobacco use

- Family history of cardiac disease

- Personal history of heart disease or peripheral vascular disease

- Obesity (BMI > 30)

- Hypertension
