Intersection syndrome is a condition that affects the first and second compartments of the dorsal wrist extensors. The condition is thought to occur as a result of repetitive friction at the junction in which the tendons of the first dorsal compartment cross over the second, creating a tenosynovitis. This is typically noted as a pain just proximal and dorsal to the radial styloid, or also noted anatomically by 4 cm - 6 cm proximal to Lister's tubercle. This activity reviews the presentation and diagnosis of intersection syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of intersection syndrome.
- Describe the presentation of intersection syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment of intersection syndrome.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by intersection syndrome.
