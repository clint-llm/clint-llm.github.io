Congenital adrenal hyperplasia most commonly results from mutations or deletions of CYP21A. This mutation produces a 21-hydroxylase deficiency in 90%-95% of adrenal hyperplasia cases. Mutations or partial deletions that alter CYP21A also are common. The estimated prevalence is one case per 60 individuals in the general population but increases to one in three in select genetically isolated communities with a smaller gene pool. CAH, which is caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency, is found in all populations, whereas 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is more common in individuals of Iranian, Jewish, or Moroccan descent.
