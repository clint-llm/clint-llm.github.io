Percutaneous cholangiography is an essential adjunct to diagnosing and treating patients with biliary disease. Patients who present clinically with jaundice or symptoms of obstructive biliary disease should be considered for ERCP and/or percutaneous cholangiography, depending on the clinical presentation. Percutaneous cholangiography can be critical in assisting with the diagnosis and may direct further patient management.
