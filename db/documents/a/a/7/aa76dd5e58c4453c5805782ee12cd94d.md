Primary orbital masses present with a wide variety of signs and symptoms. Masses in this confined space can rapidly cause visually significant symptoms, up to and including irreversible vision loss. These masses may be neoplastic, inflammatory, or infectious. Treatment and prognosis vary depending on the type of tumor, location, and systemic involvement. This activity reviews the epidemiology and presentation of benign orbital tumors, as well as clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic features. Additionally, this activity will highlight the importance of the interprofessional team in diagnosing and managing patients with benign orbital tumors.

**Objectives:**
- Review common types of benign orbital tumors and the anatomical considerations of each for diagnosis and management.
- Describe the clinical features and diagnostic workup of benign orbital tumors.
- Summarize the epidemiology and risk factors of common benign orbital tumors.
- Identify key radiographic and histopathologic features to guide the diagnosis and management of benign orbital tumors.
