The treatment and management of hearing loss in the elderly areÂ based upon proper diagnostic workup and ensuring all additional causes have been addressed. Specific treatment depends on diagnosing the most likely cause. Among those discussed above, treatments are often separated broadly based on sensorineural or conductive causes.

Conversely, sensorineural causes are typically managed with amplification, which requires specific fitting, planning, and follow-up with an audiologist.
