The diagnosis of EoE is not always easy and the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a gastroenterologist, primary care provider, pathologist, nurse practitioner and an internist. A biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis.

The goal of EoE treatment is to control the symptomsÂ by decreasing the number of eosinophils in the esophagus and, subsequently, reducing the esophageal inflammation. Management consists of dietary, pharmacological, and endoscopic treatment.

Patients who remain compliant with dietary and medication instructions do have a good outcome but for those who fail to make any adjustments in their lifestyle or diet continue to have symptoms.
