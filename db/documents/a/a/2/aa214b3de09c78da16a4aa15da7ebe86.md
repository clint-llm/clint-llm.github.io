C. psittaci is a gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium of both mammals and birds with multiple genotypes, which can be sequenced by genotype-specific real-time PCR for identification and epidemiological studies. Each genotype is associated with a specific animal host, and all can be transmitted to humans, causing psittacosis.

As stated above, contact with birds appears to be the primary risk factor for psittacosis in humans.
