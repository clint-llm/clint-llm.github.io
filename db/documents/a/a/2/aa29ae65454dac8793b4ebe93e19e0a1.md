Keloids are a result of aberrant wound healing. Standard wound healing consists of three phases: (1) inflammatory, (2) fibroblastic, and (3) maturation. In keloids, the fibroblastic phase continues, unchecked, resulting in the clinical and histopathological findings.

Keloidal fibroblasts have increased proliferative activity, persist for longer, and have lower rates of apoptosis compared to typical wound healing. This results in an overproduction of collagen and cytokines.  Collagen synthesis in keloids is 20 times greater than that of healthy skin and three times greater than a hypertrophic scar.

Transforming growth factor-beta and platelet-derived growth factor are thought to be the primary drivers of this process. Transforming growth factor-beta, an integral part of wound healing, promotes chemotaxis of fibroblasts to the site of inflammation and produces collagen. Dysregulation of this pathway leads to fibrosis and abnormal scar response.
