It is worth noting that dietary supplements such as Ginkgo biloba do not require extensive pre-marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. On multiple occasions, nutritional supplements may contain several ingredients, and a discrepancy between labeled and actual ingredients or their amounts may occur. So physicians should be cautious regarding the safety or effectiveness of a dietary supplement.

Research has noted several interactions between Ginkgo biloba and other medications, as well as other dietary supplements.

EGb doses higher than the recommended ones may lead to a weak induction of the CYP2C19-mediated omeprazole 5-hydroxylation, and weak inhibition of the CYP3A4-mediated midazolam 1'-hydroxylation through the clinical implications of such findings are unclear. Overall, as long as the maximum consumption of EGb 761 does not exceed 240 mg daily, pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions are at an acceptable limit.

As discussed above, physicians should be aware of the increased risk of bleeding when Ginkgo biloba was co-administered with other agents that have potential to increase bleeding (NSAIDs, antiplatelet, anticoagulant therapies, garlic, ginger, ginseng, etc.)

Due to its properties as monoamine oxidase inhibitors,

Also, ginkgo has an elevating effect on blood sugar, so if patients have diabetes and take ginkgo, closely monitoring of blood glucose levels is recommended.
