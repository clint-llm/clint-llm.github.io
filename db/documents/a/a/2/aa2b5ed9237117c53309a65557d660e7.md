Acute respiratory failure is caused by a wide range of etiologies. Progression to cardiopulmonary arrest and ultimately death is likely in the absence of effective and timely airway management. Therefore, one of the primary goals of airway management is to provide adequate ventilation and oxygenation to avoid or halt the progression to cardiopulmonary arrest. Effective and timely airway management is also an essential component of successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This activity describes the indications and techniques for securing a patent oropharyngeal airway and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with oropharyngeal airways.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for an oropharyngeal airway.
- Describe the technique for placing an oropharyngeal airway.
- Explain the clinical utility of an oropharyngeal airway.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to ensure appropriate maintenance of an oropharyngeal airway and improve patient outcomes.
