Alprazolam misuse potential comes from its pharmacokinetic properties of a short half-life, rapid absorption, and low lipophilicity. Compared to other benzodiazepines, alprazolam effects may be felt within 30 minutes and last for about 6 hours. Alprazolam, taken in large doses, produces strong depressive effects, which may cause memory loss. Due to alprazolam's many adverse effects, the nurse practitioner, a pharmacist, and the primary care provider must educate the patient on how to use the drug

- Discuss the specific use of alprazolam with the patient as it relates to treatment

- Discuss possible adverse effects and immediately report signs of depression (suicidal ideation, anxiety, emotional instability, or confusion), severe fatigue, shortness of breath, severe dizziness, passing out, change in balance, confusion, memory impairment, difficulty speaking, menstrual changes, or difficult urination

- Discuss to the patient how taking alprazolam may cause drowsiness and sedation, so they should not drive, operate dangerous machinery, or perform any other activity or task that requires optimal attention.

- Discuss how alcohol and/or illegal drugs with alprazolam increase the chances of life-threatening side effects.

Nurses can be invaluable in observing and verifying that the patient is adherent, not misusing the medication, and offering counsel. The pharmacist can verify dosing and check for drug interactions and inform the prescriber of signs of possible misuse (e.g., doctor shopping, early refills, etc.)  When healthcare professionals function as an interprofessional team, alprazolam therapy stands to have increased odds of being effective while avoiding adverse events and misuse, leading to better patient outcomes.
