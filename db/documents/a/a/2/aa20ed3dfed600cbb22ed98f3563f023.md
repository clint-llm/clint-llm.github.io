**Tests to Assess Visual Acuity**

Tests to assess visual acuity fall into one of the three following groups.

Detection acuity tests assess the ability to detect the smallest stimulus. Examples of detection acuity tests include:

- Boeck candy beads

- Catford drum test

- Dot visual acuity test

- Schwarting metronome

- STYCAR graded balls test

Recognition acuity tests assess the ability to recognize the stimulus. Examples of recognition acuity tests include:

- Bailey-Hall cereal test

- Bailey-Lovie chart

- Beale Collin picture charts

- Early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) chart

- Landolt C test

- Lea symbols chart

- Lighthouse test

- Lipmann HOTV test

- Sheridan letter test

- Sjogren hand test

- Snellen charts

- Snellen E test

Resolution acuity tests include:

- Optokinetic drum

- Preferential looking test

**Other Visual Testing**

The Brückner test helps in detecting strabismus. A direct ophthalmoscope is used to obtain a red reflex simultaneously in both eyes. A patient with strabismus shows an increased light reflex in the deviated eye. This test also detects high anisometropia or refractive error.

Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) testing using the swinging flashlight test detects asymmetric or unilateral optic nerve or retinal disease. A swinging flashlight test is done in a semi-dark room with the patient looking straight ahead. A bright light source is shone on one eye (A) for 3 seconds. Then, the light is rapidly shifted to the other eye (B). If the pupil of eye B dilates instead of constricting as it normally would, eye B is considered to have a relative afferent pupillary defect. Such a pupil is also called Marcus Gunn pupil.

The cover test can detect the amblyopic eye in a preverbal child. Such children resist or cry when the better eye is covered or occluded. However, when the amblyopic eye is covered, there is minimal to no resistance.
