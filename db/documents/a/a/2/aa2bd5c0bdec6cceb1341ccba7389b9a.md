Malocclusion is often developed when a child begins transitioning into mixed dentition. Overall, there is not a significant difference between males and females. However, female dental eruption and maturation tend to occur faster than males. Therefore it is common for females to receive orthodontic treatment before males.

Studies have shown that the black population has malocclusions more frequently. However, there is no genetic evidence supporting this.
