Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative, intracellular, gram-positive rod that is responsible for causing the infection listeriosis. Listeria causes severe infection in the elderly, neonates and the immunocompromised with only a self-limited gastrointestinal infection in the immunocompetent. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of listeriosis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of listeria along with the typical food that has the highest rate of transmitting infection.
- Describe the use of bacterial culture in the evaluation of listeria.
- Review the antibiotics used in the treatment of listeria meningitis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members for the early recognition of signs of a systemic inflammatory response and thus, improve outcomes for patients affected by listeria.
