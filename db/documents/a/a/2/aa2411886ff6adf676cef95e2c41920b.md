Umbilical vein catheterization utilizes the exposed umbilical stump in a neonate as a site for emergency central venous access up to 14 days old. Umbilical vein catheterization can provide a safe and effective route for intravenous delivery of medications and fluids during resuscitation. This activity reviews umbilical vein catheterization and the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who undergo umbilical vein catheterization.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications and contraindications for umbilical vein catheterization.
- Describe the technique of umbilical vein catheterization.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications of umbilical vein catheterization.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance umbilical vein catheterization and improve outcomes.
