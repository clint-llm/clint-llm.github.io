The clinical presentation, including distribution and physical characteristics, are almost diagnostic. The typical presentation in the context of a psychiatric constellation differs from that of neurotic excoriations, delusional disorders, malingering, and Munchausen syndrome (hospital hoppers who fake illness without motivation by external incentives). The differential diagnoses to be considered for crusted, blistering lesions include ecthyma and herpes simplex. Others may simulate porphyria cutanea tarda, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, amyloidosis, vasculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, cutaneous lymphoma, drug eruptions, or loxoscelism.
