Approximately 150000 patients per year undergo a lower extremity amputation in the United States. The most common causes leading to amputation are diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy, and trauma. The level of amputation will depend on the viability of the soft tissues used to obtain bone coverage. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of patients requiring a lower-extremity amputation and highlights the role of an interprofessional approach toward caring for this patient population.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures of the lower extremity. Identify the indications and decision-making process regarding the level of a lower extremity amputation. 
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to lower extremity amputations.
- Summarize the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of lower-extremity amputations.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance lower extremity amputations and improve outcomes.
