It is estimated that 271 million people used drugs in 2017, and 35 million suffered from drug use disorders. Opioid medication abuse causes the most harm, accounting for 66% of the deaths attributed to drug use disorders. According to the 2019 World Drug Report, 188 million people reported past-year use of cannabis, 53 million used opioid medications, 29 million used amphetamines and prescription stimulants, 21 million used 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and 18 million used cocaine. Globally, in 2017, there were 585,000 deaths and 42 million years of “healthy” life lost due to drug abuse.

The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) advocates using ‘‘smarter’’ drug testing. Smarter drug testing means an increased frequency of random testing and using other matrices, such as blood (serum or plasma), oral fluid (saliva), or hair, when those matrices match the intended assessment process. For example, hair testing has a much longer detection window when compared to serum or urine. Smarter testing also means testing for a broad and rotating panel of drugs based on the clinical indication rather than only testing for the traditional five-drug panel designed for government-mandated workplace testing. Smarter testing includes careful sample collection and detection technologies to decrease sample adulteration and substitution rates, as well as careful consideration of the financial costs of testing in relation to the value and medical necessity of the test results.

The main indications for urine drug testing in addiction medicine are to determine adherence, monitor abstinence, and detect early relapse.

The drugs involved in poisoning differ according to geographical region. In Western Europe, benzodiazepines and antidepressants are the most common.
