Patients may report a history of recent dental pain. The most commonly reported symptoms are fever, fatigue, chills, and weakness. Trismus is another typical complaint, which indicates a more advanced stage of the disease—the extension of the infection to the parapharyngeal space.

The clinical aspect of the condition is often described as a "bull neck," with increased fullness of the submental area and a loss of mandibular angle definition. On examination, patients usually have a fever with submental and submandibular swelling and tenderness. Swelling of the floor of the mouth, elevation of the tongue, and tenderness of the involved teeth are oral signs of infection. The induration of the submental neck and edema in the upper part of the neck are common extraoral findings, although the patient will not typically have lymphadenopathy.
