The multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) is a more recent advancement in electroretinographic testing, which enables a rapid assessment of retinal function from many areas at the same time. Using a contrast-reversing stimulus. There are standard protocols for eliciting the retinal electrical response. The mfERG is a valuable diagnostic tool that can aid clinicians in determining a correct diagnosis in patients with retinal disease beyond standard clinical examination capabilities. This activity reviews the mfERG procedure and technique and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients using this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for mfERG.

- Describe the typical mfERG findings associated with macular dysfunction.
- Review the interfering factors for the mfERG.
- Explain the importance of monitoring disease progression with mfERG.
