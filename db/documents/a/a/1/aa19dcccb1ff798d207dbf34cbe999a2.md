# Continuing Education Activity

Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in men and women in the United States. The instantaneous wave-free ratio (IFR) can be used to determine whether or not coronary lesions that are visualized angiographically should undergo percutaneous intervention. This activity describes the instantaneous wave-free ratio and its use in the cardiac catheterization lab to determine the hemodynamic significance of coronary lesions and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for percutaneous coronary intervention candidates.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the technical aspects of the instantaneous wave-free ratio (IFR).
- Explain how the instantaneous wave-free ratio is used in the management of coronary artery disease.
- Identify instantaneous wave-free ratio values at which coronary lesions are determined to be hemodynamically unstable and therefore should undergo percutaneous intervention.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure appropriate selection of candidates for percutaneous intervention.

# Introduction

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common pathologic process affecting more than 15 million Americans every year.

Cardiac catheterization with angiography is a minimally invasive diagnostic procedure and imaging modality that has become a mainstay in the evaluation of CAD.

Significant lesions, those with greater than 70% luminal narrowing, via visual estimation qualify for intervention utilizing techniques such as balloon angioplasty or percutaneous intervention with coronary artery stent placement. Lesions displaying less than 40% stenosis are determined non-significant and the recommendation in these cases is for optimization of medical therapy for the treatment of CAD. Interventions in patients with indeterminate lesions, between 40% and 70% stenosis, previously were subject to debate. In the Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE, 2007), revascularization with PCI in stable CAD with high-grade stenosis failed to display benefit over optimal medical therapy.

To better characterize these lesions and identify those that would benefit from intervention, additional diagnostic modalities have been developed including fractional flow reserve (FFR) and instantaneous wave-free ratio (IFR). FFR is described in depth within its own review article; however, in brief, FFR is a guidewire-based technique that measures blood pressure and flows through a specific lesion. In the DEFER trial (2007) it was determined that the five-year event-free survival was not significantly different between a patient who performed and deferred PCI on intermediate coronary stenosis with an FFR greater than 0.75.

IFR is a newer physiologic measurement that utilizes similar principles to FFR but does not require the use of a hyperemic agent. In a 2017 JACC study, IFR and FFR demonstrated no significant differences in the prediction of myocardial ischemia.

# Anatomy and Physiology

Relevant anatomy utilized during IFR is relatively limited, but detailed knowledge of the coronary vasculature is recommended and is reviewed elsewhere.

# Indications

Indications for IFR are in patients with stable CAD and indeterminate lesions, between 40% and 70% stenosis.

# Contraindications

There are no contraindications at this time for IFR. However, current recommendations for IFR do not include patients with ACS.

# Equipment

IFR requires a specialized guidewire with pressure and flow velocity sensing capabilities in addition to computer software that allows for accurate calculation of IFR values. Additional equipment, including the vascular sheath, cardiac catheters, and imaging modalities are unchanged from traditional cardiac catheterization.

# Personnel

At this time IFR should be performed only by board-certified cardiologists who have had formal training in interventional cardiac catheterization.

# Preparation

Once the computer software for the calculation of IFR is installed, and specialized catheters are available, minimal additional setup is required when compared to standard cardiac catheterization.

# Technique or Treatment

In IFR, the same pressure wires utilized in FFR are passed to a point distal to a stenotic lesion. During a period of diastole known as the “wave-free period,” IFR then calculates the ratio of the distal coronary artery pressure (Pd) to the pressure within the aortic outflow tract (Pa). During this timeframe completing blood flow complicating these measurements is negligible.

# Complications

There are minimal complications associated directly with IFR; however, they are the same as that of a standard cardiac catheterization with angiography and PCI and include the following:

- Bleeding

- Access site hematoma and pseudoaneurysm

- Acute kidney injury caused by the contrast agent

- Anaphylaxis caused by the contrast agent

- Coronary artery dissection

# Clinical Significance

Clinically, IFR may be utilized to assess indeterminate coronary artery stenosis further, for lesions anywhere from 40% to 90%, but recommendations do not include patients with ACS. Patients with clinical symptoms or non-invasive testing consistent with ischemia, and an IFR of 0.89 or less are candidates for PCI. While a patient with IFR greater than 0.93 typically qualifies for optimization of medical therapy (OMT), those with a ratio of 0.90 to 0.93 should have a follow-up with FFR. In a patient with clinical symptoms not consistent with ischemia, PCI is recommended for IFR under 0.86. In those with an IFR ratio over 0.89, OMT is recommended. Patients with IFR ratios between 0.86 and 0.89 are recommended for FFR confirmation. This information appears in the attached flow chart.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

In late 2018, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) announced that it had incorporated IFR into its updated revascularization guidelines. [Level of Evidence: Class 1 A] The recommendations noted that IFR should be performed alongside FFR for the objective assessment of the hemodynamic relevance of coronary lesions. At this time the current AHA/ACC guidelines do not formally address the use of IFR during coronary revascularization.

While an invasive cardiologist performs the procedure, the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and internist should give the patient information on the importance of lifestyle changes to lower the risk of coronary artery disease.
