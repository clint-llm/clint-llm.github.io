At presentation, children usually have a history of polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss for days to months. If the diagnosis is delayed, there may be vomiting, lethargy, altered mental status, dehydration, and acidosis. After diagnosis, and initiation of insulin therapy, follow-up management is typically coordinated by a pediatric endocrinologist on approximately a quarterly basis.

Some children will present with ketoacidosis that is associated with the following features:

- Smell of ketones

- Dehydration

- Abdominal pain

- Kussmaul breathing

- Vomiting

- Coma

- Altered mental status

At regular visits, the provider will assess changes in diabetes status and life circumstances affecting diabetes management, for example, school experience, changes in patterns of exercise and diet, the developmental stage of the child, their participation in diabetes care tasks, family and home life changes, and adherence to therapy. History and physical also focus on assessing issues related to glucose monitoring, insulin delivery (e.g., lipodystrophy, skin tolerance to medical adhesives on diabetes technology), and screening for symptoms of associated medical issues such as thyroid dysfunction or celiac disease.
