The management of patients withÂ abnormal serum osmolality needs an interprofessional approach because of the diverse etiologies and multiple challenges in successfully treating the patients without causing further complications. The aim is to control the primary condition causing the abnormality in the serum osmolality and monitor the fluid status and electrolytes. The clinicians (including NPs and PAs), pharmacists, nursing staff, and laboratory techs must work as an interprofessional team to minimize complications and provide the best care. The prognosis for patients with abnormal serum osmolality depends on the cause.
