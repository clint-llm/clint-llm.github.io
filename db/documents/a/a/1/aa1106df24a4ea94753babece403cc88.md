This injury is due to overuse from repetitive throwing. Therefore, deterrence includes avoiding excessive throwing. Current literature proposes limiting pitch counts to prevent primary onset and recurrence of Little League shoulder. Stretching before and after sport and icing the shoulder after throwing is also important. Further, it is recommended to take one season off of throwing per year. United States Baseball and Major League Baseball recommend age-based pitch counts and days of rest based on the pitch count to guide youth players and coaches on a safe amount of throwing-induced stress. Proper biomechanics of a childâ€™s throwing motion should also be encouraged to ensure the mechanics do not cause excess stress on the shoulder. One study found that 80.6 degrees of shoulder abduction and 10.7 degrees of horizontal shoulder adduction minimized the shear forces on the shoulder, while increased shoulder abduction increased anterior force.

Other mechanical factors that can increase torque on the shoulder and elbow and therefore increase the risk of injury include:

- Altered knee flexion at ball release

- early trunk rotation

- loss of shoulder rotational range of motion

- increased elbow flexion at ball release

- high pitch velocity

- increased pitcher fatigue

When the child returns to throw, the practitioner should discourage the child from taking NSAIDs before throwing to avoid covering up inflammatory etiologies of pain.
