Patients should be educated on the clinical course of relapsing and remitting follicular lymphomas and the available treatment options. Despite the slow-growing nature of follicular lymphoma, it is unknown whether current treatments can cure most cases.

Patients should be informed of the potential complications, side effects, and toxicity of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and stem cell transplantation, as well as the fact that most patients require several of these treatments over the course of follicular lymphoma management. Medication adherence and clinic follow-ups should be emphasized, as patients require close monitoring for potential treatment complications, response assessments, and recurrence evaluation.
