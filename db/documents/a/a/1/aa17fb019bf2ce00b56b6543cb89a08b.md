- The hallmark of porokeratosis histologically is a cornoid lamella, which is a column of tightly fitted parakeratotic cells.

- Porokeratosis presents as keratotic papules or annular plaques that expand centrifugally with an elevated keratotic border.

- There are many variants of porokeratosis.

- Porokeratosis can undergo malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma.

- Evaluation of porokeratosis is best done with a biopsy of the elevated border.

- Multiple therapies are described for porokeratosis, including topical, systemic, and surgical. However, there have been no randomized controlled trials, so there are no international guidelines on treatment standards.

- Patients treated for porokeratosis should be advised to use sun protection, avoid excessive sunlight exposure, and go for periodic examinations by a dermatologist to monitor for recurrence or malignant transformation.
