The management of head and neck cancer involves oncologists, radiotherapists, dental practitioners, dental hygienists, nurses, dieticians, and a counselor.

Often, it is a race against time to start therapy and treat the dental ailment. During the therapy usually, complications are handled by radiotherapists and nurses, and dental inputs can help to manage the condition better. The need for meticulous planning by the dentist and discussion with other professionals involved in managing the patient is highly recommended to lower morbidity and improve outcomes.

While delivering radiation treatment in the head and neck region, pre-RT dental management, along with management of adverse effects during and after RT, can have a major effect on the patient's quality of life.
