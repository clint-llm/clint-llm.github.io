Cardiac pheochromocytomas (CPs) are very rare primary neuroendocrine catecholamine-secreting tumors that arise from the sympathetic paraganglia, which is made up of chromaffin cells. Paraganglia are non-neuronal cells that originate from the neural crest. The incidence of primary cardiac tumors ranges from 0.01 to 0.3% by autopsy.
