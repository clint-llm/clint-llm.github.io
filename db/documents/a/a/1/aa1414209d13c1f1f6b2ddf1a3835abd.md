Reflux esophagitis histopathology usually not very specific. common findings are dilation of intercellular space and neutrophils and eosinophils infiltration. Eosinophilic infiltration if present in GERD esophagitis can mimic eosinophilic esophagitis however it also responds to treatment with proton pump inhibitors in contrast with eosinophilic esophagitis

Eosinophilic esophagitis histopathology shows intraepithelial eosinophils and usually requires at least 15/HPF eosinophils in at least one biopsy sample to diagnose EoE.

Multinucleated giant cells with ballooning and degeneration of squamous cells with Cowdry type A inclusion is pathognomonic diagnosis finding for HSV esophagitis and Large cells with both intracytoplasmic inclusions and amphophilic intranuclear inclusions are seen in CMV esophagitis.
