Landmark-based TAP blocks are an uncommon choice, as an ultrasound machine is commonly available and has made regional anesthesia blocks safer and more reliable. Rafi first described the landmark-based technique. Using surface landmarks, the practitioner must identify the lumbar triangle of Petit, which is bound medially by the external oblique, inferiorly by the iliac crest, and posteriorly by the latissimus dorsi.

Using a high-frequency linear or curvilinear ultrasound transducer orientated transversely, begin scanning the abdomen between the iliac crest and the costal margin at the mid-axillary line.

The TAP will begin to "unzip" as the local anesthetic is injected, pushing the transversus abdominis muscle deeper. Depending on the patient’s weight and the concentration of the local anesthetic, an injection of 15 to 20 ml of local anesthetic is typical. This technique describes a posterior TAP block, which is the most commonly performed. If a higher dermatomal coverage is required (T6-T9), the same technique can be used in the subcostal region, just medial to the anterior axillary line where these nerves enter into the abdominal wall. Local anesthetic spread along the TAP is thought to be responsible for the efficacy of the block, as shown by radiological studies.
