Pseudocholinesterase (butyrylcholine esterase) deficiency causes increased sensitivity to choline ester muscle relaxant medications: succinylcholine and mivacurium. In correlation to the level/variant of BuChE deficiency, patients exposed to these neuromuscular blockade agents may experience an amplified duration of apnea and paralysis ranging from mild to extreme.

Should persistent respiratory depression occur, most commonly due to succinylcholine administration in the presence of BuChE deficiency, the mainstay of therapy focuses on prolonged ventilatory support. Positive pressure ventilation is required until skeletal muscle regains adequate neuromuscular function following passive diffusion of succinylcholine from the neuromuscular junction.
