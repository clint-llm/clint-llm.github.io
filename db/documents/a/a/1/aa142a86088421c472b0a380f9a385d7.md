In endemic areas, the patient and the family need to be educated about personal hygiene, boiling water, and improving sanitation. The prevention of cholera rests on improving public health measures like proper sewage disposal and ensuring clean water for drinking. Much of the contaminated water is used to wash the fruits and vegetables, and also to fertilize crops, which creates a never-ending cycle of cholera. Food handlers must be educated on personal hygiene and proper handwashing.

Regarding the prevention of illness in travelers, the centerpiece of counteracting transmission is adequate sanitation and water filtration. They should be educated to avoid undercooked seafood and raw fruits and vegetables. Tap water should be avoided but can be filtered or boiled to reduce the risk of transmission of V. cholerae. In the United States, a live attenuated oral cholera vaccine is licensed for use in adults ages 18 to 64 who travel to an area of active cholera transmission. A single dose is taken, ideally 10 days before travel to an endemic area. It should be administered separately from systemic antibiotic use, which can alter the effectiveness of the vaccine. Efficacy was shown to be 80% after 3 months of vaccination. Worldwide, three killed whole-cell oral vaccines are also available for use.
