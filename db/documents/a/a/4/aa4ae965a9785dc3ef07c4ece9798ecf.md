Mesenchymal cells are the source from which the spleen is derived from, which are located between the tiers of the dorsal mesogastrium as early as the fifth and sixth weeks of fetal development. The characteristic shape of the spleen is something which occurs early in the fetal period. The rotation of the stomach during embryonic development causes the left mesogastrium surface fusion with the peritoneum above the left kidney and the resultant dorsal attachment of the lienorenal ligament. The yolk sac wall and near dorsal aorta are the sources of the cells needed for the hemopoietic function of the spleen. By the second trimester, the spleen is capable of both RBC and WBC generation.
