Chronic kidney disease (CKD) subdivides into five stages. It is essential to know whether a patient has renal insufficiency (CKD stages 2 through 5) and, if so, at what stage, because the kidneys excrete almost half of all drugs or their metabolites, and 30% of all adverse effects of medication are attributed to either a renal cause or a renal effect.

In patients with renal impairment, the dosing of renally cleared drugs has to be adjusted based on the patient's actual glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In the past, this was done by using the Cockcroft-Gault equation or measuring creatinine clearance.

The existence of these four different methods of evaluating renal function usually confuses healthcare workers as to which is the best approach. Recently a newer formula, CKD-EPI (named after the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaborative), has been greatly adapted for this purpose.

The GFR estimation according to every formula is:

**1)**The Cockroft Gault formula (1973)

GFR={((140–age) x weight)/(72xCreatinine)}x 0.85 (if female)

**2)**MDRD equation

186 x (Creatinine/88.4) x (Age) x (0.742 if female) x (1.210 if black)

**3)**CKD-EPI equation

GFR = 141 × min (S/κ, 1) × max (S/κ, 1) × 0.993 × 1.018 [if female] × 1.159 [if black]

Abbreviations/unitsS is serum creatinine in mg/dL,κ = 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males,α = -0.329 for females and -0.411 for males,min = the minimum of S/κ or 1, andmax = the maximum of S/κ or 1

- 2/89 to 60/mild

- 3a/59 to 45/intermediate

- 3b/44 to 30/moderate

- 4/29 to 15/severe

- 5/14 to 0/preterminal, requires dialysis

The units of drug dosing are amount per unit time, for instance, 500 mg twice daily. Dose adjustment is usually crude for most drugs in many circumstances, such as doubling or halving doses. In most cases, having the means to establish when drug dose should be doubled or halved is crucial, whereas a 20% alteration in dose is usually impractical and unnecessary. However, there are many drugs for which minor changes in dose or concentration may cause a significant effect, commonly called a narrow therapeutic index. The therapeutic index is calculated by using the following formula:

- The therapeutic index = Minimum toxic dose / Minimum effective dose
