In a review of 138 patients treated for vaginal cancer from the Korean Radiation Oncology Group, 12% had grade 3 or 4 acute toxicity, including skin, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary. Twelve patients (8%) showed late toxicity. The volume of the tumor and FIGO stage were foreboders of severe late toxicity. Ultimately, the data showed that a later stage of disease was associated with a worse survival outcome and more toxicity from treatment.

In extrapolation from radiotherapy for cervical cancer, vaginal toxicity from radiation for vaginal cancer includes the following: dryness (18-21%), shortening (15-22%), tightening (16-22%), dyspareunia (9-21%), and compromised enjoyment (37-47%). Hormone replacement therapy in this study showed significant improvement in alleviating symptoms.

Vaginal dilator therapy is recommended for women undergoing pelvic radiation to prevent vaginal stenosis; however, no standard protocols exist. A recent expert opinion suggests starting dilation around four weeks after treatment, using it 2 or 3 times per week for 1 to 3 minutes, and continuing it for up to a year. Using plastic dilators of varying sizes had the best outcomes.
