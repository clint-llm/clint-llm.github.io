Enlarged motor neurons are characteristic but not pathognomonic of poliovirus. In the muscle fibers affected by acute poliomyelitis, the original innervating neurons are destroyed. Neighboring neurons attempt to reinnervate the denervated tissue. This leaves the surrounding motor units innervating more muscle fibers than intended, enlargement of the affected neuron, and is suspected to be part of the fatigue associated with PPS later in life.
