Prognosis of inferior vena cava syndrome (IVCS) depends on the underlying patient condition, including the hemodynamic status of the patient, the severity of compression or vein obstruction, the grading of the malignancy, and previous comorbidities. The outcome of patients who have inferior vena cava thrombosis overall relates to the embolic risk associated with DVT. If the IVC is occluded, pulmonary embolism does not present a significant risk. However, if the IVC lumen remains, embolization may occur.
