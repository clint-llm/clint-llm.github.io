Intense pulsed light (IPL) utilizes high-intensity light sources to treat a wide range of dermatological diseases. IPL technology has evolved tremendously since the 1990s with the addition of higher intensity flashlamps, cut-off filters, and cooling systems. These features have enabled IPL to be an ideal tool for treating a variety of pigmented lesions, including solar lentigines and ephelides, vascular lesions such as telangiectasias, port-wine stains, hemangiomas, and leg veins, as well as hair removal and photoaging.
