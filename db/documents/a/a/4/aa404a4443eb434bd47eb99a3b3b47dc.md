Patients with a Barton fracture often first present to the emergency room; hence the emergency department physician and the nurse practitioner are often the first to make the diagnosis. It is important to know that Barton fracture is frequently associated with other injuries and hence a thorough physical exam is necessary. Because conservative treatment of Barton fracture is not alwaysÂ satisfactory, it is important to consult with the orthopedic surgeon. Most Barton fractures are treated surgically, though recent studies have shown little significant difference in operative versus nonoperative management in the elderly. After surgery, the outcomes in young patients are good but in elderly people, the recovery can be prolonged. All patients need some type of rehabilitation after the fracture has healed.
