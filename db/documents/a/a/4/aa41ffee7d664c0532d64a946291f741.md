In 2018, the FDA issued black box warnings against the use of OCA as it potentiated the deterioration of liver functions in patients with advanced liver disease and cirrhosis. Furthermore, it was found to fatally exacerbate hepatic decompensation and failure in patients presenting with PBC along with decompensated cirrhosis in whom the OCA was administered at levels higher than normal.

In case of overdosage, the FDA recommends closely monitoring the patient and providing appropriate care.

Administration of OCA to patients awaiting laparoscopic cholecystectomy was found to increase gallbladder cholesterol saturation and bile acid hydrophobicity. This, along with an increase in FGF-19, may exacerbate gallstone formation risk.

It is recommended that OCA be administered only in patients in whom UDCA alone is not enough or who are intolerant to UDCA.
