The patient should consent to have the wound inspected, anesthetized, cleansed, and irrigated after discussion of the risks and benefits. The patientâ€™s allergies should undergo review before the application or injection of any medications. Patient positioning should be such that both the patient and provider are comfortable during the procedure. The operator should wash his or her hands before the procedure. While complete anesthesia of the wound is usually not possible, local anesthesia should be performed prior to irrigation as it contributes to better toleration of irrigation. The periphery of the wound should be cleansed beginning at the wound and then moving out in concentric circles. Absorbent pads should be placed under the patient to minimize fluid run-off to the floor and exam bed. The operator should make use of personal protective equipment including eye/face shields, gowns, and gloves to minimize exposure risk to bloodborne pathogens.
