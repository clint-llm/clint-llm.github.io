As stated previously, a thorough history and physical exam can often provide valuable information regarding the underlying etiology of a patient's phantosmia. Nasal endoscopy can be a useful tool if a peripheral cause is suspected, such as chronic sinusitis or nasal polyposis. If no obvious cause is identified, a computed tomography scan (CT) of the paranasal sinuses and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with attention to the olfactory region may be warranted.

An MRI brain may readily identify certain tumors, masses, or cerebrovascular accidents. In contrast, a CT sinus may reveal underlying chronic sinusitis, nasal polyposis, or a sinonasal mass, any of which may contribute to the underlying phantosmia. When considering the evaluation of olfactory disorders in general, it is best to divide the disorders into two categories: quantitative and qualitative.

Quantitative olfactory disorders include anosmia or hyposmia, where there is a measurable decrease in the sense of smell, whereas qualitative would describe either parosmia or phantosmia as rather a distorted sense of smell that is more difficult to measure via traditional olfactory testing. There are several objective and physiologic tests for evaluating quantitative olfactory disorders; however, there are no reliable, verified tests for qualitative changes in olfaction.
