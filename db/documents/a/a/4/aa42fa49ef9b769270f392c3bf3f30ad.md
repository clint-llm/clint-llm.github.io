**Inguinal hernia repair**

During surgery to repair an inguinal hernia, one has to visualize the genitofemoral nerve, which is found within the deep inguinal ring. If damaged, the patient will complain of pain in the scrotal area and anterior thigh. The injury can result in genitofemoral neuralgia, causing morbidity as no good treatment currently exists.  For exam purposes, one has to differentiate between the genitofemoral and ilioinguinal nerves, both of which can be injured during surgery.

**Lumbar spinal interbody fusion**

During lumbar spine surgical procedures, the surgeon must be aware of the anatomic relationships between the lumbar plexus and the intervertebral disc at all levels.  This concept is particularly relevant when performing lateral interbody fusion by minimally invasive retroperitoneal trans-psoas approaches.  Ventral nerve roots of the lumbar plexus are particularly vulnerable during psoas muscle retraction.  Surgeons must be aware of the "safe working zone" pertaining to the particular level of interest respective to the level of pathology being treated.  This "safe zone" is typically located between the anterior border of the lumbar nerve and the posterior border of the sympathetic trunk.  The genitofemoral nerve appears to be solely responsible for narrowing this safe zone, with its most significant anatomic impact being recognized at the L2-L3 level.
