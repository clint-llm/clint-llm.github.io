Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a well-recognized, severe form of PMS. It is imperative to establish a precise diagnosis of PMDD that is guided by the DSM-5 criteria. While the diagnosis of PMS is fairly common in females of reproductive age, the referring practitioner plays a pivotal role not only in distinguishing PMDD from PMS but also in separating it from other psychiatric disorders like anxiety or depression. Good coordination between the primary physician, gynecologist, and psychiatrist is extremely important in the interprofessional management of these patients.
