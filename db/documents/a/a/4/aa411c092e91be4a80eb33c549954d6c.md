A detailed history and physical are vital to accurately diagnose the type of seizure, find the probable cause, and determine recurrence risk. Patients may present with:

- Tingling

- Numbness

- Jerking movements

- Muscle tightening

- Staring into space

- Rapid eye movement

- Aura sensation or hallucinations

- Smells
- Taste
- Sight
- Sounds or voices
- Tactile sensation

Clinical symptoms are determined by the anatomical areas affected, thus may facilitate the identification of the specific areas of epileptogenesis utilizing the topographical representation of the cortical homunculus.

- Temporal - olfactory, psychomotor agitation, dysphagia

- Parietal - auditory

- Occipital - visual

- Frontal - loss of inhibition/cognition

- Postcentral gyrus - tingling, numbness

- Precentral gyrus - jerking movement, muscle tightening

Complex partial seizures may present with an aura sensation. When patients present with an aura type of partial seizures, they claim to see, taste, smell, hear, and feel a not-present sensation. Complex partial epilepsy commonly arises from the temporal lobe causing cognitive and affective symptoms such as deja vu sensation or the ability to have psychic powers; some believe they are having conversations with God.

Patients can present autonomic dysfunction, motor, or sensory symptoms arising from the sensorimotor cortex in the temporal, parietal, or occipital lobes. The mouth, thumb, index finger, or great toe are extremely sensitive to electrical discharges, and often the patient describes increased sensation in these areas at the onset of seizure activity.
