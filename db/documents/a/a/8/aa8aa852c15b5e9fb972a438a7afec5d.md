The clinical presentation of autoimmune hepatitis can be highly variable. It can present as either an acute or chronic illness with a fluctuating pattern. It can also be discovered incidentally in completely asymptomatic individuals on routine laboratory testing such as those required for insurance, for employment, or before blood donation.

In both pregnant women and the general population, physical findings expected of AIH range from a normal physical examination to findings suggestive of cirrhosis or liver failure (e.g., jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly).

Also, individuals with AIH may present with a coexisting extrahepatic disorder, which may also be autoimmune-mediated. The common autoimmune disorders associated with AIH include autoimmune thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes mellitus, celiac disease, and ulcerative colitis.
