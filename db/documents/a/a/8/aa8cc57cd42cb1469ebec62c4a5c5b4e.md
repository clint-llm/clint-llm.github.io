Early recognition and treatment of oral mucosal melanomas significantly improve the prognosis. Preventive strategies are unknown, but some experts suggest educating patients on regular oral self-examination to help identify early suspicious pigmented or non-pigmented lesions.

An appropriate self-examination requires a mouth mirror, standard mirror, and good lightning. Patients should also be instructed to grab their tongue with the help of gauze for a better view of the oral tissues.

Due to the high risk of recurrence, patients with a history of oral melanoma require lifelong follow-up.
