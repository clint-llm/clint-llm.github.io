Because of available technologies, expertise in bedside examination has declined among medical professionals. For every patient who presents with chest pain suspicious for acute pericarditis, the nursing and medical team should attentively try to identify a pericardial rub over the left sternal border at different times, since the presence of the rub is variable during the day. Its detection modifies the patient's management since the presence of a pericardial rub is very specific for acute pericarditis.
