Erb palsy requires interprofessional care involving the parents, primary care physicians, nerve surgeons, physiatrists, and occupational and physical therapists for optimal rehabilitation for those with residual deficits.

Erb palsy requires early diagnosis and management for the best outcomes. Prenatal counseling of diabetic mothers to have good glycemic control is important to reduce the risk of Erb's palsy due to macrosomia and shoulder dystocia. In addition, parents of the affected children should be counseled about the importance of physiotherapy at an early ageÂ for the functional recovery of the arm as well as surgical repair in case of sustained injury.

A mental health nurse consult is highly recommended as the disorder can have a major psychosocial impact on the child. The child may not be able to use the arm, take part in sports or perform daily living activities. Often children become depressed and withdrawn. Because recovery is slow, long-term monitoring as outpatients is necessary. Once the diagnosis of Erb palsy is made, the interprofessional team should determine the care plan and ensure that the child is closely monitored. Failure to treat the condition can lead to severe disability.

About 90% of infants with Erb palsy will show recovery with time, but 10% will continue to have a dysfunctional arm. The key is to prevent this injury in the first place.
