Fludeoxyglucose F18 is a radioactive tracer that acts as a glucose analog and is used for diagnostic purposes in conjunction with positron-emitting tomography (PET) to localize the tissues with altered glucose metabolism. It does not have therapeutic use. Altered glucose metabolism has implications for malignancies, epilepsy, myocardial ischemia, inflammatory conditions, and Alzheimer disease. PET scan uses radiotracers injected into the patient before the scan to visualize the blood flow and metabolic and biochemical activities in diseased and healthy tissues. FDG is a glucose analog that tends to accumulate in the tissue with high glucose demand, like tumors and inflammatory cells. This activity describes the indications, mechanism of action in various conditions, administration, precautions in the particular patient population, and relevant information to maximize patient and staff safety while obtaining optimal images and analysis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the proper administration of fludeoxyglucose (F18).
- Describe the importance of patient preparation before administering fludeoxyglucose (F18).
- Explain FDG use in various conditions for diagnostic or treatment monitoring.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to obtain suboptimal images while maintaining safety.
