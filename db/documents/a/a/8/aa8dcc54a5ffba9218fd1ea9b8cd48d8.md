The most common presenting symptoms of IPF are dyspnea on exertion and cough, followed by fatigue. The diagnosis is often delayed, as most patients are diagnosed more than a year after symptom onset. Since symptoms are nonspecific and the disease is idiopathic, other conditions must be excluded before diagnosis. History of exposure to inhaled dust, metals, asbestos, mold, or birds should be elicited to exclude other interstitial lung diseases. Medication and drug history are important to exclude drug toxicities. A careful history should be elicited to exclude autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, Sjogren disease, or poly/dermatomyositis should also be elicited since these conditions can all lead to interstitial lung disease.  The cough is most commonly dry and non-productive.

The physical exam should be focused on evaluating lung involvement, extent and severity of the disease, and excluding another diagnosis. The classic pulmonary exam usually reveals fine bibasilar “velcro” crackles during inspiration. Clubbing may also be present. To exclude autoimmune conditions, evaluate for skin rashes, joint swelling, sclerodactyly, Raynaud phenomenon, and muscle weakness.  In advanced cases of IPF, patients may be exercise intolerance with minimal exertion or even resting hypoxemia.
