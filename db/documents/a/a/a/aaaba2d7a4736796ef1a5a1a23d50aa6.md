Most causes of glossitis are self-limiting and require no treatment. Symptomatic relief is possible with good oral hygiene and mouth rinses (various formulations of "magic mouthwash" contain corticosteroids and lidocaine that can soothe acute exacerbations of migratory glossitis). Some additional specific treatments include:

Atrophic glossitis:

- Intramuscular injections of vitamin B12.

Median rhomboid glossitis:

- Antifungals only if symptomatic (nystatin swish and swallow)

Benign migratory glossitis:

- Reassurance only, with mouth rinses, as described above, for acute exacerbations.

Geometric glossitis:

- Reassurance. Acute episodes have been treated with antivirals with limited success.

Strawberry tongue:

- Vitamin B12 supplementation

Medication-induced:

- Discontinue offending medication

Infectious:

- Treat acute or chronic infection.

- Immunology workup for any opportunistic infections and control of diabetes
