Alcoholic hepatitis can be confused with other causes of hepatitis, such as viral, drug-induced, or autoimmune hepatitis. Clinical context and serum tests are fundamental to distinguish these entities.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NASH) represents the principal histological differential diagnosis since the three stages of liver disease (steatosis, hepatitis, and cirrhosis) are present in the two entities. Many other differential diagnoses include:

- Reye syndrome

- Cryptogenic liver disease

- Fulminant Wilson disease

- Emphysema

- Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency

- Ascending cholangitis

- Liver decompensation associated with hepatocellular carcinoma
