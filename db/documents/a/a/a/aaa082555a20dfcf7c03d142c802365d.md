**Advantages**

- Rapid and uniform absorption of the drug, especially the aqueous solutions

- Rapid onset of the action compared to that of the oral and the subcutaneous routes

- IM injection bypasses the first-pass metabolism of the drug

- It also avoids the gastric factors governing drug absorption

- Has efficacy and potency comparable to that of the intravenous drug delivery system

- Highly effective for emergency scenarios such as acute psychosis and status epilepticus

- Depot injections allow slow, sustained, and prolonged drug action

- A large volume of the drug can be administered compared to the subcutaneous route

**Disadvantages**

- An expert and a trained person areÂ necessary for administrating the drug by IM route

- The absorption of the drug is determined by the bulk of the muscle and its vascularity

- The onset and duration of the action of the drug are not adjustable

- In case of inadvertent scenarios such as anaphylaxis or neurovascular injuries, additional intravenous (IV) routes for emergency drug administration need to be secured

- IM injection at the appropriate landmarks may be difficult in a child as well as in patients requiring physical restrains

- Inadvertent injection within the subcutaneous plane can lead to delayed action of the drug

- Painful procedure

- Suspensions, as well as oily drugs, cannot be administered

- This can lead to anxiety in the patient, especially among children

- Self-administration of the drug can be difficult

- The precipitation of the drug following faster absorption of the solvent may lead to delayed or prolonged action of the drug

- Unintended prolonged sequelae following delayed release from the muscular compartment

- Need for temporary restraint of the patients, especially in crying children
