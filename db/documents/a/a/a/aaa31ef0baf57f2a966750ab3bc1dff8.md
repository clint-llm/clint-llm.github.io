Neurotmesis frequently poses a diagnostic dilemma. It is essential to determine if the nerve is in total discontinuity before attempting a repair. The causes of neurotmesis are many, and each will have different consequences in the timing of repair and the prognosis. The physical exam is fundamental to determine which nerve is affected and if there are more involved.

While the neurosurgeon is almost always involved in the care of patients presenting neurotmesis, it is essential to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a general surgeon, vascular surgeon, neurologist, plastic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon, and physiatrist. The nurses are also vital members of the interprofessional group as they will assist with the education of the patient and family. The physiatrist will evaluate the patient and do the appropriate electrodiagnostic studies and will aidÂ to enhance and restore functional ability and quality of life to the patient with physical impairments.

The outcomes of neurotmesis depend on the cause, the timing of repair, and the amount of injured nerve. However, to improve outcomes, prompt consultation with an interprofessional group of specialists is recommended.
