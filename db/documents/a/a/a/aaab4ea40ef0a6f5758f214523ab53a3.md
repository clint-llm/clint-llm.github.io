The nasal bones are the most frequently fractured bones in the maxillofacial area due to their relative weakness and the outward projection of the nose on the face.

The structural support of the nose is composed mainly of cartilage, bone, and skin. The paired nasal bones are attached to the frontal bone superiorly and the frontal processes of the maxillae laterally, at the nasofrontal and nasomaxillary suture lines, respectively. The nasal bones tend to be thicker above the level of the medial canthus.

The nasal septum consists of bone posteriorly and cartilage anteriorly. The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone superiorly and the vomer inferiorly make up the bony septum. These fuse with the quadrangular cartilage, which makes up the anterior portion of the nasal septum. The quadrangular cartilage provides support for the nasal dorsum from the keystone area to the supratip of the nose.
