Perhaps the greatest utility that the TIMI score has to offer is its ability to guide the management of patients presenting with signs of unstable angina/non-ST elevated myocardial infarctions (UA/NSTEMI).

The TACTICS-TIMI 18 trial compared outcomes of patients presenting with UA/NSTEMI who underwent either early invasive interventions or conservative treatment with medication. After risk stratifying patients, they found that intermediate or high-risk patients who underwent invasive cardiac intervention showed a significant decrease in death, nonfatal MI, and rehospitalization for cardiac events compared to those who were medically managed. There was no significant difference in outcome between low-risk patients who received early intervention and those who received medical management.

The timing at which certain complications enfold has been another factor of interest. The TIMI 11b and ESSENCE trials have shown that nearly one-third of myocardial infarctions and half the number of deaths occur after the first week of presentation. Further studies have taken data from these trials and have shown that nearly a quarter of adverse cardiac events occur within 6 weeks following discharge.

The PRISM-PLUS study sought to highlight the importance of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. The study showed a significant benefit of the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors with aspirin and heparin in patients with a TIMI score of greater than 4 compared to management with aspirin and heparin alone. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors were shown to decrease the level of myocardial injury, as measured by peak troponin and creatinine kinase levels.

In conclusion, early invasive management, such as cardiac angiography and revascularization, is recommended for patients presenting with a TIMI risk score greater than or equal to 3. Patients with a TIMI risk score of 0 to 2 should be managed medically.
