Three major arteries supply blood to the trigeminal nerve root: a superolateral branch of the basilar artery, a peduncular cerebellar branch of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery, and the trigeminocerebellar artery. The blood supply to the muscles of mastication is via branches of the maxillary artery. The trigeminal artery is a critical potential conduit between the basilar and carotid arteries and follows the course of the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal artery most commonly arises from the superolateral pontine branch of the basilar artery and from the peduncular cerebellar branch of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. The number of trigeminal arteries ranges from two to six, with diameters ranging from one hundred to five hundred and ten micrometers.
