A spinal epidural abscess is an infection of the central nervous system that classically presents with midline back pain, fever, and neurologic deficits. It is difficult to diagnose and requires a high index of suspicion. When left untreated spinal epidural abscess can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Thus any clinical concern for this diagnosis requires prompt evaluation and treatment. Diagnosing and managing spinal epidural abscesses are greatly aided by the advent of modern radiological techniques, including computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This activity illustrates the assessment and treatment of spinal epidural abscesses and describes the role of the interprofessional team in managing those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the various potential etiologies for spinal epidural abscesses.
- Review the steps in a complete evaluation and workup for patients presenting with spinal epidural abscess.
- Outline the appropriate treatment options and case management for spinal epidural abscesses.
- Review the importance of coordination among interprofessional teams that monitor for complications and treat patients with epidural abscesses.
