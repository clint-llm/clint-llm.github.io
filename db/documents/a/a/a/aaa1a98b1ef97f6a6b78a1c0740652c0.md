An interprofessional healthcare team with a multi-disciplinary approach, including an orthopedic surgeon, physiatrist, physical therapist, orthopedist, primary care physician, and possibly a chiropractor, is key to proper diagnosis and treatment of tibial neuropathy. A physiatrist can perform electrodiagnostic testing and work with therapists and orthotists to provide a proper exercise program and equipment needs. Refractory cases may require referral to an orthopedic surgeon.

All members of the interprofessional team must document their findings, refer to the appropriate discipline when necessary, and ensure that all healthcare team members are kept informed regarding changes in patient status. This open, interprofessional approach will optimize patient outcomes and mitigate adverse consequences. [Level 5]
