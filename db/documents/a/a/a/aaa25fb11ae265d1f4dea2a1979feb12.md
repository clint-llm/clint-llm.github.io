Intraabdominal adhesions are a widespread problem in the Western world and lead to several hundred thousand hospital admissions when associated with complications. Surgical intervention might be necessary for some instances. Many members of the healthcare team are crucial to caring for these patients. Different physician specialties will care for these patients, including surgeons, anesthesiologists, primary care, emergency department, and radiology all will see patients with adhesive small bowel disease requiring adhesiolysis. Other members of the health care team, including pharmacists, nurses, and aides, will also be caring for these patients and need to understand the workup and treatment of these patients.
