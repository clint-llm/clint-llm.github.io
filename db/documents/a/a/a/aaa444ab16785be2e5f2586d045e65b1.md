The most significant complication associated with brief psychotic disorder is the sudden onset of symptoms and accompanying loss in functioning. It is crucial to make special note of predisposing stressors and comorbid disorders and manage them appropriately as that may have precipitated this episode and may result in similar manifestations in the future. Although pharmacotherapy may help curb the presenting symptoms of BPD, it is psychotherapy that will empower the patient with the skills and techniques to cope with this disorder during and after the symptoms have remitted.
