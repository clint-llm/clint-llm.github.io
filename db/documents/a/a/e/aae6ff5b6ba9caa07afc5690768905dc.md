Thoracolumbar junction fractures can cause significant morbidity to a patient. Patients should avoid activities where they can have easy falls. Many patients suffer falls while climbing trees; therefore, protection and safety is always a priority. Security ropes and wire cables should be used if working at heights or during recreational sports. Driving under the influence of toxic drugs and alcohol should be avoided.

Depending on the neurologic deficit, patients may be able to return to work, but some may persist with disabling pain. The use of a postoperative brace does not influenceÂ pain, return to work, or instrumentation failure.
