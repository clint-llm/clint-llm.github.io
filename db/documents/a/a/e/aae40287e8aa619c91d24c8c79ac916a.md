Generally speaking, alcohols are considered safer than detergents.

Some studies have also posed the question of possible health effects related to unintentional alcoholization (via inhalation and dermal contact) from frequent professional usage of alcohol-based hand sanitizers.

Even though not considered a contraindication, alcohol-based hand sanitizers have shown to be inferior to soap and water against certain pathogens. For instance, alcohols have very poor activity against protozoan oocysts, certain non-enveloped (non-lipophilic) viruses, and bacterial spores. Cryptosporidium, a waterborne parasite considered an important cause of diarrheal outbreaks in daycares, is not effectively killed by alcohol. Similarly, alcohol-based hand sanitizers are also considered ineffective against norovirus, a non-enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. One study even found an association between the use of ABHS for routine hand hygiene and an increased risk of outbreaks of norovirus.

Other potential areas of concern with using alcohol-based hand sanitizersÂ are the inadequate bactericidal and virucidal effects under long fingernails and visibly soiled hands.
