The atrioventricular septal defect is a congenital cardiac malformation that is characterized by a variable degree of the atrial and ventricular septal defect along with a common or partially separate atrioventricular orifice. Diagnosis of AVSD in fetal life or early neonatal period is essential in order to initiate appropriate medical treatment and to plan early surgical repair. In order to avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of AVSD and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of atrioventricular septal defects.
- Outline the evaluation of atrioventricular septal defects.
- Review the management options available for atrioventricular septal defects.
