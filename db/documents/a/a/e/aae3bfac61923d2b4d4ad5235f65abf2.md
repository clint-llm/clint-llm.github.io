The optimal anatomy for TPVI is a uniform diameter from the RVOT to the bifurcation of PA with adequate length of main PA to avoid stenting into the bifurcation. TPVI recommendations are currently limited to the dysfunctional RVOT conduits 16 mm in diameter or greater. Occasionally, off-label use of these valves is applied in patients with native or post-TAP repair, or those with less than 16 mm conduits.
