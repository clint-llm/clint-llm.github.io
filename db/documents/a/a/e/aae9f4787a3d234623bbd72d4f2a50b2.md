Development of tongue is due to the complex interaction between various genes like Pax3, Pax7, and Dlx gene, which are responsible for survival and expansion of mammalian muscle and patterning information in tongue myogenesis. Some studies have shown that signaling by TGF Beta controls explicitly the proliferation of myogenic cells during tongue morphogenesis.
