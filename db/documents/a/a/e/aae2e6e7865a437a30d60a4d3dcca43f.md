New ventilator modes are designed to improve some of the shortfalls of AC:

- **NAVA (neurally adjusted ventilator assist):**In this mode, sensors in the diaphragm measure the timing and intensity of the patient’s respiratory effort and couple it with the timing and intensity of the ventilator assist, thereby preventing barotrauma and ensuring ventilator demand fulfillment.

- **ASV (Adaptive support ventilation):**This mode automatically adapts inspiratory pressure and respiratory rate with minimum work on the part of the patient to assure a target minute ventilation is reached

- **APRV (Airwar pressure release ventilation):**This pressure-cycled mode of ventilation delivers a continuous set pressure for a set amount of time and then "releases," giving time for the lung to deflate for a shorter period. In theory, this maintains alveoli inflation to prevent alveolar damage. This mode sometimes is used in patients where AC cannot be effectively and safely continued due to persistently elevated plateau pressures and continuously poor oxygenation

These and other methods currently are being studied as alternative modes of mechanical ventilation, but none have shown clear superiority over the others.
