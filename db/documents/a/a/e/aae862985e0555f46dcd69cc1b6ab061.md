The patients should receive education about:

- Risk factors of the disease

- Complications of the disease

- Treatment options of the disease

- Complications of the surgery

- The regular need for a follow-up

Visual acuity charts and slit-lamp examination should be used on regular bases at every follow-up to detect any impairment in visual acuity after cataract or any complication of the surgery. The patient shouldÂ be advised to wear spectacles in the sunlight to avoid damage by ultraviolet rays. A thorough systemic evaluation is advisable to rule out any systemic disease which may affect the outcome of the treatment.
