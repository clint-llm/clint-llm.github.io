Often, before more advanced therapies or medications, more conservative measures can be taken to help treat disease processes. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of the piriformis muscle and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for muscle energy and counterstrain.
- Describe the technique in which to treat the piriformis muscle using muscle energy.
- Outline the technique in which to treat the piriformis muscle using counterstrain.
- Summarize how to evaluate the piriformis muscle prior to treating it using osteopathic manipulative treatment.
