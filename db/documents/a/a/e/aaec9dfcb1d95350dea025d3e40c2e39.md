Acetyl-CoA, a significant carbon input into the citric acid cycle, can be derived from glucose or fatty acids; however, a substantial portion of acetyl-CoA comes from glucose or more specifically, pyruvate. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) facilitates the enzymatic conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. This complex has three protein subunits, in total requiring five cofactors and each with its unique enzymatic activity.
