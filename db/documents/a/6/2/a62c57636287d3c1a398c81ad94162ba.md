**Brain Infarction and Hematoma after Hemorrhage**

Vascular invasion is characteristic of rhinocerebral mucormycosis. The formation of intravascular thrombi leads to ischemia and infarction of the brain, including the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem.

**Orbital Apex Syndrome**

Ophthalmoplegia due to damage of motor nerves, vision loss due to optic nerve involvement

**Meningitis**

Meningitis is a rare manifestation of rhinocerebral mucormycosis. Diffuse vasculitis or fungal infection of meninges is supposed to be the cause of meningitis.

**Brain Abscesses**

Brain tissue involvement of mucormycosis gives rise to brain abscess formation, especially in chronic cases.

**Garcin Syndrome**

It is the unilateral cranial nerve palsies without the involvement of sensory and motor tracts.

**Facial and Nasal Deformity**

Permanent destruction of maxillary and nasal bones changes the cosmetic facial configuration. Orbital exenteration gives disfigurement of facial structures.
