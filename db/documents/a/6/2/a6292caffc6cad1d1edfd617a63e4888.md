While all cells can synthesize cholesterol to a small extent, the liver is the major site of cholesterol synthesis. The cholesterol synthesis occurs in the hepatic cytoplasm and requires enzymes n the cytoplasm and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). The first step of cholesterol biosynthesis involves condensing 2 molecules of acetyl-CoA to form acetoacetyl-CoA. Next, a cytosolic enzyme HMG-CoA synthase adds a third molecule of acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA, making a six-carbon compound called 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA). An isozyme of HMG-CoA synthase in mitochondria catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction in ketogenesis. HMG-CoA reductase, a regulatory enzyme in the smooth ER catalyzes the next step, which reduces HMG-CoA to mevalonate. Synthesis of mevalonate is the key rate-limiting, committed step in the synthesis of cholesterol. A series of reactions convert Mevalonate to 3-isopentenyl pyrophosphate, farnesyl pyrophosphate, squalene, and lanosterol. Lanosterol then goes through another19-step ER-associated process to finally synthesize cholesterol. The terminal step is catalyzed by 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase that converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol.
