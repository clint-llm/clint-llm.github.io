Patients with cerebral palsy can have several complex health issues managed by different healthcare providers.  An interprofessional and multidisciplinary team can help achieve the best outcomes in patients with cerebral palsy in the perioperative setting. A collaborative approach should be employed between all healthcare workers, including providers, occupational and physical therapists, social workers, nursing staff, nutritionists, speech and language pathologists, and the patient’s primary caregiver to optimize the patient’s recovery after surgical procedures. Effective communication and transparency between the healthcare team and the patient’s primary caregiver are crucial to achieving a favorable outcome. [Level 5]
