Bile has many important functions throughout the body, as discussed below.

- Bile is the major excretory route for potentially harmful exogenous lipophilic substances and other endogenous substrates, such as bilirubin and bile salts, which cannot be filtered or excreted by the kidney. Bile aids in emulsifying large fat particles into many minute particles, the surface of which can then be attacked by lipase enzymes secreted in pancreatic juice.

- Bile is the primary route for the elimination of cholesterol.

- Bile protects the organism from enteric infections by excreting immune globulin A (IgA) and inflammatory cytokines and stimulating the innate immune system in the intestine.

- Bile is an essential component of cholehepatic and enterohepatic circulation.

- Bile salts are the major organic solutes in bile and function to emulsify dietary fats and facilitate their intestinal absorption.

As the primary function of bile is the facilitation of fat absorption, it plays a vital role in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamins A, D, E, and K. As previously discussed, the bile salts present in bile are bactericidal, thereby destroying most of the pathogenic microorganisms present in the ingested food. Since the pH of the bile is alkaline, bile also plays a vital role in neutralizing excess stomach acid emptied into the duodenum.
