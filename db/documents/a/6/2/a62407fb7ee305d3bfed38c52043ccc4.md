**Nonunion**- This is the most likely complication arising from missed scaphoid fractures. The risk is higher in those that are very displaced or have associated carpal fractures. These will generally require operative intervention with screw fixation. There are three stages:

- Radioscaphoid arthritis

- Scaphocapitate arthritis

- Lunocapitate arthritis

Scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse (SNAC) is the end-stage and is managed with wrist fusion or proximal row carpectomy.

**Avascular necrosis**- The incidence of this is approximately 30-40%. This is most likely to affect the proximal pole.

**Scapholunate Dissociation**

**Delayed union**
