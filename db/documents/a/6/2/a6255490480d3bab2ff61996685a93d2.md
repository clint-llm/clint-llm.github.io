CTO lesions are found in approximately one-quarter to one-third of patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography. The true prevalence, however, in the general population is unknown due to a subset of patients with CTO lesions being asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and never undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography. Patients with a history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery are found to have CTOs of their native vessels more frequently (50% to 55%). In comparison, patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are less likely to have a CTO (9% to 11%).

Data from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (1997–1999) Dynamic Registry showed that CTO lesions are most common in the right coronary artery and least common in the left circumflex artery. Older patients are more likely to have at least one CTO lesion with 37% prevalence in patients under the age of  65 years, 40% in patients between the ages of 65 to 79 years, and 41% in those patients who are older than 85 years.
