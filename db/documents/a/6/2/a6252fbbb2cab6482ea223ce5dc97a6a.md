Most neonatal and infant retinal hemorrhages secondary to trauma have a good prognosis and resolve in 2Â to 4 weeks. Retinal hemorrhages secondary to metabolic syndromes and venous occlusions resolve with control of the underlying conditions. Submacular and subretinal hemorrhages have a very poor prognosis and can irreversibly affect the vision due to damage to the photoreceptor layer. Subhyaloid hemorrhages, if ruptured by ND-YAG laser at an appropriate time, have a good prognosis. Most vitreous hemorrhages resolve within three months, and fine traces of blood clot can still be seen settled inferiorly. Unresolved hemorrhages or hemorrhages which cause secondary glaucoma carry a poor prognosis.
