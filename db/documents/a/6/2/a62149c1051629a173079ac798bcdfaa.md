It is imperative to recognize pneumatocele in clinical settings and differentiate from many other similar diagnoses. Opinion from radiologists should be taken in uncertain situations, and the final decisions should be made in clinical settings to differentiate pneumatocele from cyst, abscess, bullae, infectious causes.

Complicated cases benefit from an early surgical intervention that varies from minimally invasive to large surgeries such as lobectomy, pneumonectomy, chest tube/ pigtail insertion, and instillation of sealants.
