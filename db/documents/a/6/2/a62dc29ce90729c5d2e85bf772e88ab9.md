Charcot neuropathic osteoarthropathy is seen in the lower extremity and is characterized by bone and joint fragmentation of the foot and ankle in individuals with various peripheral neuropathies. Diabetes, neuropathy, trauma, and metabolic abnormalities of the bone result in an acute localized inflammatory condition. The inflammatory response can permanently disrupt the bony architecture of the foot resulting in abnormal plantar pressures that are at risk for ulceration, osteomyelitis, and amputation.

Charcot is a debilitating condition affecting the lower extremity of patients with established peripheral neuropathy caused by many complicated etiologies; however, diabetic neuropathy has become the most common etiology.Â  Other etiologies include spinal cord injury, poliomyelitis, leprosy, syphilis, syringomyelia, or chronic alcoholism.
