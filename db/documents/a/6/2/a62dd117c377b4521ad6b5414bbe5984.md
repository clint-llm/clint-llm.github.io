**Procedures involving the Facial Artery**

The facial artery has a role in the reconstructive procedures of the face.  It can act as the vascular supply for various flaps including local flaps, regional flaps, or free flaps.

**Complications associated with the Facial Artery**

The facial artery can have implications in complications associated with various surgical procedures.  Prevention of trauma to the facial artery is paramount.  Thus, excessive retraction in this area should be avoided.  Hemorrhage from the facial artery can occur during submandibular gland excision as well.

It is also important to recognize the proximity of various nerves, including the hypoglossal nerve, to the facial artery during surgical procedures.  These structures need to be identified early and preserved to minimize post-operative complications.
