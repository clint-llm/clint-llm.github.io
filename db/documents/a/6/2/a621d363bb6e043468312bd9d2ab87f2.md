Amyloidosis is an uncommon spectrum of heterogeneous disease patterns with local to systemic effects which may involve the cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurologic, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, and integumentary tissues. The deposition of misfolded and insoluble proteins secreted into the extracellular space defines the pathophysiology of amyloidosis. Amyloid fibrils are derived from soluble precursors, such as serum amyloid P component (SAP) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which aggregate into insoluble antiparallel configurations in the form of beta-pleated sheets, and are resistant to catabolic proteolysis.

Organ involvement and degree of disease is a function of amyloid protein subtype, plaque burden, and organ-specific toxic effects that leads to inflammation, swelling, end-organ dysfunction, and eventual failure.

While there are around 40 identified protein subtypes of amyloidosis, the most common amyloid subtypes that involve the musculoskeletal system include the immunoglobulin light chain (AL), the beta-2 microglobulin (AB2M), and the transthyretin (ATTR) proteins--the latter having genetic and senescent variants.

The musculoskeletal tissues most commonly involved in amyloidosis include osseous, articular, ligamentous, cartilaginous, synovial tissues, and intervertebral discs.

The etiologic pattern of musculoskeletal amyloidosis is variable and can mimic other disease processes, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple spondyloarthropathies, myopathy, and chondrosarcoma.

A separate, primary disease process combined with the nonspecific symptoms and imaging appearance of amyloidosis necessitates a careful differential consideration—especially when initial treatment for a primary diagnosis is ineffective. Underdiagnosis of amyloidosis is common and contributes to nearly 50% of patients expiring within the first two years of diagnosis. Several treatment options are available for most amyloid subtypes--however, efficacy is inversely proportional to the degree of end-organ damage.

The radiologic features of amyloidosis are problematically diverse and nonspecific.

Advancements in radiologic imaging have improved the specificity of MRI and nuclear medicine modalities for detecting amyloidosis. Common imaging patterns seen in various amyloid subtypes include the calcification of involved tissues and infiltration into adjacent soft tissues.
