Ultrasound is a noninvasive diagnostic modality that can quickly confirm an intrauterine pregnancy at the bedside, significantly shortening the length of stay for pregnant patients and avoiding the use of contrast or radiation. Point-of-care pelvic ultrasound in the hands yields the greatest diagnostic potential in the first trimester of pregnancy. This activity illustrates how an obstetric ultrasound can help detect disorders of pregnancy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients undergoing obstetrical ultrasound.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for obstetric ultrasound.
- Summarize the technique involved in performing an obstetric ultrasound.
- Review the clinical significance of the obstetric ultrasound during pregnancy.
- Explain the importance of optimize coordination amongst interprofessional team members to enhance the delivery of care to pregnant patients with the use of the obstetric ultrasound.
