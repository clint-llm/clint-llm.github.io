A gastrocnemius rupture can be diagnosed clinically and involves a proximal calf injury after a sudden push off associated with sprinting or jumping. Patients describe symptoms to include a tearing sensation or pop with pain in the calf region. Patients endorse difficulty bearing weight and prefer to walk on their toes to minimize discomfort. Patients complain of calf weakness, increased pain with active plantarflexion or passive dorsiflexion of the ankle, and increased muscular cramping.

Physical examination findings include swelling, ecchymosis, and focal muscle tenderness of the proximal calf. Ruptures may present with a palpable defect in the muscle. The patient will have difficulty performing a calf raise. A Thompson squeeze test (used to assess for Achilles tendon rupture) will be negative with normal plantar flexion upon squeezing the calf.
