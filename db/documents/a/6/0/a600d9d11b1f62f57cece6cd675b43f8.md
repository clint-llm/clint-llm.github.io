The blood supply to the sartorius is mainly from the muscular branches of the femoral artery. Over half of the blood supply comes from these muscular branches of the femoral artery, but collateral flow does come from elsewhere. A study researching blood flow to the sartorius demonstrated collateral blood flow arising from the superficial circumflex iliac artery, lateral circumflex femoral artery, superficial femoral artery, descending genicular artery, and superior medial genicular artery.
