Hyperlipidemia is one of the factors contributing to metabolic syndrome. It could lead to an increased risk of atherosclerosis in patients if not properly managed. This article reviews lipoprotein- x, which is a lipoprotein anomaly, leading to a false LDL level. It is usually present in patients with liver dysfunction, LCAT deficiency, lipid infusion, and even graft vs host disease in liver transplant patients. It requires prompt management to avoid increase morbidity and mortality.

**Objectives:**
- Describe lipoprotein X structure.
- Summarize the complication that could arise due to lipoprotein X-induced hyperlipidemia.
- Identify the most common physical findings associated with lipoprotein X-induced hyperlipidemia.
- Explain the management of lipoprotein X-induced hyperlipidemia by an interprofessional team.
