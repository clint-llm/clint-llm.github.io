The development of radiation enteritis has been shown to be dependent on factors such as:

- Radiation dose

- Past abdominal surgery

- Body mass index

- Comorbid conditions like diabetes mellitus, hypertension

- Concurrent chemotherapy

Statistics show a large number of patients undergoing surgery for radiotherapy-induced gut damage die from their original cancer within the period of 2 years. Whereas without cancer recurrence, the 5-year survival is approximately 70%.
