Essential considerations for differential diagnosis pertain to etiologies involving visual hallucinations. These include

- Narcolepsy

- Peduncular hallucinosis

- Levodopa-induced hallucinations

- Hypnagogic hallucinations

- Migraine coma

- Schizophrenia

- Epileptic seizures

- Dementia

- Migraine aura

- Neurodegenerative - Parkinson, Alzheimer, and Lewy body dementia

- Metabolic encephalopathy - drugs, alcohol withdrawal, or delirium

CBS is differentiated from all these conditions simultaneous presence of visual deficits and the absence of neurological deficits. Furthermore, CBS is differentiated by the lack of auditory or sensory-associated hallucinations, which can be seen in manyÂ of the above differentials.
