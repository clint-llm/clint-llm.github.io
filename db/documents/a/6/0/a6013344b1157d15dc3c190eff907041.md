If SCVT is suspected, it must be treated promptly to prevent dire consequences, such as pulmonary embolism or complete occlusion of the vessel. This is based on a good and detailed history and physical exam that can lead to decreased mortality.

A strong interprofessional healthcare team should manage SCVT, including primary and emergency department clinicians, hematology, oncology, interventional radiology, and vascular surgery. These clinicians must operate cohesively from their disciplines to ensure proper measures are enacted to guide the patient's case; none of these practitioners should operate "in a silo." Nurses and pharmacists should also be part of the team, particularly where anticoagulation is concerned. Nurses can answer patient questions, administer medication, and serve as the liaison point for the various clinicians on the case. Pharmacists will verify the appropriateness of dosing, recommend particular anticoagulants based on the patient's profile, monitor for adverse events, answer patient questions about their drug regimen, and perform medication reconciliation. Collaboration, coordination, and open communication within the interprofessional team in the care of these patients will lead to better outcomes. [Level 5]
