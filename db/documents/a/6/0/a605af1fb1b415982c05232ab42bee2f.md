Directly visualizing the glottis is the most sensitive and specific method for assessing vocal fold movement abnormalities, though indirect visualization with concomitant video stroboscopy is the most practically useful method.

Visualization can start with flexible laryngoscopy in the clinic. Vocal fold asymmetry and bowing may be visualized, as well as lesions such as vocal fold scarring and sulcus vocalis which may be causing a closure deficiency of the vocal folds. The exact vocal cord positioning should be noted and may indicate the level of injury; e.g., a paramedian positioning of the cords is suggestive of injury at the level of the recurrent laryngeal nerve compared with lateral positioning of the cords suggesting both recurrent laryngeal and superior laryngeal nerve injury (indicating either a high vagal injury or a central nervous system lesion such as a stroke).

Video stroboscopy allows assessment of the dynamic functioning of the vocal folds. Subtle abnormalities of mucosal motion can be detected, and functional deficits that accompany symptoms such as breathy phonation can undergo assessment.

Serology tests tend to add little value when evaluating glottic insufficiency, however, should the patient’s symptoms be suggestive of systemic disease as a cause of their glottic insufficiency, particularly if there is suspicion of rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune conditions, the relevant serology tests should be obtained.

Vocal fold immobility is a physical finding rather than a diagnosis. It is necessary to determine the underlying cause. Commonly there is no identifiable cause found during the initial consultation. A contrast CT or MRI from the level of the skull base down to the diaphragm may need to be done to assess for any lesions along the full course of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the vagus nerve in the neck and chest.

Laryngeal electromyography should be a consideration if there is a suspicion of the etiology of the vocal cord immobility. It aids in differentiating between motion impairment due to structural issues such as mechanical fixation, dislocation, and ankylosis of the cricoarytenoid joint which may cause a closure defect, versus motion impairment caused by denervation of the vocal fold.

Due to its poor sensitivity, acoustic voice recording is less useful as a tool for screening phonatory apparatus pathology. However, it helps aid the objective analysis of voice outcomes and subsequent rehabilitation. The clinician can compare results based on computer-based analysis of acoustic signals rather than relying on patient or examiner subjective reporting.
