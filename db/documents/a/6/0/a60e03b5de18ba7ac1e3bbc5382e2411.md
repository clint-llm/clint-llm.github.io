Before placing an intragastric balloon, a patient should be under the care of a multidisciplinary team, including a nutritionist. The nutritionist will help develop a plan for the patient before placement of the balloon, in the periprocedural timeframe, and post balloon removal. Typically, the gastroenterology team sees the patient for 12 months in totality, which includes the six months with the balloon in place and six months post balloon removal.

The patient should have a planned exercise and diet regimen before placement of the balloon and during and after its removal. A key for the placement of the balloon itself is an experienced endoscopist and staff. The patient should be seen by a multidisciplinary team, including a nutritionist, gastroenterologist, primary care clinician, and psychologist/psychiatrist.
