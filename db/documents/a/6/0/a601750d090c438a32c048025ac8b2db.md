An interprofessional team approach can help achieve the best possible outcomes in some of the highest mortality scenarios. Hemorrhage is the number one cause of death in trauma patients within the first hour, and often cross-matched blood is either not available or painfully delayed. Autotransfusion can provide a segway towards stabilizing the patient and often presents with fewer risks and fewer delays than cross-matched blood. Autotransfusion requires a team approach to ensure the procedure is performed effectively, safely, and with as few complications as possible. This interprofessional team approach includes providers, nursing, and laboratory scientists both in the preparation and execution of the procedure. [Level 5]

Before autotransfusion, the following should be in place:

- Early recognition by providers of the presenting patient that autotransfusion should be utilized

- Quick preparation from nursing staff of equipment required

- The sterile technique achievedÂ providing a minimal risk of systemic infection

- Peripheral access with a blood sample sent to the lab for cross-match and additional laboratory testing if autotransfusion is not possible or insufficient

- Consultation to surgery if there is an inability to achieve hemostasis
