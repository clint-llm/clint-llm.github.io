A diagnosis of concretions is usually made incidentally during a routine eye examination under the biomicroscope. Once diagnosed, the clinician should reassure the patient that the condition is entirely benign. Asymptomatic patients can undergo observation. In the presence of aÂ foreign body sensation, irritation, redness, or watering, these concretions can be necessary. Removal of concretions is performed with a topical anesthetic in an outpatient setting, usually in the clinic. Recovery is generally rapid, with little discomfort. Recurrence of concretions may occur, especially if there is associated inflammation.
