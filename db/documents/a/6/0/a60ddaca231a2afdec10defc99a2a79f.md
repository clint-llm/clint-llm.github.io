Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis in the world. It can be classified into 2 categories: primary osteoarthritis and secondary osteoarthritis. Classically, OA presents with joint pain and loss of function; however, the disease is clinically veryÂ variable and can present merely as an asymptomatic incidental finding to a devastating and permanently disabling disorder.
