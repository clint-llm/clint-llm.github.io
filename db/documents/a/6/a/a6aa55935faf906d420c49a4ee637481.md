Patient education and compliance with treatment are crucial to managing pneumatosis intestinalis. Nonadherence to treatment and lifestyle modifications can lead toÂ consequences such as recurrence, septic shock, and death. Long-term lifestyle modifications include an elemental diet composed of digestible formula, which promotes near-complete absorption of its nutrients and reduces gas production in the intestines. Overall, patients should practice nutritional changes in order to prevent the recurrence of pneumatosis intestinalis.
