The gastrointestinal tract of humans is formed from the mesoderm, ectoderm, and endoderm. The endoderm forms the lining of the tube. The posterior splanchnic vessels fuse to form the dorsal mesentery. Anterior splanchnic vessels fuse to form ventral mesentery. The liver is developed in the septum transversum, which is enclosed by the ventral mesentery. The liver retains its attachment with the anterior abdominal wall.

Since the liver receives its blood circulation from the systemic and portal circulations, it is more susceptible to getting infections and abscesses from the bloodstream.

The usual pathophysiology for pyogenic liver abscesses is bowel content leakage and peritonitis. Bacteria travel toÂ the liver via the portal vein and resides there. Infection can also originate in the biliary system. Hematogenous spread is also a potential etiology.
