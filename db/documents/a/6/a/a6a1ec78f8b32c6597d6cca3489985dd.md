Dermatoscopes may be with or without an in-built image capturing facilities. A simple hand-held dermatoscope looks like a broader version of an otoscope and lacks an inbuilt camera. Image-capture dermatoscopes have a special lens, which mounts onto a conventional or a digital camera. United serial bus (USB) video-dermatoscopes have a high-resolution camera fitted to the handpiece that allows visualization of the image on the computer screen as well as capturing videos. Advanced dermatoscopes have an analytical capability in addition to image-capture.

Dermoscopy is performable by either the non-contact or the contact technique. In the contact technique, the glass plate of the instrument touches the lesion through the linkage fluid. In the non-contact technique, the cross-polarized lens absorbs all the scattered light and hence allows only light in a single plane to pass through it without contact of the lens with the skin. The contact technique gives better illumination and resolution. The advantage of the non-contact technique is the prevention of inter-patient infections.  Avoidance of cross-infection in the case of contact dermoscopy is by using a barrier like a cling film or adhesive tape over the lesional skin.

Although the advent of high-quality dermatoscopes with polarizers has rendered the use of linkage fluids and contact dermoscopy almost redundant; it is worthwhile to be cognizant of the concept. The linkage fluid enhances the translucency of stratum corneum facilitating imaging of deeper structures. Many substances can function in this capacity including mineral oil, ethanol, liquid paraffin, and ECG/USG gel. The latter remains the most commonly used linkage fluid in the current era, especially for onychoscopy.

The recent improvements in the manufacturing of dermatoscopes include - reduction in dimensions and bulk of the device, wi-fi connectivity for USB dermatoscopes, digital image analysis, and attempts to incorporate artificial intelligence to create an automated diagnostic unit.
