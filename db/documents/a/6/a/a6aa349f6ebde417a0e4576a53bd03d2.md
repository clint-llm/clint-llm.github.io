- Once a patient with an amputation injury arrives in hospital, a speedy but thorough assessment is essential to minimize the delay to definitive surgical management.

- Often, amputated parts are brought to the emergency department (although sometimes forgotten at the scene or referring hospital) in inappropriate storage. As a specialist center, it is crucial to inform referring units of the best way to preserve the amputated part, to label it with the patient's details, and keep it with the patient to avoid the loss.

- Early involvement of specialists where possible

- Take account of patient factors, i.e., age, occupation, comorbidities, and also patient wishes - replantation requires long and complex surgery, hospital admission, the risk of complications, long rehabilitation, and risk of an incomplete return to normal function. 

- This may not be acceptable in some patients, especially in those who are self-employed and cannot take prolonged time off work.
- As such, the terminalization of the affected finger may allow early return to work and normal function for the patient - if possible, the patient needs to understand their options and the potential outcome of each.

- Good rehabilitation process - early involvement of hand therapists
