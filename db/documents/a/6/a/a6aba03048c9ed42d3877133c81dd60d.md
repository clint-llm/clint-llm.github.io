Mitigating the effects of phantosmia can be difficult due to the lack of treatment options. The debilitating effects of phantosmia may be mitigated by addressing underlying etiologies and employing patient education. This is supported by many cases of phantosmia secondary to migraines, seizures, or schizophrenia, resolving with the treatment of the underlying etiology.

The umbrella of olfactory disorders is large, and educating patients on the nature of their particular olfactory disorder can help them differentiate phantosmia from other olfactory disorders. This differentiation can help further guide evaluation and management. Understanding the underlying etiology, if any, of a patient's phantosmia helps the patient in further pursuit of treatment and potential alleviation of symptoms. Phantosmia can be an extremely debilitating disease and severely affect a patient's quality of life. Therefore, healthcare providers should understand the definition of phantosmia and its etiology, evaluation, and management to educate patients effectively.
