The utility of hepatobiliary scintigraphy is that the radiotracer follows the bilirubin pathway, taken up by hepatocytes, excreted into the bile ducts and passing into the gallbladder and duodenum; this allows for high sensitivity and specificity in the evaluation of biliary pathologies such as cholecystitis, obstruction or leak and to a lesser extent the assessment of hepatic function.
