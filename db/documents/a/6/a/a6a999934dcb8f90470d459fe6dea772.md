Clinical outcomes have been tested in various studies. Clinical efficacy and safety of the Watchman device have been evaluated in two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and various large registries, demonstrating consistent improvements in procedural successes and complication rates. The PROTECT-AF trial and PREVAIL compared the WATCHMAN device and anticoagulation in patients with AF. The PROTECT-AF trial showed a procedural failure rate of 9%, with procedural-related complications of 8.7%, mostly secondary to pericardial effusion (4.8%).

Subsequently, the PREVAIL trial conducted on 407 patients showed a significant drop in procedure-related complications, even though it contained higher-risk patients, and about 40% of operators were novices.

ACP was first studied in 2011, demonstrating procedural success rates of 96% and serious adverse effects of 7%, of which 3.5% were pericardial effusion.

In patients with LAA anatomies unsuitable for endocardial devices, Lariat is a great option, although the procedure's safety is still a concern. There are many studies with the use of a Lariat device.
