Usually, diagnosis is made by clinical morphology and site of lesions. Histopathology is rarely necessary but may help to differentiate psoriasis from another dermatosis if the diagnosis is not easy. Characteristic changes in biopsy show parakeratosis, micro-abscess, the absence of granular lesions, regular elongation of ridges in the form of camel foot appearance, and spongiform pustules of Kogoj with dilated and tortuous capillaries in the dermal papilla.
