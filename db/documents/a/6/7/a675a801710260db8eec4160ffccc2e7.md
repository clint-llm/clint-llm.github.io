The ileocolic artery is present in more than 95% of people. In roughly 50% of patients, the ileocolic artery travels anterior and superior to the superior mesenteric vein. The most common variations of the right colon vasculature include the common origin of the right and middle colic arteries, with separate vascular of the ileocolic, and common origin of the right colic and ileocolic, with a distinct origin of the middle colic. An additional anatomic variation includes the absence of the right colic artery.
