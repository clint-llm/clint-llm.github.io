The ductus arteriosus is a short vessel that connects the fetal pulmonary artery to the aorta and involutes it following birth. During development, the ductus arteriosus allows oxygenated blood to bypass the pulmonary circulation and provides nutritional and oxygen-rich blood directly into the systemic circulation. After birth, the ductus arteriosus closes, and its remnant is referred to as the ligamentum arteriosum. A failure of the closure of the ductus arteriosus leads to a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) which may cause a left-to-right shunt post-birth. A PDA may be repaired either medically using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) or surgically.
