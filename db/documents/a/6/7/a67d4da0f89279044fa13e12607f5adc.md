**Limitations of forensic gait analysis and criticism about its admissibility in the court of law**

In the present era, due to the paradigm shift in forensic science, there is an increased focus on the reliability, accuracy, quality of evidence, and its admissibility in the court of law. Forensic gait analysis has also witnessed criticism regarding its reproducibility, reliability, lack of proper standards, and rules of forensic practice.

Gait pattern or walking pattern is highly affected by various parameters mentioned above, so it brings the investigating officer into a situation that requires consideration of several factors, which is practically not possible to identify the single suspect. Another limitation of gait pattern analysis is that we do not have databases that can be used for gait comparison. Gait pattern shows high intra-individual variability. It means that a person's gait is highly variable on different occasions and scenarios, which makes it difficult to identify the person.

Presently, the research is being carried out in the area of automated gait recognition combined with larger & variable datasets, tested variables, and enhanced statistical evaluation of results. Despite these improvements, any form of forensic evidence without fully recommended codes of practice and standardization of procedures and having error rates in reproducibility and repeatability should be treated with caution in forensic scenarios.
