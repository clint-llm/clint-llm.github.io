Rifaximin is an antibiotic used to treat irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, reduce the risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence in adults, and treat travelersâ€™ diarrhea caused by noninvasive strains of Escherichia coli. Rifaximin has a broad spectrum of activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. This antibiotic is used primarily in diseases since it is specific to the gastrointestinal tract due to its nonabsorbable profile. This activity will review the indications, mechanism of action, administration, safety profile, and contraindications for rifaximin. In addition, this activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, and relevant interactions) pertinent to the interprofessional team members.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of rifaximin.
- Describe the adverse drug reactions of rifaximin therapy.
- Review the indications for using rifaximin therapy on a patient.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance rifaximin and improve outcomes.
