The two common staging systems for telangiectatic osteosarcoma include the Enneking system for malignant bone neoplasms and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) system for staging bone sarcomas. The Enneking system includes tumor histological grade, the local extent of the tumor- intracompartmental or extracompartmental and the presence of metastasis. The AJCC system considers tumor histological grade, tumor size, and the presence and location of metastases.
