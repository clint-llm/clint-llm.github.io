Orthogonal radiographs of the forearm should be obtained during the evaluation of both bone forearm fractures. Standard radiographs should include an AP (anterior-posterior) and lateral views of the forearm. Oblique views of the forearm and imaging of the wrist and elbow should be considered as needed. CT scan is rarely required in the setting of both bone forearm fractures but can be useful for complex fractures or if there is a concern for intraarticular involvement.
