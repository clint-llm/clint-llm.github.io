Contraindications to removing a foreign body from the external auditory canal are related to the patient's cooperativeness, location of the object in the EAC, lack of appropriate instruments for removing the foreign body, and the type of foreign body. An uncooperative patient and the inability to safely sedate an uncooperative patient are contraindications to attempting foreign body removal.

A foreign body lodged against the tympanic membrane, or a foreign body that cannot be grasped easily, such as a hard spherically shaped object, may require specialized equipment not readily available. Specific methods might also be contraindicated in certain situations. For example, irrigation would be contraindicated with a suspected tympanic membrane perforation, removal of organic material, or removal of a battery. Irrigation may also be contraindicated if the suspected foreign body is made of a spongy material that may swell and enlarge if hydrated.
