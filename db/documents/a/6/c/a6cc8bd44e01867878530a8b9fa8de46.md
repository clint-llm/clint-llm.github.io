There are various types of melanoma: superficial spreading melanoma (most common), nodular (worst prognosis), lentigo malignant (best prognosis), and acral lentiginous (occurs on palms of hand and soles of feet, common in African Americans).

Melanoma most commonly metastasizes to the skin and lungs, but sometimes metastasizes to the small bowel (most common site of metastases). When diffusely metastatic, there are chemotherapy options available, namely intralesional Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy (BCG) or immunotherapy with vaccines aimed to raiseÂ the levels of anti-melanoma tumor antibodies.
