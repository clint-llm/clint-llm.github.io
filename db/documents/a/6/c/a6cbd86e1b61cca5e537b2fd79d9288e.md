The complications of untreated or poorly treated HT1 are liver failure, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, resulting in early death. Neurological complications are also common in HT1 patients, ranging from porphyria-like neuropathic crisis to muscle weakness, often leading to respiratory failure.Â Renal Fanconi syndrome can result in hypophosphatemic rickets.

HT2 is typically milder than HT1, and complications in untreated patients are related to corneal ulcerations and painful keratotic plaques. However, 50% of HT2 patients may also develop some degree of intellectual disability.
