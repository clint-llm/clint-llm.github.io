Blepharoplasty is a surgical technique for correcting defects, deformities, and disfigurations of the eyelids; and for aesthetically modifying the eye region of the face. With excision and removal of skin and adipocyte fat and the reinforcement of the corresponding muscle and tendon tissues, blepharoplasty resolves functional and cosmetic problems of the periorbita, which is the area from the eyebrow to the upper portion of the cheek. The procedure is most common among women, who accounted for approximately 85% of blepharoplasty procedures in 2014 in the USA and 88% of such procedures in the UK.

The operative goal of a blepharoplasty is the restoration of the correct functioning to the affected eyelid(s) and the restoration of the aesthetics of the eye-region of the face.
