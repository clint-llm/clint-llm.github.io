The choroid plexus refers to a group of fenestrated blood capillaries locatedÂ in the ventricular system. The choroid plexus mostly synthesizes CSF.

Arachnoid granulations are responsible for CSF resorption; they drain CSF into the dural venous sinuses.

CSF drains into the lymphatic circulation, through lymph ducts contiguous to the olfactory duct as it passes through the cribriform plate.
