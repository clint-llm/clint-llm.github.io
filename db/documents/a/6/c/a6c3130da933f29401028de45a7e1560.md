Although there is some controversy over indications, recurrent deep venous thromboses and consequent pulmonary emboli refractory to treatment with anticoagulation may require placement of an inferior vena cava filter.

IVC thrombosis is a difficult clinical scenario. Although it can be asymptomatic IVC thrombosis can also present with a myriad of symptoms. These are usually non-specific like abdominal or back pain; but may also include leg cramping, swelling, or pain. Treatment is based on patient condition/symptoms and can include anticoagulation, clot, and/or filter (if present) removal via Interventional Radiology techniques or rarely open surgical techniques. The most common cause of IVC thrombosis in a patient without anatomic variants is the previous IVC filter placement.
