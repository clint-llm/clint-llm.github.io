A three-layered body wall develops from somatopleuric mesoderm by the ninth week of gestation. The three intercostal muscle layers differentiate from hypaxial myotomes innervated by ventral primary rami of spinal nerves T1 to T11, the intercostal nerves.

Vertebrae develop intersegmentally by embryonic fusion of the caudal half of the superjacent somitic sclerotome with the cranial half of the subjacent sclerotome. Ribs, myotomal derivatives, and segmental neurovasculature maintain their segmental embryonic patterning. The rib head in most ribs (2 to 9) thus articulates with two vertebrae at the costovertebral joint, but by convention, rib denomination is by reference to their subjacent vertebra. Rib 1 only articulates with the first thoracic vertebra, and ribs 10 through 12 also have only one facet at the costovertebral joint at which they articulate with the lower thoracic vertebrae.

The lining of the coelomic cavity develops as a mesothelium which invests organs as visceral pleura and the internal surface of the thoracic wall as parietal pleura. The space between visceral and parietal layers comprises the pleural cavity, which normally contains only serous fluid. The lungs inhabit the two halves of the thoracic cavity, not the pleural cavity.
