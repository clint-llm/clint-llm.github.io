Renal lymphoma is commonly seen as a part of the spectrum of multi-systemic; however, it may seldom be seen as a primary disease. It usually presents in middle-aged persons although half of the cases may be clinically silent. Presenting symptoms include flank pain, weight loss, fever, night sweats, palpable abdominal mass, hematuria, and deranged renal function usually seen as elevated serum creatinine.

Primary renal lymphoma is an infiltrative tumor that grows without disruption of structure or function. However, the most common presentation of primary renal lymphoma is acute renal failure, flank pain, and mass. The cause for renal failure is somewhat ambiguous, but several theories have been postulated including lymphomatous infiltration of the parenchyma, hypercalcemia due to vitamin D overproduction by the lymphomatous mass or ureteral, and vascular or tubular compression by the lesion.
