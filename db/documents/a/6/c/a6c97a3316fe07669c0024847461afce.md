Anencephaly is not compatible with life. The most important aspect of the management of this condition is prevention. The simplest way to reduce the incidence of anencephaly is to advise women of childbearing age to take a supplement of folic acid. Any dose at or more than 0.4 mg a day is effective; this is especially important for any woman taking anticonvulsants. For a young female patient with epilepsy, counseling is essential about the risk of seizures during pregnancy to the developing fetus and the risk of teratogenicity. The patient and provider should develop a plan before she starts a family. The seizures should best be under optimal control with at all possible a single anti-epileptic agent at the lowest possible dose. Valproate should be avoided. The anticonvulsant with the best track record concerning teratogenicity is lamotrigine.

Maternal serum and fetal ultrasonography are diagnostic procedures during pregnancy for in utero diagnosis of any neural tube defect, including anencephaly. Early termination of pregnancy may be an option upon the diagnosis of anencephaly.
