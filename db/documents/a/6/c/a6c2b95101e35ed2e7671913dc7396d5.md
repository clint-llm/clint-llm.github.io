Physiological variants of the popliteal artery are a common phenomenon. Studies have shown seven major branching variants using digital subtraction angiography. A particular study from 2004 to 2006 on 621 patients (1242 limbs) revealed 89.2% of participants with traditional branching patterns of the popliteal artery and the following variations:

- Aplastic/hypoplastic posterior tibial artery-5.1%

- Hypoplastic/aplastic anterior tibial artery-1.7%

- Trifurcation-1.5%

- High origin of the anterior tibial artery-1.2%

- Hypoplastic/aplastic posterior tibial and anterior tibial arteries-0.8%

- High origin of the posterior tibial branch-0.4%

- Anterior tibioperoneal trunk-0.1%

Research found that when one limb had a variant, there was a 28% chance the other limb would also be a variant. When one limb displayed traditional anatomy, there was a 13% chance the other limb would contain a variation.  These variations carry significance in surgical situations.
