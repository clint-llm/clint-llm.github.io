Elevated IOP can be caused by many things, even with concurrent steroid use. The steroid-induced rises in IOP are reversible on discontinuation. This differentiates it from glaucoma. Below is a list of differential diagnoses that can give rise to high levels of IOP:

- Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)

- Angle-closure glaucoma

- Angle-recession glaucoma

- Pigmentary glaucoma

- Plateau iris glaucoma

- Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma

- Uveitic glaucoma
