**Antiviral Mechanisms of CMV Drugs**

Anti-CMV drugs target the viral DNA polymerase, pUL54.

- Ganciclovir acts as a nucleoside analog. Its antiviral activity requires phosphorylation by the CMV protein kinase, pUL97.

- Cidofovir is a nucleotide analog, which is already phosphorylated and active.

- Foscarnet has a different mode of action as it directly inhibits polymerase function by blocking the pyrophosphate binding site of pUL54.

Two CMV proteins are implicated in the resistance of these drugs: pUL97 and pUL54.
