Hypertriglyceridemia is responsible for a mild amount of acute pancreatitis. There is a direct correlation with increased risk of pancreatitis as triglyceride levels rise above 500 mg/dL. When values rise above 1000 mg/dL, there is a described 5% risk of pancreatitis that then doubles when values reach more than 2000 mg/dL. Acute pancreatitis treatment includes IV fluid resuscitation and pain control. Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis includes standard acute pancreatitis treatment, insulin to reduce triglyceride load, and possibly total plasma exchange (TPE).

Additionally, there is evidence suggesting a relationship between elevated triglycerides with respect to cardiovascular disease, through increased atherosclerotic burden. While a causal relationship has not yet been established, evidence suggests that states of increased triglyceride levels are linked to an increased incidence of coronary heart disease.
