NETs are slow growing indolent tumors. But they induce the same other consequences of uncontrolled tumor growth with mechanical and physiologic alteration of the gastrointestinal tract. Bowel obstruction, perforation, bleeding, and altered function are possible complications of advanced intestinal NETs. Therefore, prognosis depends primarily on the tumor and disease stage, tumor location, presence of metastasis, presence of synchronous or metachronous tumors, and the histologic grade/differentiation. Overall, the prognosis of intestinal carcinoids is good. High overall survival rates were reported among intestinal NETs patients including patients with distant metastasis with a 5-year overall survival ranges between 40% to 85%.
