Salmon calcitonin (after this referred to as "calcitonin") is an analog of human calcitonin used to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis, Paget disease of bone, and hypercalcemia. Its clinical importance derives from its ability to inhibit osteoclasts and increase renal excretion of calcium. Through these processes, bone matrix resorption and serum calcium are both decreased. For these reasons, it is of benefit in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, Paget disease of bone, and emergent hypercalcemia. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of calcitonin, pertinent for clinicians and other interprofessional team members where calcitonin therapy can provide patient benefit.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of calcitonin.
- Review the FDA-approved on-label indications of calcitonin.
- Summarize the contraindications and risks associated with calcitonin therapy.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients receiving treatment with calcitonin.
