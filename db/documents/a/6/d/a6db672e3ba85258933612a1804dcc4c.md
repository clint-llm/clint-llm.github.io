There are few contraindications to the cone procedure. If there is too little cervix to excise due to previous excisions, then a cold knife coneÂ may not be possible. If a patient is a poor surgical candidate, then an office procedure avoiding general anesthesia would be recommended. Pregnancy is a relative contraindication to the cold knife cone and should only be performed when there is a strong suspicion of invasive cancer. Severe cervicitis or a patient on anticoagulant therapy are contraindications to the cone.
