Von Hippel-Lindau is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation of the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 3, resulting in an abnormal pVHL. pVHL regulates a protein known as HIF-1-alpha, which is responsible for cellular response to hypoxia. VHL genetic mutations result in alterations to pVHL at the HIF-1-alpha binding site. As a result, pVHL does not bind effectively to HIF-1-alpha, which, in turn, leads to the transcription of several genes and subsequent upregulation of growth factors, including erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor B, and other genes involved in glucose uptake and metabolism.
