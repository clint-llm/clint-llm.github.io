Chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis (CNH) is a benign inflammatory condition that affects the skin and cartilage of the pinna. CNH, also known as Winkler disease, commonly affects the helix of the pinna, though in some cases, the antihelix also may be affected. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis.
- Describe the presentation of patients with chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis.
- Outline the treatment options available for patients with chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving coordination and communication to advance the management of chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis and improve outcomes.
