SCUBA (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) diving was introduced to the world by Jacques-Yves Cousteau. In 1942, he, along with Emile Gagnan, developed the demand valve system that led to modern regulators. However, it was scientific research advanced by the work of Paul Bert and John Scott Haldane, from France and Scotland, respectively, that helped explain the effects of water pressure on the body and also defined safe limits for compressed air diving. Cousteau became famous by following these rules, surviving while many others before him died while diving. Much earlier in 1825, the "first workable, full-time SCUBA" was invented by an Englishman, William James. It incorporates a cylindrical belt around the diver's trunk that serves as an air reservoir at 450 psi. Air delivery to the diver was by turning a valve on and off as needed.

Today, there are two principal types of SCUBA: open and closed circuits. Open-circuit vents all expired gas into the water and is the mode used predominately in recreational diving. Closed-circuit systems, in which exhaled gas is rebreathed after carbon dioxide is absorbed and oxygen added, were widely used before open circuits became available, particularly by military divers who wished to avoid showing any air bubbles. Herein, we will cover medical concerns of compressed gas diving, including the risks and benefits of air,Â  enhanced oxygen (nitrox), and trimix diving, and the physics and physiology of SCUBA.
