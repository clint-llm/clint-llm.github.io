Patients should be evaluated on an individual basis. The main factors that should be taken into account in deciding whether congenital melanocytic nevi should be excised are the risk of developing melanoma and cosmetic disfigurement and derived psychological impact.

The risk of developing melanoma in individual small and medium lesions is extremely low. Therefore, routine monitoring in this group does not seem necessary.

When a giant or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi are present, follow-up is recommended. When a large number of nevi are present, mole mapping with high-quality photography and dermoscopy is ideal. Excision surgery is recommended when malignancy is suspected, or when it can improve cosmetic outcome.

When CMN are removed for cosmetic reasons, dermabrasion, various laser modalities, and curettage are sometimes used.

A pediatric neurologist should evaluate patients with neurocutaneous melanosis. They can sometimes benefit from surgery and/or chemotherapy. Symptomatic medical treatment (i.e., anticonvulsants, dexamethasone) should be used whenever necessary.
