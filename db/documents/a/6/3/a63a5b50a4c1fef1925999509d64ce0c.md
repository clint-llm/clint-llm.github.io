During the gastrulation phase of the embryo, three germ layers are createdâ€”the ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. The ectoderm itself is composed of two parts, the surface ectoderm, and the neuroectoderm. The neural crest, which derives from the neuroectoderm, gives rise to the peripheral nervous system which includes the saphenous nerve. On the other hand, the blood vessels that give rise to the saphenous artery and vein derive from the mesoderm. Although the blood vessels and nerves may originate from different germ layers, the vasculature corresponds with the consequent neuronal network. The Schwann cells that myelinate the peripheral nerves release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to stimulate the growth of the associated blood vessels of the neurovascular bundle.
