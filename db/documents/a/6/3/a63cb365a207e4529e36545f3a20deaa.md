A chylothorax is the accumulation of chyle in the pleural space. This is most commonly seen following traumatic disruption of the thoracic duct and is typically diagnosed based on the milky appearance of fluid due to high-fat content. Most patients with chylothoraces will require surgical exploration of the thoracic duct. This activity reviews the evaluation and management options for patients with chylothoraces and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of a chylothorax.
- Summarize how to evaluate for a chylothorax.
- Outline the treatment options for a chylothorax.
- Explain a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients with chylothorax.
