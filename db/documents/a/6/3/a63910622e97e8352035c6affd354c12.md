The management of silent MI is an interprofessional. Often the diagnosis is missed or delayed, and hence appropriate referral to a cardiologist should be made. Patients should receive education about the control of modifiable risk factors; smoking cessation, lowering blood cholesterol, control of hypertension, diabetes, maintaining ideal body weight, regular exercises, control of stressors in their lifestyle, dietary modifications, and medication compliance.  They should be advised regular follow-ups as by controlling these risk factors one can improve the quality of life and hence the long-term survival.
