Much of the information about the prognosis of TS has been gained from analyses of reported cases. The overall survival for children with medulloblastoma alone with treatment is 52% at 10 years.APC mutations or TS2, 7 of 8 patients who died in a familial analysis done by Hamilton et al. died because of a brain tumor.

Since there are several deadly comorbidities in TS, the prognosis depends on the disease presentation. One case report describes a patient with glioblastoma multiforme early in life that was resected and radiated who subsequently developed adenocarcinoma of the colon. The patient survived into his 60s.

Patients who develop any malignancy that metastasizes have a poor prognosis. Inherited MMR or APC mutations cause CRC 70% to 100% of the time if no treatment or prevention is applied.

Prognosis may be worse in those patients that present with both CNS tumor, specifically, glioma, and CRC. The development of glioblastoma multiforme seems to render TS patients the worst prognosis, with an average survival being 27 months.

Also of note, FAP patients who undergo a prophylactic colectomy most frequently end up dying because of duodenal cancer, usually located in the peri-ampullary region of the duodenum.
