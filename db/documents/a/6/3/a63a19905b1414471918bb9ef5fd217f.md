Tonsils are lymphoid tissue aggregates situated near the entrance of the digestive and respiratory tracts and play a key role in our immune system. They act as a front-line defense forming the initial immunological response to inhaled or ingested pathogens. The lymphatic tissues located in the oropharynx are composed of a circumferential tonsillar ring, known as the Waldeyer's ring which consists of the palatine tonsils (faucial tonsils), adenoid (nasopharyngeal tonsil), lingual tonsil, and tubal tonsils. When patients and doctors discuss tonsils, they are often referring to the palatine tonsils located at the back of the throat between the two palatine arches (pillars).
