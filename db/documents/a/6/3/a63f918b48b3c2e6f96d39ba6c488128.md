It is always important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a general practitioner, obstetrician, gynecologist, urologist, and a physiatrist. The physiotherapists also play crucial roles in the interprofessional group. They should teach the patients the proper way to perform Kegel exercises and how to contract the pelvic floor muscles correctly. The nurses are also vital members of the healthcare team since they will assist with the education of the patient and family.

The patients usually donâ€™t have sufficient knowledge about general pregnancy topics and pelvic floor risks.
