Nursing and respiratory therapists must closely monitor any patient on mechanical ventilation, including those on SIMV. Ventilator asynchrony and dyssynchrony result when the patient and ventilator are out of sync and should be minimized. There are seven types of events: ineffective effort, double trigger, premature cycling, delayed cycling, reverse triggering, flow starvation, and auto-cycling. Graphical displays on ventilators can help nurses, and respiratory therapists identify ventilator asynchrony. These graphics include pressure and flow waveforms. Further education may be required to identify these events on waveforms monitoring, but prompt identification will increase the amount of time a patient spends in synchrony with their ventilator.
