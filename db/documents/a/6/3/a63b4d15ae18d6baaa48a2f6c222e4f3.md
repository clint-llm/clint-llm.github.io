The treatment options for autoimmune encephalitis include immunosuppression and tumor resection if applicable. The treatment regimen is based on principles of autoimmune disease management with the aim of pathogenic antibody depletion. It is important to note that treatment should not be delayed until detection of the antibody, as early initiation is associated with improved outcomes. A multidisciplinary team should be involved in the team involving neurologists, rheumatologists, and oncologists to manage AIE. First-line therapy for AIE includes corticosteroids (1 g IV methylprednisolone for 3 to 5 days), intravenous immunoglobulins (0.4 g/kg/day for five days), and plasmapheresis alone or combined.

Plasmapheresis should be considered in the treatment when patients have severe dysautonomia, refractory seizures, or central hypoventilation syndrome. Second-line immunotherapy should be considered for patients who fail to improve on these regimens. This includes rituximab (375 mg/m^2 for four weeks) and cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m^2 for six months) alone or combined in the adult population. Nonetheless, if underlying malignancy were found, it should undergo removal or chemotherapy as it accelerates improvement and prevents relapses.
