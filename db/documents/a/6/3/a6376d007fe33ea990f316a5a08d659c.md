Regional cooling using ice packs to wrists and ankles during therapy may help in decreasing the frequency and severity of symptoms by decreasing blood flow

Randomized clinical trials using topical urea preparation to hands and feet revealed contradictory results depending on the dosage and duration of treatment in patients receiving capecitabine. Further studies need to validate the use to be applied in clinical practice

Studies including meta-analysis conducted using pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) reveal varying results

Oral  Celecoxib 200 to 400 mg twice a day for 12 to 18 weeks significantly reduced the risk of grades 2 and 3 HFS (odds ratio 0.37, 95% CI 0.19-0.71) in a meta-analysis of randomized trials

Studies using systemic corticosteroids in the management of HFS are also not convincing resulting in the need for large randomized clinical trials
