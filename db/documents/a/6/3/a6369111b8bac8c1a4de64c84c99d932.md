SAD mainly affects energy output by inducing fatigue and a reduction in energy levels. It affects the daily functioning of an individual leading to lower performances and reduced productivity. The Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ) revealed several aspects of the condition. Therefore, much is yet to be unveiled about this form of depression. While the effects on melatonin, serotonin, and vitamin D induction from sunlight have been documented, its effects on other hormones and neurotransmitters are yet to be known. Counseling approaches are intrinsically effective in handling the condition, but supplementation with synthetic vitamin D and bright light therapy is also effective.

SAD requires the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team that includes clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nursing staff, mental health professionals, and pharmacists. These disciplines need to exercise open communication and collaborative effort to bring about the best possible patient outcomes. [Level 5]
