# Continuing Education Activity

Stroke is the third leading cause of death and morbidity in the United States. Systemic atherosclerosis and atherosclerosis of extracranial and intracranial arteries have been identified as the major cause of ischemic stroke. Doppler imaging of the extracranial is routinely performed to assess the atherosclerotic burden of these arteries. This activity reviews the assessment, protocol, and interpretation of Doppler imaging of extracranial arteries.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the technique of Doppler US of extracranial carotid arteries.
- Summarize the interpretation of Doppler waveforms of extracranial carotid arteries.
- Summarize the protocol of Doppler US of extracranial carotid arteries.
- Summarize the clinical significance of Doppler US of extracranial carotid arteries.

# Introduction

Over the past few decades, Doppler ultrasound has become a primary modality for extracranial carotid assessment because it is readily available, non-invasive, and relatively inexpensive.

# Anatomy and Physiology

Extracranial vessels represent vessels outside the brain and skull. The most common configuration is the three-vessel arch anatomy, where the first branch is the brachiocephalic artery which further branches into the right common carotid artery (CCA) and right subclavian artery. The second branch is the left CCA, with the left subclavian artery as the third branch.

The most common variant to this anatomy is the common origin of the brachiocephalic artery and left CCA from the aortic arch. The common carotid arteries bifurcate into the external carotid artery (ECA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) at the upper border of the thyroid. The carotid bulb is the location of a bifurcation and the ICA origin.

# Indications

Indications for extracranial carotid doppler ultrasound include hemispheric or nonhemispheric neurologic symptoms, cervical bruit, pulsatile neck mass, preoperative evaluation for major cardiovascular surgery, follow-up of known carotid disease, and subclavian steal syndrome.

# Equipment

Since carotid vessels are superficial, a high-frequency linear transducer operating between 5.0 to 7.5 MHz is used. This is because the frequency of the ultrasound probe is inversely proportional to the depth of insonation. Doppler US is usually performed in combination with grayscale imaging. Grayscale images are obtained with a 5.0 to 12.0 MHz transducer.

# Preparation

The patient should be placed supine with head slightly extended and turned 45 degrees away from the examined side. The sonographer position is based on individual preference; some prefer to sit behind the patient’s head facing caudally, while others may prefer sitting to the side facing superiorly. The patient’s bed height should be adjusted according to the sonographer’s comfort to avoid hunching over.

# Technique or Treatment

The technique is built on the principle of the Doppler effect, with measurement of the change in the frequency and wavelength of a sound wave transmitted and reflected by moving red blood cells within the vessel, termed as Doppler frequency shift.

There are many parameters that should be optimally adjusted to achieve reliable results. The actual angle of insonation / Doppler angle should be less than <60 degrees (as close as possible to parallel) to improve the accuracy of measurements (the calculated velocity will be less precise if calculated/extrapolated from a nearly perpendicular angle).

Spectral analysis including peak systolic velocity (PSV), peak diastolic velocity (PDV), mean maximum velocity, and pulsatility index can then be obtained. Spectral Doppler waveform evaluation gives critical information about flow dynamics at the point of sampling, which depends on hemodynamic factors affecting a proximal or distal portion of the vessel.

With complete occlusion of ICA, the external carotid doppler waveform can change from high resistance to low resistance due to the development of low resistance collateral pathways.  This is known as the internalization of the external carotid.

Peak systolic velocity of greater than 125 cm/s correlates with 50% or higher ICA stenosis.

The final assessment is done on vertebral arteries to determine the direction of flow. Vertebral arteries are located deep in the neck. Therefore, time gain compensation should be optimized.

# Clinical Significance

Stroke is the third leading cause of death and major disability in the united states. Atherosclerosis of extracranial and intracranial cerebral arteries has been identified as the major cause of ischemic stroke. The evaluation of atherosclerotic burden, therefore, is very crucial for stroke risk stratification. Grayscale ultrasound imaging combined with color Doppler and spectral waveform analysis is a widely available tool that can assess the morphology of plaques and detect hemodynamically significant stenosis. Besides the screening, doppler examination of extracranial carotid is also beneficial to evaluate the potential complications of vascular interventions such as pseudoaneurysm formation, restenosis of carotid arteries, fistula formation, and stent deformation and fracture.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Stroke risk stratification through evaluation of extracranial arterial atherosclerotic burden has proven to be beneficial with improved outcomes. This requires an interprofessional team, including primary care provider/internist, mid-level practitioners (PAs and MPs), interventional radiologist, vascular surgeon, neurologist, and ultrasound technologist. Communication between these health professionals is crucial for patient-centered care. [Level 5]
