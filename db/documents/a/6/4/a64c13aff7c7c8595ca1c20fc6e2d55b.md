Trichuris trichiura, also known as the human whipworm, is a roundworm that causes trichuriasis in humans. Infections involving a high-worm burden typically include distal parts of the large intestine. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of trichuriasis and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of trichuriasis infections.
- Review the presentation of a patient with trichuriasis infection.
- Outline the treatment options for trichuriasis.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by trichuriasis infection.
