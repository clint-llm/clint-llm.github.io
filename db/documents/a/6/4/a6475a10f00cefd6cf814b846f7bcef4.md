Having an interprofessional approach is key to the successful management of this injury. Clinicians in the emergency department must be familiar with this injury because it is easily overlooked, and prompt antibiotics and tetanus are paramount at preventing concomitant infection. Having a high index of suspicion will decrease the time to a definitive diagnosis and operative treatment if needed. The treating surgeon may need to take the patient to the operating room several times to clear the material and compromised tissue. As mentioned previously, co-management from infectious disease, toxicology, and hand specialists may enhance the treatment plan. The nursing staff and on-call physician will need to closely monitor the patient perioperatively and coordinate care and patient education to prevent any complications such as compartment syndrome or super-infection. Postoperatively, physical and occupational therapy play an especially important role in preventing contractures, increasing range of motion, and performing activities of daily living. Open, interprofessional communication between all of these different health care providers is critical to limiting morbidity from this injury. [Level 5]
