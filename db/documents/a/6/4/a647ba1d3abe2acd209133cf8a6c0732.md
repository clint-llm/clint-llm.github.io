Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive, facultative intracellular rod bacteria that is catalase positive and beta-hemolytic when grown on blood agar. There have been several historical foodborne illness breakouts involving L. monocytogenes. In 1981, L. monocytogenes was revealed to be a foodborne illness linked to a variety of foods.  In 1985, a massive outbreak of L. monocytogenes was traced to a brand of soft cheeses involving 142 cases, 28 deaths, and 20 fetal losses.L. monocytogenes is not the most common foodborne illness, it has the highest mortality rate secondary to its unique virulence factors.

L. monocytogenes’ virulence factors include but are not limited to intracellular mobility via actin polymerization and the ability to replicate at refrigerator temperatures. This makes it difficult for food industries to control. Transmission of the bacteria occurs via the fecal-oral route and most commonly involves foods such as cold deli meats and unpasteurized dairy products. The number of cases involving L. monocytogenes has decreased in recent years thanks to advances in prevention, detection, and treatment.

Infection via L. monocytogenes (listeriosis) includes but is not limited to sepsis, meningitis, encephalitis, spontaneous abortion, or fever and self-limiting gastroenteritis in a healthy adult. Populations at the most risk for L. monocytogenes infection include pregnant females, infants, immunocompromised individuals, and elderly.
