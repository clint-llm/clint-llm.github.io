Plummer-Vinson syndrome (PVS) is a rare condition characterized by the classic triad of dysphagia, iron-deficiency anemia, and esophageal webbing. Plummer-Vinson syndrome is more common in middle-aged women and is associated with an increased risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the pharynx and proximal esophagus. Other disorders associated with Plummer-Vinson syndrome include celiac disease, Crohn disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and thyroid disease, raising the possibility that immune dysregulation may be involved in its pathogenesis, although this remains to be proven. This activity addresses the presentation, evaluation, and management of Plummer-Vinson syndrome and examines the role of an interprofessional team approach in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of Plummer-Vinson syndrome.
- Outline the examination findings in a patient with Plummer-Vinson syndrome.
- Explain the management of Plummer-Vinson syndrome.
- Review the interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and management of Plummer-Vinson syndrome and improve outcomes.
