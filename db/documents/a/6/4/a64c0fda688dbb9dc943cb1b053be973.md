Restenosis presents with a wide spectrum of clinical features that depict varying levels of cardiac ischemia in the setting of previous coronary intervention. The clinical features of restenosis depend on the individual patient and lesion characteristics, as well as the anatomic location. They may present as stable angina, unstable angina (26 to 53 % for BMS, 16 to 66 % for DES), or acute myocardial infarction (MI) (3.5 to 20 % for BMS, 1 to 20 % for DES).P < 0.001).

In a study of 909 patients who had ISR after BMS, first-generation DES, or second-generation DES,  the clinical presentation was acute coronary syndrome in 67.8%, 71.0%, and 66.7% of patients, respectively (P=0.470). In contrast, myocardial infarction occurred in 10.6%, 10.1%, and 5.2% of patients, respectively (P=0.273). These are not statistically significant and may suggest that patient and lesion characteristics, rather than the specific initial device deployed, are the major determinants of the clinical presentation of ISR.
