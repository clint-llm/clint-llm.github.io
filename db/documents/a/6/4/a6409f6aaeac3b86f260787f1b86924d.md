Bowel perforation results from a violation of the mucosal layers of the intestinal tract resulting in the spilling of air and digestive contents into the peritoneal cavity. These contents can range from highly acidic gastric contents in more proximal bowel perforation, to fecal material from a more distal area of perforation. Areas of partial erosion can become full-thickness tears over time, or a specific insult can cause spontaneous rupture. This means that pain may be gradual or sudden, but it usually progresses in severity. Feelings of abdominal distension and signs of abdominal muscular rigidity representing peritonitis may develop.
