Snake venom is a mixture of multiple different compounds, each having different physiologic effects. The specific constitution of an individual snake’s venom will vary by species, geographic location, diet, and even between siblings.

Examples of specific compounds identified and their actions:

- Snake venom metalloproteinase (SVMP) has both pro- and anti-coagulation effects. SVMP also contributes to the development of edema, myotoxicity, and inflammation.

- Snake venom serine protease (SVSP) targets the coagulation cascade and causes platelet aggregation.

- Phospholipase A2 has anticoagulant, cytotoxic, and myotoxic effects. It also contributes to the development of edema.

- Disintegrins and C-type lectins modulate platelet aggregation.

Neurotoxins are uncommon among North American Crotalids. However, three particular species: Mojave rattlesnake (C. scutulatus), Timber rattlesnake (C. horridus), Southern Pacific rattlesnakes (C. oreganus helleri) are known to have the Mojave A, or a similar presynaptic neurotoxin.
