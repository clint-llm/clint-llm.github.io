Resective surgery is undertaken for patients with epileptogenic foci. The newer dimensions in the minimally invasive techniques have been achieved through the advancements in the stereotactic radiosurgery, MR-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MgLiTT), and subdural electroencephalogram (SEEG)-guided radiofrequency thermal coagulation.

In non-lesional epilepsy disorder, there has been a gradual transition from the previously performed major anatomic resective procedures (hemispherectomy) to the currently advocated disconnection procedures (hemispherotomy).

In certain patients who are not a suitable candidate for epilepsy surgery, seizure reduction can be attainable through neuromodulatory techniques such as vagal nerve stimulation and deep brain stimulation.

**Peri-Insular Hemispherotomy
**

The salient steps in the surgical procedures for a peri-insular hemispherotomy include:

- Suprasylvian block

- Infrasylvian block constituting the resection of the frontal and the temporal neocortex exhibiting the feature of the ictal origins, as per the relevant preoperative and intraoperative investigations

- Transection of the corona radiata

- Anterolateral temporal lobectomy/disconnection of the temporal lobe via incising fornix at the splenium

- Transventricular corpus callosotomy

- Frontoparietal disconnection

- Subpial insular resection

The details of the procedure include:

**Patient Positioning**

Supine with head turned to the contralateral side, ensuring the temporal lobe remains at the apex and parallel to the floor.

**Osteoplastic Craniotomy**

This ensures better cosmetic results through enhanced wound healing and preservation of the atrophy of the temporalis muscle.

**Lateral Disconnection**

A corticectomy in the middle frontal gyrus extending into the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle disconnects the fibers of the corona radiata and the internal capsule. Plugging of the foramen of Monro is advocated for minimizing the risk of hydrocephalus. The corticectomy at the supramarginal gyrus is then carried out along the atrium into the temporal horn. Subpial resection of the insula is carried after the frontotemporal operculectomy, which facilitates surgical access. The frontal and temporal opercula are resected to expose the insula.

**Mesial Temporal Resection**

The anterior temporal lobectomy is performed until the subpial visualization of the oculomotor nerve, and MCA bifurcation at the limen insulae is confirmed. The subpial resection ensures that the midbrain/brainstem is not inadvertently entered. Amygdalectomy is then undertaken till the junction of the inferior choroidal point and the MCA bifurcation, followed by hippocampectomy. It is of paramount importance to remain lateral to the choroid fissure throughout the procedure so as to prevent damage to the basal ganglion and the thalamus.

**Transventricular Corpus Callosotomy**

Corpus callosotomy taking pericallosal arteries and the falx as the anatomic landmarks, aided with neuronavigation, is carried out posteriorly till the atrium and the tentorial edge are visualized. The anterior dissection is limited 5 mm anterior to the foramen of Monro to prevent hypothalamic injury.

**Frontobasal and Parietooccipital Disconnections**

This completes the disconnection of the neural network involved in the seizure semiology.

**Closure**

External ventricular drain (EVD) is placed. The water seal closure of the dura aided with a dural substitute is carried out. The osteoplastic bone flap is replaced and fixed with mini plates. The wound is closed in layers.

The surgical steps, while undertaking other epilepsy surgical procedures, can be summarised as:

**Anterior Temporal Lobectomy and Amygdalohippocampectomy**

This includes resection of the lateral and mesial temporal structures either separately or en bloc ****

- Pterional craniotomy and durotomy are performed in the standard fashion.

- A point is marked in the middle temporal gyrus (5.5 cm from the temporal tip on the non-dominant hemisphere and 4.5 cm on the dominant side)

- Sylvian dissection exposing the insula and extending to the lateral uncus is performed.

- The temporal pole is resected and extended to the collateral sulcus.

- The temporal horn is entered, and the temporal stem along with the temporal neocortex is excised at the level of the inferior circular sulcus.

- Mesial temporal resection is performed with the aid of ultrasonic aspirator preserving the arachnoid plane.

- Uncus paralleling the M1 segment of MCA till the limen insulae is performed.

- The amygdalectomy is performed at the intersection of the choroidal point and the limen insulae.

- The hippocampal sulcus is exposed, its feeder controlled, and the hippocampus and the parahippocampus are removed en bloc—the posterior limit of the resection in the midbrain tectum.

**Selective Amygdalohippocampectomy**

This is aimed to preserve the temporal neocortex, can be performed via the subtemporal, transcortical, or via trans-Sylvian approaches.

**Multiple Subpial Transections
**

Indication- surgical management in cases of ictal origins within the eloquent cortex

Salient steps in the procedure include:

- A right-angled hook is inserted subcortically across the gyrus form one sulcus to the other.

- The hook is then dragged in the subpial plane back to the entry point.

- Such cuts, perpendicular to the gyrus, are repeated every 5 mm from one sulcus to the other.

- This disrupts the intercortical neural connectome preserving the subcortical fibers.

**Vagal Nerve Stimulation
**

Achieves up to 50% reduction in the seizure frequency in patients who are high-risk candidates for major surgical procedures. It includes placement of the helical electrodes on the left vagus nerve (right vagus was found to activate the efferents innervating the SA node in the heart during experimental studies) 8 cm above the clavicle, with intermittent stimulation (30 seconds of 30 Hz) from subcutaneous prosthesis placed in the chest.
