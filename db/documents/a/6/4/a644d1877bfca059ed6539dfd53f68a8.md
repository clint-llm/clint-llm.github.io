Improving the outcomes of epidural steroid injections in the treatment of acute or chronic pain requires careful patient selection. ESIs are efficacious in the treatment of radicular pain and not axial pain. Physicians have an ethical responsibility to utilize ESIs in cases of radicular pain with a history and physical exam findings concordant with MRI evidence of nerve root pathology at the level to be treated. The evidence is lacking for ESIs in the treatment of axial back pain. Most patients with back pain, including those with disc herniation with radicular pain, will improve with time or conservative treatments, including oral analgesics, various treatment modalities, and physical therapy. Thus, it is the role of the provider to place ESIs in the context of the individual's disease and form a patient-centered treatment plan.
