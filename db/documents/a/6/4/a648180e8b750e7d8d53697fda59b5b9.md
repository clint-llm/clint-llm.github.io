Differential diagnosis includes pulmonary edema (immersion or other etiology), myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, water aspiration, breathing gas contamination, pulmonary oxygen toxicity (unlikely in most dive settings), pulmonary embolus, and alkaline aspiration secondary to water intrusion in the breathing loop of a closed or semiclosed-circuit rebreather.
