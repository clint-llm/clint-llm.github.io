Nerve block, radiofrequency ablation, and decompression surgery have all been used successfully for the treatment of epicrania, but they seldom work for nummular headaches. For mild to moderate pain, NSAIDs and analgesics may be all that is needed. However, in resistant cases, preventative therapy with chemical neuromodulators such as gabapentin, pregabalin and tricyclic antidepressants TCAs have been successfully used. Peripheral nerve stimulation for intractable supraorbital pain has been used as well with favorable outcomes.

Therapy with botulinum toxin deserves a special mention. For refractory cases of nummular headache, two case series, and several case reports showed that 10 to 25 units of botulinum toxin A injected in the affected and surrounding area resulted in substantial relief of symptoms. Its onset of action is 6 to 10 days, and the effect lasts up to 14 weeks at which point the procedure is repeated.
