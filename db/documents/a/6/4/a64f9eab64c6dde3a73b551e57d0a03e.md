Patients need to understand the factors that can increase the risk of a turf toe injury, including competing on artificial turf and shoes with excessively flexible soles. The athlete must understand that their athletic footwear must be supportive and appropriate to the surface on which they compete. They should receive instruction on flexibility and strengthening exercises for the ankle and foot to increase their ability to withstand the stresses that accompany their athletic activities.
