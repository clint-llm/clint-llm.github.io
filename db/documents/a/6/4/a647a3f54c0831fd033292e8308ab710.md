Mirtazapine is an atypical antidepressant and is used primarily for the treatment of a major depressive disorder. Mirtazapine is in a group of tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCA). Mirtazapine inhibits the central presynaptic alpha-2-adrenergic receptors, which causes an increased release of serotonin and norepinephrine. The drug has sedative, antiemetic, anxiolytic, and appetite stimulant effects, which explains its off-label use for insomnia, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, headaches, and migraines. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of mirtazapine, pertinent for interprofessional team members in treating patients with depression where it is of clinical value.

**Objectives:**
- Review the mechanism of action of mirtazapine.
- Identify the FDA-approved and off-label indications for mirtazapine.
- Summarize the adverse event profile of mirtazapine.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients who might benefit from therapy with mirtazapine.
