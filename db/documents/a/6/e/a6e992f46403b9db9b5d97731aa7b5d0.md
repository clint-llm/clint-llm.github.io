- Melanocytes number and distribution is preserved in the skin in patients with OCA, making melanoma a possible, albeit rare, a complication of albinism.

- Albinism has a broad range of presentations, and sometimes, hypomelanosis can only be considered in relation to the average pigmentation of other family members. When this is the case, ocular findings may be more likely to lead caregivers and providers to seek outÂ a diagnosis.

- Vision deficits are the major source of debility in non-syndromic albinism subjects. These should be addressed early to maximize outcomes and limit the social and educational impact.

- Squamous cell carcinomas are the most common malignancy in albinism, which can increase the relative risk as much as 1000 times.

- Albinos with systemic signs such as easy bruising or frequent infections should be assessed for a syndromic form of albinism.
