Operative radial neck fracture repair is usually indicated when the fracture angulation is greater than 30 degrees following attempts at closed reduction, translation of greater than 3 mm, and reduced range of supination and pronation ofÂ under 45 degrees. For cases in which angulation is close to thirty degrees, closed reduction with immobilization in a long-arm cast is acceptable. Closed percutaneous reduction using a K-wire or the Metaizeau technique using an elastic retrograde intramedullary (IM) nail can be trialed if closed reduction maneuvers fail and an angulation deformity of greater than 30 degrees persists.
