The goal of osteochondral transplantation is to improve articular function, relieve symptoms, and delay arthroplasty by restoring the articular surface through a biologically active implant. They are especially useful in young active patients and conditions such as osteonecrosis, chondral lesions secondary to traumatic events, fracture malunion, and osteochondritis dissecans.

Main indications for osteochondral allograft transplantation are:

- Symptomatic full thickness osteochondral lesions larger than 3 cm

- Chondral lesions associated with diseased subchondral boneÂ such as in the case of avascular necrosis

- Revision restoration in patients who failed previous cartilage procedures
