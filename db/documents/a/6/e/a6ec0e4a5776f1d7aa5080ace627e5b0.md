The rectum initiates the terminal section of the large intestine at the level of the S3 vertebra, just after the sigmoid colon. Approximately 15 cm long, it is characterized by the cessation of the omental appendices and the absence of teniae coli and haustra. It is distally continuous with the anal canal as it protrudes through the pelvic diaphragm/levator ani. The rectum plays a significant role in fecal continence and the storage of feces via the ampulla. The anal canal is the final portion of the large intestine and is approximately 3 cm long.Â The anal canal also contributes to the maintenance of fecal continence and has great clinical significance due to the different embryological origins of the superior and inferior sections of the canal. Disruption in the development of the hindgut either environmentally or genetically can cause many disorders of the rectum and anal canal.
