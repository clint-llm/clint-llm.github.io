Patients with TIA or evidence of carotid artery atherosclerosis are frequently seen by the primary care provider or nurse practitioner. If the workup reveals narrowing of the carotid artery, the patient should be referred to the neurologist and vascular surgeon based on degree of stenosis and symptoms present. Carotid endarterectomy has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in properly selected patients. Stroke is also a potential complication of CEA, therefore physicians must educate the patient regarding potential complications of the procedure. The primary care physician should encourage the patient to eliminate controllable risk factors for stroke by discontinuing smoking, maintaining a healthy weight and lowering levels of cholesterol. Regular exercise is highly recommended.
