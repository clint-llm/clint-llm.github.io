One of the critical health hazards is osteoporosis, with over 200 million affected people worldwide. It has more prevalence in postmenopausal women with around 25 to 30 percent of its prevalence in the United States and equally in Europe. Besides the actual prevalence, there has been a tremendous impact due to increased life expectancy and a more aged population.

A previous history of fracture is, by itself, a very significant risk factor for future fractures. Those already sustained a low trauma fracture in the past have over 80 percent probability for a new one. Similarly, those who had a history of vertebral fracture have over two-fold increased risk of hip fracture and roughly 1.5 fold distal forearm fracture risk.

Ethnicity also has a strong influence on the prevalence of osteoporosis, with co-relation to bone mineral density (BMD).

- African American women have the highest BMD as compared to Asian women of the same age group.

- The most prevalent risk of osteoporosis has been found in Native Americans with 11.9 %, followed by Asians 10%, Hispanics 9.8%, Whites 7.2%, and blacks 4%.

- Interestingly even though BMD has been recorded highest in African Americans, they are most like to die from hip fractures because of increased hospital stay.
