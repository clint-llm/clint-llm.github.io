The histopathology of acute myocarditis is variable and depends on the organism and the extent of myocardial damage. The damage may be focal or diffuse. Necrosis with the involvement of the coronary vessels may also be seen. In long-standing cases, fibrosis may be evident. Endomyocardial biopsy is not routinely performed in nonfatal cases. Patients with myocarditis may or may not have evidence of viral genome by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Dallas criteria (1987) is the most used by pathologists worldwide to diagnose myocarditis.

The WHO endorses a combination of histopathology and immunohistology to classify myocarditis. According to WHO Marbug criteria, in acute (active) myocarditis, there are more than 14 leukocytes per sqm, along with degeneration or necrosis. Chronic myocarditis has more than 14 leukocytes per sqm. However, necrosis or degeneration is usually absent. A leukocyte count of less than 14 per sqm suggests no myocarditis.
