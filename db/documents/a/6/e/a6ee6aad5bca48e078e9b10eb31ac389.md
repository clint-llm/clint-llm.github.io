Labyrinthectomy is performed to treat intractable vertigo. It ablates the abnormal signals from a diseased vestibular system in order to facilitate central compensation. It can be performed via a transcanal or a transmastoid approach. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and complications of labyrinthectomy and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in monitoring and managing the clinical sequelae of this surgery.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for performing a labyrinthectomy.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to labyrinthectomy.
- Review appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and their clinical significance following labyrinthectomy.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance labyrinthectomy and improve outcomes.
