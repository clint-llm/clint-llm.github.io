There are a number of field walking tests designed to measure the exercise capacity of patients with chronic respiratory disease. Among these, the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is a key study providing a functional, therapeutic response, and prognostic data that is valuable in the care of patients with respiratory as well as cardiac diseases. It is used widely due to its simplicity and reproducibility, delivering a consolidated image of the cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal response to exercise. It requires no special training on the part of the staff performing it, items and equipment available at any clinician's office or hospital may be used, and is safe and well-tolerated by most patients at any stage of disease, with the test being highly reflective of usual daily activity and exercise performance.

It is particularly useful in assessing and monitoring chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has a role in managing patients with other conditions, including those with diffuse parenchymal lung diseases and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Overall, it is an inexpensive test that can provide a wealth of data with potential impact on the treatment of several conditions. The test is self-paced, with standardized instructions and encouragement being given as patients walk as far as possible over 6 minutes through a flat corridor. The final distance is recorded in meters.
