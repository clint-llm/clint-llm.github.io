Patient education is crucial in preventing recurrent cases of dysuria. If women have dysuria due to recurrent urinary tract infections or vaginitis, they should be educated notÂ to use douches, maintaining perineal hygiene, and using correct wiping techniques. Patients who are experiencing recurrent sexually transmitted infections should be educated about safe sex practices, the use of condoms, and urinating right after sex. Patients who get recurrent urinary tract infections due to uncontrolled diabetes should be educated about the importance of controlling their blood sugars. Patients with dysuria from atrophic vaginitis can benefit from education and the use of hormone replacement therapy. Male patients suspected of having dysuria from benign prostatic hypertrophy should be educated about routine prostate exams and taking medications to control the related urinary symptoms. All patients should understand the importance of early detection and treatment of infections, which can present with dysuria as the earliest sign, and should be encouraged to seek proper follow-up and treatment.
