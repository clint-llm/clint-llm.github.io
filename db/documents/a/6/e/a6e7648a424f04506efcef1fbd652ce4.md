Microscopic examination of the white area of geographic tongue shows subepithelial infiltrates with a predominance of neutrophils forming microabscess, epithelial acanthosis associated with an elongation of the rete ridges, acantholysis, parakeratosis, glycogen deposits in the epithelial cells, and exfoliation of necrotic cells in the surface layer.Â The histopathology of the erythematous area of the lesion may show mononuclear subepithelial infiltrate (predominantly CD4+ T-lymphocytes), suprapapillary hypertrophy, and vascular ectasia.
