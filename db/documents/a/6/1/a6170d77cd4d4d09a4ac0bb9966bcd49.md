Telangiectatic osteosarcoma is a rare and aggressive variant of osteosarcoma with distinctive radiological and pathological features. It poses diagnostic difficulties, mainly with an aneurysmal bone cyst. Distinguishing between these two entities is vital since their management and prognosis differ significantly. Telangiectatic osteosarcoma is ideally managed by an interprofessional team that consists of orthopedists, oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, pharmacists, and specialty care nurses. Pharmacists review chemotherapeutic regimens, check for drug-drug interactions, and provide patient and family education. Specialty care oncology nurses administer chemotherapy, educate patients and their families, monitor for side effects, and give the team feedback on the patient's condition. All team members must maintain accurate and updated patient documentation so all caregivers can access accurate, up-to-date patient data. Interprofessional patient care will result in improved diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes for patients with telangiectatic osteosarcoma. [Level 5]
