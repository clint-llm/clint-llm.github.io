Scombroid poisoning results from eating fish that have been improperly stored. The primary toxic agent implicated in scombroid toxicity is histidine, which is normally found in the dark meat of fish, and breaks down to histamine. In temperatures warmer than 4 degrees Celsius, the fish undergo bacterial overgrowth and subsequently convert histidine to histamine, resulting in very high levels of histamine. This activity reviews the presentation of scombroid toxicity, the types of fish and bacteria most commonly involved, and the management of this condition. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team management of scombroid toxicity.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the types of fish typically implicated in scombroid toxicity.
- Explain the etiology of scombroid toxicity. 
- Describe the appropriate management of a patient with scombroid toxicity.
- Employ strategies to improve care coordination between the interprofessional teams caring for patients with scombroid toxicity to improve disease recognition and management and to educate patients on the fact that this condition is not an allergic reaction.
