Legionella pneumonia is a serious respiratory tract infection which usually affects the elderly. If the diagnosis is missed or treatment is delayed the morbidity and mortality are very high. Learned evidence-based experience from previous outbreaks reveals that an interprofessional group of healthcare workers is vital to help decrease the morbidity of the infection. Even if a single case is diagnosed, urgent set up of an interprofessional team is necessary to determine the source of the outbreak. The organism is known to rapidly disseminate via air droplets and can quickly infect many people.

The team should include a pulmonologist, infectious disease specialist, critical care specialist and an internist. The nurses play a vital role in the monitoring of the patient in the ICU.

**Outcomes**

The outcomes for patients with Legionella pneumonia do vary, but despite treatment, mortality rates of 5-15% are reported.
