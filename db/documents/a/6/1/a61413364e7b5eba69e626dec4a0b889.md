Abdominal compartment syndrome can beÂ divided and classified into two groups, primary and secondary ACS. Primary ACS causes include abdominal blunt or penetrating trauma, hemorrhage, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture, intestinal obstruction, and retroperitoneal hematoma. Secondary causes include pregnancy, ascites, ileus, burns, intra-abdominal sepsis, and large-volume fluid replacement (greater than 3 liters). Chronic causes of elevated intra-abdominal pressure include pregnancy, cirrhosis, obesity, intraabdominal malignancy, and peritoneal dialysis. These are all causes of intraabdominal hypertension, defined as repeated intra-abdominal pressures greater than 12 mm Hg. The presence of organ dysfunction in this setting due to compressive symptoms now confirms a diagnosis of abdominal compartment syndrome.

Studies have shown that mortality after ACS caused by AAA rupture neared 47%. The disease can become devastating once other organ systems become involved due to compression, and primary ACS tends to have an increasingly worse outcome.
