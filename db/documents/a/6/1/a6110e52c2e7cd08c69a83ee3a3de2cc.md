In the adult patient, history should include inquiry about developmental milestones in the pediatric patient and any potential neurologic, psychiatric, or cognitive manifestations. Physical examination during the perinatal period should include a search for additional neurologic and systemic malformations, including headache, nausea/vomiting, paresthesias, weakness, ataxia, etc.

The focus of the neurologic examination will vary based on the patient'sÂ age, including tests of attention, motor, sensory, coordination, reflexes, and brainstem reflexes, and in older patients should include a mental status examination.
