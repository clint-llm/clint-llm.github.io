**Osteosarcoma**

Osteosarcoma is an aggressive, metastatic malignancy. The types seen in the jaws are less aggressive and have a better prognosis than those in the axial skeleton. The risk of lung metastasis is 20 to 25%.

**Fibrous Dysplasia**

Malignant transformation, although very rare, can occur (1%).

**Central Giant Cell Granuloma**

Central giant cell granuloma can have aggressive, locally destructive behavior or may be indolent and respond to non-surgical therapies. The recurrence rate is higher in these aggressive forms, particularly if incompletely removed. Recurrence normally occurs within the first 12 to 18 months.

**Osteoma**

Osteomas have a good overall prognosis, recurrence following surgical excision is exceedingly rare, and there are no reported cases of malignant transformation.

**Osteochondroma**

Excision is usually curative. The recurrence rate is low and elsewhere in the body, reported at 1 to 2%. There are only two reports within the literature on the malignant transformation of craniofacial osteochondromas.

**Osteoblastoma**

Osteoblastoma has a high recurrence rate, reported at up to 20%.
