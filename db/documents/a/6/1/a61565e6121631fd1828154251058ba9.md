Direct visualization of Blastomyces dermatitides is essential for a definitive diagnosis. Sputum specimens stained with 10% potassium hydroxide or a fungal stain have an approximate 80% yield. Biopsy and histopathological examination of skin lesions reveal pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia with neutrophilic abscesses. Organisms can be difficult to identify and are often found within histiocytes or abscesses in the dermis. The yeasts are 8 to 15 micrometers in diameter with thick, double-contoured walls and display broad-based budding. Culture is the most sensitive method for detecting and diagnosing blastomycosis.

Chest radiologic imaging can be used to screen for pulmonary involvement, though findings are variable and lack specificity. Of all the systemic fungal infections, blastomycosis is most likely to resemble cancer on lung radiography. Lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid analysis may be ensued to determine central nervous system involvement, though the diagnosis is also difficult and rarely definitive. Lastly, a chemiluminescent DNA probe is commercially available and can produce results within hours.Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, though this is usually not a problem in the US as this organism is found almost exclusively in South and Central America.
