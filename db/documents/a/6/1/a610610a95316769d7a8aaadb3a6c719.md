The testicle migrates from the abdominal cavity through the inguinal canal into the scrotum via the gubernaculum. Migration can become arrested at any point along its descent.

When viewing the internal ring of the inguinal canal during a laparoscopic approach, the vas deferens comes medially to join with the vasculature that comes in laterally. These then join to travel through the inguinal canal into the scrotum.
