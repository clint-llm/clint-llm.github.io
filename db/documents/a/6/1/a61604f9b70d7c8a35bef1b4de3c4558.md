While the risk of acquiring progressive multi-leukoencephalopathy with treatment can be daunting, one can take measures to best decrease the probability, given the current evidence at hand. As mentioned before:

- Three risk factors have been associated with a decreased incidence of PML, which include (1) that the patient was on Natalizumab for the shortest period, (2) the patient did not have a large list of immunosuppressant drug use in their history, and (3) those patients who were negative for virus antibodies. The incidence of PML in a low-risk group (as defined by those mentioned above) was 0.09 cases per 1000 patients, compared to the high-risk group’s 11.1 cases per 1000 patients.

- Checking for anti-JC antibodies can help but is not definitive for the risk stratification of acquiring PML. Those tested negative for the antibody have a decreased risk, but it does not provide 100% immunity against acquiring PML. Therefore, periodic testing should be done for anti-JC antibodies while a patient is on natalizumab.

- Immune modulating drugs, including corticosteroids, should be discontinued if possible before using natalizumab.

- Patients deemed immunocompromised, such as HIV, AIDS, leukemia, lymphoma, or organ transplant recipients, are at increased risk of acquiring PML.

The long-term effects of natalizumab have yet to be determined. It is the responsibility of the clinicians to have a thorough discussion regarding the risks and benefits of treatment with their patients. Nursing needs to monitor patients after administration and comply with TOUCH program guidelines. Also, infusion centers and pharmacies must be certified to infuse or dispense natalizumab. The pharmacist needs to perform the medication reconciliation and notify the prescriber of any concerns. Open communication and collaboration among interprofessional team members can improve safety outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients treated with natalizumab. [Level 5]
