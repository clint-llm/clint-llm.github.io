Cystitis cystica epidemiology is still not well documented because of the challenging diagnosis; however, it can affect males and females at any age, with a slightly higher prevalence in males. It is a common incidental finding in biopsies or cystoscopies done for any other reason, and it can be found in 60% of autopsies. Hence, it may be considered a normal variant of the urothelial mucosa.

Cystitis cystica is frequently seen in the bladder, neck, and trigone. Less commonly, it can be seen in the ureters and renal pelvis.

Cystitis glandularis may be diffuse or focal and generally affects about 2% of the population, usually appearing during the fifth and sixth decades of life.Nephrogenic adenomas are more common in males than females, with a 2-to-1 ratio. Its incidence is probably more common than is generally reported. While more common in adults, about 10% of cases have been reported in children.
