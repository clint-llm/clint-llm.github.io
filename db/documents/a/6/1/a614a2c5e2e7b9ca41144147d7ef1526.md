Lung isolation involves utilizing bronchial barrier devices to separate the lungs enabling each lung to function as a separate unit. Lung isolation is used to facilitate surgical exposure during specific intrathoracic procedures or assist in the management of certain pulmonary conditions. This activity describes technical and physiologic principles relevant to lung isolation and the role of an interprofessional team, including anesthesiologists, thoracic surgeons, and operating room (OR) nurses involved in managing these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the relative and absolute indications for lung isolation.
- Describe the techniques used for achieving lung isolation.
- Summarize the potential complications of lung isolation.
- Explain the importance of effective collaboration and communication between interprofessional team members caring for a patient requiring lung isolation.
