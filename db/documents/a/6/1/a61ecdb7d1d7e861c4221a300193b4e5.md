Thrombus formation startsÂ in response to injury, activating the hemostatic process. Platelets are activated by exposure to collagen or tissue factor. This causes a further cascade of platelet activation with the release of cytokines, ultimately causing thrombus formation. A number of cardiac conditions pose an increased risk of thrombus formation. These include atrial fibrillation, heart valve replacement, deep venous thrombosis, acute myocardial infarction, and genetic coagulation disorder. The whole process is regulated by thermoregulation. Large thrombus in a vessel can occlude a vessel and can induce ischemia, also termed as mural thrombi, resulting in the death of tissue. Sometimes thrombi are free-floating and can dislodge to the distal vessel. Embolization to the brain can lead to stroke. Embolization to the limb can lead to amputation.
