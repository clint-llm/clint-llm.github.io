There are no absolute contraindications to the use of TTF. Though the manufacturer doesnâ€™t recommend the use of TTF among patients with implanted medical devices like pacemakers, deep brain stimulation electrodes, etc., a study found no adverse effect of TTF in such patients. A pre-existing skin disorder may be considered a relative contraindication as TTF itself may cause allergic or contact dermatitis, resulting in its exacerbation.
