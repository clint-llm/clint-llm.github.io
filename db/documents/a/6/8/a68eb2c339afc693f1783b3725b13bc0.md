Acute urinary retention is most common in men in their 60s to 80s.  Research determined that over five years, 10% of men over age 70 and close to one-third in their 80s will develop acute urinary retention. The risk for this in men is prostatic enlargement, with risk factors of increasing age, African American race, obesity, diabetes mellitus, high alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity.  Neurogenic causes of urinary retention tend to occur in younger males and women.  The mortality rate for men with spontaneous urinary retention at 1-year increases from 4.1% in patients ages 45 to 54 years to 33% in those 85 years and older.
