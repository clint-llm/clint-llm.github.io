As the exact cause of GCT, like most of the other tumors, is still unclear, measures to deter them from occurring are unknown. It is crucial to educate the patients about the presentations of a local invasion or metastasis so that they can seek medical advice early in the process, which results in early detection and a better outcome. Education of the patient in regards to the surgical treatment is of utmost importance so they can make informed decisions that may impact the outcomes.
