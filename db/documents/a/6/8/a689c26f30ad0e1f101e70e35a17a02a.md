A difficult airway is a clinical situation in which a healthcare provider who is skilled at airway management encounters difficulty with one or more standard methods of airway management. The definition is not standardized in the literature and there are some variations between national expert guidelines. The American Society of Anesthesiologists defines a difficult airway as existing when "a conventionally trained anesthesiologist experiences difficulty with facemask ventilation of the upper airway, difficulty with tracheal intubation, or both."

The difficulty of airway management is highly variable and will depend on several factors including patient characteristics, medical and surgical history, airway examination, the clinical context for which airway management is required (including the nature of any planned surgical procedure), and the patient's current status and vital signs.

Algorithms for managing the difficult airway have been outlined by national and international bodies such as the American Society of Anesthesiology and the Difficult Airway Society. These provide a basic pathway for difficult intubation. It is vital that all clinicians who attempt intubation be familiar with the equipment and techniques necessary for successful intubation. In the Closed Claims Analysis performed by the American Society of Anesthesiology, failed intubation remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality.
