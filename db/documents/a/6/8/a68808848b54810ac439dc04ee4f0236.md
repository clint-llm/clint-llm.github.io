Cranial nerves IX, X, and XI, originate from the brainstem and exit the cranium via the jugular foramen. These nerves originate from the medulla, the inferior most portion of the brainstem.

Cranial nerve IX courses laterally and anteriorly away from the superior medulla and exits the jugular foramen. Immediately after it exits, it creates a superior jugular ganglion, and further branches to innervate its target tissues. Cranial nerve IX also briefly enters the carotid sheath at its superior portion, right as it exits the jugular foramen.

Cranial nerve X courses laterally and anteriorly away from the middle segment of the medulla and exits the jugular foramen. It then extends inferiorly and branches at many levels as it has many connections throughout the body. Importantly, the major descending branch will enter the carotid sheath and run alongside the carotid artery and internal jugular vein.

Cranial nerve XI courses laterally and anteriorly away from the inferior most segment of the medulla and exits the jugular foramen. Immediately as it exits the jugular foramen alongside the vagus nerve, it enters the carotid sheath briefly in its superior portion.
