Nursing or medical assistant postprocedure monitoring should include basic patient observation, including vital signs and notification of the physician of any deterioration and patient status. Because the patient may have received light sedation with a benzodiazepine or opioid for the procedure, reversal protocols should be implemented, and resuscitation equipment should be readily available in case of an emergency.
