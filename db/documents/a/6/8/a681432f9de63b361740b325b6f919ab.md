Argyll Robertson pupil is found in late-stage syphilis, a disease caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. Neurosyphilis occurs due to an invasion of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by the spirochete which likely occurs soon after the initial acquisition of the disease. The exact pathophysiology leading to the AR pupil, however, remains unknown.
