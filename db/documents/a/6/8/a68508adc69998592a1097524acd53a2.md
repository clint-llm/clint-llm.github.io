The fetal heart initiates at 22 days; this indicates the initiation of fetal circulation. Gas exchange initially occurs in the yolk sac until the placenta entirely takes over. This transition occurs around ten weeks of gestation. Maternal oxygenated blood mixes with placental blood, which is low in oxygen, before heading out to the fetus. Due to this mixing, the fetus is relatively hypoxic compared to maternal arterial blood.

As the baby is born, the cardiovascular system undergoes a quick, drastic change. With its first breath, the baby's pulmonary vascular resistance substantially drops, which is in response to the oxygen now present in the lungs and the physical act of breathing. With the umbilical cord clamping after birth, the systemic vascular resistance increases, helping the blood flow toward the lungs. The ductus arteriosus has a left-to-right flow within 10 minutes. The smooth muscle in the ductus arteriosus responds to the oxygen by increasing calcium channel activity, causing constriction and, ultimately, shunt closure. The increased systemic resistance also raises the pressure in the left atrium to be higher than the right atrium, and this causes the foramen ovale to close.
