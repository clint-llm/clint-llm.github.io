Gastric adenocarcinoma is the fifth most common cancer in the world.

Chronic atrophic gastritis is often diagnosed late, as many individuals can be asymptomatic for years and diagnosed incidentally. It is essential to investigate those with risk factors, such as the new onset of upper gastrointestinal symptoms in those over 50 years of age, pernicious anemia, or with a family history.

According to one of the largest meta-analysis of numerous studies carried out worldwide, the incidence of gastric cancer in individuals with gastric atrophy varies widely from 0.53 percent to 15.24 per 1000 person-years depending on region and ethnicity, with the highest numbers in Asian countries. The incidence of GC in individuals with intestinal metaplasia was even more varied from 0.38 to 17.08 per 1000 person-years. The highest incidence rate, which was above 15 per 1000 person-years, was in Asia and the United States of America.

In terms of prognosis, the cumulative five-year incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma increases from 0.7% in mild to 10% in severe atrophic gastritis in H. pylori-associated gastritis in a more recent Japanese cohort study.

It is essential to identify individuals from certain ethnic minorities at risk and investigate them. In another study, Americans of Hispanic and Asian heritage had a higher prevalence of H. pylori infection and gastric precancerous lesions (GPLs). Patient ethnicity should be taken into consideration as a risk factor in the detection of GPLs.
