The cornerstone of treatment of viral pneumonia consists of the following: **Supportive Care**

- The first priority of supportive care is to maintain oxygenation as needed. This may entail nasal cannula, noninvasive airway, or mechanical ventilation.

- The second priority of supportive care is to maintain hydration either via supervised oral intake or intravenous fluids.

- The third priority of supportive care is to maintain rest and decrease oxygen demand.

- A final priority of supportive care is to meet the increased calorie needs of the patient, secondary to the increased respiratory effort.

**Management of Comorbid Illnesses****Appropriate treatment of Coexisting Bacterial Types of Pneumonia**

Most current evidence indicates the frequent existence of concomitant bacterial types of pneumonia. The prototypical example is the observation that the majority of mortality during the 1917-1918 influenza pandemic was secondary to bacterial pneumonia, superimposed on the initial influenza pneumonia.

Specific antiviral therapy for a number of viral pneumonia exists as does preventative or prophylactic therapies for those at high risk would have been exposed:

**Influenza virus**

- Treatment: Oseltamivir or peramivir or zanamivir

- Prophylaxis: Influenza vaccine and/or chemoprophylaxis with zanamivir or oseltamivir

**Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)**

- Treatment: Ribavirin

- Prophylaxis: RSV immunoglobulin and/or palivizumab

**Parainfluenza virus**

- Treatment: Ribavirin

- Prophylaxis: Not available

**Herpes simplex virus (HSV)**

- Treatment: Acyclovir

- Prophylaxis: Not available

**Adenovirus**

- Treatment: Ribavirin

- Prophylaxis: Not available

**Measles virus**

- Treatment: Ribavirin

- Prophylaxis: intravenous immunoglobulin

**Cytomegalovirus (CMV)**

- Treatment: Ganciclovir or foscarnet

- Prophylaxis: intravenous immunoglobulin

**Varicella-zoster virus (VZ)**

- Treatment: Acyclovir

- Prophylaxis: Varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG)
