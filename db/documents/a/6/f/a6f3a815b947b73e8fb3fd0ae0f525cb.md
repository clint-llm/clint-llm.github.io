It is associated with many other disease conditions or treatment complications. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary to avoid high morbidity-mortality, long-term disability related to anterior spinal artery syndrome. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of anterior spinal artery syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with anterior spinal artery syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of the anterior spinal artery syndrome. 
- Summarize the pathophysiology of the anterior spinal artery syndrome. 
- Outline and explain different treatment modalities for anterior spinal artery syndrome.
