The majority of posterior tibial tendon dysfunction patients will demonstrate medial ankle and foot pain, especially in the early stages of the disease. At later stages, lateral pain can be seen as well, due to sub-fibular impingement or peroneal tendon injury.

Single-limb heel raise is an important clinical test that can differentiate stage 1 disease from stage 2 and higher. A patient in stage 1 disease should be able to perform this test without pain. In stage 2 disease, patients may be able to perform the test but will likely have pain. In later stages, the rigid deformity may prevent the patient from completing the test. The flexibility of the foot also requires evaluation on an exam.
