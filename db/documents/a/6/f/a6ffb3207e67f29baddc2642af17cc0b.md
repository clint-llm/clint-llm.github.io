The anterior tibial artery and peroneal artery supply the peroneus longus muscle. The anterior tibial artery arises from the popliteal artery, which originates from the superficial femoral artery, a branch of the common femoral artery of the external iliac artery.

The lymphatic vessels of the lower limb can subdivide into two major groups: superficial and deep vessels. The superficial lymph vessels of the lower limb can further split into two groups: a medial group, which follows the greater saphenous vein, and a lateral group, which follows the small saphenous vein.
