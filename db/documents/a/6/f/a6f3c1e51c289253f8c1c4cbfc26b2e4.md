Any patient presenting with Coats disease should not only receive treatment by an ophthalmologist as it requires an interprofessional team evaluation by pediatricians and oncologists. Interprofessional team communication can lead to better patient management. The patient will most often present to the primary clinician, and these professionals should be aware of the condition as it is treatable. Prompt referral to an ophthalmologist is necessary. These patients can then be followed by their primary clinicians and ensure compliance with treatment. The nursing staff will be the first to the department to come in contact with patients on follow-up and can assess treatment progress as well as evaluate compliance with therapy and report any issues to the primary care clinician. This collaborative, interprofessional approach to care can ensure optimal patient outcomes.
