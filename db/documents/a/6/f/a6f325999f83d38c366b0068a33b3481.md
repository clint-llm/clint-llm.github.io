A laceration is a pattern of injury in which blunt forces result in a tear in the skin and underlying tissues. Lacerations in the scalp are different from lacerations in other parts of the face and body due to differences in the anatomy and blood supply. The scalp lies on stretched skin tissue that lies on the bone that makes it more prone to be lacerated.

Clinicians must have a clear understanding of these differences and their effect on evaluating and managing these types of injuries.
