Interferons are glycoproteins that have antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory functions. They are used widely for the treatment of many conditions like Hepatitis C, cancers, and immune-mediated disorders like multiple sclerosis. Interferon was discovered by Issacs and Lindenmann in 1957 while studying the phenomenon of virus interference. The FDA approved the use of interferon-alpha-2a and alpha-2b for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia in 1986. As time progressed, the use of interferons (IFN) has expanded to include a broad spectrum of conditions. However, their use correlates with numerous adverse effects like fatigue, influenza-like syndrome, toxicities related to the central nervous system, the gastrointestinalÂ tract, endocrine system, and cardiovascular, renal, and musculoskeletal systems.
