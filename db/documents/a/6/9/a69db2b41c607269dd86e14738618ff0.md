The phenotypic findings of piebaldism will be apparent at birth. Despite incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, detailed family history is useful to establish an inherited genetic cause. During the postnatal period, careful physical examination, including ophthalmic examination and neurologic examination, can help distinguish piebaldism from syndromic causes of leukoderma, such as Waardenburg syndrome and peripheral demyelinating neuropathy, central dysmyelinating leukodystrophy, Waardenburg syndrome, Hirschsprung disease (PCWH). Although Waardenburg syndrome may have a similar phenotypic appearance to piebaldism, there will also be extracutaneous features, such as congenital deafness and heterochromia. Concomitant Hirschsprung disease is concerning for PCWH. Wood's lamp examination is useful to distinguish between piebaldism and nevus anemicus and nevus depigmentosus.
