The conundrum with the talocalcaneal coalition is that the patients do not manifest with symptoms until they reach 12 to 15 years of age. Flexible flat foot is common in children, and in most children, the reconstitution of the medial longitudinal arch occurs with age. The majority of patients (75%) are asymptomatic, and no treatment is necessary. The minority few who have rigid symptomatic flat feet require assessment and investigated early to diagnose talocalcaneal coalition as an earlier diagnosis can have better outcomes. The spectrum of symptoms depends on the degree of ossification, i.e., the metaplasia of the fibrous coalition into osseous synostosis. More commonly, the patients are often diagnosed late, negating a successful early intervention.
