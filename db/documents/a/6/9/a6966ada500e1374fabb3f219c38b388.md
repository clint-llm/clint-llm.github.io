The development of the mandible originates from the branchial apparatus. The branchial apparatus divides into three main components. The components are the branchial clefts, arches, and pouches. The branchial clefts are made up of ectoderm. The only significant branchial cleft is the first one. This first branchial cleft will develop into the external acoustic meatus. The composition of the branchial arches is of neural crest cells and mesoderm. The branchial arches are responsible for developing into the muscles, bones, and nerves of the face and neck. While the branchial pouches will develop into the organs in the face and neck such as the tonsils, parathyroid, and thymus. Simultaneously, the arterial system in the head, face, and neck will develop from the aortic arches; the aortic arches will differentiate around the same time as the structures from the branchial apparatus.

The first branchial arch will form the mandible. The grooves and impressions in the mandible will develop as the other tissues differentiate. As the inferior alveolar nerve and artery develop and travel toward the oral cavity, the mandibular foramen will develop. The mandibular foramen will form to protect the inferior alveolar nerve and vessels.
