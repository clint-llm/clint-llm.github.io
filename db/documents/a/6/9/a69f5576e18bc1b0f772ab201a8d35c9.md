Generally, isosorbide does not need any monitoring. However, monitoring is recommended in:

- Patients who have low blood pressure and low heart rate

- Patients who are on chronic diuretic therapy

- Elderly patients with underlying autonomic dysfunction

- Patients with right ventricular infarction who are preload sensitive

- Volume-depleted patients, e.g.,Â from chronic diarrhea and vomiting

- Patients who are taking other types of vasodilators

Close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate in the above patients is recommended to avoid severe hypotension and bradycardia. Though methemoglobinemia is a rare complication, patients more susceptible to developing methemoglobinemia require close monitoring for signs and symptoms. The diagnosis of methemoglobinemia requires arterial or venous blood gas with co-oximetry.

The development of tolerance is a significant concern during long-term isosorbide therapy.

- 12-hour drug-free interval with 40 mg dose

- 18-hour drug-free interval with 80 mg dose

- 24-hour drug-free interval with 120 mg dose

The patients should understand the possibility of developing anginal episodes during the drug-free interval. Chronic isosorbide use without drug-free intervals may cause poor symptom control and endothelial dysfunction due to the release of excessive free radicals.
