- Light skin pigmentation, poor tanning ability

- FAMM syndrome and atypical mole syndrome

- Male gender and age > 60 years

- Deep invasive or ulcerated primary lesions

- Acral, lentiginous, or nodular histology

- Involvement of >3 lymph nodes

- Visceral metastasis at diagnosis

- BRAF mutation and NRAS mutation

- Activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway (PI3K/AKT)

- Elevated LDH
