Bladder stones are relatively uncommon in Western countries but remain an issue for much of the world. Failure to routinely empty the bladder is a major causative factor. Catheters that are not changed for prolonged periods will predispose to bladder calculi. When Foley catheters are removed traumatically, it is important to have the catheter inspected to make sure there are no missing balloon fragments or pieces. All caregivers of the interprofessional team need to be cognizant of the potential risk in such patients of retained balloon fragments inside the bladder, which will otherwise tend to calcify. In such cases, cystoscopy by a urologist assisted by a nurse is necessary to remove any such fragments. More frequent catheter changes and the judicious use of citric acid, glucono-delta-lactone and magnesium carbonate, and 1/4% acetic acid solutions can help reduce the formation of bladder stones, calcium phosphate debris, and catheter encrustations. Pharmacists should assess drug treatments, interactions, and compliance and report concerns to the interprofessional team. Specialty care urologic nurses coordinate care, facilitate communication with the interprofessional team, and work with the team to provide coordinated patient education.

Close communication and coordination of care between urology, primary care, pharmacy, and nursing staff can help reduce the incidence of preventable bladder stones.
