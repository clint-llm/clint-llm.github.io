Pneumocystis jirovecii has a preference for infecting the lung in at-risk individuals. Microscopic examination reveals that Pneumocystis attaches to Type I alveolar epithelium, which allows the fungus to transition from its small trophic form to the larger cystic form. Adherence of Pneumocystis to alveoli is not the singular cause of diffuse alveolar damage, but rather it is the host's inflammatory response that causes significant lung injury and impaired gas exchange, leading to hypoxia and possibly respiratory failure. Pneumocystis is primarily an alveolar pathogen, but in the setting of severely immunocompromised individuals, the rare disseminated form may be seen. Examples of extra-pulmonary manifestations may be seen in patients undergoing non-systemic or second-line prophylaxis, including hepatosplenomegaly and thyroid, ocular, ear, or skin lesions.
