Many theories have been postulated in the pathogenesis of this entity.**ontact pressure theory**'' inferred from cadaveric studies in 1960 postulated degenerative spurs during flexion to compress the cord.**'tight dural canal theory in flexion''**was proposed in 1987.

It has also been further suggested that this laxity may be caused by a ''**growth imbalance between the vertebral column and dural canal**''.

Hirayama postulated that increased intramedullary pressure during neck flexion causes ''**stagnation of the posterior epidural venous plexus**'' causing cord compression.**loss of dorsal dural attachment from the pedicle due to immunological abnormalities of the dura and posterior ligaments**'' has also been implicated in the pathogenesis.
