Cutaneous innervation of the shoulder and upper limb comes from multiple peripheral nerves originating from cervical and thoracic nerve roots, with most of the nerves originating from the brachial plexus. Location of pain or deficits in sensation can be clinically useful in determining the location of a nerve lesion, especially when combined with an associated motor deficit. This activity will specifically discuss the surrounding anatomy of the nerves providing shoulder and upper limb cutaneous innervation and will be assessing the sensory distribution as it relates to nerve injuries.
