The presence of granuloma characterizes the delayed hypersensitivity reactions. APC stimulated by T cells are unable to digest the antigens, and they become in giant multinucleated cells. In this process, many cytokines are produced, and the most important are TNF-alpha and beta, IL-2, and GM-CSF. Diseases caused by hypersensitivity reactions tend to be chronic. Some of them are leprosy, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, sarcoidosis, and Crohn disease. A chemical irritant can apply to the epidermis and may result in over-expression of ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1, which mediate inflammatory reactions consistent with a delayed hypersensitivity reaction.
