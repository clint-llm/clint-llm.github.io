Researchers have attributed first-degree AV bloc to increased vagal tone in younger patients, as many of the early population studies of the condition utilized young, healthy volunteers. Fibrotic changes in the cardiac conduction system appear to be one of the common etiologies in elderly patients. Additionally, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, electrolyte abnormalities (particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia), inflammation, infections (endocarditis, rheumatic fever, Chagas disease, Lyme disease, diphtheria) drugs (antiarrhythmics Ia, Ic, II, III, IV and digoxin), infiltrative diseases (sarcoidosis), collagen vascular diseases (SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma), idiopathic degenerative diseases (Lenegre and Lev diseases) and neuromuscular disorders are identifiable causes of first-degree AV block.
