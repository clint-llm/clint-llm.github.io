The retina is a complex, neurosensory structure, and patients with retinal disease often present with non-specific visual symptoms. Therefore, determining the etiology of retinal disease by layer and by region is a frequent diagnostic challenge, and an interprofessional team approach is critical for providing appropriate patient care. Patients with sudden onset vision loss are typically encountered in the emergency department. Nurses are likely the first point of contact, who then triage the patient according to symptom acuity and severity. Given the ambiguity in clinical diagnosis and concern for emergent neurologic conditions, physicians and nursing staff routinely order a costly workup involving a battery of tests, the majority of which return negative. In turn, patients are instructed to follow up with an outpatient ophthalmologist. In most cases, these are comprehensive ophthalmologists, who then perform a standard eye examination, including ocular imaging. Notably, however, these diagnostic tests detect structural changes associated with ocular pathology, which do not always correlate with clinical findings. Consequently, patients may be misdiagnosed as having a benign condition and, in some cases, presumed to be malingering. Neuro-ophthalmology is the field that is commonly acknowledged when the etiology of vision impairment remains unknown, despite extensive medical workup.
