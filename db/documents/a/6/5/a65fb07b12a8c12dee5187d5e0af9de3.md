For most patients with a minute amount of air in the venous system, there are no complications. However, anytime air enters the CNS, the prognosis is grave. Three factors that determine outcomes include the patient's mental status, neurological deficits, and age. There is always the potential of life-threatening complications with venous air embolism, especially if the air remains lodged into a vessel. Mortality rates of 30-80% have been reported following venous air embolism after chest trauma. Surgeons who perform procedures with the patient in the fowler position or insufflate the body with carbon dioxide should remain extra vigilant as many cases of air embolism continue to be reported.
