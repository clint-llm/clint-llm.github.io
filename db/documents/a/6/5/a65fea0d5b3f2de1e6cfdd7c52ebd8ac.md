Patients who present with asteatotic eczema should be comforted that it is likely a benign condition, although underlying malignancies have correlations with the disease. The importance of emollients is a point of emphasis for the patients. Patients also need to be educated on the risk of scratching. Scratching causes a break in the skin, which can lead to infection. Patients also need to understand that asteatotic eczema is likely to recur in the winter months.
