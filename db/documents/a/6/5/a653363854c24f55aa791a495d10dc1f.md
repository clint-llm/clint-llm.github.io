Plicae are normal structures in the knee joint that come together in utero. Plicae typically involute when the fetus is around 12 weeks old, but autopsy results indicate plicae are present in 50% of individuals.

For the approximately 50% of people who have a plica, there are four different normal plicae. These are suprapatellar, infrapatellar, medial, and lateral. It is not uncommon for a patient to have more than one plica.

The suprapatellar plica is found between the knee joint and the suprapatellar bursa. The infrapatellar plica is found between the intercondylar notch and the synovium around the infrapatellar fat pad. The medial plica is found between the infrapatellar fat pad and the medial aspect of the knee joint. Medial plicae are the most common type of plicae and are the most common to be symptomatic.

It is important to note that not all plicae cause pain. Normal plicae can become painful as a result of undergoing inflammation. This inflammation can then lead to a tight, fibrotic plica that can manifest in symptoms during flexion of the knee when it leads to impingement between the patella and femur.
