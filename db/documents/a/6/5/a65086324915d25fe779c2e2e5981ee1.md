A thorough history and complete physical and neurological exam are essential in ascertaining the etiology of upper motor neuron signs. The differential for UMN signs includes strokes, malignancies, traumatic brain injury, infections, inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic disorders. The following are select diseases that present with UMN signs.

Strokes are defined as the sudden cessation of blood flow to various areas of the brain resulting in neuronal cell death. Due to the vast areas spanned by the pyramidal tract, upper motor neurons are vulnerable to many stroke syndromes. Strokes subdivide into two categories: ischemic or hemorrhagic. The sudden interruption of blood flow secondary to thrombi, emboli, or compression defines ischemic strokes. Sudden bleeding into the brain secondary to the rupture of a blood vessel defines hemorrhagic strokes. The target area of an upper motor neuron lesion is dependent on the branch of the cerebral blood supply that is damaged. Motor areas of the cerebral cortex are damaged with occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or the anterior cerebral artery. Strokes involving these arteries are also likely to present with sensory, perceptual, visual, and language deficits. Damage to the posterior limb internal capsule secondary to occlusion at the lenticulostriate arteries presents with pure UMN deficits of the contralateral face, arm, and leg.

The pyramidal tract can undergo impingement by mass effect secondary to malignancies or abscesses. The majority of brain malignancies are due to metastasis from another primary tumor. Common malignancies that metastasize to the brain include lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, colon cancer, and renal cancer. Treatment for metastatic brain tumors involves a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Infections can localize to specific areas in the brain and create empyemas, abscesses, or cysts. Some organisms that create focal cysts within the brain include Aspergillus, toxoplasma gondi, and taenia solium.

Neurodegenerative diseases are a collection of disorders that primarily affect neurons. The most common neurodegenerative disease is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is unique in its involvement of upper and lower motor neurons. The clinical symptoms are a mix of upper and lower motor neuron signs. A diagnosis is made with nerve conduction studies and electromyography. Labs are ordered to rule out differential diagnoses that also manifest with muscle weakness. ALS is currently incurable.

Autoimmune diseases can damage neurons disrupting their ability to conduct signals from the brain. One example is multiple sclerosis (MS) which is an immune-mediated, inflammatory, demyelinating disease. It is characterized by symptoms that are separated by time and space. Presentation of multiple sclerosis is highly variable and can include UMN signs, cognitive disturbance, visual changes, ataxia, and sensory changes. The imaging test of choice to diagnose MS is MRI. Intrathecal immunoglobulin G and oligoclonal bands are common findings in a cerebrospinal fluid analysis of an MS patient that can support the diagnosis.

Spinal cord lesions that damage the corticospinal tract can present with UMN signs. Brown-Sequard syndrome is a lesion due to hemisection of the spinal cord. The most common etiology is penetrating trauma to the spine. Other causes include blunt trauma, hematoma, tumors, and disc herniation. UMN signs manifest ipsilateral and below the level of the lesion. Patients will also present with signs of damage to the dorsal column and lateral spinothalamic tract; this presents as ipsilateral loss of fine touch, vibration, proprioception, and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation.

**Treatment**

Treatment of UMN signs starts with the diagnosis of the underlying cause of the symptoms. Appropriate medical or surgical management is then pursued based on the underlying disease process. However, in cases where there is no immediate cure, management of the long term sequelae of upper motor neuron lesions is essential. Spasticity management is a major issue that requires attention due to the profound disability incurred by patients. It can lead to a restriction in the activity, pain, weakness, and contractures. Optimal management requires an understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of spasticity. The aims of spasticity management include improvement of function, symptom relief, and improvement of posture.

The management of spasticity involves physical and medical modalities. Physical rehabilitation is a mainstay in treatment and involves proper positioning of patients, stretching of muscles, cooling of muscles, heat, and orthosis. Pharmacologic management should be an adjunct to these physical modalities. Correct positioning is an important area of management, especially for immobilized patients. The main goal is to produce a stretch of spastic muscles to reduce spasticity and facilitate the function of antagonistic muscles. Proper stretching maintains muscle length throughout passive and active exercises. Stretching plans can include standing and splinting for short and long term management. Application of heat can increase the elasticity and thus relax spastic muscles; this should be utilized in conjunction with stretching and exercise. Finally, orthosis can be used to distribute or remove forces from the body to allow better control of movement or alter body shape. Orthoses can include ankle supports, insoles, wrist splints, knee splints, spinal braces, or neck collars. Splints and casts can be used to prevent the formation of contractures in the long term.

Medical management aims to improve function and relieve symptoms and is always in conjunction with physical modalities. Medications can be administered enterally, intrathecally, and intramuscularly. Nerve blocks are also an option in certain cases. Common oral medications include baclofen, dantrolene, benzodiazepines, and gabapentin. Oral medications are typically for milder cases of spasticity. The dosages required to provide relief in severe cases often present with unwanted side effects such as drowsiness and weakness. Nerve blocks are another avenue of treatment that can be of use in severe cases of spasticity. A nerve block is the application of a chemical agent that impairs the conduction along a nerve. Common agents utilized are phenol, alcohol, and local anesthetics. The major indication for a nerve block is debilitating and painful spasticity. Nerve blocks can be performed with fluoroscopy or nerve stimulation. To test the effects of a nerve block on a muscle, peripheral blocks with local anesthetics can be used to observe potential benefits and side effects.
