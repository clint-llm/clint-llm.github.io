Diaphragm pacing is a perfect example ofÂ the need for an interprofessional team for improving outcomes in patients. This procedure not only involves clinicians across specialties, but there is also consistent involvement of ancillary services like nursing care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. The rehabilitative process involves diaphragmatic conditioning after pacer implantation, which can take a long time. Education of all ancillary staff to identify clinical signs and symptoms of pacemaker malfunction and timely communication to the treating clinician is the key to the successful rehabilitation of these patients.
