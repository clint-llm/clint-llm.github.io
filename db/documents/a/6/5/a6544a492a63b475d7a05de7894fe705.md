The prognosis is dependent upon the timing of therapeutic intervention, as well as the degree of the underlying immunodeficiency of the patient with mortality ranging from 25% to 87% depending on the site of infection.

Severity and poor prognostic indicators include disseminated infection, renal injury, central nervous system disease, and inadequate response to medical treatment. The most important prognostic factor is the ability to restore a normal immune status. If this is not possible, the prognosis is uniformly dismal. If immunocompetence can be restored, even temporarily, then prognosis does improve.
