On ultrasound, the normal spleen has a uniform echogenicity and is hypoechoic relative to the cortex of the nearby kidney.

A simple cyst will appear similar to cysts elsewhere in the body. Characteristic features of cysts on ultrasound include round shape, anechoic echogenicity, and pencil-thin walls. Posterior acoustic enhancement and absence of internal Doppler flow are additional features.
