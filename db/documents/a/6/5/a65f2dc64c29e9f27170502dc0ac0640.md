Hypothermia occurs when your body can no longer produce enough heat to overcome cold exposure. Hypothermia is an extremely dangerous entity that has the potential to lead to death if not treated quickly. Luckily, hypothermia can be avoided. Do not stay outside too long if the weather is cold. If youâ€™re outside during this arduous climate, proper clothing is key. If your clothes are wet, quickly change out of them.

Certain patient populations are at a higher risk of developing hypothermia. Infants and young children are at greater risk due to their underdeveloped bodies and their inability to communicate reliably. On the other end of the age spectrum, the elderly are also at greater risk. They tend to have multiple comorbidities. Physical and cognitive limitations could prevent them from seeking warmer environments in certain situations.
