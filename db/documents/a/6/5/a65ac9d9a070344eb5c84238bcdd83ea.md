The following are the proposed pathogenetic mechanisms:

- The direct effect of inflammatory cell infiltrates includes CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B Cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells.

- Indirect effects of cytokines include interleukins, tumor necrosis factors, and interferons.

- Involvement of microvasculature includes increased thickening of endothelial cells, both of capillaries and venules, which are noted in myositis. This, along with increased expression of adhesion molecules, can promote inflammatory cell infiltration of the muscle tissue. Clinical observation of nail splinters and histological observation of decreased capillaries in muscle tissue supports this pathogenic mechanism.

- A humoral mechanism is suggested based on the presence of autoantibodies in serum and complement and immunoglobulin in the muscle biopsy specimen.
