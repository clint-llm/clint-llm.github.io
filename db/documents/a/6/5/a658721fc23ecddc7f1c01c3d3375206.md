In areas where a tooth or teeth are missing, normal to a slightly reduced level of bone is seen microscopically.

Hyperdontia presents histologically as a normal tooth with defined layers of enamel, dentin, and pulpal tissues. Most supernumerary teeth, specifically the mesiodens, are smaller in size than a normal tooth; however, they will still demonstrate the defined layers in a reduced size or ratio.
