Anterior knee pain is the most common chief complaint of patients with chondromalacia patellar; however, a high proportion of patients will present with insidious onset of vaguely diffuse retropatellar or prepatellar pain. This pain is usually made worse with activities that increase the stress on the patellofemoral joint, for example, stair ascending or more frequently descending, squatting, kneeling, and running, or even prolonged sitting rather, known as theatre pain. In addition to the anterior knee pain,Â  effusion, wasting of the quadriceps, and retropatellar crepitus have all been reported in patients with CMP despite none being specific.

The varied etiological factors of chondromalacia mandate a thorough history and physical evaluation to diagnose this condition and avoid mismanagement due to misdiagnosis correctly. The history should include evaluating previous trauma, comorbid conditions, unstable joints, foot and ankle pain or dysfunction, and activity. Likewise, the physical exam should evaluate the quadriceps appearance and presence of atrophy, the orientation of the foot and ankle, as well as a specific evaluation of the patellofemoral joint.

Specific evaluation of the patellofemoral joint should include assessment of pain, effusion, quadriceps strength, patella mobility, and crepitus. Particular attention to signs of patella maltracking, which includes increased femoral anteversion, increased external tibial torsion, lateral patella subluxation, loss of medial patellar mobility, and positive patellar apprehension test.

The physical examination test, which specifically evaluates the knee for chondromalacia patellae, is Clark's test. This test evaluates patellofemoral grinding and pain by compressing the patella into the femoral trochlea and having the patient contract their quadriceps muscle-pulling the patella through the groove.
