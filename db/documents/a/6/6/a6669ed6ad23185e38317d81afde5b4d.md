Prevention is the best approach to caterpillars.  The healthcare team, including doctors, nurses, and pharmacists, should work toward teaching children and outdoor workers avoidance which will alleviate most exposures.  Everyone playing or working outdoors in endemic areas should have a heightened level of alertness during peak caterpillar seasons (spring/summer).  Encourage patients to wear protective clothing.  Clothing that includes long-sleeved shirts, long pants tucked into socks, work gloves along with a wide-brimmed hat minimizes the likelihood of accidental exposure.  For known areas of heavy infestation or presence of toxic setae, a tight-fitting respirator mask and eye protection should make for a safe work zone.
