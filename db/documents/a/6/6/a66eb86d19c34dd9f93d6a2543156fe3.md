Normal skin and musculoskeletal anatomy include the following general layers from superficial to deep: skin, subcutaneous fat, superficial fascia, deep fat, deep fascia, muscle, bone. When a mechanism occurs that causes a tangential shearing of these layers, an internal degloving may take place. Essentially, the bone, muscle, and deep fascia shear one way, and the more superficial layers slide in the opposite direction. This event transects the perforating arteries and lymphatics that are traversing the fascial layers and leads to a collection of blood, lymphatic fluid, and necrotic fat in the newly created potential space.
