Patients who have signs or symptoms of a wheat allergy should see a doctor as soon as possible as it can be a life-threatening disease. Those who are already diagnosed should make sure they avoid wheat and always carry epinephrine. A medical identification bracelet that describes the allergy should be worn all the time whenever a patient leaves home and needs emergency care can help if he/she experiences anaphylaxis and can't communicate. Parents of children who have a wheat allergy must make sure that anyone who takes care of the children, including the principal, teachers, and nurse at school or child care, knows about the allergy and the signs of wheat exposure. Following up with an allergist can offer treatment options such as immunotherapy. Those with celiac disease should maintain a gluten-free diet to avoid symptoms and follow up with a gastroenterologist.
