Active immunity functions as an additional immunologic defense to eliminate infective pathogens from the body. The process is more energy-intensive compared to the innate immune response and is therefore reserved for pathogens not effectivelyÂ removed by the body's initial defense. Immunity mounted by the active, antigen-specific response provides decades of protection against that antigen.
