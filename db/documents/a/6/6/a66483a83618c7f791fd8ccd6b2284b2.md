Chronic mesenteric ischemia is a difficult diagnosis and thus best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a radiologist, gastroenterologist, nurse practitioner, general surgeon and an internist. Once the diagnosis is made, the novel treatments include endovascular stenting. However, since most of these patients have cardiac risk factors, a referral to a cardiologist is recommended. The cause of death in nearly 40% of patients is an adverse cardiac event. Thus, the primary care giver and nurse practitioner should educate the patient on discontinuing smoking, eating healthy and maintaining a healthy weight.
