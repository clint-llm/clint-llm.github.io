**Pre-briefing phases**: For the simulation-based course to be successful, the instructor has to build a safe learning environment for the learners. During this phase, the instructor invites learners to reflect and share their thoughts during the simulation event. For the learners to remain engaged with the simulation, the instructor has to run the scenario based on the learners' actions; this is referred to as maintaining fidelity, both physical, conceptual, and emotional.

**Case facilitation during the scenario**: Though instructors need to prepare how to run the scenario during the simulation, they also must remain flexible and adjust the flow of the scenario based on the learners' actions or lack thereof. Adjusting the scenario based on learners' behaviors improves the realism of the scenario. It helps learners to understand their performance and identify the gaps or strengths in knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Instructors have to adjust physiological and verbal responses based on the learners' actions. The beginning of the case may be the same, but the flow should vary based on how learners perform. In the end, the main goal of the simulation is for the learners to discover their strengths and weakness through actions, reflection, and discussion. Simulation offers the opportunity to try, fail, and learn from mistakes without compromising patient safety.

**Guiding the debriefing after the case**: Debriefing is an essential part of simulation-based education, it offers the opportunity for learners to reflect and discuss their performance in simulation and to identify how they can improve. The role of the instructor is to guide the discussion rather than directing it. The debriefing starts with the instructor asking learners to share their reactions to the simulation event. During this phase, the instructor identifies the topics that are most important to the learners and includes them in the debriefing plan.

Several tools can help instructors assess the performance of the learners in simulation. The Non-Technical Skills for Surgery (NOTSS) rating tool is used to assess the observable non-technical skills of a surgeon, both in simulation or clinical environment.

**Concluding:**The instructor can conclude the debriefing phase by inviting learners to share their take-home messages from the simulation events. During this phase, the instructor has to find a balance between learner-driven take-home messages and the instructor's take-home message in order to ensure safe patient care.
