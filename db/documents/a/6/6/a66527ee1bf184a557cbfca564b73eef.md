Intracardiac shunts are caused by a combination of modifiable and nonmodifiable factors. Prior to conception, family physicians and obstetricians should counsel the mothers about safe prenatal approaches to minimize the incidence of such diseases. These approaches include but are not limited to better control of diabetes, avoiding teratogenic substances like retinoids and ibuprofen, and steering clear of recreational drugs. As kids grow into adolescence and start understanding things, they should be educated about their conditions compassionately and realistically.
