**Histogenesis**

Telangiectatic osteosarcoma is presumed to derive from either transformed osteoblasts or stem cells of mesenchymal origin. Angiosarcomatous features are present in addition to osteoblast-like and fibroblast-like cells at the ultrastructural level. Tight intercellular junctions, Weibel-Palade bodies, and pinocytic vesicles are visible within the cell cytoplasm. These features suggest that telangiectatic osteosarcoma derives from multipotential stem cells of mesenchymal origin.

**Cytogenetics**

Only seven cases of telangiectatic osteosarcoma to date have had genetic studies. The cytogenetic analysis identified trisomy 3 in one case, and in three other tumors, more complex chromosomal changes were reported.
