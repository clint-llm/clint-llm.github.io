The overall prognosis of CMV colitis is excellent; however, some risk factors for poor prognosis and higher mortality have been reported. In immunocompetent patients, the prognosis is age-dependent, with patients older than 55 years having slightly higher mortality. Patients requiring surgery tend to have a poorer prognosis as well. Some studies correlate the male gender with higher mortality in patients with CMV colitis. Timely diagnosis and treatment of CMV colitis have been shown to greatly improve prognosis in immunocompromised patients. Patients with CMV colitis reactivation in association with ulcerative colitis tend to have a poor prognosis; however, this can be greatly improved with timely treatment as well.
