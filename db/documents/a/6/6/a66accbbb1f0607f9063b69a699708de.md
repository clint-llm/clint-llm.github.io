Despite the lack of evidence to delineate a specific etiology and pathogenesis of spine arthritis, several risk factors are critical in its development. Osteoarthritis traditionally was thought to be a disorder directly linked to "wear and tear." Degenerative changes over time were theorized to lead to osteophyte formation and cartilage loss.

Genetically, researchers have linked over 80 gene mutations involved in osteoarthritis. The 143383 nucleotide polymorphism is arguably the most critical, secondary to its role in developing, maintaining, and repairing synovial joints.

The role of epigenetics in osteoarthritis includes more rapid phenotypic variance for cellular microenvironmental changes. For example, the MMP-13 and IL-1 beta promoter play a significant role in the maintenance of cartilage. The MMP-13 enzyme is associated with cartilage matrix destruction in osteoarthritis. Demethylation of the MMP-13 promoter is associated with an increased expression of the MMP-13 protein, which, in turn, increases cartilage matrix degeneration.

The most crucial associated risk factor for osteoarthritis among many studies is age.

Gender and ethnicity also have a role in osteoarthritis. The degree of lumbar lordosis is different between genders. Excessive curvature increases the load on the lumbar facet joints and predisposes the lower spine to degenerative changes. Changes in lumbar lordosis have a significant effect on the development of spine osteoarthritis. This change in lordosis is more pronounced in women and older men.

The contribution of ethnicity to spine osteoarthritis is mostly variable. Joint mobility is more common in whites than African Americans. Yet, there is no association between hypermobility and the development of radiographic arthritis between races. Interestingly, there is a correlation between joint hypermobility and low back pain.

Diet and obesity are also directly related to the development of osteoarthritis. Risk factors for metabolic syndrome are independently associated with the development of osteoarthritis, including central obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and hyperlipidemia.
