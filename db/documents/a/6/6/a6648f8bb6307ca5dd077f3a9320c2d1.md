During development, nodes form relatively densely along the axon, then the internode length increase as the embryo grows and the axons stretch along their length.  In humans, peak myelination occurs in the first year of life, beginning in the peripheral nervous system, followed later by myelination in the brain and spinal cord. The largest diameter axons are also the first to be myelinated.

The assembly process of nodes of Ranvier requires 1) the expression of specific structural proteins within the axon and 2) interactions with glial signals.  First, the neuronal expression of ankyrin (ankG) structurally interacts with voltage sodium channels and other nodal proteins.  Secondly, sodium channels concentrate within axonal membrane adjacent to new myelin sections, termed heminodes.  The ion channels, restricted in movement by the paranodal SpJ, are clustered as two neighboring heminodes merge to form a node of Ranvier.  In the CNS, there is also a redundant, independent mechanism of node formation by glial signals.  Node formation in the CNS is also mediated through interactions with oligodendrocyte-secreted proteins such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans.
