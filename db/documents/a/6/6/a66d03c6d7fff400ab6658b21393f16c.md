Histological appearance of the liver is consistent with micro-vesicular fatty infiltration of hepatocytes in patients with AFLP. A foamy appearance of cytoplasm is observable, as the fat surrounds the nuclei intracellularly. Around the portal tracts, sparing of a rim of cells can be observed; the central and mid zonal parts of the liver demonstrate characteristic infiltration.
