Drug metabolism is a very important clinical concern for the interprofessional healthcare team. Clinicians, nurses, and especially pharmacists need to work together to prevent clinically significant drug interactions that could affect patients' health. In a hospital setting, nurses must be alert for signs of a toxic buildup of metabolites or active drugs, particularly in instances of renal or hepatic insufficiency, so that they can alert the clinician and pharmacist. In many cases, drugs such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, warfarin, fluoroquinolones, etc., are dosed and monitored by pharmacists, who monitor serum levels of the drugs and renal function. This points to the importance of an interprofessional approach to drug dosing and administration in light of the effects of drug metabolism on patients, whether through impaired metabolism, drug-drug interactions, enzymatic induction, or other factors. Using the interprofessional paradigm will result in better therapeutic results with fewer adverse events. [Level 5]
