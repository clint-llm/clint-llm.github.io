The incidence of right ventricular myocardial infarction coexisting with inferior wall left ventricular dysfunction ranges from 10 to 50%. This wide range is due to the difficulty in identifying the condition in living patients. Autopsy results show a higher rate. Cases of isolated right ventricular infarction or dysfunction are rare, except for iatrogenic causes during procedures involving the heart (i.e., interventional procedures or cardiac surgery). Another confounding variable is the fact that RV stunning can be temporary, make detection even less likely.
