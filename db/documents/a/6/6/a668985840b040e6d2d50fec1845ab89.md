Although spiradenoma is considered a benign adnexal neoplasm with low recurrence rate, malignant transformation can occur in long-standing lesions, particularly in patients older than the age of 50. The rate of metastasis for malignant spiradenocarcinoma is about 50%. Conservative surgical excision of spiradenomas is therefore recommended. In cases of multiple spiradenomas, adjunctive treatment with carbon dioxide laser may be employed after surgical debulking.

Malignant spiradenomas tend to be aggressive tumors with high rates of metastasis and mortality. Radiation and chemotherapy may be used after tumor resection for malignant spiradenomas.
