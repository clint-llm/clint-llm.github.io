MECP2Â mutations alone are not enough to make a diagnosis of RTT. RTT is still considered a clinical diagnosis and is divided into typical and atypical presentations. The diagnostic criteria for a typical presentation require the presence of regression in addition to the criteria mentioned above main criteria plus the exclusion criteria must be met (see Table 1). In typical RTT, there will be a regression of purposeful hand use and spoken language resulting in a hand-wringing movement and abnormal gait. A stage of stabilization will often follow regression, and sometimes there will even be an improvement. Not all individuals with typical RTT will have postnatal deceleration in head growth. The diagnostic criteria for atypical RTT require the presence of regression plus 2 out of the 4 main criteria in addition to 5 out of the 11 supportive criteria (see Table 2). The above-mentioned criteria for typical RTT and atypical RTT apply to both males and females.
