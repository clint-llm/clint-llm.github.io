Meromelia is defined as a partial absence of a free limb. Limb deficiencies have been known to be caused by chromosomal abnormalities, genetic disorders, environmental exposures in utero, or as a complication of chorionic villus sampling. This activity serves to explain the disease processes associated with meromelia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of meromelia.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of meromelia.
- Outline the management options available for meromelia.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of meromelia and improve outcomes.
