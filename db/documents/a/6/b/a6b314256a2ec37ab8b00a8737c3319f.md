Approximately two million acute ankle sprains are reported annually in the United States.

Age as a predictor of recurrent ankle sprain has been inconsistent. The mean age has been reported as 26.20 years, according to the Waterman et al. study in 2010, with peak incidence occurring between ten and nineteen years of age.

According to the Waterman et al. study, overall males had an incidence rate of 2.20, and females had an incidence rate of 2.10, ankle sprains per 1000 person annually. Males between the age of fifteen and twenty-four were more prone to this injury compared to females of the same age group. However, females between the age of thirty to ninety-nine incurred more ankle sprains than their male counterparts.

Regarding race, African Americans and Caucasians have substantially higher incidence when compared to Hispanics. Overall, African American males had a considerably higher incidence of ankle sprain when compared to Hispanic males.

Nearly half of all ankle sprains were reported during some form of athletic activity, with basketball, football, and soccer, being 41.1%, 9.3%, and 7.9%, respectively.

Also, military service members reportedly incurred more ankle sprains when compared to the civilian population.
