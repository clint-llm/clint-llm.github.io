The shoulder muscles originate from the axial skeleton and the scapula and insert onto the humerus. The muscles that originate from the anterior compartment of the brachium act to flex the forearm, while the muscles that originate from the posterior compartment of the brachium extend the forearm. The anterior muscles of the forearm act to flex the hand at the wrist joint, and the posterior muscles act to extend the hand at the wrist joint.

The hand is comprised of eleven separate compartments. These are the four dorsal interossei, three volar interossei, the thenar, the hypothenar, the adductor, and the mid-palm compartments, respectively.

*Memory trick PAD-DAB palmar interossei adduct and the dorsal interossei abduct the digits.

- Interossei - Latin = between the bones

- Thenar - Greek = the mound at the base of the thumb
