Pediatric craniopharyngioma could be considered one of the most complex neurosurgical pathologies in the pediatric population. The tumor's proximity to essential neural structures poses challenges to manage in both pediatric and adult populations. In pediatric populations, these structures are still maturing and are extremely sensitive, both to the craniopharyngioma and the treatment that might be employed against it making treatment decisions difficult. This activity reviews the most important aspects of this pathology in the pediatric population and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of craniopharyngioma.
- Describe the pathophysiology of a craniopharyngioma.
- Summarize the treatment options for craniopharyngioma.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by craniopharyngioma.
