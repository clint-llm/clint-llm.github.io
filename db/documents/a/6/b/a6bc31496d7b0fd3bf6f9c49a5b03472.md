The trigeminal nerve is derived from the first pharyngeal arch. The musculature of the first pharyngeal arch includes the muscles of mastication, anterior belly of digastric, mylohyoid, tensor tympani, and tensor veli palatini muscles. The development of the mandibular nerve is similar to that of the ophthalmic and maxillary branches. The development follows inÂ 3 stages. First, a pioneer neurite emerges, and a nerve forms as other, later neurites fasciculate with this. Upon reaching the inside surface of the cement gland, the neurites separate and penetrate holes in the basal lamina. Finally, the neurites grow between the cells they will innervate and form free nerve endings.
