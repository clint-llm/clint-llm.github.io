Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common primary lung cancer seen in the United States. It falls under the umbrella of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and has a strong association with previous smoking. While incidence and mortality have declined, it remains the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Adenocarcinoma of the lung usually evolves from the mucosal glands and represents about 40% of all lung cancers. It is the most common subtype to be diagnosed in people who have never smoked. Lung adenocarcinoma usually occurs in the lung periphery, and in many cases, may be found in scars or areas of chronic inflammation. This activity describes the pathophysiology of adenocarcinoma of the lung and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of adenocarcinoma of the lung.
- Review the workup of a patient with adenocarcinoma of the lung.
- Summarize the treatment options for adenocarcinoma of the lung.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by lung adenocarcinoma.
