The vast majority of gastric polyps are asymptomatic, with over 90% being found incidentally on endoscopy. The most common complaints associated with the finding of gastric polyps are dyspepsia, acid reflux, heartburn, abdominal pain, early satiety, gastric outlet obstruction, gastrointestinal bleed, anemia, fatigue, and iron deficiency. Only in rare circumstances would a physical exam be helpful in the finding of gastric polyps as most are less than 2cm in size.
