Sympathetic blocks are widely used to treat visceral, ischemic, neuropathic, and sympathetically mediated pain, as well as many other conditions. Most large sympathetic ganglia and plexi are anatomically separate from somatic nerves in prevertebral and paravertebral regions, and thus are readily accessible to percutaneous interventions. Current methods outlining the performance of sympathetic blocks are safe and effective, alleviate suffering, and aid in the recovery of a multitude of patients. This activity reviews the physiological basis and techniques of commonly used sympathetic nerve blocks pertinent to the management of patients with chronic pain.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the indications for sympathetic nerve blockade. 
- Identify the most common adverse events associated with sympathetic nerve blockade.
- Describe the types of sympathetic blocks performed to treat visceral, ischemic, neuropathic, and sympathetically mediated pain.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for sympathetic ganglion blocks and to enhance the efficacy of pain management.
