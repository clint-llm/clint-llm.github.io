X-ray is the initial modality for the evaluation of the trauma patient and may show signs indicative of tracheal injury, including subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, or a “fallen lung” sign.  The “fallen lung” sign is where the lung presents in a dependent position held on to the hilum by its vascular attachments.
