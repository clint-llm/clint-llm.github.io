On March 11, 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as a global pandemic after the first cases of an atypical acute respiratory illness initially reported in China in December 2019 spread to more than 100 countries. Since then, the ongoing pandemic has overwhelmed many healthcare systems worldwide, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality emerging as a major global health crisis since the influenza pandemic of 1918. This viral infection readily spreads from person to person via respiratory droplets, mucosal contact, and through contaminated surfaces. SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory system; however, it can affect other major organ systems such as the gastrointestinal tract (GI), liver, cardiovascular, central nervous system, and kidneys. Emerging data have shown that patients with COVID-19 infection presented with higher rates of isolated gastrointestinal symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms. Patients with any primary GI-related symptoms or concurrent symptoms were at increased risk of hospitalization
