While the clinical presentation of classic CS is quite distinctive, the vast majority of HCM patients do not present this way, making a high index of clinical suspicion central to the detection of HCM.  The possible signs and symptoms of HCM are numerous and individually are not pathognomonic. Many of these findings are non-specific, making HCM both over-diagnosed and underdiagnosed depending on the unique clinical scenarios involved. The history and physical examination findings though very important, are often not sufficient to diagnose HCM and generally have to be coupled with appropriate diagnostic laboratory findings. As the clinical presentation of HCM can be non-specific, a missed diagnosis can have catastrophic consequences. To increase diagnostic sensitivity, the suggestion is to consider screening both with careful problem-focused clinical questioning and examination for distinctive examination findings in certain groups of patients determined to be at higher than the typical risk for possible HCM. Among these are young adults with osteoporosis, early-onset hypertension and/or hyperglycemia/diabetes, facial plethora, proximal myopathy, presence of distinctive pigmented palpable wide (greater than 1 cm) striae, easy cutaneous bruising especially in young patients, and patients with adrenal incidentalomas.

Since exogenous CS is the most common cause of H, the history must include careful questioning regarding exogenous glucocorticoid exposure, which may be from prescriptions including topical and inhalational glucocorticoids (iatrogenic CS)as well as the possibilities of recreational and factitious abuse.

The most common clinical symptom is progressive weight gain, which is typically but not invariably centrally dominant. The weight gain in patients with HCM can, however also be generalized and akin to nonsyndromic obesity.

Among the typical physical examination, findings are facial rounding ("moon facies"), facial flushing including marked malar telangiectasia, enlarged dorsocervical pad (buffalo hump), and supraclavicular fat pads. The supraclavicular fat pads are more specific for HCM than the dorsocervical fat pads. The finding of blood pressure elevation on examination is common. Cutaneous atrophy is a typical clinical finding, and in women, scalp hair loss can occur.

Diffuse cutaneous hyperpigmentation in the setting of HCM should suggest the possibility of EcCS.

It is also not uncommon for patients with HCM to present with clinical features of the comorbidities and complications associated with HCM. HCM is a poly systemic clinical state and thus can impact virtually every organ system of the body. Clinical presentations could, therefore, be consequent upon reproductive, dermatologic, orthopedic, metabolic, cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, infectious, and bariatric comorbidities.

Further modulating the clinical presentation of the individual with HCM are the duration and degree of severity of the HCM. HCM is associated, therefore, with considerable morbidity and mortality risk, which is why its early recognition and appropriate management is so important. HCM is associated with high to very high excess cardiovascular risk consequent upon its association with hypertension, which can be severe and resistant at presentation, dysglycemia, or frank diabetes mellitus, which is a well established cardiovascular risk equivalent and increased coagulopathic risk including increased risk for thromboembolic events.

Furthermore, HCM can also be associated with increased risk for heart failure and/or the development of a dilated cardiomyopathy.
